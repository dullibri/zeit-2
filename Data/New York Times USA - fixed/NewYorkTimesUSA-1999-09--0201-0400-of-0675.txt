HEADLINE: Typical Drug User Is Profiled by U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Trying to paint a more realistic picture of drug users, the Government said today that out of every 10 people who used illegal drugs in 1997, 7 had full-time jobs.
Officials said they hoped the data would dispel the notion that most drug users are burned out and disconnected from the mainstream. 
 "The typical drug user is not poor and unemployed," said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "He or she can be a co-worker, a husband or wife, a parent."
About 6.3 million full-time workers, ages 18 to 49 -- 7.7 percent of people in that age range -- admitted in 1997 that they had used illegal drugs in the preceding month, according to the report, which is issued every few years by the Department of Health and Human Services. The proportion has been steady since 1992.

HEADLINE: Lott Says Veto Is Likely to Kill Tax Cut in '99

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said today that President Clinton's promised veto of the Republicans' $792 billion tax-cut bill probably doomed any tax-relief legislation this year and would set up a major campaign issue for the 2000 election.
In the opening salvo of the biggest political battle in Washington this fall, Mr. Lott all but ruled out any compromise with the White House, saying there was not enough time to negotiate a new plan for taxes and spending for the next decade. 
 "I don't see how we do it," Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, told reporters on the Senate's first day back to work after its August recess.
Mr. Lott's gloomy outlook may just be a bargaining ploy to pressure the White House to budge from its top offer of a $300 billion tax cut. But Senate aides said Mr. Lott had calculated that Republicans stood to gain more politically by doing nothing this year and wielding tax cuts as a major campaign issue next year, than by bowing to the President now.
"These issues will come up in November 2000, and they'll be settled then," said Mr. Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki.
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, backs Mr. Lott's hard-line approach, but other Republican leaders like Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, are willing to discuss a smaller tax package, especially if it involves repealing the estate tax or the so-called marriage tax.
"We're always pushing for tax relief," said John P. Feehery, Mr. Hastert's spokesman. "We don't want to give up."
Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Armey, said that tax cuts were still the "No. 1 issue" for House Republicans, who will meet on Thursday with their leaders to discuss what approach to take if Mr. Clinton fulfills his veto threat.
"It's always the case that lower taxes are better than higher taxes," Ms. Davis said.
The White House has floated the idea of a grand bargain to divide the projected $3 trillion surplus among tax relief, Federal programs and debt reduction. Mr. Clinton said in his national radio address on Saturday that he would support a smaller tax-cut bill in exchange for Republican concessions on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, including a voluntary prescription drug program for senior citizens, and other spending.
Congress will send the President the tax-cut bill next Tuesday or Wednesday, but Mr. Lott said he had not seen any signs that the White House was willing to compromise.
"I haven't seen any indication that the President wants to work with us," Mr. Lott said. "What the President wants is more spending, more spending, more spending for everything. He is not for tax relief for working Americans."
Ms. Davis, Mr. Armey's spokeswoman, flatly rejected any deal that included additional spending.
Republicans and Democrats both feel that the political peril of doing nothing on tax cuts is less than they perceived earlier in the year. Lawmakers say they believe that the public has largely absorbed the idea that doing nothing means plowing back much of any surplus into reducing the national debt, which is popular among conservatives. Reducing the national debt keeps interest rates low and provides flexibility on other fiscal programs. So for political and substantive economic reasons, the default position of reducing the debt is attractive.
"Clinton is in a take-it-or-leave-it position and, for the most part, so are we," said a senior Senate Republican aide. "That wouldn't be so bad. We'd still get debt reduction, plus it would clear away the clutter and focus attention on the appropriations process."
Both sides are positioning themselves to blame the other if lawmakers are forced to dip into the Social Security surplus to keep the Government running next year, as current spending plans would require them to do. Politically, it is also true that both sides are convinced that the issue of taxes and spending plays in their favor, and sets up a classic ideological fight.
Republicans can assert that Mr. Clinton denied Americans a tax cut, even after protecting Medicare and most Social Security money, and instead is seeking to increase Federal spending. Some Republicans say Mr. Clinton would be pressured to approve a tax-cut bill in an election year, just as he was when making changes in welfare. Other analysts suggest that would be highly unlikely. "Maybe next year we'll pass another good, pro-growth tax-reduction package," Mr. Lott said.
Democrats could argue the importance of keeping a Democrat in the White House to stop Republicans from giving away the Federal surplus in tax cuts to the rich, without addressing problems in Medicare, Social Security and other domestic programs that help working people.
"Large tax cuts could deny the nation the full benefit of debt reduction," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a speech in New York today, "and depending on economic circumstances, they could force deep and dangerous cuts in core government or Social Security or Medicare."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN DISMISSES GRAFT ALLEGATION

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told President Clinton in a telephone conversation today that accusations linking Mr. Yeltsin and his family to a corruption inquiry were politically inspired, the White House said this evening.
Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser, said that Mr. Clinton specifically asked about reports that the Swiss authorities had evidence implicating Mr. Yeltsin and his family in taking bribes. The Swiss authorities were reported to have documents showing that Mr. Yeltsin's credit card bills and those of his two daughters had been paid by a construction company that did a great deal of renovation work on the Kremlin. 
 "And Yeltsin denied those reports," Mr. Berger said.
But another White House official, who commented on the condition that he not be named, said this evening that the Russian President's repudiation of the accusations was less categorical.
Mr. Yeltsin did not state his total innocence in so many words, the official said; rather, he insisted that the accusations were not substantive.
An informant, Felipe Turover, said on Wednesday that he had seen credit card bills and photocopies of credit cards bearing the signatures of Mr. Yeltsin and his daughters, and that the cards had been provided by Mabetex Project Engineering, a Swiss construction company that has done $1.5 billion worth of work for the Kremlin. Page A18.
The Swiss and Russian corruption inquiry, which is focusing on allegations of international money laundering and bribes to Russian politicians in exchange for lucrative construction contracts at the Kremlin itself, came up during part of a 40-minute telephone call, White House spokesmen said.
Mr. Yeltsin called Mr. Clinton to discuss a variety of topics, including disarmament negotiations and the Asian economic summit meeting in New Zealand this weekend, according to Mr. Berger.
As Mr. Berger recounted at a news briefing, Mr. Clinton broached the subject of money laundering and corruption by commenting that it would be good if Mr. Yeltsin could sign money laundering legislation recently passed by the lower house of Russia's Parliament.
Mr. Yeltsin said he was prepared to sign a money laundering bill if the Parliament passes one that is consistent with the Russian Constitution, Mr. Berger said. Mr. Yeltsin said he had doubts about a law passed this summer, and vetoed it for that reason.
Mr. Berger, responding to a question, said Mr. Clinton then got to the point, asking Mr. Yeltsin about the credit card bill reports.
Previously, Mr. Yeltsin's press aides have categorically denied that Mr. Yeltsin has anything to hide. And even people who detest Mr. Yeltsin personally and politically agree that he has plenty of enemies happy to say damning things about him.
The White House official said about 40 percent of the total conversation was devoted to government-corruption issues. The two national leaders -- neither of whom speaks the other's language -- spoke through interpreters. The official said Mr. Yeltsin called Mr. Clinton late this morning, which was early evening in Moscow.
A team of Russian law-enforcement officials is coming to the United States early next week to take part in the continuing multinational investigation, whose scope now includes allegations that money from Russia was laundered through the Bank of New York. The Russian contingent will include a high official of Russia's equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, tax investigators and the Kremlin version of a national Attorney General.
The White House official who commented this evening said President Clinton did not indicate whether he felt totally reassured by Mr. Yeltsin's assertions. The American President did not disagree when his Russian counterpart said that the odor of scandal could damage relations between the two countries, the official said.
The United States has already asked Russia for assurances that no international financial assistance has been lost to corruption, although Washington stopped short of asking that International Monetary Fund loan payments to Russia be frozen. The Administration is under pressure by Republicans in Congress who have used the reports of corruption to raise questions about United States aid to Russia and to renew attacks on the I.M.F.
Last week, Swiss authorities investigating suspected money laundering by powerful Russians ordered Swiss banks to provide information on two dozen Russians thought to have accounts in Geneva. The Swiss have frozen at least 59 bank accounts in the past two months in the search for evidence.
Russians known to be under scrutiny include the head of Mr. Yeltsin's property-management team; his wife, daughter and son-in-law; and a former deputy prime minister involved in the military industry and arms exports.
And though no definite link has yet been established between the Swiss investigation and the one in the United States, American authorities are looking into possible laundering of Russian money through the Bank of New York. The bank has said it is cooperating.
As for other subjects touched upon in the conversation, Mr. Berger said they included missiles and missile defenses. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is in Moscow now for exchanges on those subjects, and a Russian delegation is coming to Washington in mid-September.
Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton also discussed the Russian Army's battle with separatists in Dagestan, Mr. Berger said. "And President Yeltsin said that he expected and hoped that they would be able to gain control of the situation but it was a very difficult one," Mr. Berger said.

HEADLINE: Do Voucher Plans Steal From Poor Schools?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I have some concerns about George W. Bush's ideas for "fixing" education (letter, Sept. 7). First, research has shown a high correlation between family income and test score outcome. This implies that we already know which schools Mr. Bush would close: the ones that serve those same economically disadvantaged students he says he wants to help. 
 Before we hear any more "solutions" to problems in education, the financing of public schools needs to be equalized within each state. Schools should no longer be financed with property taxes, a formula that limits equal opportunity in education.

HEADLINE: With Other Goals in Indonesia, U.S. Moves Gently on East Timor

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The United States is resisting direct threats of economic or military sanctions against Indonesia in hopes of preserving its relationship with the vast archipelago nation, even as the Administration protests the chaos in East Timor that has left hundreds of people dead, senior officials said.
The Administration, these officials say, has made the calculation that the United States must put its relationship with Indonesia, a mineral-rich nation of more than 200 million people, ahead of its concern over the political fate of East Timor, a tiny, impoverished territory of 800,000 people that is seeking independence. 
 The Defense Department is taking the lead in dealing with the crisis. Hoping to make use of longstanding ties between the Pentagon and the Indonesian military -- a relationship that dates to the early days of the Cold War, when Indonesia was seen as a bulwark against Communism -- the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, has talked by telephone with Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, several times this week to discuss East Timor.
Officials say the two military leaders have discussed details of General Wiranto's plan to remove troops from East Timor who have allied themselves with anti-independence militias and replace them with soldiers clearly loyal to the central Government in Jakarta.
"It is not unreasonable to give him at least 24 hours to get folks there, and then you've got to give him a little time to bring them under control," a senior Administration official said. "Wiranto knows that everybody expects to see real traction on this very fast -- and very fast doesn't mean weeks."
While senior Administration officials did not rule out the use of sanctions, they acknowledged that the United States had no firm plans to punish the Jakarta Government if the violence continued. The Administration, they said, is willing to support an Australian-led United Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor, but only if it is invited by the Indonesian Government.
"Because we bombed in Kosovo doesn't mean we should bomb Dili," said Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, referring to the East Timor capital.
"Indonesia is the fourth-largest country in the world," he said. "It is undergoing a fragile but tremendously important political and economic transformation, which the United States strongly supports. The resolution of this crisis matters not just for East Timor but for Indonesia as a whole."
He suggested that American threats of a cutoff of economic or military aid to Indonesia were not necessary.
"It's not a question of making threats," he said. "It's a question of stating what is simply a practical fact of life, which is that it would be very hard for the international community to continue to be of economic assistance if there is a chaotic situation in Timor."
 In Jakarta, the Indonesian Government rejected pressure to allow foreign peacekeepers to enter East Timor. Page A8.
The United States has little direct leverage on the Indonesian military. Because of human rights abuses attributed to the military, Congress has sharply limited military aid and training to Indonesia, and the total military aid package this year totaled only $476,000.
"It's not as if we have a military assistance program that could be cut off," said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
The United States has a more potent means of punishing Indonesia through what amounts to its veto power in the International Monetary Fund, which has committed tens of billions of dollars in emergency financial support to Indonesia as a result of the Asian economic crisis.
But Washington has been reluctant to threaten a cutoff of the aid for fear that the result would be a new economic collapse in Indonesia, further undermining its transition to democracy after three decades of authoritarian rule under President Suharto, who was forced from office last year. It could also harm American corporations that have large investments in Indonesia.
The Clinton Administration has focused its attention on persuading General Wiranto to step in personally to insure that his troops stop the violence.
The Indonesian military leader is respected by Pentagon officials for his military professionalism and is seen as the key figure in the crisis, overshadowing President B. J. Habibie, who appears to have little control over the situation and is distrusted by many in the military.
American officials say they are convinced that General Wiranto is not directing the violence in East Timor, but they say he has made few efforts to reign in junior military commanders who may be encouraging the violence as a means of blocking independence for the territory.
The United States is trying to convince General Wiranto that with order restored, a United Nations peacekeeping force could be deployed to East Timor and relieve him of the responsibility of controlling the militias until there is a final decision on East Timor's political future.
In a referendum last week that ignited the violence, an overwhelming majority of Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia, which invaded and annexed the former Portuguese colony in 1975.
A senior Pentagon official said today that the commander of American military forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis Blair, arrived in Jakarta today to carry the message to General Wiranto "that he has the responsibility to bring this under control and he had better belly up to that responsibility."
Administration officials are also concerned that the crisis in East Timor could disrupt the difficult relationship between the Indonesian military and its civilian leaders, and could bring down President Habibie, who has been praised by the United States for pushing ahead with democratic reforms.
Administration officials said that if the United Nations sponsored an armed peacekeeping mission in East Timor, it would almost certainly receive military support from the United States, although not ground troops.
"The United States is not planning an insertion of any peacekeeping troops," said Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. He called on the Indonesian Government to act "swiftly and effectively" to stop the militias. "The Government of Indonesia is responsible for bringing order and peace to East Timor," he said.
At a White House news conference, Mr. Berger said that any peacekeeping force would be "overwhelmingly Asian in character."
"We have to recognize that Indonesia is in Asia, and that the Indonesians will respond much better to a solution here that is dominated by the Asians and not dominated by the United States," he said.
The Government of Australia has volunteered to lead an international force and provide 2,000 troops, but has said that it will not go in alone.
American officials say they have been in close contact with the Australian Government and that if the United States participated in the mission, it would probably provide communications, logistics and intelligence support.
"We will look at what is the appropriate level of assistance we can give, whether it be logistical or technical support or other," said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman. "But I can tell you that there's been no decision made on that."

HEADLINE: Students Face New Standards In City Schools

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
More than a million New York City schoolchildren -- many of them in uniform for the first time -- hoist their book bags and return to school today to face the toughest promotional standards in decades, a demoralized force of principals and uncertainty about the future of the school system's leader, Chancellor Rudy Crew.
This year, for the first time, all high school seniors -- in New York City, the suburbs and across the state -- must pass a Regents English examination to graduate. The new test is a particularly daunting challenge in the city, where fewer than half of the students graduate on time as it is. Younger children and their parents face the anxiety of new promotional standards in every grade from third grade up, which could force as many as 360,000 of the students to attend summer school next year. 
 It is a pivotal year as well for Dr. Crew, who, worried about his legacy after five years in New York, is under pressure to show progress in the system after a year of slumping test scores.
Dr. Crew's contract expires in June and it is not clear that the city's Board of Education will renew it or that he will stay until the last day.
"Assuming that he's going to stay at least through the year, and that he wants his legacy to be a positive one," said Robert Berne, vice president for academic development at New York University, "the stakes are high across the board -- for him, for principals, for teachers and certainly for the results that kids achieve."
On the bright side, enrollment has grown far more slowly than projected for the second year in a row -- with only 1,000 new students added to the system -- relieving somewhat the overcrowding that had forced schools to teach children in hallways, closets and even bathrooms. And the city schools have received $109 million in state and Federal aid to begin addressing a perennial concern of parents: large classes in kindergarten through third grade.
In many of New York City's suburbs, children returned to school yesterday, greeting friends whom they had not seen all summer, sizing up their new teachers and dragging their parents to buy last-minute school supplies.
For many children and educators, it is the push to higher standards, in which New York mirrors a trend across the country, that will cause the most stress, pressure and heartache.
"Parents bring back the worry, with all of the new testing: will our children be prepared?" said Jan Atwell, associate director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a nonprofit group that monitors city schools, and the mother of a high school senior. "All of their work all year long can boil down to a single day's performance. I think there's a lot of stress involved for kids."
Already this summer, in a small-scale introduction of the city school system's efforts to end social promotion, 21,000 third, sixth and eighth graders have been held back, 7,000 because they failed an end-of-summer test, but 14,000 because they may not have realized what was at stake and failed to show up for summer school.
The introduction of new state tests in the fourth and eighth grades last year also proved ominous as 52 percent of all fourth graders in New York State -- and 67 percent of those in New York City -- failed to meet state standards in reading and writing. The results for mathematics and for the eighth grade have not yet been released.
Dr. Crew said at a briefing last week that he expected both math and reading scores to rise this year, as they usually do in the second year of a new test.
But many educators fear that new high school graduation standards, imposed by the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, and the State Board of Regents, will cause graduation rates to plummet. This year's seniors will not be allowed to graduate without passing a Regents test in English with a score of at least 55. Tests in four more subjects will be phased in in subsequent years, and the passing grade will be raised to 65.
Similar requirements in other states have led to lawsuits as parents have contended that their children were not given the education that they needed to graduate.
Until now, children have been allowed to graduate by taking an easier competency test, which is being eliminated. In 1998, 37 percent of city seniors and 27 percent of seniors in the rest of the state did not pass the Regents test in English. The new test was introduced in June, but pass rates have not yet been released.
"It counts, and it counts big time," Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said of the new exam.
Dr. Crew will have to steer the system through the new standards while grappling with principals who are increasingly demoralized after working without a raise since October 1995 and without a contract since February 1996. Dr. Crew and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani have offered the principals' union a raise of 33 percent if principals agree to give up tenure and work a longer year. Those talks have stalemated.
As the school year begins, 195 schools of the system's 1,200 schools, or about 16 percent, lack permanently appointed principals and are being led by interim acting principals, Lewis H. Spence, Deputy Chancellor for Operations, said yesterday. The union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, said the 195 was the highest figure in the last five years.
"We are frustrated and concerned," Mr. Spence said, conceding that the absence of permanent leadership can be a destabilizing force. Many principals, he said, echoing union complaints, have been recruited by New York City's wealthier and higher-paying suburbs.
But he said that Dr. Crew would stand by his decision not to grant substantial raises unless principals moved toward a management system where tenure was based on performance.
In the longer term, Ms. Weingarten of the teachers' union said, the system may also face a drain of teachers. By 2001, she said, 21,000 teachers will be eligible to retire, compared with a normal retirement rate of 2,100 a year.
As for the decline in enrollment growth, Mr. Spence said officials were puzzled by the numbers, which were far below the 15,000 to 20,000 new students arriving in the system just a few years ago. He said changing patterns of immigration -- more families moving out of the city in a booming economy, with fewer families with children moving in -- could be the cause, but the board is working with city planning and immigration officials to determine that for sure.
But as in previous years, Queens schools are overcrowded. This year, the borough's schools are 26,000 over capacity, and the lack of space has forced 8,000 high school students to take six classes instead of the state-mandated seven, said Terri Thompson, a Board of Education member from Queens.
Karen Crowe, a board spokeswoman, said the city plans to build 65,000 seats in the next five years to deal with the problem.
The system has made progress in hiring certified teachers, with the number of uncertified teachers citywide down to an all-time low of 13 percent, Mr. Spence said.
Whether Dr. Crew remains to see the results of the new policies depends in part, he has said, on the political climate. The Board of Education is conducting an evaluation that will help determine whether to renew his contract, a decision that must be made in January. Around that time, a state Moreland Act commission is expected to release the results of its investigation into allegations of mismanagement and corruption in the school construction and leasing program. The commission is also looking at allegations that school officials inflated attendance as a way of collecting more state aid.
By then, the race for for the United States Senate will be heating up, and Mayor Giuliani, a likely candidate, could resurrect issues, like school vouchers, that he and Dr. Crew have feuded over. Dr. Crew has said that he intends to stay until June or beyond -- although he is being wooed by the University of Washington -- but that the political landscape could determine whether he stays or goes.
"The curveball about his tenure in New York is unfortunate, because it will divert attention" and could undermine Dr. Crew's ability to lead the school system, Mr. Berne said.

HEADLINE: Betting the Farm On the Virtual Store

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

 BODY:
FOR eight years, Fred Parks says, he sold all manner of antiques and collectibles, "everything but tube socks and T-shirts," from a series of stores in downtown Baltimore. About a year ago, he closed his latest store, but he didn't go out of business. He took his expertise in ceramics -- Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Arts and Crafts styles -- to Ebay, the largest of the on-line auction sites.
Now working from home and a studio that he rents for $100 a month, he has lowered his expenses, he says, and increased his prices and profits. "If I opened a store, I might have 35 people on a good day," he said. "I get thousands in my virtual store." 
 More and more people are making a living from on-line auctions, often closing their brick-and-mortar stores or quitting jobs to vend bric-a-brac electronically at auctions like the ones at Ebay (www.ebay .com), Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) and Yahoo (www.yahoo.com). According to a report issued in March by Forrester Research, a consulting company that tracks E-commerce, spending on auction sites will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to an estimated $2.3 billion this year. While none of the auction sites knows how many people have turned electronic auctions into full-time jobs, Ebay estimates that it has about 10,000 "power sellers," who sell merchandise for $2,000 to $25,000 or more each month.
Mr. Parks said he had no regrets about going virtual. "I at this point have no interest in ever having a store again," he said. "Why would I?"
Why? Well, there are the long hours at the computer, and the tedium of wrapping and sending countless packages. Sometimes the auction sites crash, suspending business for days and putting a crimp in the cash flow. And there are the prickly customers who think nothing of firing off rude E-mail tirades. But for Mr. Parks and others, the increased profits and ability to open for business at any hour are ample compensation for the drawbacks of Web auctions.
The Forrester Research study projects that by 2003, auction sites will account for $6.4 billion in spending.
As more store owners get a taste of selling on line, more stores will close, analysts predict. Michael May, a digital commerce analyst for Jupiter Communications, a research firm in Boston, explained: "They are Main Street, mom-and-pop-type stores that realize they are selling a far greater percentage of their inventory through sites like Ebay, and they can't justify paying rent anymore."
For instance, take Mike Baker, who had averaged $30,000 to $40,000 in revenue a year selling baseball cards and photographs from his store in Springdale, Ark. Now he makes bulk purchases of movie star photos and art prints to sell in on-line auctions, and he reports that his gross revenue is in six figures.
Mr. Baker said he had been initially startled by the effectiveness of auction sales two years ago when he posted some Marilyn Monroe photos that were readily available from other sources. "If I got $6 back, I broke even; if I sold them for $12, I did good," he said. They sold for $36.10 each. (Mr. Baker has since self-published a book, "Strike it Rich on Ebay.")
Or take Chris Gwynn, who quit his job as a marketing analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston to sell refrigerator magnets on line. He has now branched out to auctioning new action figures and has created his own site (actionfigureauctions.com) to sell them.
Mr. Gwynn makes less money than he did as an analyst. "But within a year," he said, "I should be doing a lot better than I was."
Auction sites have made it fairly simple for people to hang out a shingle because they require sellers to do little more than enter information in a series of text boxes. That has made it possible for even the computer-phobic to become involved in E-commerce.
"I was scared of it and I thought I was too old to learn," said Claudia Bennett, an antiques dealer in Vernon, Tex. Ms. Bennett, who is 52, is now designing her own Web page, and she says she does not regret closing her 14,000-square-foot store or quitting her job at the post office to underwrite her antiques operation. "Now for the first time, I am making money at it," she said.
While anyone can sell on line, not just anyone can make a living at it. "It's not as easy as saying, 'I am an E-merchant,' " said Mr. Parks, who bought a $1,200 digital camera, lights and a booth to make his ceramics and other wares look appealing on line. "A bad photograph will not make you money."
Even though successful, full-time auction entrepreneurs set their own hours, they say the job is extremely demanding. One such Web merchant, Lisa Harrington, said she had owned a tropical fish store in Houston that went bankrupt. But six years after the bankruptcy, she was drawn into Ebay when she helped a friend who was struggling with an on-line business. She struck out on her own in June 1998, and in the year that followed, she said, she took in $250,000, selling everything from electronics to motorized self-scooping cat litter boxes.
To generate that kind of income, Mrs. Harrington signs on at 8:30 A.M. on workdays and does not sign off until 2 A.M., taking only an hour on some days to watch a soap opera. She takes only Fridays and Mondays off. "They are dead," she said.
On a typical workday, she handles about 600 E-mail messages, monitors 20 auctions and packages about 20 items for shipping. She also has to scare up fresh stock over the phone and on line.
Although customers pay for shipping fees -- and Mrs. Harrington confides that she sometimes makes a small profit on the shipping charges -- there are other costs that new sellers tend to overlook, like the fees charged by auction sites, usually a percentage of the selling price. Mrs. Harrington said that she paid an average of $2,000 a month to Ebay alone. She also uses sites like Utrade, Ubid, Haggle and 321Gone. Mr. Baker also puts in long hours selling his celebrity photos and art prints. "I start at 6 every morning," he said. "I work until 6. Then I take a break. Then I go back up around 10."
Alan Hunter, who auctions sports and political memorabilia on line, said he put in eight hours a day photographing items, writing descriptions, uploading information onto the day's auction sites, answering E-mail and packing up items to be mailed out. "But that doesn't include the time you spend hunting this stuff up," he said. "The toughest part is that you have a commitment to it every single day."
Those who are not willing to put in long hours may get involved in too few auctions to really make money. Even worse, they may be slow to respond to customers, which can result in the posting of complaints referred to as dreaded "negative feedback."
When a transaction is completed, the seller and buyer can write a short message commenting on it. Such feedback is available for all to see, and it works as a self-policing mechanism, warning people away from buyers or sellers who other people think are dishonest.
The problem for someone selling goods at a lot of auctions is that it is easy to accrue negative comments. The more customers a seller has, the greater the chances that some of them will be slow to pay or hard to satisfy. If a seller posts a complaint about a buyer, the buyer may retaliate. "And before you know it," Mr. Hunter said, "you have 20 negative feedbacks." The alternative is for a seller to grin and bear it when dealing with a testy buyer -- a frequent occurrence.
Sellers often try to increase profits a few percentage points by avoiding auction site fees. For instance, there is no rule against a seller getting in touch with auction losers to make separate deals if the seller has multiple copies of an item.
Arlen Miller, who quit his job at Planet Hollywood in Orlando two years ago to deal full time on line in Disney collectibles, said: "I'll look at Ebay stuff, and if I have the same item on my list, I'll go back when the auction is over. You can go in and look at all of the bidders. If it went for $50, and I have it for $30, I'll send a note."
But Mr. Miller draws an ethical line. "I would never step on someone's toes by doing that before their auction is over."
The auction game is outgrowing the boundaries of Ebay, Amazon and Yahoo. The Forrester study predicted that the future of on-line auctions would be in sales of new retail products sold by companies, often on their own sites, rather than by individuals.
"Over time, consumers will prefer buying from businesses rather than individuals since businesses are more accountable and offer first-run merchandise," the report said. A check using Yahoo's search engine turned up a list of close to 200 auction sites, including head-to-head Ebay competitors as well as specialty sites like Justbeads.com, which auctions beads, and Floorspace.com, which auctions industrial machinery.
Off-the-shelf auction software makes it possible for individuals and small businesses to set up their own auction sites. "Auction software costs about $5,000," said Mr. Gwynn, the refrigerator magnet magnate who sells his action figures on his own site. "The server is a few hundred dollars a month."
Mr. Gwynn does not allow other people to sell on his site. If he had set up the site that way, he said, he would have been competing against Ebay; that, he added, would be a losing proposition.
In an early test of his sales plan, Mr. Gwynn said, he auctioned 96 Austin Powers figures, which sell at retail for about $11, in a week. He sold many of them in the $20 range, and some for as much as $38. "They were popular that week, and they were hard to get," he said.
Not all the figures have flown off the shelves. Mr. Gwynn has found it difficult to sell everything from Barbie to "Star Wars" figures on a single site. So he will soon specialize even more. He plans to set up auction sites that are organized to reflect the way collectors collect: by manufacturer. That will make it easier to reach collectors looking for specific toys through on-line bulletin boards and newsletters, he said.
While the on-line auction entrepreneurs do a lot of selling, they do little buying on line. "I never have really been able to buy on Ebay to re-sell and make a profit on it," said Mr. Baker, the print seller.
In fact, some sellers worry about what Ebay and other sites will mean for their sources for items, like garage sales, if everyone is selling everything, including the kitchen sink, on line.
So far those fears have proved to be unfounded. The number of yard sales each weekend proves that people still need to clean out their attics -- and that most of them still do it the off-line way, especially if they don't own a digital camera.
 
Sales Strategies
TOP sellers agree that the most important ingredient for success in on-line auctions is choosing the right words to describe the item up for bid.
The trick is to include as many potential search words as possible in the limited space allowed for the title line of a listing. That way, when a prospective bidder searches for a particular item, there is a greater chance for a hit.
"You take a Marlboro lighter," said Mike Baker, who sells movie star photos and art prints in on-line auctions. "If you write 'butane lighter, Marlboro Zippo style,' you've got four key words. A lot of people would put 'Great, beautiful, hard-to-find Marlboro lighter.' That way you have only two words."
Spelling counts, too. Buyers who search for a product using the correctly spelled word will never find a listing with a misspelling. The result is fewer bids.
In fact, clever buyers intentionally search using misspelled words to find the best deals. For instance, a search on Ebay for "beanie babies" produced 10,066 listings. But a search using the misspelling "beenie" returned only 10 listings, some ripe for the picking without any bids. ROY FURCHGOTT

HEADLINE: Foiled Once, China's Entry In Trade Body Is on Agenda

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Thursday, Sept. 9

 BODY:
After a period of high tension between the United States and China, the two sides met here today to set the stage for the resumption of talks on China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
Five months ago, the Clinton Administration rebuffed an offer that the Chinese thought would be accepted, and Washington has been trying to get the talks to resume almost ever since, but tensions only grew worse with NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the renewed tensions between China and Taiwan. 
 In the first concerted activity to get the talks going again, the United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, arrived here from Washington along with the two chief American trade negotiators who came directly from Beijing.
The Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, met with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Jiaxuan Tang, for 90 minutes this morning in an encounter that was described by an Administration official as "free of any acrimony."
Ms. Barshefsky emphasized this morning that meetings between the Americans and the Chinese over the last day and a half in Beijing were an "ice-breaking session" and "very general" in nature.
Substantive talks about China's membership in the body that governs world trade -- a membership that the Clinton Administration very much wants but on what it calls commercially viable terms -- had not resumed, she said.
President Clinton and the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, are scheduled to meet here on Saturday, their first face-to-face meeting since Mr. Clinton was in China in 1998. Since then the relationship between Washington and Beijing has plummeted to its lowest depths in years.
Administration officials hope that the presidential discussions on Saturday will help right the course of the relationship and result in the resumption of serious and speedy negotiations that would allow China to enter the trade body.
A new round of global trade talks is being held in Seattle in November. If China fails to enter the World Trade Organization before those talks, the Chinese would most likely face more stringent entry requirements.
The meeting between the two leaders has become the most significant event of the annual economic summit meeting of leaders of the Asian region. They may be able to announce a resumption of negotiations.
But Ms. Barshefsky said that despite the visit of her team to Beijing this week it was still not clear what the Chinese intentions were.
"Do they want to re-engage for the look of it or because they want to substantively re-engage to conclude an agreement?" she said.
To pursue the resumption of talks further, Ms. Barshefsky was to meet here tonight with her Chinese counterpart, the Foreign Trade Minister, Shi Guangsheng.
The White House, buffeted by criticism from the business community and from some quarters in Congress for its failure to seal an agreement with China when it seemed possible in April, has been pushing to resume the negotiations with the Chinese almost since President Clinton turned down the Chinese offer on April 8.
But the Administration has been blocked by a series of unrelated setbacks -- chiefly the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the Taiwan-China dispute.
One of the most difficult tasks for the negotiators now, officials said, would be how to overcome the appearance that each nation had caved to the demands of the other.
In choosing not to forge a deal when Prime Minister Zhu Rongji was in Washington in April, President Clinton decided he wanted several more concessions from the Chinese, officials said.
The agreement that failed to close -- but was posted on the Internet by the Clinton Administration the day after the White House decision -- would have given broad market access to China for many American goods and services.
But Mr. Clinton wanted stronger safeguards for the American textile apparel industry against Chinese imports and sought other concessions in the area of insurance.

HEADLINE: Sharp Divergence Found in Views of Military and Civilians

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
A deep gap over politics and values has opened over the last two decades between the nation's increasingly conservative military elite and prominent civilians without military service, sowing latent distrust despite the respect each group professes for the other.
These are the first findings of a major study of military and civilian attitudes, focusing on a problem that Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has called a major challenge for him: "to somehow prevent a chasm from developing between the military and civilian worlds." 
 While there were few disagreements about foreign policy between the two groups, the single most striking finding was political.
Ordinary Americans divide about evenly between calling themselves Democrats or Republicans, but the study found that 64 percent of elite military officers called themselves Republicans. Only 8 percent said they were Democrats.
A more modest gap, on political identification had been measured before. Comparable 1976 data found that 33 percent of military officers identified themselves as Republicans and 12 percent as Democrats. The 1976 survey did not cover values. The remainder, in both surveys, said they were independent or had no political affiliation.
The most startling differences were found between the military leaders and the potential military leaders, like students at advanced schools like the war colleges, and prominent civilians who had never served in the armed forces.
The civilians were selected at random from Who's Who and from other lists, like prominent women, the clergy, foreign policy experts, labor leaders and the press. Prominent civilians with military service fell in between.
For example, 45 percent of the military group favored barring homosexuals from teaching in public schools, while only 17 percent of the nonveteran civilian group did. Ten percent of the military leaders supported a ban on the death penalty while 37 percent of the civilians did. And 74 percent of the military group backed permitting prayer in public schools, compared with 46 percent of the civilian group.
Some of the differences can be explained by the fact that the officers were almost all men, while the nonveteran civilian group was two-fifths women.
The results were taken from nearly 4,000 interviews conducted in late 1998 and early 1999 as part of a $500,000 study that will ultimately produce at least 20 academic papers. The study is coordinated for the Triangle Institute for Security Studies, a nonprofit foundation based in North Carolina, by Richard H. Kohn, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina, and Peter D. Feaver, associate professor of political science at Duke University.
In meeting rooms and corridors, the first findings were the hot topic last weekend at the 95th annual meeting of the American Political Science Association in Atlanta. Further data are to be made public at a conference by the Triangle Institute in late October in Caughny, Ill., including a comparison with the views of the general civilian public that may show the nonveteran elite more at odds with ordinary Americans than is the military elite.
That conference, unlike the association's meeting in Atlanta, will focus exclusively on the civilian-military study and will offer more examination of the causes and consequences of the gap.
In papers presented at the Atlanta meeting, scholars had more fear of potential dangers than evidence of any impact of the gap thus far. Prof.Ole R. Holsti of Duke, who longed for the days when generals like George C. Marshall never even voted, said, "A political military is worrisome if it just becomes another interest group."
Prof. Charles Stevenson of the National War College said it was "scary" to have "an officer corps so overwhelmingly Republican."
"In the 19th century, officers frequently had political alignments," Professor Stevenson said, "but they did not favor a single party consistently."
Benjamin O. Fordham, assistant professor of political science at the State University of New York at Albany, said the gap in beliefs had not affected either military spending or the rates of enlistment and re-enlistment. But the professor said he worried that Democrats might not take seriously warnings from a military establishment that they perceived as overwhelmingly Republican.
One clear finding was a widespread unhappiness in the military with current trends in civilian society. But despite the generally high regard the public holds for the military, there were some clear measures of latent civilian distrust.
"Support for the military drops, even precipitously, as connections to the military disappear," wrote Dr. Feaver and Paul Gronke, assistant professor of political science at Duke.
Twenty-one percent, for example, of the civilian nonveteran elite said they would be disappointed if one of their children joined the armed forces. Just 7 percent of the military officers felt that way. On the other hand, 77 percent of officers agreed with the statement that "civilian society would be better off if it adopted more of the military's values and customs;" only 43 percent of civilian elites with military experience agreed and just 25 percent of the nonveterans agreed.
One simple explanation for some of the gap is the differing attitudes of men and women. Women make up 41 percent of the civilian nonveteran elite, but only 8 percent of the military elite. Dr. Feaver said in an interview that on many of the issues examined, as much as half the difference between military and civilian opinions could be attributed to the relative conservatism of men.
But the difference between the Republicanism of the more than 600 almost all-male officers surveyed and the nearly 700 nonveteran civilians is only marginally related to the preference of women for the Democratic Party. The most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll showed that 29 percent of the public was Republican and 31 percent Democrat. Among men, 29 percent also said they were Republicans but just 26 percent identified themselves as Democrats.
Among the nonveteran civilian elite, 30 percent called themselves Republicans, and 43 percent Democrats, while among veterans, 47 percent identified themselves as Republicans, and 23 percent Democrats.
The veterans averaged nearly 60 years old, while the nonveterans averaged around 50.
Two other military groups were also surveyed, nearly 400 officers in the active reserves and 1,700 students in the Reserve Officers Training Corps in colleges and cadets and midshipmen at the service academies, who were identified as "precommissioned" respondents. Among the reservists, 63 percent said they were Republicans and 10 percent identified themselves as Democrats, while 47 percent of the students said they were Republican and 12 percent Democrats.
Dr. Holsti said it was clear that the Republican trend in the military began well before President Clinton took office. There is considerable tension between the Administraton and the military over Mr. Clinton's avoiding the draft, his effort to remove barriers to homosexuals in the services and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
But Dr. Holsti also said the Republicans in the military were not extremists; only 13 percent called themselves "very conservative." They rejected propositions like removing books attacking religion or promoting Communism or homosexuality from library shelves by the same sort of overwhelming majorities as others in the study.
On military and foreign policy questions, there were many agreements between the nonveterans and the military elite. Both overwhelmingly supported using the United Nations to help settle international disputes and felt the American public would not tolerate large numbers of casualties in military operations.
Both groups heavily rejected the idea that military, rather than political goals, should govern the use of force. Both disagreed sharply with the statement, "We shouldn't think so much in international terms but concentrate more on our own national problems."
But there were also clear differences. Among the nonveterans, 59 percent agreed with the statement that "American national security depends more on international trade and a strong domestic economy than on our military strength." Only 37 percent of the officers agreed. And 65 percent of the officers but only 43 percent of the nonveterans agreed with the idea that "there is nothing wrong with using the C.I.A. to try to undermine hostile governments."
Professor Kohn said in an interview that when the study was completed, "We are likely to have a set of conclusions that are complex."
The current level of discussion of the issue, he said, "tends to be one of extremes," either arguing that the differences between military and civilians are of no consequence, or that they raise the threat of a breakdown in civilian control.
The professor said it was important to identify the differences that were new and also those that did not simply represent the fact that the military was an "unusual and very different profession."

Poking Wounds Within a Family

BYLINE: By Peter M. Nichols 

 BODY:
"If we're lucky enough, we work for and toward our weakest area," said the filmmaker Alan Berliner, who guessed it was the psychiatrist Carl Jung who first provided that observation. In any event, Mr. Berliner steered toward family, particularly his own, in three acclaimed documentaries, "The Family Album," "Intimate Stranger" and "Nobody's Business," to be released on tape on Tuesday by Milestone Film and Video.
Mr. Berliner's films are praised for their introspection. They also make the commonplace totally involving. "In 'Nobody's Business,' Alan Berliner illustrates the power of fine art to transform life," Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The New York Times. 
 That film, shown at the New York Film Festival in 1996, was the third in the series. "My family life in childhood was very painful," he said. "I've been inching my way toward 'Nobody's Business.' " The first documentary, "The Family Album" (1986), led him to the general subject of family. A collection of ingeniously pieced-togother snatches from countless home movies, most from the 30's and 40's, the film touches on life's eras: babyhood, school, dating, marriage, child rearing, aging, death. Accompanying them are bits of oral history and family audio recordings. "My school isn't like your school; I'll be a laborer like my father," someone says in a typically striking remark.
Storm clouds of trouble suddenly gather: unemployment and money problems, excessive drinking, fighting, loss of hope and direction, strangulating marriages, child support (or lack of it). Someone remarks that there is a sadness to a broken family, a subject Mr. Berliner gets to in "Nobody's Business."
Before that, though, came "Intimate Stranger" (1991), a film about his maternal grandfather, Joseph Cassuto, a cotton merchant whose family bent but never broke through years of separation and dysfunction. A Palestinian Jew brought up in Egypt, Mr. Cassuto worked for the Japanese Cotton Trading Company in Alexandria. After World War II, he moved to Japan, where he worked for 11 months of the year. He left his wife and four children in Brooklyn. In the film he is described as a man who lived to please his associates. He is not rated highly as a father. "There were a lot of things going on in Brooklyn, U.S.A., but he wasn't around," a son says.
The most caustic comments come from Oscar Berliner, Mr. Cassuto's son-in-law, Alan's dedicated father and the subject of Alan's most accomplished film, "Nobody's Business." In the early 70's, Oscar and his wife (Mr. Cassuto's daughter) divorced after years of domestic discord that deeply affected their young children. Now a gruff, reclusive man in his 80's, the elder Berliner bluntly rebuffs his son's explanation of the reasons to make a documentary about him, which, in Alan's view, include the need for father and son to link with each other and by extension with the world. Oscar says he sees no such need and ducks behind a who-cares attitude. "You're trying to put your head on my shoulders and it won't work," he insists.
Nevertheless, Alan said, Oscar responded to the standing ovation he received from the audience at the New York Film Festival.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Gazing in a Mirror: The Omnipresent Camera

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
IN the age of mechanical reproduction, the hatred that dare not speak its name may well be photophobia. In these image-saturated times, even the most devout lovers of photography can succumb, while acute sufferers may even long for heated discussions of "the death of photography." After all, if other forms of human expression -- painting, sculpture, the novel -- are regularly pronounced dead, why is photography exempt?
Here, unfortunately, is why: Photography, you might say, is us. A century and a half after its invention, it is less a "form of human expression" than an inextricable part of the human condition and contemporary landscape, something involuntary and inescapable, almost like weather. It is no longer possible to catalogue its uses and applications, the fields of knowledge it has extended and the doors of experience it has opened, not to mention the thrilling tricks, illusions and visual manipulations it executes daily in magazines and newspapers and on billboards. At the moment the southeast corner of 26th Street and the Avenue of the Americas is dominated by the spectacle of a towering image of a well-shod young man scaling a brick wall that covers the side, also brick, of a 12-story building. It is an advertisement for shoes, but what dazzles is the giant figure, the blend of real and depicted brick and the way the building's actual windows become part of the image. Photography permeates the social fabric, the media and cyberspace, our very dreams. And it is the most omnipresent of all art forms. 
 Despite talk of the rise of video or the return of painting or the dominance of installation art, nothing in the last three decades of art can match the triumph of photography. Since the late 1960's, when it was put into play by Conceptual Art, photography has changed the history of art and infiltrated every other contemporary art medium while diversifying exponentially.
It has generated a sea change or two in art criticism and theory as well. And it has demonstrated that it is as capable as any other art medium of endless repetition and derivativeness, as suggested by the plethora of snapshots that, in various sizes, pass for art these days. An exhibition at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center offers some respite from the onslaught of photography that in the homeopathic tradition of treating like with like consists of more of the same. "The Promise of Photography: Selected Works From the DG Bank Collection" is a big, genial show of work dating from the early 1960's to the present. Its nearly 300 images by 32 artists are spread throughout the center's dozen ground-floor galleries with a sense of spaciousness and order that feels unusual by today's standards, when so many dense-packed photography installations seem bent on mimicking the medium's saturation of everyday life.
Selected from the DG Bank's enormous collection by Alanna Heiss, P.S. 1's director, and Klaus Biesenbach, one of its curators, "The Promise of Photography" seems like an attempt to clear the air quietly, to loosely yet seriously chart the extraordinary range of art photography without a hint of agenda, polemic or sensation.
In a purely experiential sense, air, or open space, is something that P.S. 1 has in quantity. There are rarely more than one or two artists to a gallery, and the blank walls provide perceptual intervals and pauses that enable each one's work to stand, or occasionally fall, in isolation, although there are plenty of connections and contrasts to be drawn if one is so inclined. The effect is marvelously unforced and unpredictable.
The works on view range from Marco Giacomelli's early 1960's black-and-white photographs of exuberant clerics on ice skates, their dark robes dramatically silhouetted against the snow, to Magdalena Jetelova's overly contrived images of dark Icelandic landscapes streaked with the white hot lines of a laser. In between, the show runs the gamut from artifice to document and back again. There are various kinds of street and landscape photography, work from several generations of Conceptually inclined artists (Dan Graham, Christian Boltanski, Dennis Adams, Candida Hofer) and sundry examples of set-up photography. The most notable of these is "Something More," Tracey Moffat's steamy Outback melodrama of death, desire and derailed travel plans, a tale told in nine images that combine over-the-top Technicolor with the silvers and grays of film noir.
The show is rife with the work of artists who have not had solo shows in New York; the mysterious portraits and landscapes of Bill Henson, who, like Ms. Moffat, is Australian, are a case in point. And there are several younger artists, both known and unknown, whose work reflects a new generation's embrace of the intuitive.
The German photographer Wolfgang Tillmans is represented by a wall scattered with his stylishly romantic images of his friends and surroundings. Nearby the sculptor Gabriel Orozco tactfully makes his presence felt with three color images that characteristically blend the exotic and banal. And across the way, the close-ups by the German artist Tamara Grcic zero in on the details, mostly green, of a grocery store in Chinatown in New York.
It makes perfect sense that these newcomers share a gallery with three color images from the 1970's by Helen Levitt, the great photographer of New York street life whose work has done so much to reveal the joys of the serendipitous encounter.
Ms. Heiss and Mr. Biesenbach seem to have deliberately avoided some of the most obvious usual suspects, skipping William Wegman, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff, even though the collection includes their work. And there are several surprises. Hanging opposite the charming Giacomelli images are a series of irresistibly antic images of Japanese children at play by Nobuyoshi Araki, best known in New York for voyeuristic, sexually charged scenes of scantily clad women. Considered against the background of Mr. Araki's other work, the innocence of his photographs at P.S. 1 is almost jarring.
There are also invigorating changes of pace. The walls of one gallery are covered with a single 109-image work from 1990 by the German Conceptualist Hanne Darboven. The color photographs document every page of a week-at-a-glance calendar completely filled with the artist's abstract script, measuring time in wavelike ebbs and flows.
The next gallery presents two photographs by the German artist Katharina Sieverding: enormous X-ray-like images that show the human skull infused with clouds of liquid that suggest the imagination depicted at a rolling boil. A tiny alcove in one corner of this gallery holds one of the show's sweetest surprises, dopey self-portraits of Eva and Adele, the angelic German performance artists (a man and woman) known for a kind of double-cross cross-dressing. They always appear at international art openings dressed as identical female twins in bright vinyl suits and heavy powder, but confuse matters with their shaved heads. The images are accompanied by viewer mail.
The show often progresses in telling juxtapositions of sympathetic or contrasting sensibilities. In one of the early galleries, a photograph generated by the latest installment of Matthew Barney's "Cremaster" film series is a straight-on head shot of the artist as Gary Gilmore, grim, gritty and carefully staged.
Across the way are 12 images from Andy Warhol's "Social Disease," his offhand oddly caricature snapshots from the 1970's of the rich and famous and glamorous at play. They are, by the way, the only images of celebrities in the exhibition.
The German painters Sigmar Polke and Gerhard Richter, longtime colleagues, take opposite walls, each represented by a small gallery with a small series of photographs that share a gray fuzziness and lackadaisical technique. Mr. Polke's double-exposed images of starlike sculptures fashioned from a folding ruler are from 1968 and brim with Post-Minimalist laissez-faire. Mr. Richter's shadowy images, from 1991, show the artist and others in a murky basement and exude some of the sinister, crime-scene ghostliness reminiscent of early works like his Bader-Meinhoff paintings, which were based on news photographs of the German terrorist group.
In another gallery, the straightforward photographs of William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, all from the 70's, cast the American South and the American West, respectively, in a glowing yet desolate light in scenes riddled with social inequity, economic decline and emotional isolation. Their genuineness is pointed up by one large image from the intractably cerebral Rodney Graham, of a tall and glorious ponderosa pine that is hung upside down. Fittingly, the image recreates the inversion of the human retina that makes all vision possible.
"The Promise of Photography: Selected Works From the DG Bank Collection" is at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, through Oct. 24.

HEADLINE: The New Russian Menace

BYLINE: By James A. Leach; James A. Leach, a Republican Representative from Iowa, is chairman of the House Banking Committee, which will hold hearings this month on international financial corruption.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Recent allegations that American and European banks have facilitated money laundering for Russian organized-crime figures underscore how intractable a problem corruption in Russia is and how vulnerable Western institutions are to the lure of servicing the world's most virulent kleptocracy.
Russia is hardly the first country to be victimized by a culture of corruption. The plundering of the Philippines under Marcos, the looting of Zaire by Mobutu and Indonesia's crony capitalism during the last years of Suharto stand as parallels. What sets Russia apart is the pervasiveness of politically tolerated corruption in a country of such size and geopolitical significance. 
 The Russian Government estimates that criminal syndicates control 40 percent of the economy and perhaps half of the country's banking assets, though others put the figures higher. In any country where political stability is questionable and legal protections of property are unreliable, those who come to control wealth, legally or otherwise, can be expected to invest abroad. In Russia, theft exceeds investment, resulting in negative economic growth and a disillusioned society.
The question is how the West should respond. Americans have both a vested and a humanitarian interest in helping the Russian transition to democracy. But there's no credible way to suggest to taxpayers that they should support assistance to a government that allows insiders to recycle aid from the West in the form of laundered bank deposits, personal investments in the stock market or Pebble Beach real estate. American policy in this circumstance should be directed to helping the Russian people, not its rulers.
The struggle of the last half century was to defeat Communism; the challenge in the years ahead will be to constrain corruption. The second struggle may well prove more difficult, because avarice is a more fundamental aspect of human nature than the Communist precept that people are subject to historical determinist forces beyond the individual's control.
We should begin by enforcing our laws, issuing indictments if necessary. Such actions might prompt Russian prosecutors to do the same, calling Russia's new class of thieving oligarchs to account for domestic crimes more serious than international banking violations. We should also emphasize retrieving stolen assets for the Russian people rather than giving new aid, except perhaps food assistance.
For the Russians' part, instead of propelling the flight of capital through a banking system that principally serves as a platform for money laundering, they should establish community-oriented banks and press for the opening of branches of well-regulated Western banks in which people can trust that their savings will be turned into loans for local enterprises. No nation, after all, can prosper if it lacks institutions where people can safely put their money and seek secure loans.
Most of all, we have an obligation to insure that the corrosive impact of foreign corruption is blocked from our shores. America may be as challenged today by the threat of a deterioration of values -- galloping corruption -- as it was yesterday by Marxist ideology.

HEADLINE: New Economic Data Stir Inflation Fears

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly declined last week, good news for job seekers but a sign of potential trouble to economists who worry about inflation.
A total of 286,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits for the week ended Saturday, a drop of 4,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said today. That was the lowest level since Aug. 21, when claims were at 285,000. 
 Many economists had been expecting that new claims would actually rise a little to 290,000.
The four-week moving average for claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, rose just 750, to 287,500 last week.
Economists consider jobless claims levels below 300,000 an indication of an extremely tight labor market. In August, the nation's unemployment rate inched down to 4.2 percent, returning to a 29-year low.
That is good for workers but worrisome to economists. They fear employers scrambling for workers will offer higher wages and benefits, which could drive up prices and trigger inflation.
That has not happened so far. Although growth in productivity the amount of output for each hour worked slowed in the spring, it is one of the forces helping to keep inflation low.
And, the Government last week said hourly earnings for workers rose slightly in August.
On Friday, the Government will release a report on inflation at the wholesale level; many economists are expecting a slight rise to three-tenths of a percent, reflecting higher energy and food prices.

HEADLINE: Helping East Timor, and Indonesia

 BODY:
Time is running out for Indonesia to disarm and disband the army-backed militias that have rampaged through East Timor for the past week, killing hundreds of people and sending thousands into hiding and exile. The violence subsided somewhat yesterday. But unless Jakarta can bring these militias to heel in the next few days, which is unlikely, an international peacekeeping force will be needed to save lives and make sure that the results of last week's referendum approving independence for the province is respected.
Indonesia's consent is needed for such a force to function smoothly. That will require strong pressure from Washington. President Clinton applied some yesterday, announcing the suspension of military ties with the Indonesian Army and emphasizing that American support for future economic assistance will hinge on Indonesia's performance on the East Timor issue. He should be even more explicit and declare that billions of dollars in international loans will stay blocked until President B. J. Habibie accepts international peacekeepers. 
 Washington wants to save lives in East Timor without derailing Jakarta's transition to democratic government. This fall, a partially elected assembly is scheduled to choose Indonesia's next president. That would complete what, for all its deficiencies, would be the most democratic selection process the world's fourth-largest country has ever known. But American policy can advance both objectives at the same time. Democracy can take root in Indonesia only if its armed forces defer to civilian authority and respect election results. In East Timor, Indonesia's army is doing neither.
Last week's independence referendum was organized with the approval of President Habibie, who promised to abide by its result. But a significant faction of Indonesia's army fears that independence for East Timor could encourage secessionist movements elsewhere in Indonesia, and is therefore trying to subvert the referendum by creating so much chaos that Mr. Habibie will be forced to reverse course. If this succeeds, it would demonstrate that the military, which has ruled Indonesia for the past 34 years, remains the real power no matter who wins the presidential election. Many senior officers also oppose an international peacekeeping force.
Indonesian democracy requires that the armed forces obey civilian authorities in Jakarta. East Timor's safety and freedom require that Jakarta agree to international peacekeepers. Washington should use every lever at its disposal to make sure that both requirements are quickly fulfilled.

HEADLINE: Both China and U.S. Upbeat About Talks on Trade Group

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Friday, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Overcoming a serious obstacle in their soured relationship, the United States and China agreed today to resume negotiations on China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and both sides expressed hopes that China would join in less than three months.
The United States Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and the Chinese Foreign Trade Minister, Shi Guangsheng, announced the resumption after a discussion here at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. 
 Their agreement sets a positive tone for the meeting here Saturday between President Clinton and the Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin. The Clinton Administration hopes the meeting will restore some steadiness to the relationship between the two countries after a many months of acrimony over the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and charges that China stole American nuclear secrets.
Ms. Barshefsky did not release a precise schedule but said that "substantive discussions" between Chinese and American trade officials on the outstanding issues would begin and that it was unlikely that the deal would be completed on Saturday.
For his part, Mr. Shi characterized his talks with Ms. Barshefsky as "very constructive."
He said, "We are willing to work together to conclude negotiations at an early date and bring China into W.T.O. at an early date."
China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which would give United States businesses and agricultural producers wide access to the Chinese market, has been a major goal of the Clinton Administration's China policy.
But the decision in April by President Clinton to turn down an offer by the Chinese and the refusal of the Chinese to come back to the table derailed the progress that had been made in rounds of intense negotiations earlier in the year.
Ms. Barshefsky said that the two sides would pick up the negotiations where they broke off. She described the main issues as banking, textiles and anti-dumping measures and suggested that the United States wanted the Chinese to agree to the demands Mr. Clinton made in April.
The stakes for getting China membership in the entity that governs world trade are now high because a failure to reach an agreement before the start of the next round of the organization's trade talks in Seattle that start at the end of November would place even more stress on the Washington-Beijing relationship.
China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization, and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have lasted 13 years. Only under Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, a reformist, have the talks made serious progress. As China's economy has faltered and as it tries to shut down or shrink inefficient state-run industries, Mr. Zhu has been anxious to attract foreign investment and competition.
Congress will not need to vote on a final deal, but in order for China to take full part in the Seattle trade talks and for American businesses to get the full advantage of China's membership, Congress must pass legislation allowing China permanent normal trading relations with the United States, officials said. At the moment, China is subject to annual Congressional renewal of its trade status.
In the document that was nearly completed in April, China made far-ranging concessions to liberalize its economy, including opening up telecommunications, financial services and agriculture.

HEADLINE: New Chinese Missiles Seen as Threat to U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
An intelligence report issued today predicted that within 15 years, China will be aiming missiles at the United States that will be fitted with small nuclear warheads developed with the help of espionage.
The new report, a National Intelligence Estimate that surveys threats facing the United States, concludes that "by 2015, China will likely have tens of missiles targeted against the United States, having added a few tens of more survivable land- and sea-based mobile missiles with smaller nuclear warheads -- in part influenced by U.S. technology gained through espionage." 
 The report, a consensus within the American intelligence community, is the strongest statement yet from those officials on the value to China of what the officials have called a long campaign of nuclear espionage. It is being released in the middle of a public debate over the significance of the allegations of espionage.
A senior intelligence official said the report marks the first time the intelligence community has explicitly stated that Chinese warheads developed with stolen secrets will be aimed at the United States.
Among its other findings, the report concludes that North Korea could convert a recently developed rocket into a ballistic missile capable of carrying small nuclear warheads to the United States.
Following the pattern set by North Korea, Iran could test a ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States in the second half of the next decade, the report states. But the intelligence analysts differ over how soon such a test may come.
Iraq could also test a North Korean-style ballistic missile in the second half of the next decade, especially if it obtains outside assistance.
By contrast, the report found that Russia's nuclear ballistic missile forces are likely to be limited by economic problems. The intelligence estimate concludes that by 2015, Russia will maintain fewer nuclear weapons on its ballistic missiles than are allowed under either the Start I or Start II treaties. It also concludes that an unauthorized or accidental launch of a Russian strategic missile remains "highly unlikely," but "only so long as current technical and procedural safeguards are in place."
The National Intelligence Council, which oversees intelligence analysis, issued an unclassified summary of the report at the request of Congress, where the potential threat from nuclear missiles from North Korea, Iran and Iraq lies at the core of a debate over whether the United States should develop an antimissile defense system.
The debate over Chinese espionage has now been added to that mix, as the intelligence community struggles to fathom both the damage done to national security from the apparent theft of nuclear secrets and China's strategic intentions.
In April the intelligence community concluded that China had stolen nuclear weapons design information "that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons." The report added that the intelligence community believed Beijing had probably used the information not to copy American warheads but to accelerate its own program.
In May intelligence officials also stated privately that the warhead to be deployed on a new missile is likely to include some stolen American technology. The Chinese missile, the DF-31, which had its first flight test in August, is expected to have a range of about 5,000 miles, and so will be capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii. But intelligence officials say it is more likely to be aimed at Russia and other Asian countries because of its limited range.
The new intelligence estimate states, however, that China is developing a longer-range, mobile ballistic missile that will be aimed primarily at the United States. This land-based missile is expected to be tested within the next few years, and is likely to be equipped with a small warhead that uses stolen American design information, the report concludes.
China is also developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile, the JL-2, which the report concludes is likely to be tested within the next decade. The JL-2 will probably be able to hit the United States from within China, and will also be equipped with small advanced warheads.
"They didn't copy our systems, as much as the stolen U.S. technology has guided their efforts for their work on their own weapons," a senior intelligence official said.
As it modernizes its small, aging missile inventory, China is following a strategic doctrine that emphasizes smaller, lighter-weight warheads that can be used in mobile systems, the report concludes. Mobility, the senior intelligence official said, equals "survivability."
The report also says China is "significantly improving" its short-range missile systems and is increasing the size of its missile forces deployed opposite Taiwan, though they may not be larger than has been reported in the news media.

Treasuries Fall on Consumer Price Concerns

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday, as a tumbling dollar, a rise in crude-oil prices and unexpected economic growth in Japan fanned concerns that consumer prices may climb.
"It all adds up to more inflation," said Mark MacQueen, who has been selling Treasuries and buying money-market securities for the $550 million debt portfolio at Sage Advisory Services Ltd. in Austin, Tex. "There's a good chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again" to combat it, he added.
The 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 100 17/32. That pushed its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent on Wednesday.
One reason Treasuries fell is that the dollar was down 3.2 percent against the yen to a three-year low of 107.60 yen. A falling currency can spur inflation by making imports more expensive. Investors got another whiff of inflation when crude oil, which is used to make products as diverse as gasoline and plastic bags, climbed to its highest price in two-and-a-half years.
Signs of economic growth fueled concerns about rising prices even more. Claims for unemployment insurance, measured by their four-week moving average, held below 290,000 for a fifth week. That has not happened since the end of 1973.
In Japan, the economy grew tw-tenths of a percent in the April-June quarter from the first quarter, the Government announced today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a decline of three-tenths of a percent . Many investors fear improving economic growth in Asia and Europe may lead to higher prices for goods and services globally.
"Inflation is going to show up," said Todd Finkelstein, who helps oversee $425 million at Advest Group in Boston. "It's imminent."
Mr. Finkelstein, who expects the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its next meeting Oct. 5, has been selling Treasuries to buy investment-grade corporate bonds, gaining some protection against inflation in their higher yields.
Fed officials refrained from stoking rate concerns today. William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaking in Buffalo, said the American productivity boom will probably continue. High worker productivity has helped keep inflation low, analysts say. And Roger Ferguson, a Fed governor,, speaking in Washington, said inflation was well contained. Both played down the impact of the weaker dollar on the United States economy.
Bonds were also held back as corporations scheduled some $5 billion of debt sales, which will offer investors a higher-yielding alternative to Treasuries.
The Procter & Gamble Company sold $1 billion of 10-year notes, yielding just under a percentage point more than the 10-year Treasury rates.
The AT&T Corporation, the largest United States long-distance phone company, issued $450 million of three-year notes.
Duke Capital, part of Duke Energy, an electric utility based in North Carolina, plans to sell $1 billion of global notes.
Arcadia Financial Ltd., an auto financier, plans to sell $600 million of auto-loan backed bonds, adding to $1.47 billion of asset-backed securities already scheduled for this week.

Yen Soars on Data Showing Growth in Japan's Economy

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The yen jumped to a three-year high against the dollar on international markets today after the Japanese Government surprised analysts with a report indicating that the economy grew from April to June, expanding for two successive quarters for the first time in more than two years.
The Economic Planning Agency said yesterday that the economy grew by two-tenths of a percent -- an annualized rate of nine-tenths of a percent -- in the April-June quarter, beating consensus projections of a marginal decline. 
 The new figures, which measure the total value of goods and services produced in Japan, come as a seeming confirmation of the unusually strong 2 percent growth -- an annualized rate of 8 percent -- in the previous quarter. The earlier numbers stunned economists, some of whom even questioned the validity of the figures.
They also come as a welcome boost to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who began his re-election campaign for the presidency of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday, and who faces a Lower House election within a year.
Mr. Obuchi responded to the announcement of the new figures by reiterating his Government's projection of half-a-percent growth this year. "We have to make efforts by invoking all measures so that Japan may maintain the momentum toward stable economic growth," he said.
Japanese markets responded favorably to the new growth figures. The benchmark Nikkei stock index rose 36.18 points to close at 17,677.56 yesterday. The yen hit 108.85 to the dollar in Tokyo, and continued to strengthen overseas after the close of trading here, hitting 107.78 in New York, passing a level last seen in August 1996.
The narrowly positive growth rates of this quarter may have suggested that the Japanese economy was finally stabilizing after a decade-long recession characterized by a domestic debt crisis, plummeting real estate prices and high -- by Japanese standards -- unemployment, but analysts picking over the latest numbers remained deeply divided over the country's prospects.
The Government itself, anxious not to prematurely ease its policy of fiscal stimulus aimed at restoring growth as it has done before, signaled moves yesterday to quickly release new spending, which was approved in a large supplemental budget passed earlier this year. A second, similarly large stimulative budget is expected before year's end, economic analysts here said.
"Japan's economy is in a run-up to recovery, but it is not yet on a full recovery track," said Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, which releases the growth numbers each quarter.
The additional spending measures come as personal consumption, widely considered the key indicator of the country's recovery, grew by a modest eight-tenths of a percent. Much of this came from a record 16.1 percent jump in housing investment, as home-buyers appeared to take advantage of special tax cuts and falling prices.
One of the few other bright spots in household spending was on personal computers, which consumers have begun to buy enthusiastically.
Figures released on Tuesday, meanwhile, showed a marked decline in capital spending by Japanese corporations. Until demand in corporate and consumer spending perk up, the Government will feel obliged to pick up the slack, hoping to avoid a relapse into recession.
Despite agreement on these fundamentals, foreign economists were deeply divided on the longer-term interpretation of the consequences of the latest gross domestic product report's details. While some said the numbers reflected a growing confidence in the economy that would build new strength going forward, others warned that persistent high unemployment and falling monthly wage figures could spell more trouble just ahead. Increasingly, the pessimists say, the Government appears reliant on pump priming and lacks an exit strategy.
"I think this is very straight-forward," said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan. "The policy measures adopted by Obuchi last year have kicked in and are working. Essentially, today's numbers say that we have entered a period of stability in which fiscal support goes hand in hand with restructuring."
Mr. Koll dismissed worries about Japan's debt, and cited the fusion of three of the country's largest banks last month as a sign that after years of doldrums the corporate sector had recovered its vigor. "A year ago, bank managers could think of nothing but sidling up to the public trough to seek money. Now they are making deals and seizing the initiative."
Other economists sounded much darker notes, however, with many focusing on the consequences of continued Government spending as a solution to the crisis. Several economists described the smart rise in housing starts and personal computer sales as possible blips on the screen, and warned that at some point, Japan will face a bill for all the recent spending, much of it in the form of costly bailouts.
"Consumer confidence is up, and the Obuchi Government deserves credit for that, but the question is what are the consequences of the measures they've used to reach this goal," said Robert Feldman, chief economist for Japan at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "They've spent a lot of money on credit guarantees. In November they added 20 trillion yen to the guarantee authority.
"Bankruptcies are way down, of course, but the taxpayers are holding the bag, and one has to wonder how much of this debt will ever be repaid?"

HEADLINE: Changes at Morgan Stanley Reflect GrowingImportance of Europe

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
To judge by a sweeping reshuffling of management at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Europe is king.
Europe has long been a testing ground for senior investment bankers. But the Continent, in the inaugural year of the euro, has quickly become the deal-making center of the world even as American merger and acquisition activity slows. And for Wall Street, power follows the money. 
 At Morgan Stanley, New York-based and London-based bankers will now share authority over two leading profit centers in investment banking: mergers and acquisitions, and corporate finance. The firm named Mike Uva, a London-based banker, to split corporate finance duties with William M. Lewis Jr. in New York. Simon Robey in London will share the title of merger and acquisitions chief with Stephen R. Munger in New York. The changes were announced in an internal memorandum circulated to employees yesterday.
The most senior banking executives at Morgan Stanley remain in New York. But the firm's promotions in London signal that key foreign posts are no longer mere training grounds for top jobs in the United States. London in particular is becoming a global administrative center in its own right, a place where Wall Street bankers can spend most of their careers and accumulate authority once vested solely in those willing to play politics at corporate headquarters.
"This is a dramatic statement of how important Europe is becoming to our business," one person close to Morgan Stanley said of the personnel changes. "More and more, everything we do will be cross-border."
Morgan Stanley is not alone in recognizing the trend. John L. Thornton, who has guided Goldman Sachs Group's international operation from London for many years, was named co-chief operating officer and designated an heir apparent of the firm earlier this year. He remains in London.
Business is moving across the Atlantic. In the highly profitable mergers advisory business, total volume of deals slipped in the United States in the first half of this year, to $880 billion from $945 billion. In Europe, companies in nearly every area, from telecommunications to basic industry, are rushing to set up seamless pan-European operations in tandem with the new continent-wide European currency. The volume of deals there increased by half over the year-ago period, to $455 billion.
Many of the biggest deals of the year -- the ones generating the highest fees for bankers -- were in Europe. Olivetti's headline-grabbing $35 billion purchase of the much larger Telecom Italia meant big fees for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and Lehman Brothers, advisers on the two sides. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were on opposite sides of the biggest telecommunications deal of the year, when Vodafone Group of Britain bought America's Airtouch Communications for $60 billion.
Wall Street firms have also sent top New York bankers and traders to London to oversee the new business of underwriting bonds denominated in euros. Long-term, some economists see the euro as competing with the dollar as the top international currency. American investment banks have made no secret of their desire to steal that business away from Europe-based rivals.
The promotions of executives in Europe were the centerpiece of Morgan Stanley's reshuffling. But the changes were surprisingly broad in scope for a firm that is in the middle of its most profitable year ever. Though the firm has shown few signs of weakness in mergers and acquisitions, the appointments mean all new administrative leadership for that unit. Gary W. Parr, who had been a co-head of mergers and acquisitions, returns to doing client work full time as head of an expanded banking group catering to banks and insurance companies, according to the memo.
Corporate finance, the part of the banking business that manages clients' relationships worldwide, will also have two new leaders. Mr. Lewis, who had been a co-head of mergers and acquisitions, and Mr. Uva in London replace Robert Jones, a veteran Morgan Stanley executive who insiders said had withdrawn from administrative duties but will continue at the firm as a vice chairman and senior banker.
Both corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions continue to report to Joseph A. Perella, the firm's head of investment banking. In other changes, Michael Zaoui was named head of European mergers and acquisitions, based in London, and Owen D. Thomas will become deputy head of the firm's real estate department.
One person close to Morgan Stanley said the midyear changes reflected some tensions within the executive suite as well as a desire to focus more on Europe.
"You don't change so many people at once unless there are conflicts to be addressed," the person said. "Morgan Stanley has become a less congenial place to work, frankly, even though no one can complain about performance."
The person added that growth in all kinds of banking had strained the collegial atmosphere that had prevailed at the firm and had tested the administrative skills of people who were groomed in serving clients, not managing employees. "I think they're still just feeling their way through this by trial and error," the person said.
A spokeswoman for the firm declined to comment on the personnel changes.

HEADLINE: House Bill Would Slightly Ease Lawsuits Against H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
House Republicans introduced a comprehensive bill today to regulate health maintenance organizations and to protect patients, who would gain carefully circumscribed new rights to sue health plans for injuries caused by the insurer's negligence.
The full House is expected to vote soon on the measure, drafted at the request of House Republican leaders including the Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert. Given the divisive history of the issue in the House, Republican and Democratic leaders were reluctant to predict the vote. 
 The authors of the bill, Representatives Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and John Shadegg of Arizona, said it would allow patients to sue in Federal court to recover damages for genuine injuries, while making sure the courts were not filled with frivolous claims.
Representative Van Hillary of Tennessee, a Republican supporter of the bill, said, "It allows patients who have truly been wronged to have a jury trial in Federal court."
President Clinton, Congressional Democrats and consumer groups favor a much greater expansion of the patient's right to sue. H.M.O.'s, insurance companies, business groups and Senate Republicans oppose any new right to sue, saying it would make insurance unaffordable for many people.
Democrats described the Coburn-Shadegg bill as a diversion, meant to sabotage stronger patient protections. Those protections are in a bill supported by most House Democrats and by a few Republicans, notably Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia.
Dr. Coburn and Mr. Shadegg shared drafts of their bill with aides to the Speaker, but Mr. Hastert's office had no immediate comment today.
Republican supporters of the measure urged the Speaker today to endorse it. Otherwise, they said, House Republicans, under pressure to make H.M.O.'s more accountable, might end up supporting the Democratic proposals.
That House Republicans are now trying to expand patients' ability to sue H.M.O.'s shows how much heat the Republicans feel on the issue, which has emerged as the most contentious of all questions in the debate over how to regulate health insurance in the United States.
Federal and state judges have often allowed H.M.O.'s to avoid liability for decisions on benefits. In the last two years, courts have become more receptive to lawsuits challenging the quality of care, but patients' rights vary from state to state, and many judges have described the mix of Federal and state laws as confusing.
The Senate passed a bill on July 15 that would provide some protections for a limited number of Americans in managed health care plans. But it does not include any new right to sue. Mr. Graham said the Senate measure was "a woefully inadequate response to a real problem."
Dr. Coburn, a physician, and Mr. Shadegg, a lawyer, stressed that the right to sue was narrowly defined in their bill.
Patients would be allowed to sue if they suffered physical injury because of a health plan's negligence. Before going to court, patients would have to exhaust the administrative appeals process established by their H.M.O. This process would include review by an outside panel of at least three medical experts.
An H.M.O. could be forced to pay damages only if it failed to exercise "ordinary care" and made an "incorrect determination" that a a service was not medically necessary or was not a covered benefit under the terms of the health plan.
Damages for pain and suffering would be limited to $250,000 or twice the amount of any economic loss, whichever was higher. Patients could not recover punitive damages unless a health plan had acted with "conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety" of patients.
Employers who provide health benefits to their employees would not be subject to lawsuits unless they directly participated in the final decision of a health plan to deny a claim for benefits.
Adrienne Hahn, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the bill was "unacceptable, because it does not provide the consumer with full compensation for injuries that result from the mistakes of a managed-care plan."
Donald A. Danner, vice president of the National Federation of Independent Business, said the bill "would force most small employers to stop providing health insurance."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Changing Old Buildings To Harbor Apartments

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The financial district's healthy rental market has given rise to a new plan to convert the mostly vacant upper floors of a three-building complex at 17 Battery Place, overlooking Battery Park and New York Harbor, into 500 apartments.
The complex, between West and Washington Streets, contains a total of 1.2 million square feet of space spread among the three interconnected buildings, built in 1903, 1911 and 1972. Of that total, 760,000 square feet -- on floors 2 through 13 in the older buildings and in the entire 22-story 1972 structure -- make up the complex's office component, which is owned by the S. L. Green Realty Corporation, a Manhattan-based real estate investment trust. 
 Last month, the Moinian Group of Manhattan paid $42 million for the remaining 440,000 square feet, all in the older buildings, comprising the basement, ground level and floors 14 to 31. It plans to invest $58 million in the next 10 months to reshape those floors into a luxury rental with studio to two-bedroom units, including 10 duplex penthouses.
The rental project will be called the Ocean and will have a new address, One West Street. Its amenities will include a garage with parking for up to 150 cars, an 18,000-square-foot ground-floor business center, a health club and a 7,500-square-foot rooftop deck so that tenants can take advantage of the views.
Joseph Moinian, chief executive of the Moinian Group, said those views, along with what he described as a continuing demand for rentals in the financial district, persuaded him to move ahead with the project. The renovation architect is Avinash Malhotra Architects of Manhattan.
The Moinian Group is no stranger to downtown, having successfully combined office and residential uses at 90-100 John Street. At that 400,000-square-foot building, the lower 7 floors were retained for retail and office use, with the upper 22 stories converted to 221 rental apartments.
An earlier plan for 17 Battery, envisioned by the seller, a partnership of GFI Capital Resources and Savanna Partners, both of Manhattan, called for converting floors 14 to 23 into a 325-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel. On the floors above that, the partners intended to create 90 condominium units, with hotel services, topped by a banquet hall and business center on the 30th and 31st floors.
GFI bought the entire complex in late 1997 for more than $70 million, and at that time sold S. L. Green the office component for $59 million. GFI intended to relocate the commercial tenants who occupy 30,000 square feet on the upper floors of the older buildings into Green's commercial space. GFI then joined with Savanna Partners to convert those floors.
That plan unraveled in 1998 after negotiations with Ritz-Carlton to manage the hotel did not move forward. The hotel chain now is working with Millennium Partners to bring a Ritz-Carlton to Battery Park City as part of a 38-story tower, to be completed by 2001, whose upper 25 stories are to house 170 condos.
Allen I. Gross, GFI's president, said that by the fall of 1998, the tightening of the financial markets in response to the stock market's slide rendered a condo-hotel project economically unfeasible. Mr. Gross said he and his partners were thinking of converting the space to rentals this year but decided to sell it for what he said was "a great price."
Mr. Moinian said his company closed on the purchase last month after the seller obtained signed contracts from the tenants to relocate in the next 60 days to the office component. While he said his company was also using its own money to start the conversion -- with demolition of the interior and restoration of the building's exterior under way -- it was also seeking bank financing. A new lobby is to be carved out of the older buildings for use by the residents.
Ron Cohen, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG, a commercial brokerage in Manhattan, who worked with both parties on the sale, said the sales price of just under $100 a square foot was reflective of the current market. It is, he added, also indicative of how prices have risen for old downtown office buildings, which sold for as little as $15 a square foot in 1994, a year before a city tax-incentive program ignited conversions to housing.
Since then, about 5,317 apartments have been or are being built, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, the area's business improvement district. Most are rentals.
In the last four years, said Andrew Heiberger, president of Citi Habitats, a rental brokerage that is the leasing agent for the Ocean, average rents per square foot in the financial district have increased from $24, to $40 a year, or $2,300 a month for a typical 700-square-foot one-bedroom unit. The rental vacancy rate in the area, he said, is about 2 percent.
Mr. Moinian said his company was betting that the downtown area could sustain even "more upscale rental units," like those at the Ocean. Given the demand for furnished corporate apartments downtown, he said, he is also contemplating reserving one-third of the units for that use.
Mr. Heiberger said initial rents for the apartments, with 450 to 1,100 square feet, would be $1,575 to $4,025 a month. But he and Mr. Moinian said they expected that the water views from the units, with 10.5- to 16-foot-high ceilings, and planned luxury finishes and amenities would allow them to raise rents as the rental campaign went on.
Leasing is to begin next May.

HEADLINE: U.S. Industry to Drop AIDS Drug Lawsuit Against South Africa

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Pharmaceutical industry leaders said today that they had suspended a lawsuit against South Africa over the price of drugs to treat AIDS and other illnesses.
The dispute has generated public anger toward Vice President Al Gore, who in talks with South Africa represented the drug companies' point of view. 
 The suit challenged a 1997 law aimed at giving South African patients access to cheaper drugs. More than 40 major drug companies said the law infringed on their patent rights. Alan F. Holmer, president of an organization representing the drug companies, said a senior South African official had assured him that the law would soon be changed.
The companies have been trying for two years to persuade South Africa to change the law. Mr. Holmer said that the South African Health Minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, had said the bill would be redrafted next year. The law covers all drugs, but the focus of the dispute has been on AIDS drugs, because they are especially expensive and South Africa has been ravaged by the disease.
The 1997 law had two provisions aimed at bringing down drug prices. One sought to take advantage of a kind of gray market by allowing the import of drugs from countries where they may be available for less, even though unlicensed by the companies that hold the patents.
The second provision, called compulsory licensing, would let the South African Government license local manufacturers to make their own generic versions.
The pharmaceutical companies objected strongly, fearing that the law would erode their patent protections. They have pushed for help both from Congress and the White House, even raising the possibility of economic sanctions against South Africa.
The complex trade issue has proved a problem for Mr. Gore, who had represented the drug companies' point of view in talks with South Africa.
He has been confronted at campaign appearances by protesters accusing him of heartlessness toward AIDS sufferers in South Africa.
Industry officials have said that the dispute has blocked efforts to find other ways to reduce the cost of AIDS drugs in South Africa.
An estimated 6 million of South Africa's 44 million people are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.

HEADLINE: The Full Second Avenue Subway

 BODY:
New York City began construction of its subway system 100 years ago, a fact that should not surprise any veteran customer, especially those using the old Lexington Avenue line along Manhattan's East Side. The oddly designated green line is too often excessively dirty, noisy and hot. Its cars are groaning with so many passengers that City Councilman A. Gifford Miller complained this week at a press conference before a City Council committee hearing that "if the subway represents the arteries of our city, the Lexington Avenue line is about to cause us cardiac arrest."
The strain on the system worsens when the passenger load increases, a problem that could occur under a five-year capital plan being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The M.T.A. is expected to propose building a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, an idea favored by Gov. George Pataki, who also controls the current M.T.A. board. This new tunnel could overload the already overcrowded Lexington Avenue line, but instead of building an additional full line along Second Avenue on the eastern side of Manhattan, the M.T.A. board is considering a truncated Second Avenue line that would stretch only from 125th Street to 63d Street. Called "the stub" by critics, this shortened line would send trains over the N and R tracks at 63d, producing a partial solution to a longer-term need for relief along the East Side. 
 The authority, which is expected to approve a new five-year capital plan at its next board meeting in less than three weeks, should endorse the full Second Avenue line, even if it still needs to find the funds, to help balance the passenger load that will be created by Mr. Pataki's new tunnel from the suburbs. This full line would feed into financial and residential pockets of lower Manhattan, supporting new economic growth with an expanded subway system.
Both projects are expensive. At least $4 billion would be needed for the L.I.R.R. connection and up to $15 billion for the subway, which means the lobbying for Federal, state and city funds is still a crucial part of any future package. But these additions are a down payment on the city's growth. As one transit advocate said recently, New York has used up the transportation system built by its grandparents. It is time now to start constructing a route or two for the grandchildren.

Israel Gets Cheers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Deep in our hearts there is pain, said the Prime Minister of Israel. He spoke as his Cabinet voted to give the Arabs 7 percent more of what the world calls the West Bank, Arabs call Palestine and Israelis whose pain is deepest call Judea and Samaria.
 For decades, Israeli Jews have grappled with the possibility that Judea and Samaria would become a new Arab-ruled state called Palestine. 
 Many Israelis on the left and center-left felt that was the only road to peace. And since 1991, when the Labor Party created the foundation of Palestine at Oslo, many other Israelis have felt a sense of dread that they were losing the struggle against creation of Palestine, and feared that it would endanger Israel's existence.
The pain Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke of crossed party lines. But in the end it was overwhelmed by Israel's eagerness for peace, an eagerness that became the Palestinians' great asset at bargaining time.
So what has all the harsh Arab-Israeli negotiation and the Arab terrorism been about, if so many Israelis, gladly or in fear, accept the inevitability of Palestine?
Mostly it was about these quintessential problems: buffer zones, the future of Jerusalem, the armed strength of the new Palestine, Arab incitement to hatred against Israel, water resources in a dry part of the world, the return of the Palestinians who left their homes when Israel was created, and how that would change the Arab-Jewish population balance. What would the answers do to Israeli chances of existence, not for 10 or 20 years after the peace treaty, but forever?
In May Israelis elected Mr. Barak, a Laborite who has a record as a particularly brave soldier, and a man decent of mind and manner, to bring a settlement as quickly as possible. His decision to resume negotiations by turning over more land has made him cheered in a world not given to cheering Israeli leaders.
But -- still the problems and still no answers.
Nobody who does not choose to live in Israel can decide its security strategy. And I hope that American and Israeli Jews who may think that Mr. Barak is taking the wrong road -- concessions without comparable security payment in advance -- will not do to him what so many Labor people did to his conservative predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu. They tried to destroy him abroad, particularly in America, with increasingly nasty propaganda.
Palestinians, through their passion for nationhood, plus terrorism and incitement to hatred, will have won their own country -- provided they give answers to critical problems, which Israel can accept with safety. And provided there is enough time for the answers to be tested before Mr. Barak's settlement date of September 2000.
Yasir Arafat could start by doing what he promised to do publicly and in secret codicils at Wye in 1998 but somehow has not carried out. He can, for instance, dismantle all terrorist organizations politically, economically and militarily. He can live up to his promise that the Palestinian police force be reduced to the agreed 30,000, and armed like police, not a combat army.
Or the promise about not taking important action unilaterally -- like the declaration of a Palestinian state he is still threatening. And how about the pledge to give up incitement to hatred, in public statements, propaganda and in schools? Palestinian officials say they will get around to changing anti-Jewish textbooks -- but give us a break, it will take time.
Israelis' desire for peace is so strong now that they do not seem to mind that their Government did not give them a detailed report on Palestinian "compliance" with Wye before handing over that 7 percent. It raises the total of West Bank land under Palestinian control to 40 percent. The big Palestinian push for more land will come during final-settlement talks.
Ariel Sharon, now the leader of the defeated Likud Party, has some advice for Mr. Barak:
"The responsible leadership of a nation does not pay off with homeland territories, or with its security or with strategic assets in order to improve its posture among the Egyptians, the Europeans or anybody else."
I think Mr. Barak understands, and that one day he will show he does, before September 2000.

HEADLINE: 31 Are Charged With Taking Jobless Aid Despite Working

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
The Bronx District Attorney said yesterday that his office had arrested 31 people and planned to arrest 160 more on charges that they collected unemployment benefits while gainfully employed.
The District Attorney, Robert T. Johnson, and the Inspector General of the State Department of Labor, Brian Sanvidge, said at a joint news conference yesterday that the total theft was more than $900,000. 
 The fraud was uncovered by using a computer to cross-check unemployment insurance claims against the state's tax and finance records, which show who is paying taxes on wages. Legislation passed in 1996 enabled the Labor Department to see the tax and finance records, thus building a stronger case against those filing false unemployment claims.
The suspects, who began surrendering Wednesday after receiving letters from the District Attorney's office, have been charged with grand larceny in the third degree.
"Our position is that these people were motivated by greed," Mr. Johnson said. "Their actions are, in fact, criminal. The money they received, in fact, was stolen from legitimate taxpayers of this state."
The Labor Department estimates that $22 million in false claims were filed in 1998, and $13 million so far this year. Cracking down on such claims has been a priority of the Pataki administration, and in 1996 the state, in conjunction with district attorneys, began criminally prosecuting individuals who file false claims. The Department of Labor has referred 1,200 cases statewide to prosecutors, Mr. Sanvidge said.
Those arrested Wednesday include secretaries, an account executive, a nurse, a meatpacker and a trucker. The District Attorney said they unlawfully connected $14,755 by filing claims for unemployment insurance on four occasions between November 1994 and June 1997.
Most started out legitimately collecting unemployment insurance but continued getting $365 a week for the full 26-week period after they found work, prosecutors said.
Charged with a Class D felony, the defendants could each face up to seven years in prison if found guilty. Given the weight of evidence against them -- cashed checks for both unemployment insurance and wages received for the same time period, for example -- the District Attorney's office said it expected most of the defendants to plead guilty. Because most are nonviolent first offenders, it is unlikely they will go to prison; rather, they will be expected to make restitution.
"It will mean $1 million being returned to businesses in the Bronx," Mr. Sanvidge said.

HEADLINE: THE FATE OF EAST TIMOR;
In Clinton's Words: East Timor, Waco, Clemency Offer, and Other Issues

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's statement on East Timor today at the White House and questions and answers, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
Statement by Clinton
 
PRESIDENT CLINTON -- Good afternoon. Before I leave on my trip for New Zealand I wanted to say a few words about the trip and a couple of other issues. These Apex summits started in 1993, when I first invited the leaders of the Asia-Pacific region to meet in Seattle, Wash. They bring together the leaders of more than half the world's people and half its economic activity. What we do there will help to decide whether the global economy continues to move in the direction of greater openness and integration, equity and growth in the next century. 
 This year, one of my most important goals is to get a commitment on the part of all our Asian-Pacific partners to a rapid wide-ranging market opening, so that can launch a new trade round at the W.T.O. meeting in Seattle in December. We must stand together against protectionism and for a common future of prosperity. During the global financial crisis over the last two years, the fact that the United States kept its markets open, bolstered Asia and the world. It helped to keep the crisis from becoming even worse, and it certainly helped to turn it around.
All of this was good for American workers, as you can see by the continued low unemployment rate in our country. I will meet with Prime Minister Obuchi and President Kim in Auckland to have the opportunity to discuss not only economic issues, but also the difficult issues surrounding our relationships with North Korea. I will also meet with President Jung and with the new Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Putin.
We will be meeting following a difficult period in Asia. There are encouraging signs of recovery from South Korea to Thailand to Japan. There are also continuing difficulties, as all of you know, caused by everything from economic distress to neglect of human rights. Nowhere are those difficulties more pressing than in Indonesia. It is, first, the fourth largest country in the world and the largest Islamic country. It has been undergoing an important democratic transformation. It has the capacity to lift an entire region if it succeeds and to swamp its neighbors in a sea of disorder if it fails. Precisely because Indonesia's future is important, I am so deeply concerned by the failure of its military to bring a stop to gross abuses now going on in East Timor. . . .
The Indonesian Government and military are responsible for the safety of the East Timorese and of the U.N. mission there. If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite, it must invite the international community to assist in restoring security. It must allow international relief agencies to help people on the ground. It must move forward with the transition to independence.
Having allowed the vote and gotten such a clear unambiguous answer, we cannot have a reversal of course here. The overwhelming weight of international opinion from Asia to Africa to Europe to North America strongly agrees with this position. Right now, the international financial institutions are not moving forward with substantial new lending to Indonesia. My own willingness to support future assistance will depend very strongly on the way Indonesia handles this situation. Today I have also ordered the suspension of all programs of military cooperation with Indonesia, effective immediately. Our military leaders have made crystal clear to senior military officials in Indonesia what they must do to restore our confidence. . . .
 
Questions and Answers
Q Mr. President, Republicans in Congress are saying that if you veto their tax-cut package, they're not likely to send you another one. Are tax cuts dead for this year?
A Well, my bill is $250 billion, and it provides almost exactly as much aid to middle-class Americans as theirs does. Whether there is a bill, of course, is up to them. They can control what bills come up. But if they're saying, "Well, it's our way or no way," then that is evidence that this has been pretty much about politics all along. I'm all about progress. I want to get something done. . . .
Q About the F.A.L.N., the clemency's been accepted, but these prisoners say they are political prisoners. They challenged the restrictions on them. And your disagreement with the First Lady -- can you describe to us how you discussed it with her on the issue of clemency?
A Well, first of all, let me discuss this issue on the merits, so you know what happened. It came up, in what I would call the ordinary course of business, from the counsel's office. And I received a very detailed statement of the facts and the claims. I was requested by hundreds of people, including President Carter, Bishop Tutu and many other religious leaders and members of Congress, to look at this and act favorably on it. And then, obviously, there were those who disagreed.
My judgment was that these people should be offered a conditional clemency for two reasons. 1) None of them, even though they belonged to an organization which had espoused violent means, none of them were convicted of doing any bodily harm to anyone. And 2) They had all served sentences that were considerably longer than they would serve under the sentencing guidelines which control Federal sentencing now. Most of them had been in for somewhere around 19 years. They had served very long sentences for offenses that did not involve bodily harm to other people.
And because I did not believe they should be held in incarceration, in effect by guilt by association, I agreed to offer them clemency, if they would abide by the conditions of parole and specifically renounce violence. What that means is if they get out and they violate the conditions of parole, and particularly if they are engaged in any way with people who are espousing violence, that their parole will be revoked and they'll have to go back to prison. So under those circumstances, I felt then and I still feel that that was the just decision.
She didn't know anything about it until, as far as I know, until someone from her office called and asked her for a comment, because I did not discuss it with her. I haven't discussed other clemency issues with her and I didn't think I should discuss this one. So it was up to her, and entirely appropriate for her to say whatever she wanted to about it. But I did what I thought was right, and it's what I'll continue to do.
Q If your wife decides on a run for office, does she figure to be hurt by what many people perceive as a flip-flop on the issue of clemency for the Puerto Rican nationalists?
A Well, I, you know, they'll have to evaluate that as they please. You know what she said in her statement. I don't know that that's a flip-flop. I had a different position. I thought they should be given another week. If in the course of this week, if we had come to tomorrow and they hadn't taken it and I had revoked the offer, would that have been a flip-flop by me? I don't think so. But the reason I thought that they should -- the reason I felt they should be given to this week is I knew that their lawyer was actually physically going around to see all of them and would not finish until, I think, yesterday. So I thought they ought to be given that amount of time, and it's the judgment I made.
Q Mr. President, what level of military support are you prepared to provide to any peacekeeping mission? And what recourse do you have if Indonesia continues to refuse an international mission for East Timor?
A Well, the answer to the first question is we're still -- we're consulting with the Australians and with others and we're also talking to interested members of Congress about this, and no decision has been made. I want the American people to know two things. No. 1, the Australians have made it clear that they, being the nearest military authority, intend to play the largest role and provide the lion's share of the effort there, and that many other countries have already agreed to contribute.
But secondly, the United States has been, certainly since the Second World War, and indeed going back before, heavily involved in the Asia-Pacific region. The Australians and many of these other countries have been our allies in every difficulty that we have faced. And I believe that we should support them in an appropriate way. But that is something that would still have to be worked out.
Now, the second question you asked is the most difficult one. There are any number of countries that are willing to support this endeavor. There are any number of countries on the Security Council who are willing to support it, if Indonesia will ask.
The problem is we are in this interim period, where the East Timorese have voted for independence. But East Timor is still a part of Indonesia. And we are going through this transition period. The frustrating thing to me, and I don't know how many phone calls I've made the last three or four days about this, but the thing that's frustrating people all over the world is they either can't or won't stop the violence, which is leading people to leave. But they don't want to admit they can't. So they don't want to ask anybody else to come in.
And that is why I have made the statements I've made today about economic aid and military cooperation. I tried to do this with telephone calls, working with others. I have seen the frustration and the anxiety in the voice of the Portuguese Prime Minister and any other number of leaders who are passionately concerned about this area. And obviously Prime Minister Howard in Australia, Prime Minister Shipley in New Zealand and others. We are doing our best. Kofi Annan is doing his best. He sent a U.N. delegation there, and they arrived there yesterday. So this may be a question that you'll have to ask me again tomorrow and the next day and the next day, because I don't have a clear answer for you yet.
Q . . . Have you thought of economic sanctions in Indonesia?
A Well, first of all, I think today the right thing to do is to make it clear what our intentions are. And our intentions are 1) to stop military-to-military cooperation right now, until this matter gets resolved, and 2) we have sent a clear signal about what we will do on economic cooperation if it is not resolved. It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by this. But one way or the other, it will be crashed by this if they don't fix it. . . .
Q You left a big blank on what kind of response you're getting from the Indonesian Government. . . .
A The reason I left a big blank there, the reason I left a big blank there is that so far both the political and military authorities have been unwilling. They have been very clear. They do not want to ask for international assistance. Now that is subject to one of two or three interpretations. Interpretation No. 1 is they believe they can stop this madness in East Timor and they want to do and they don't want to have to admit they have to have help to do it. Two is nobody's got the authority to make a decision, because it's chaotic there. They've already had a President election and Parliamentary elections. But they haven't, because of the complex system for picking a new leader, they haven't done that. Three is that at least some elements in the country support what is happening in East Timor. . . .
Q Do you think Freeh should resign?
A I think Janet -- first of all, in terms of the merits of this and the F.B.I. I don't have anything to add to what I said last week. I think that she did the right thing in asking an outside person to review it. I think that Mr. Freeh did the right thing in supporting that. I think I've known Senator Danforth for, well, I met him when President Carter was in office, sometime during that period, so somewhere around 20 years. And I have always thought him an honorable man and an intelligent and straightforward man. The only thing that I would ask is that he conduct a thorough and honest inquiry and do it as promptly as he can, so that we can get the facts, take appropriate action and go forward. But based on what I know of him and what I have observed, I think that's a good move by the Attorney General and I certainly don't think there's any reason for her to resign. Thank you.

HEADLINE: Catfish Hunter, Who Pitched in 6 World Series for A's and Yankees, Dies at 53

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
Catfish Hunter, the Hall of Fame right-hander who helped pitch the Oakland A's and the Yankees to six pennants in the 1970's, hurled a perfect game and was part of an economic revolution in sports, died yesterday at his home at Hertford, N.C. He was 53.
He had been struggling for the last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the progressive and ultimately fatal neurological condition also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. He had also been hospitalized after falling and hitting his head on concrete steps outside his home Aug. 8. He was sent home Saturday. 
 Hunter was a premier pitcher of his era, a 6-foot, 190-pounder who did not have overpowering speed but possessed outstanding control, an assortment of superb pitches and a winner's poise.
He won 224 games in 15 major league seasons from 1965 to 1979 and won at least 21 games over five consecutive seasons, from 1971 to 1974 with Oakland and in 1975 with the Yankees. He won the Cy Young Award as the American League's top pitcher in 1974 and was an eight-time All-Star. In compiling a record of 224-166, he had an outstanding career earned run average of 3.26.
Although an unassuming ballplayer who rarely took himself seriously, Hunter was wise enough to become the first big-money free agent.
An arbitrator freed him from his contract with Charlie Finley's Athletics after the 1974 season, and the Yankees signed him to a five-year, $3.35 million contract that was the largest in baseball history at that time.
While his case did not directly lead to free agency for other players -- a ruling in an unrelated case the next year led to that -- it showed the players what they, too, might command from the baseball owners.
"He paved the way for me," said Roger Clemens, who will earn $16.1 million with the Yankees over 1999 and 2000.
 
Relying on Control, Not Simply Power
 James Augustus Hunter was born on April 8, 1946, on a farm near Hertford in Perquimans County. He said he was taught to pitch by his older brothers.
"My three brothers taught me to throw strikes," he said when inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, "and thanks to them I gave up 379 home runs in the big leagues."
Hunter was overstating things a bit, having given up 374 homers. And the control he developed by throwing baseballs at a hole in the barn door -- the last brother to hit the hole had to do the chores -- would pay off.
A Yankee teammate, pitcher Pat Dobson, once said about Hunter: "He can put the ball where he wants it -- or within an inch or two, which is just about as good. From that one capacity stems everything else."
On occasion, Hunter's family would travel to Baltimore to watch major league baseball. "I remember once we were watching Robin Roberts there," Hunter said, "and my father said, 'Hell, I could hit him; he's not throwing that hard.' We were sitting behind the plate, and Roberts really did look as though you could murder him. But nobody seemed to do it. I admired the heck out of Roberts. I just naturally patterned myself after him, and eventually I learned to do it, too."
Major league hitters would feel the same way about Hunter as Hunter's father had felt about Roberts. "I could never understand why I couldn't hit Hunter," said Ed Herrmann, an opponent who later became a teammate on the Yankees. "Even when you're up at the plate, you think, just give me one more of those and I'll clout it out of here. But I rarely did."
Hunter was known all his life as Jimmy in his home area. Finley, the A's flamboyant owner, gave him the nickname Catfish and apparently manufactured a story to go with it. "Around here, we never call him Catfish," Ray Ward, editor of The Perquimans Weekly, once said. "We call him Jimmy. Jimmy's mother has been upset about the nickname." The story created to go with the name: Hunter had once run away from home and come back with two catfish. "His mother was irritated that somebody would believe her little boy ran off," Ward said.
During Hunter's senior year at Perquimans High School in Hertford, he was wounded in his right foot when his brother Pete's shotgun misfired, destroying the little toe and leaving the foot full of pellets. The Kansas City Athletics signed him anyway, for a $50,000 bonus, and sent him to the Mayo Clinic for surgery. He spent the 1964 season on the disabled list, but the foot did not bother him after the operation even though about 15 shotgun pellets remained.
Hunter never pitched in the minor leagues, starting the 1965 season with a cellar-bound Kansas City team that had eight rookies. He had an 8-8 record that year and was 55-64 in his first five seasons, never finishing above .500. Despite his mediocre won-lost records with mostly mediocre A's teams, Hunter was named an American League All-Star in 1966 and 1967.
In 1968 Finley moved the A's to Oakland, and on May 8 of that year Hunter retired all 27 Minnesota Twins he faced, the first regular-season perfect game in the American League since 1922.
The fortunes of the A's improved dramatically after their move to Oakland, and they quickly developed into a powerhouse that won three straight World Series from 1972 to 1974. Hunter also improved, in part because of a slight modification to his pitching motion, and he became the steady center of a swaggering, squabbling club that featured larger-than-life characters like Reggie Jackson, Vida Blue and Rollie Fingers. In his last five seasons with Oakland he compiled a record of 106-49, and he was 4-0 in seven World Series appearances.
Jackson, a teammate of Hunter's with both the A's and the Yankees, would recall, "When we started winning in Oakland, Cat was the father of those teams." Hunter was only 26 when the A's won their first World Series championship.
Lou Piniella was another teammate on the Yankees. "The main thing about Cat is that statistics didn't mean much to him," Piniella said. "The only thing that mattered was victories. He didn't have overpowering stuff, but he knew how to pitch and how to beat you. If there was a game you had to win, he's the guy you wanted on the mound."
After he won the Cy Young Award in 1974 with a record of 25-12 and a league-leading 2.49 e.r.a., Hunter uncovered a violation of his contract with Finley and the A's that allowed him to become a free agent. The A's were to send half of Hunter's $100,000 annual salary to a North Carolina bank as payment on an annuity, but Finley did not comply.
 
Showing Players Their Value
 At season's end, with the guidance of the players' association, Hunter took a grievance to arbitration. He won and was declared a free agent, unfamiliar words in baseball in 1974. When he learned of the decision by telephone, Hunter hung up and, shaken, turned to his wife, Helen. "We don't belong to anybody," he told her.
"I was scared," Hunter recalled. "I didn't have a job. I didn't realize the implications."
His case was an anomaly; it was the next year before Andy Messer smith and Dave McNally would challenge baseball's reserve clause and win, establishing the players union's power and spurring a tremendous escalation in athletes' salaries. But Hunter was about to show baseball players what their services were worth on the open market.
Hunter was the most accomplished veteran player ever to become a free agent, and soon teams were clamoring for his services in an unprecedented bidding war.
Among those who sought to sign him was Gene Autry, the singing cowboy of the movies who was the owner of the California Angels. Autry was so eager that he traveled across the country to meet Hunter in Ahoskie, N.C., 60 miles from Hertford.
"Gene Autry came down here handing out records of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' " Hunter once recalled. "That was the biggest thing that ever came to Ahoskie."
Twenty-three of the 24 teams in the major leagues -- all but the San Francisco Giants -- bid for Hunter's services. George Steinbrenner's $3.35 million offer to pitch for the Yankees for five years, which included a $1 million signing bonus and various insurance policies and annuities, was the most appealing, and the Yankees announced the signing of Hunter on New Year's Eve 1974.
The $150,000 annual salary Hunter received from the Yankees did not even rank among the top 10 in baseball -- Dick Allen of the Chicago White Sox had received $250,000 in 1974. But the total package was the largest in baseball's history, and it made Hunter, at age 28, one of the three or four highest-paid American athletes at a time when rival leagues in hockey and football had already begun to drive up salaries.
But it was not just the money that brought Hunter to New York. "We'd had better offers, but New York was closer to home and they played on regular grass," he said. Coming to the Yankees also meant rejoining Clyde Kluttz, the scout who had signed Hunter to his first contract with Kansas City.
Hunter again led the league in victories in his first season with the Yankees, winning 23 games. He was 17-15 the following season, when the team won its first pennant in 12 years, and he compiled records of 9-9 and 12-6 for the Yankees' World Series winning teams of 1977 and 1978, despite spending time on the disabled list during both seasons.
He was a humorous and a stabilizing force in the clubhouse for the Yankees, as he had been for the A's. While his jokes to teammates could be pointed, they were usually taken well. When Jackson had a candy bar named for him, Hunter said, "When you unwrap one, it tells you how good it is."
When Hunter was elected to the Hall of Fame, Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, said: "You started our success. You were the first to teach us how to win. Other Yankees continued that leadership role, but you were the one who first showed us what it means to be a winner."
 
Home on the Farm, Out of the Limelight
 Hunter retired from baseball at age 33 when his contract expired after the 1979 season, having suffered problems with his pitching arm. But he found it no hardship to leave the limelight and return to his roots. Shortly after he joined the Yankees he had said: "I don't like New York much, either. I had to live in a hotel downtown for a couple of months until my wife got here. Hated it. Now I got this nice home in Norwood, N.J., and I just drive straight from there to the ball park. Never go downtown. Nothing for me to do down there."
Hunter and his wife, Helen, his high school sweetheart, lived in the same house outside tiny Hertford for more than 20 years. But their 100 acres had increased to 1,000. He was a full-time farmer in his corn, soybean and peanut fields for 10 years after he retired from baseball, and then he turned it over to a friend who leased the land.
He was an avid fisherman and hunter, keeping a kennel of deer hounds and bird dogs and shooting quail, pheasant, rabbit and deer in the winter.
The financial package from the Yankees in 1974 included $25,000 payments for annuities for college tuition for his two children, Todd, then 5, and Kimberly, 2. His son Paul was born five years later. "I forgot I might have one more after baseball," Hunter said. "I have to pay for him myself."
In addition to his wife and three children, Hunter is survived by three brothers, three sisters and a grandson.
Hunter was a fierce competitor, but he kept his perspective and his unruffled disposition, understanding that baseball was just a game. "Golf's the only thing that makes me mad," he once said, with a smile.
Hunter entered a hospital in Baltimore last September after experiencing difficulties with motor skills, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was diagnosed. He did not appear in public outside his hometown again until March, when he attended the Yankees' first spring training game in Tampa, Fla. He joked with reporters but had difficulty shaking hands.
"I've got no strength in my arms and my hands," he said last fall. "I can't do the routine things like button a shirt anymore."
Helen Hunter helped him with cutting his food and tying his shoes. "I'm putting a lot of work on her and she's strong," Catfish Hunter said. "But once in a while we sit here and cry together."
For many of his friends and family and teammates, Hunter's charm was memorable. After he lost a game with the Yankees in the 1977 World Series, for example, he was unhappy but not distraught. He understood that there are good days and bad.
"The sun," he said, "don't shine on the same dog all the time."

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Details World's Religious Persecution

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
While the number of freely elected governments continues to grow throughout the world, there are still many countries in which people face harassment, imprisonment or even death for practicing their religions, a State Department report said today.
The department's first annual Report on International Religious Freedom cited Afghanistan, China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Sudan as among the most repressive countries. The report, filling more than 1,000 pages, covers 194 countries. 
 "There's something very important that we cannot afford to lose in the pages of such a large report," said Robert Seiple, the department's ambassador at large for international religious freedom, speaking at a news briefing. "It is the fate of millions of people throughout the world who are suffering because of their religious faith."
The persecution cited today has been widely reported before, though perhaps not in such detail. But the document is significant in that it is the first such annual report required under the International Religious Freedom Act, passed by Congress last fall.
The report is meant to guide the Federal Government in shaping policy toward other countries. The worst offenders on religious freedom, those that engage in systematic and egregious violations like torture or imprisonment, may be subject to severe economic sanctions.
The findings detailed today by Mr. Seiple include persecution and killings by Afghanistan's Taliban movement; China's continuing intolerance of unregistered religious activity and punishment by imprisonment and labor camps; Cuba's scrutiny and harassment of many religious activities, its national constitution notwithstanding; Saudi Arabia's detention of members of a minority Islamic branch, and Sudanese persecution of Christians and Muslims in connection with a civil war.
President Clinton, who left today for the Asian economic summit meeting in New Zealand, said he would study the report on the way.
The report was largely based on research by American Government employees around the world.
Tacitly recognizing that the criticism is not enough in itself to change the behavior of foreign governments, Mr. Seiple said the report would nonetheless "signal unambiguously to persecutor and persecuted alike that they will not be forgotten."
Mr. Seiple said that American efforts to effect change in other countries can begin with constructive, diplomatic criticism.
"Suffering has a face," Mr. Seiple said. In his office, he said, is "a lovely watercolor painting of a house and a garden," done by a young Lebanese woman named Mary, who fled her village as it was being overrun by militiamen. One caught her and demanded that she repudiate her faith. She refused.
"The bullet that was fired went in just to the left of her chin and severed her spinal cord," Mr. Seiple said. Now, she paints with a brush braced in her right hand.
"Throughout the world there are many Marys," he said.

HEADLINE: Tiny Treasures Stolen, Shells and All, at Zoo

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Soon after the police first got the call yesterday that two extremely rare, extremely small tortoises had been stolen from the Bronx Zoo, the hypotheses began. Were they taken so they could be ground up and used as aphrodisiacs? Or as ingredients in some exquisite soup? More than one police official even suggested that a vengeful hare might be suspect.
But the leading theory is that the tiny reptiles -- which, as members of an endangered species, are no longer allowed to be sold on the open market -- were taken either by collectors who covet them as pets or by the rogue traders who supply the growing black market in forbidden wildlife. 
 The two Egyptian tortoises were reported stolen yesterday after a zoo keeper on his morning rounds in the Reptile House noticed that the glass had been removed from their case, the police said. The tortoises were last seen on Wednesday afternoon, when the zoo was packed with people on its weekly free day.
Egyptian tortoises, which are found in the deserts of Egypt, Libya and Israel, are among the world's smallest, growing to a length of only four inches. Their size had long made them popular pets until 1995, when an international treaty organization found that the tortoises faced an immediate threat of extinction and banned all commercial traffic in them.
But the ban on legal sales has not stopped the illicit trade.
"They have become the bonsai tortoise and turtle species, coveted by apartment dwellers and collectors," said John Behler, the zoo's reptile curator.
In response to the Egyptian tortoise crisis -- their estimated worldwide population has dwindled to below 5,000 -- Mr. Behler and his colleagues at the zoo started a breeding program in 1995 to try to hatch them in captivity. The tortoises that were stolen yesterday were the first to be hatched in the program back in 1996. Only a few have been hatched since.
The theft of the tortoises was not the first from the Bronx Zoo, officials said. In September 1998, after another species of tortoise was stolen, the zoo upgraded its alarm system. But this time, the thieves bypassed the alarm by removing the glass instead of breaking it.
The black market in illegal reptiles is thriving, experts said.
Craig Hoover, the senior program director of Traffic North America, a branch of the World Wildlife Fund, said: "There's no way to put a number on the illegal wildlife trade, but I would say that it's measured in the billions of dollars."
Mr. Hoover said that recent advertisements for illicit Egyptian tortoises listed prices from $250 to $350.
The legal reptile industry has also soared in recent years. The United States imported 1.8 million live reptiles in 1997, worth some $7 million, and exported 9.7 million valued at $13.2 million, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. (The most common import was the green iguana; the most common export was the red-eared slider turtle.)
The illegal reptile trade is believed to be even more lucrative. The Komodo dragon, a 10-foot lizard, can sell on the black market for $30,000. The Chinese alligator, which lives only along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, fetches $15,000. Forbidden tortoises are also popular: 70 plowshare tortoises were stolen from a breeding program in Madagascar several years ago, setting off a worldwide search.
To fight the rogue reptile trade, the Fish and Wildlife Service ran a five-year undercover operation, called "Operation Chameleon," in which agents posed as buyers. In 1998, its agents went to Mexico City and arrested Keng Ling Wong of Malaysia, who is known as Anson, whom they called "the kingpin of an international smuggling operation that plundered reptiles from Asia, New Zealand and Madagascar."
And in April, a Florida reptile dealer, Tommy Edward Crutchfield, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role in a ring that smuggled rare reptiles from Madagascar.
Whether the Bronx Zoo theft was the work of an organized ring or a determined teen-ager remains to be seen. Mr. Behler, the curator, just wants the little tortoises back.
Breeding them is no easy task. They need a special diet, with just enough protein, the right quality of light and low humidity, and an environment that simulates the desert, with high temperatures in the day and low ones at night.
And Mr. Behler said that unlike snapping turtles, which can lay 50 eggs at a time, Egyptian tortoises lay only one egg at a time. "They are not very fecund," he said.
He gave the following description of the missing tortoises: they are males, tan with black along the plates of their backs, and they are three inches long. Their hind legs are shaped like an elephant's; their front legs are shovel-like. They do not have names. Anyone who has seen them is urged to call (800) 577-TIPS.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ASSERTS JAKARTA MUST ACT OR ADMIT TROOPS

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton demanded today that Indonesia permit an international peacekeeping force to try to restore order in East Timor if the Indonesian military is unable to end "this madness" -- the wave of violence that has taken hundreds of lives across the tiny province since it voted for independence last week.
"If Indonesia does not end the violence, it must invite, it must invite the international community to assist in restoring security," the President said at the White House as he prepared to leave for the Asia-Pacific economic summit meeting in New Zealand. 
 But the President did not threaten an immediate cutoff of economic assistance to Indonesia, as some lawmakers and human rights groups had wanted. Nor did he cut off commercial arms sales to Indonesia, which are expected to total about $16 million over the next year.
Instead, he said that he had ordered the Pentagon to suspend its few formal contacts with the Indonesia military, and that he would consider economic sanctions if the killings in East Timor did not stop. "My own willingness to support future assistance will depend very strongly on the way Indonesia handles this situation," he said. Excerpts, page A12.
He said the United States was prepared to assist Australia in its efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for East Timor, an idea Indonesia has rejected. Mr. Clinton made clear that no decision had been made on the extent of American involvement in the mission. The Pentagon has said there are no plans to deploy American ground troops.
The Administration has faced a difficult calculation in deciding how to react to the bloodletting that began after the independence referendum in East Timor. Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed by anti-independence militias backed by elements of the military.
More Roman Catholic priests and nuns became targets in East Timor today in what the Vatican interpreted as a campaign against the church. At the same time, the United Nations sharply reduced the size of its staff in Dili, the capital of East Timor. Page A12.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that the United States was unclear on how decisions were being made in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, about how to deal with the killings in East Timor. He said it was possible that "nobody's got the authority" among Indonesia's military or civilian leaders to quell the violence.
While strongly protesting the violence, the United States wants to preserve a relationship with the civilian Government of President B. J. Habibie, which has been responsible for democratic reforms in Indonesia, an archipelago nation of more than 200 million people. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony of about 800,000 people, was invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
Mr. Clinton touched on the larger policy dilemma when, at the beginning of his remarks on East Timor, he saluted Indonesia for its "important democratic transformation," adding, "It has the capacity to lift an entire region if it succeeds and to swamp its neighbors in a sea of disorder if it fails."
He noted that Indonesia's economy, which was ravaged by the Asian economic crisis, has begun to rebound in recent months, largely as a result of billions of dollars in American-backed emergency aid through the International Monetary Fund.
"It would be a pity if the Indonesian recovery were crashed by this," he said of the crisis in East Timor. "But one way or the other, it will be crashed by this if they don't fix it, because there will be overwhelming public sentiment to stop the international economic cooperation.
"Precisely because Indonesia's future is important, I am so deeply concerned by the failure of its military to bring a stop to gross abuses now going on in East Timor."
The I.M.F. had already suspended all emergency aid to Indonesia, even before the crisis in East Timor, because of concerns over possible misuse of funds previously sent to Indonesia. And because of the current violence, an observation team from the I.M.F. that was to have gone to Indonesia this month has postponed its trip.
"We believe that, in effect, any future assistance from international financial institutions is effectively cut off as of now," Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, said today in Congressional testimony. "There will not be any more forthcoming."
The suspension of military cooperation between the United States and Indonesia is little more than symbolic, since military ties between the two countries have been sharply limited by Congress in recent years because of human rights abuses attributed to the Indonesian armed forces.
The United States ended military exercises with Indonesia last year. As a result of today's action, the United States will freeze a $470,000-a-year military training program between the two countries and a handful of officer exchange programs.
Informal contacts between the two nations will continue. Clinton Administration officials said the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, intended to remain in contact with his Indonesian counterpart, Gen. Wiranto, who is considered the key figure in the crisis.
In an appearance before Congress on his nomination for a second two-year term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shelton said he spoke with General Wiranto by phone on Monday and "laid out for him in no uncertain terms what I thought we needed to see from Indonesia, and specifically from him."
But while he said the United States was alarmed by the violence that has overwhelmed East Timor, General Shelton stressed that American national security interests were not on the line in the tiny territory.
"Certainly if you look at East Timor by itself, I cannot see any national interest there that would be overwhelming -- would call for us to deploy or place U.S. forces on the ground in that area," he said.
The general instead described the crisis in East Timor as a "moral issue" that "very clearly challenges our role as a leader with other nations in that region of the world."

HEADLINE: Black Baptists Hear Forbes But Are Mixed On His Views

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Sept. 9

 BODY:
Steve Forbes brought a message of conservative economic, social and political values to the nation's largest African-American Baptist organization, and the reaction was decidedly mixed.
After rousing gospel music and inspirational preaching, the Republican Presidential hopeful took to the podium and, in more subdued and methodical tones, laid out his case for lower taxes, school vouchers and changes in Social Security. And he told the tale -- meant as an inspirational message -- of how his grandfather came to America as a penniless immigrant and became a millionaire many times over through hard work. 
 But the story was less well received than other parts of his talk.
The Rev. Earl Jones, pastor of the First Calvary Church in Brooklyn, said: "My grandfather has been here since 1850. We are not billionaires. We're still working. It's not a question of hard work, but opportunity."
The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr., pastor of the Salem Baptist Church in Atlanta, added: "It's like he was trying to identify with the issues of the struggle. But I wasn't impressed. He wants to make us feel that we could all be millionaires and that's not the real world."
Mr. Forbes's speech was a sidelight to a larger four-day convention here of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., which today elected the Rev. William Shaw as president. Mr. Shaw, of Philadelphia, replaces the Rev. Henry Lyons, who earlier this year was convicted on charges of racketeering and grand theft.
More than 12,000 members of the convention heard Mr. Forbes's speech today. For Mr. Forbes, the event was high in publicity value and an effort to show that a conservative Republican could relate to a black and largely Democratic audience that has provided a forum for nearly every Presidential candidate since Dwight D. Eisenhower.
"This is a major event," Randy Tate, president of the Christian Coalition, said in an interview. "What Steve recognizes is that conservatives can reach out and expand their base without betraying their core principles."
The Rev. William Snorgrass, pastor of the Progressive Baptist Church of Kansas City, Mo., noted that the group has historically heard more from Democratic politicians than Republicans.
"It seems that Republicans are not interested in us," Mr. Snorgrass said. "We've extended invitations to both. Sometimes we feel the Democrats take us for granted, but at least they show up. And we'd like to hear from both."
Mr. Forbes, who inherited the magazine publishing concern Forbes Inc. from his father, Malcolm Forbes, came to the convention to try to build a more broad-based coalition across ideological boundaries, said his traveling press secretary, K. B. Forbes, who is no relation.
But others questioned whether appearances such as this one would help Mr. Forbes at his next political hurdle -- making a good showing in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, where his target audience is Republican and largely white. "This is not a vote-rich environment for Forbes," said a Republican analyst.
In his speech, Mr. Forbes, an Episcopalian, equated education with civil rights, saying, "A good education is a civil right and a passport to economic freedom."
In arguing in favor of school vouchers -- which would provide aid to allow parents to send their children to private schools -- Mr. Forbes said: "No mother in America should be forced to send her child to a lousy school.
"Today we find big government politicians standing in the schoolhouse door to keep children trapped in dangerous and failing schools."
He also restated several of his campaign themes: allowing younger workers to have private retirement accounts instead of the traditional Social Security benefits and reducing taxes across the board.
These views garnered a mixed response. The Rev. Henry Holmes, pastor of the Higher Dimensions Baptist Church in Vero, Fla., a lifelong Democrat, has invited Mr. Forbes to visit his region. "It appeals to me when he talks about economic empowerment for minorities," Mr. Holmes said. "Over the last six years, the wealthy have gotten wealthier and the gap has spread."
And the Rev. John D. Kelly, pastor of Elyton Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit, favored school vouchers as a way to pressure public schools to improve.
Others had their doubts. Mr. Williams of Atlanta felt that inner-city schools should be improved over all but that school vouchers would hamper that effort.
On the subject of tax cuts, Mr. Jones of Brooklyn questioned whether big tax cuts would lead to cuts in Government programs.
"Someone's got to pay the bills." he said.

6 Decades of an Unconventional Legal Life

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
LAST week, a Buffalo man on whose behalf Eleanor Jackson Piel had pestered the courts for 10 years was released from prison, after DNA tests proved he wasn't a rapist. Later this month, she is going to Mississippi for a death row inmate. The date coincides with her 79th birthday.
"I think he's innocent," Ms. Piel, wearing pearls and a pleated silk blouse, said brightly. "I don't know how we'll do it, but we'll find a way." 
 Ms. Piel and Conventional Wisdom have yet to be properly introduced. In the 1950's, the decade of the suburban housewife, she practiced law and remained stubbornly single until she was nearly 35; after she married, she continued her practice, while raising a daughter named Eleanor Jackson Piel Jr.
As a lawyer, she is also an anomaly. In the 1960's she won a civil rights case in the Supreme Court and later not only got a client released from Florida's death row but also successfully sued the state for wrongful imprisonment. Yet she is not regarded as a left-wing advocate.
Rather, Ms. Piel is a solo practitioner whose patchwork caseload has included the Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, a Vassar professor, murder trials, discrimination claims and patent lawsuits. Plus volunteer cases, a description she eschews because, she said: "I always expect to get paid. I just never do."
And though litigators specialize in trials, appellate lawyers in appeals, Ms. Piel, the courts' most elegant pain in the neck, does the whole shebang, while conducting her own legal research and typing her own briefs.
Penury? Pride is more like it, for she lives on Fifth Avenue and attends a full season of society benefits for the boards on which she and her husband, Gerard, the 84-year-old scion of the Piels beer family and former publisher and editor of Scientific American magazine, serve.
"I have the best stories at dinner parties!" Ms. Piel said. That fact is not in dispute, counselor.
For to spend a long afternoon in her modest midtown office is to hear decades' worth of tales that are, by turns, moving, long-winded, funny, enraging and, in total, extraordinary:
She grew up in California, the smart, restless Depression-era daughter of a concert pianist and a Santa Monica doctor. "He's the only person who bought a lot of property in Southern California who had deficiency judgments against him," Ms. Piel said fondly.
There is Ms. Piel at 25: it's Tokyo, 1945, and she's a Berkeley-trained lawyer prosecuting war crimes, and then an adviser to a committee whose mission, she said, was to distribute food and get the Japanese economy on its feet. "And by gum, we did!"
She then sets up practice in Los Angeles, reveling in representing the elderly and doing criminal trials.
"Criminal law was such a low level in the profession that anyone who gave it time was a sport," she said. "I couldn't understand why it was so disrespected. To me, facing the unknown and coming up with something on my feet that worked was heaven."
OF course she endures slights. "I was at a party and the host introduced me as the best woman lawyer in Los Angeles," the diminutive Ms. Piel said. "So I hit him."
She rents office space from the lawyers representing the Hollywood 10. Almost nightly at 6, the bottles come out and partyers drop by. One is a New Yorker, Mr. Piel, who is reviving the moribund Scientific American. They correspond for two years. On their wedding day, a judge throws out murder charges against her clients. So her nuptials are announced not on the society pages but in the news section: "Three Youths Freed and Lawyer Wed."
"My mother was mortified," Ms. Piel said.
Move to New York. There's the client charged as an anarchist for inciting riots in Harlem. ("I refused the fee," she said.) Summer 1964: "I decided they needed me," she said airily, "so my husband and I went to Mississippi." A white teacher has been refused service at a Hattiesburg lunch counter because she is with black students, and she is locked up. Ms. Piel gets her out and snips, snaps and nags until the Supreme Court allows her to sue a private institution for deprivation of constitutional rights.
"I am persistent," Ms. Piel said, "and I like to challenge authority. No question about it."
Now the 1980's. Ms. Piel reads a newspaper story about how death row inmates need lawyers. Her desk unusually clean -- a trip with her husband has just been canceled -- she picks up the phone.
Hours before her new Florida client is to die, a judge stays the execution, complaining that Ms. Piel has filed too much paperwork to be read promptly. Years later, the client will be freed. Ms. Piel leads a New York City bar committee that arm-twists nearly 300 big-firm lawyers into taking on death penalty cases.
Perhaps no one dares suggest that slowing down, visiting grandchildren -- Eleanor Jackson Piel Jr. set aside her medical career and is pregnant with her eighth child -- is now permissible. Ebullient and tireless, Ms. Piel arrives home to cook dinner by 7:30 P.M. and is at the office by 9 A.M.
This morning she was late, having driven from her Connecticut weekend home. "I took a swim in the buff," she said. "It was so beautiful. You couldn't tell where the lake ended and the sky started!"

CORRECTION-DATE: September 15, 1999, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A Public Lives profile on Friday about Eleanor Jackson Piel, a 79-year-old litigator who worked for 10 years to overturn a 1983 rape conviction for a client, misstated the former title of her husband, Gerard Piel, at Scientific American. He was publisher and chairman of the board of editors, not the editor.

HEADLINE: Auto Workers Try to Wring DaimlerChryslerConcessions

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is demanding that DaimlerChrysler A.G. make it easier for the union to organize workers at its plants as a condition of leading industry contract talks, U.A.W. officials said.
Mr. Yokich spent the last two days pressing DaimlerChrysler to go beyond a simple promise to remain neutral in U.A.W. campaigns, the officials said. The union is seeking access to employee lists and to factory floors, pledges that plants will not be shut down if the union wins and simpler election procedures. 
 Contracts for 370,000 workers at DaimlerChrysler, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company expire on Tuesday. Companies vie to be the first to craft a U.A.W. contract so they can tailor industrywide patterns to their needs. Mr. Yokich threatened yesterday to work first with G.M. but returned today to DaimlerChrysler, so the officials considered it still in the lead.
The auto maker, based in Stuttgart, Germany, "is trying to create a foundation for good relations with the U.A.W.," said Harley Shaiken, a University of California labor analyst.
"If they take a hard line now," he said, "it will take years to undo it."
Neither Mr. Yokich nor David Barnas, a spokesman for the auto maker, would comment.
For months, the U.A.W. has been pushing DaimlerChrysler to become more union-friendly at an Alabama Mercedes-Benz factory with 1,700 nonunion workers and at a North Carolina Freightliner Corporation plant that employs 1,600.
One way would be to recognize the union if 50 percent of the workers signed cards supporting it, rather than tougher-to-win secret ballot elections. DaimlerChrysler has said that doing so would violate its pledge to remain neutral.
While neither side expects a strike, talks about neutrality are taking unusual twists. The union officials said Mr. Yokich complained yesterday that Thomas Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler's American unit, became a director of the Kmart Corporation this week. The U.A.W. recently lost a hard-fought organizing drive at Kmart's distribution warehouses.
The union, which saw an increase in membership to 846,400 last year, has made gains this year at several auto-parts makers, although unions still represent fewer than a quarter of the 650,000 American auto-parts workers, down from about half in 1976. A renewed organizing surge could make it harder for suppliers like Magna International Inc. and Borg-Warner Automotive Inc. to remain mostly union-free, analysts said. Also, G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler might find it more difficult to win price cuts on parts.
Sean McAlinden, a University of Michigan labor analyst, said union auto-parts workers now average $13 an hour, compared with $10 an hour for nonunion workers.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Stable Prices and Firm Dollar Push Treasury Prices Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday after a report on producer prices pointed to tame inflation and the dollar climbed.
The benchmark 30-year bond posted its biggest gain of the week, climbing 2 2/32 to 101 7/32. Yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell to 6.04 percent, the lowest in two weeks, from 6.09 percent on Thursday. 
 "Inflationary pressures aren't that great," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at the BankBoston Corporation, with about $25 billion under management. He said he expected 30-year bond yields to fall as low as 5.5 percent by the end of the year.
For an investor buying bonds now, that would produce a return of 9.4 percent; in contrast, for the year so far, bonds have handed investors losses of 8.9 percent including price declines and interest.
Treasury bond prices gained after the Labor Department said prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers had fallen two-tenths of a percent, excluding volatile food and energy costs, after showing no change in July. The department's overall index rose five-tenths of a percent in the month, mostly reflecting higher energy prices.
"The numbers away from energy look pretty good," said Robert Auwaerter, who is standing pat on Treasury bonds and buying corporate bonds for the $70 billion he oversees at the Vanguard Group of funds. Tame inflation means bonds hold more of their value.
Bonds also got a lift from a climbing dollar, which rose from a three-year low of 107.55 against the yen after Japan sold its currency earlier yesterday, and climbed against the euro. Expectations for further gains in the dollar help American assets, because overseas investors would stand to gain more when they convert proceeds into home currencies.
Not everyone is sanguine. David Brownlee, head of fixed-income investing at Sentinel Advisors in Montpelier, Vt., with some $11 billion, predicted that 30-year yields could rise to as high as 6.45 percent in the months ahead. He has been favoring short-term corporate debt, which offers higher yields than Treasury bonds with comparable maturities. Among recent purchases, he bought some of the $1.5 billion in bonds sold earlier this week by Safeway Inc., the grocery chain.
Many investors still predict the Fed will raise rates at least once before the end of the year. That is evident in Federal funds futures contracts, which signal where investors expect the Fed funds rate to be in the weeks and months ahead.
The implied yield on the contract for December delivery was unchanged at 5.40 percent -- 15 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above the current Fed funds target, and a sign that more investors expect a rate increase by the time the contract expires.
Scott Grannis, who helps manage $50 billion at Western Asset Management in Pasadena, Calif., said the market's woes so far this year reflected concerns about the Fed more than major concerns about inflation. That can be seen in the fact that Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, which offer protection from quickening inflation, have actually fallen in recent months.
The current 10-year inflation-indexed note yields 4.03 percent, near the high of 4.05 percent reached earlier this month and about a quarter-point higher than when the securities were sold in January.
At a yield of 5.89 percent, 10-year Government notes yield 4.08 percentage points more than the 1.81 percent yield on the most current 10-year Japanese bond and 85 basis points more than the 5.04 percent yield on 10-year German bonds.

HEADLINE: China and Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Sept. 9 Business Day article cites a study by the Institute for International Economics that claims the American textile and apparel industries would not be hurt if China joined the World Trade Organization. However, a recent report by the International Trade Commission found that China's increased exports would come at the expense of foreign suppliers, including United States apparel producers and workers. 
 Also, an increase in foreign investment in China could mean more technology transfers useful to China's military-industrial complex, and a higher trade surplus would make it easier for China to buy weapons. Meanwhile, the diversion of trade from the Pacific Rim to China would shift the balance of power in the region against the interests of the United States and its allies.

HEADLINE: Tough Times in the Copper Pits;
Excess Capacity and Sagging Prices Force Retrenchment

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF

DATELINE: SAN MANUEL, Ariz.

 BODY:
Thousands of feet below the scrub and cactus near this copper town is an unusual silence. The din of pneumatic hammers, conveyer belts and blasting that was music to the ears for many miners here in the Sonoran Desert has mostly subsided.
The San Manuel mine, among the largest underground copper mines in the nation, has been closed. So too has the nearby smelter that in better times sent wisps of smoke from giant chimneys visible for miles along the San Pedro River valley. 
 A decline in copper prices has led to significant cutbacks in the industry around the world. It has hit particularly hard in the United States, where many of the mines are more played out and more costly to operate than are those abroad. Over the last few months, a string of major copper producers has announced layoffs, reductions and closures.
The sagging market has also prompted a wave of merger proposals that could significantly transform the industry. A plan announced last month by the Phelps Dodge Corporation of Phoenix to consolidate with two other companies -- Asarco Inc., based in New York, and the Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, based in Englewood, Colo. -- would create the largest copper producer in the world. Similar slumps in other commodities, including aluminum and paper, are forcing producers in a variety of basic industries in join together to eliminate over-capacity in the face of the decline in prices. But none has been hit harder than copper.
"Copper has supported families for generations here in the Southwest," said Dennis Duffy, a laid-off miner in San Manuel who is training for a new career in installing computer networks and, to help cope financially, has canceled satellite television service at his home. "It's sad. I hate to see jobs like mine dry up."
The slump began in 1997 with the financial panic and economic downturn in Asia, a major market for copper and copper intensive products like electrical wires, automobiles and pipes. A series of new mine openings in South America flooded the market with copper and depressed prices even further.
In two years, the price of copper has tumbled nearly 50 percent from $1.20 a pound, hitting bottom in May at 61 cents a pound, the lowest in 12 years. The price has since increased to an average of 80 cents a pound, but that is not enough to make copper producers in the United States reverse their retrenchments.
"Copper had a fairly significant run through most of the 1990's," said Chuck Shipley, president of the Arizona Mining Association. "But it really dropped over the edge in the last six months or so."
The town most affected by the decline in copper prices is San Manuel, a company town of 4,000 carved out of thorny wilderness, about 30 miles northeast of Tucson. With nearly every job and business here tied in some way to mining, its future is uncertain.
In June, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the worldwide mining concern based in Melbourne, Australia, announced it would close the mine and smelter here indefinitely, putting nearly 2,200 people out of work. An additional 400 employees were laid off elsewhere in Arizona and Nevada, representing the company's nearly total withdrawal from the American copper industry.
While there are plenty of jobs elsewhere, many ex-miners are reluctant to pull up stakes. As a result, many have had to take jobs around here that pay far less than the $40,000 a year or more many made in the copper industry. Among them are Joseph Coubb, a miner for 12 years at San Manuel, who spoke recently while taking a break from truck-driving lessons in a dirt lot near a high school.
"At least I'll have a job," said Mr. Coubb, though he complained that trucking, unlike mining, would take him away from his family for days at a time.
Jay Rhodes, a spokesman for Broken Hill, said the company was forced to stop most production in the United States because it was unprofitable at such low prices. Closing mines and laying off workers, while unfortunate, he said, was hardly unusual in the industry.
"Copper is a cyclical business," Mr. Rhodes said. "It's been one where when the price increases, the players holding low-grade deposits open them for production. When the cycle is down, they have to put them on hold."
Two other producers with mines in Arizona, where much of the copper in the United States is found, have also announced reductions in their work forces. Asarco laid off 150 miners near Green Valley, south of Tucson, and Phelps Dodge dismissed 1,650 employees at mines and factories worldwide.
The problems in the industry come as copper use is growing, though not enough recently to offset new production. World copper consumption has increased in 11 of the last 13 years, according to the International Copper Study Group, with the proliferation of cars, electrical appliances, computers, telephone lines and new homes.
Low copper prices have resulted in losses for producers like Asarco and Phelps Dodge the last few quarters. But most analysts say that such losses are not especially significant as long as prices do not decline further over an extended period.
Indeed, by reducing production, some companies say they have put a stop to the losses. Thomas Foster, vice president and treasurer of Phelps Dodge, said his company was "breaking even or doing a little better" now that it had trimmed money-losing production.
Over the last decade, many copper producers have tried to increase efficiency by implementing new, cheaper mining and smelting techniques that require fewer workers. They have also tried to cut costs with mergers.
In July, Asarco and Cyprus Amax announced that they intended to join forces. No money would have been exchanged in the merger. But then, on Aug. 20, Phelps Dodge offered to buy Asarco and Cyprus Amax for $2.56 billion. Federal securities regulators recently approved Phelps Dodge's plan to issue stock in the transaction.
If that deal were approved by Asarco and Cyprus Amax shareholders, Phelps Dodge would replace Codelco, the Government-owned mining company of Chile, as the world's largest copper producer.
 On Sept. 9, though, Asarco and Cyprus Amax rejected the Phelps offer as "inadequate and not in the best interest of their shareholders." They urged shareholders instead to approve the merger of their two companies at a meeting scheduled for Sept. 30. In the meantime, Phelps continues to lobby shareholders in favor of its plan.
"The stronger players see the market when it is down as a time to buy," said John Dobra, professor of economics and director of the Natural Resource Industry Institute at the University of Nevada at Reno, "The weaker companies run for cover."
Though many North American mine operators have suffered in recent months, those overseas have remained relatively prosperous. Mines in Chile, Argentina, Peru and Indonesia, where much of the growth in the industry is taking place, have the advantage of higher quality ore, less stringent environmental regulations and lower labor costs.
For example, it can cost nearly 65 cents to produce a pound of copper in the United States, compared with 50 cents a pound in South America.
To stay competitive, many producers are increasingly opening their own mines overseas or forming partnerships with local companies that are already there.
But Professor Dobra said the industry would almost certainly maintain a significant presence in the United States, at least for the next few decades. The cost of quickly transferring production overseas would be too exorbitant, he said.
Opening a mine costs hundreds of millions of dollars, no matter where it is. Closing an existing mine in the United States costs millions more and carries the potential for additional costs to cover liabilities for environmental contamination.
"There is always the hope that the price of copper will rise and these mines will be profitable again," Professor Dobra said.
Kurt Billick, an analyst in San Francisco who follows the metals industry for the investment firm Warburg Dillon Read, predicted that the price of copper would increase modestly within the next year. With improvements in the Asian economies and the round of new mine openings in South America nearly over, the industry has survived the worst, he said. "But copper," he added emphatically, "is going nowhere near the bull market levels."

HEADLINE: Russian Promises Help From Police

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Saturday, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said here on Friday that a team of Russian law enforcement officials would arrive in Washington next week, in an effort to prove Moscow's eagerness to cooperate with American inquiries into money laundering.
Mr. Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met for two hours at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-Operation forum Friday night, and Russian corruption and its effect on the international financial system were high on the agenda, an aide to Ms. Albright said. 
 Mr. Ivanov called her last week offering to send the Russian law enforcement officials, saying at the time that the idea came from Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.
American law enforcement officials have said that at least $4.2 billion passed through accounts at the Bank of New York between early 1998 and March 1999, and that as much as $10 billion may have moved through these accounts in the last 18 months. Investigators believe the money was tied to organized crime and corporate embezzlement in Russia.

Tokyo Slows Yen's Rally, at Least for Now

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Japanese Government sold yen for dollars in the foreign exchange market yesterday in an effort to slow the rise in the value of the yen, which had jumped 2.8 percent on Thursday.
The intervention stopped the yen rally for the moment. Late in the day, the yen was valued at 108.81 to the dollar, off from 107.78 on Thursday. But analysts expect the yen's rise to resume because the economic outlook for Japan has improved. 
 Statements from Japanese officials indicated that the Government was not trying to reverse the yen's course with the latest intervention, although reversing course was indeed the goal of a series of six interventions in June and July.
Instead, the officials indicated that they just wanted to slow the yen's rise because a move that was too rapid could be destabilizing in an economy that is still fragile, even if it is finally turning around. A much stronger yen would make Japanese exports harder to sell abroad and could dampen this key sector of the economy.
"The intervention today was an operation meant to smooth the move in the yen instead of changing direction," said James McCormick, currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. Japanese officials, he added, "are happy enough to stand by and let the fundamentals drive the yen as long as it is orderly."
Although the dollar rose against the yen yesterday, it has been in a steady decline against the yen recently. Analysts, however, contend that the weakness of the dollar against the yen does not signal a broader problem for the dollar -- yesterday it rallied sharply against the euro.
At the same time, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers reiterated the Clinton Administration's support of a strong dollar. According to a Reuters report, Mr. Summers said yesterday, "Our policy and approach is unchanged -- a strong dollar is very much in the interests of the United States."
No matter how much it favors a strong dollar, the Administration will probably remain on the sidelines. Any effort to change the dollar's course against the yen would require concerted intervention by the United States, Japan and their other industrial allies. But the Administration has been reluctant to use such concerted intervention unless the dollar was extremely strong or weak. And if the Japanese economy is recovering, intervention is unlikely to alter significantly the sudden flow of new investors into Japan that is powering the yen rally.
The surge of the yen on Thursday followed a Japanese Government report that the economy had grown at an annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter ended in June. That performance was much better than the small decline that had been expected. Taken with a surprising 8.1 percent rate of growth in the previous quarter, the data helped bolster the belief that the Japanese economy is beginning to recover from its longest recession since World War II.
The prospect of a Japanese recovery has been luring foreign investors into the Japanese stock market for months. As they return, they have to sell dollars and other foreign currencies to buy yen, pushing up the currency's value. They use the yen to buy stocks, which are surging. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 28 percent this year in local terms.
Many economists had thought that the rapid economic growth in Japan in the early months of this year had been overstated. But the small rise in the second quarter will make the recovery seem much more real for many investors. "Now it is clear that the economy at least held onto those gains in the second quarter and that industrial output is moving strongly higher into the third quarter," Karen Parker, the director of currency research as the Chase Manhattan Bank, said in an assessment for clients yesterday.
And that improvement in the economic outlook will make getting back into the stock market more attractive, providing another boost for the yen.
But some economists still think that the Japanese economy could stumble again, especially when the Government cuts back on the fiscal spending it approved to jump start the economy. "There are clear downside risks for the economy because the fiscal spending will have to fade," said Mr. McCormick of J. P. Morgan. But the economic momentum should continue through the quarter ending in September, he said.
The euro fell against the dollar yesterday after the Department of Labor reported that American producer prices, excluding food and energy, declined by one-tenth of 1 percent in August. Some investors took this sign of restrained inflation as another indicator that the Federal Reserve might not raise short-term interest rates again this year. That would give American markets a bit of an edge over those in Europe. The euro was at $1.0364 in late trading, down from $1.0544 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Latest Report Says Inflation Is Still Tame

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In the 1970's, a sudden jump in the price of energy or some other important commodity inevitably signaled a nasty chain reaction that would send inflationary ripples through the whole economy.
These days, the prices of oil and other raw materials are climbing once again. But, so far, there are few signs of a ripple effect. 
 In August, producer prices, a gauge of wholesale price inflation, jumped five-tenths of a percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday. It was the biggest monthly increase since last December. But the increase turned out to be largely confined to energy and food.
The core rate of wholesale price inflation actually fell slightly -- 0.1 percent, after staying put in July. Despite the jump in crude oil prices since the spring, producer prices other than for food and energy are just 1.3 percent higher than they were a year ago.
"There are no signs of inflation in the U.S. economy," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "Despite rapid growth and tight labor markets, there's no evidence of pricing pressure outside of oil."
The data do not necessarily mean the Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates before the year is over, possibly at its next meeting on Oct. 5. But normally hypersensitive bond investors -- on the lookout for anything that might give the Fed a reason to raise rates -- apparently interpreted the producer price data as signs of benign inflation.
Bonds rallied, sending the yield on the long bond to 6.04 percent from 6.09 percent. Stocks were mixed.
"On balance, this is a constructive piece of news from the Fed's perspective," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities. "The Fed prefers not to see energy prices go up, but other prices, on which monetary policy has more direct impact, are still moderate."
Wholesale inflation has been running faster in the first eight months of this year compared with the same period last year, 2.3 percent versus zero. But the Labor Department attributed the entire increase to energy products. By contrast, the Labor Department noted in its release, the index for finished goods other than food and energy declined at a 0.4 percent rate the last eight months after advancing 2.5 percent in 1998.
Although most economists agree that the best news on inflation is probably past, there was a reassuring absence of signs that pressures were building along the pipeline that connects the prices of raw materials with those of finished goods. Prices of so-called intermediate goods outside of food and energy -- everything from copper wire to paper and plywood -- rose two-tenths of a percent in August, about half the rate of the previous two months.
Certainly, the fact that Asia is emerging from its recession, Europe is beginning to grow faster, and Latin America is not sinking as much as everyone feared after Brazil's currency tanked, means that the demand for many raw materials will increase, raising prices.
But instead of passing on higher prices, many manufacturers seem to be accepting smaller profit margins or, more frequently, finding ways to trim costs elsewhere in their operations by bolstering productivity.
They may not have much choice. The world is still awash in excess capacity, not just overseas but also in the United States, where the fraction of unused industrial capacity remains well above the historical norm. And optimists think they detect a long-term shift in corporate thinking.
"There's more competitive pressure on pricing than before," said Mr. Rippe of Prudential Securities. "But there's also a different mentality out there."
Few analysts expect energy prices to keep soaring as they have the last four months, but energy prices are likely to stay firm thanks to growing demand, low inventories and the chance that the coming winter will not be as balmy as the most recent winters.
Faster growth abroad and a nascent rebound in manufacturing in the United States are also having an effect on the prices of industrial commodities -- iron and steel scrap, raw cotton and the like -- which jumped nearly 2 percent in August after a 2.3 percent increase in July.
Food prices tell a different tale. Prices bounced up 0.4 percent in August, a sizable rise. But that followed a nearly 1 percent drop in July. Unlike energy and raw materials, there is no reason to think food prices are on a rising trend. Among things that were a lot pricier in August were pork, dairy products and soda. Beef, veal, chicken and vegetables fell less in August than in July. Some things became cheaper, among them fish and coffee.
Meanwhile, prices of many manufactured goods are still flat or falling. Although aircraft, office furniture and construction equipment became costlier, capital goods prices did not budge over all in August as everything from trucks to X-ray equipment was cheaper.
And the prices of consumer goods other than energy products dipped slightly. Among the things that became more of a bargain in August were liquor, clothes, laundry soap and mobile homes.
Stable wholesale prices will not necessarily stay the Fed's hand this fall, however. Apart from the fact that producer prices exclude imports and, more important, services, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, reminded anyone who cared to listen that the Fed had yet to reverse all of its 75-point rate cut of last fall.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Assisting Militias, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON with DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton accused the Indonesian military today of direct involvement in the savagery that has swept across East Timor and said that an international peacekeeping force must be allowed to restore order.
"It is now clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and abetting the militia violence," he said in a statement released during a stop in Hawaii en route to an Asia-Pacific economic meeting in New Zealand. "This is simply unacceptable." 
 Mr. Clinton, who earlier had held out the possibility that the Indonesian military might end the violence, said today that international peacekeepers were now essential.
"The Indonesian government and military must reverse this course -- to do everything possible to stop the violence -- and allow an international force to make possible the restoration of security," he said.
Despite the Pentagon's earlier insistence that there are no plans to send American ground troops to join an Australian-led peacekeeping force in East Timor, the President's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said today, "I don't think anything is ruled out here."
Mr. Berger indicated that Mr. Clinton, from Air Force One, had been consulting congressional leaders about how deeply the United States might get involved. One official said contingency plans would require moving "thousands of American personnel, though not necessarily onto East Timor." The troops, aircraft and ships would be chiefly drawn from Marine bases on Okinawa.
Mr. Berger also appeared to acknowledge what other senior Administration officials have said privately -- that Indonesia's military has muscled aside President B.J. Habibie, who seems unable to control developments in East Timor. While President Clinton has exchanged messages with Mr. Habibie in recent months, Mr. Berger said, "I think we have focused on where we believe the decisions are being made, which is the Indonesian military."
He said that General Wiranto, Indonesia's senior military commander and defense minister, "has ultimate responsibility for asserting control over" the situation in East Timor although "there may be divisions within the military."
Mr. Berger said the Administration had begun a reviewing other sanctions that could be taken against Indonesia. Earlier this week, the President announced that he had ordered the Pentagon to end its few formal contacts with the Indonesian military, and that he would consider new economic sanctions against Indonesia if "this madness" in East Timor was not ended.
A senior administration official said the White House decided today to suspend a package of commercial arms sales to Indonesia expected to total about $16 million over the next year. "All ongoing and previously approved sales are being frozen," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Even as the American response grew more heated today, the Administration appeared to be running out of options to bring pressure on the Indonesian military to quell the violence or to permit the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
The most potent weapon available to the United States is its veto power over economic assistance to Indonesia from the International Monetary Fund, which has propped up the Indonesian economy with billions of dollars in emergency aid.
But no new I.M.F. assistance for Indonesia is in the pipeline, and $2.5 billion already committed to Indonesia by the Fund was frozen even before the crisis in East Timor, as a result of allegations that the Indonesian Government had misused an earlier package of aid money.
A few officials in the Administration, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have questioned whether economic sanctions would be wise, especially because they might lead to widescale rioting across Indonesia or a nationalistic backlash.
During a two-hour stopover in Hawaii, President Clinton met with Adm. Dennis Blair, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, who hurried returned home to Hawaii after meeting with General Wiranto in Indonesia. He also spoke by phone with Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, who is working to organize a peacekeeping force.
"The President made clear to Prime Minister Howard that the United States supported such an international peacekeeping force and that we would provide support to such a force if one becomes feasible," Mr. Berger said.
Asked whether American support would go beyond logistical assistance, he said that the Australians "are most interested in those things that we have a special capability in -- in terms of logistics and communications and intelligence." But he added that "we've not made any decisions beyond that or ruled anything out."

HEADLINE: Andreessen Steps Down From AOL

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Marc Andreessen, who became an icon of the Internet age as a co-founder of the Netscape Communications Corporation before it was acquired by America Online last year, is stepping down after seven months as America Online's chief technology officer, the company said yesterday.
In his place, the company hired William J. Raduchel, the chief strategist of Sun Microsystems. 
 The chief technology officer's job at America Online is not to run its vast computer network, but to plan a network of the future that will connect not only to computers but to telephones, televisions and all manner of new gadgets.
Mr. Raduchel's background may fill the bill better than Mr. Andreessen's. He has been involved in Sun's Internet strategy and forging alliances with other big companies, including Fujitsu, Sony and more recently America Online. Moreover, Mr. Raduchel, a 53-year-old former Harvard professor and veteran technology executive, may be more suited to the ways of America Online, where executives tend to be in their late 30's and 40's, than the 28-year-old Mr. Andreessen, who was a student before forming Netscape.
Of course, when Mr. Andreessen took the job at America Online in February, it was seen as a sign that the sprawling company in Dulles, Va., was reaching out to former Netscape employees and to Silicon Valley in general. As one of the inventors of the Internet browser at 23, Mr. Andreessen was the first of the young entrepreneurs who were changing the world -- and getting rich -- by building the Web.
But Mr. Andreessen said he figured out that he would rather be investing in and working with start-ups rather than attending meetings about corporate strategy.
"America Online's mission is to bring the Internet to everyone and to accomplish that mission is clearly a matter of size and scale," he said. "Start-ups have a different role. They are about breaking the rules and trying new things that might fail or might change the world."
So, he has arranged a part-time position with America Online that will allow him to make personal investments in start-up companies as well as advising America Online about investing in or acquiring them.
"I look at all the creativity in the start-up world and it's like white water rafting," Mr. Andreessen said. "You can't tell what's going on from the shore. You have to be in the middle of the rapids."
Over the last year, Mr. Andreessen has made personal investments in Replay, a company that makes digital video recorders, and Accompany, an on-line store. But he says his new role will give him the time to serve on more boards and work more closely with companies.
Another factor that was not endearing about his new job, Mr. Andreessen conceded, was that his English bulldogs could not take the Virginia heat, and he had to send them back to his home in Palo Alto, Calif.
Mr. Andreessen was the last America Online employee among the small group of engineers from the University of Illinois who founded Netscape along with Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics. Indeed, of the top seven executives at Netscape at the time of the acquisition last November, only one is still working for the company full time. Barry Ariko, Netscape's chief operating officer, is the No. 2 executive in Iplanet, the joint venture between America Online and Sun to sell software that runs Web sites.
Mr. Raduchel was one of the top four executives at Sun and has served over the last 10 years as its chief financial officer and its chief information officer.
He said that like Mr. Andreessen, he has been considering investing in or working for start-ups.
"I had already told Scott that I wanted to look at doing something different after 10 years on the inside as a staff guy," Mr. Raduchel said, referring to Scott McNealy, Sun's chairman, who was one of his economics students at Harvard. But then Steve Case, America Online's chairman, heard that Mr. Raduchel was considering leaving Sun and just two weeks ago called him to offer him Mr. Andreessen's job.
"I wasn't planning to take another job like I had," Mr. Raduchel said. "But I realized I enjoy the leverage that big companies give me. You can paint on a three-by-five card in your house or you can paint on a billboard in Times Square. And that's what I'd rather do."

Nasdaq Hits New High as Computer Companies Rebound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index soared to a record yesterday as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies and software makers. But the swing toward technology stocks came at the expense of industrial stocks, which finished mostly lower, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down.
The Nasdaq index rose 35.04 points, to close at 2,887.06, easily surpassing its previous closing high of 2,864.48, on July 16. For the year, the Nasdaq has gained 31.7 percent. 
 The Dow industrials, however, fell 50.97, to close at 11,028.43, after giving up a gain of 62 points. For the week, the Dow lost 50.02, or 0.5 percent, but it is still up 20.1 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4, to 1,351.66.
The Nasdaq's strength came from hefty gains by the on-line auction house Ebay, which rose 13 9/16, to 158, and the Internet search provider Yahoo, which rose 7 13/16, to 170 1/2. Software companies also gained ground, with Microsoft rising 15/16, to 95, and Oracle, a maker of business software, picking up 2 5/16, to 46 3/8.
"Technology is back," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "This is a group that had been battered in recent weeks, and it's nice to see money coming back into the group."
Traders suggested that Thursday's unofficial test run for Year 2000 computer glitches may have eased concerns about computer-related companies. Some programmers had feared that the string of nines in Thursday's date, 9/9/99, would cause computer programs to fail. But with no major problems reported, programmers and Wall Street professionals alike gained confidence that Jan. 1, 2000, would pass without difficulty.
Stocks also benefited from a relatively benign Government report on producer prices for August, which eased investor concerns about higher interest rates. The Labor Department said that rising energy costs pushed producer prices up a higher-than-expected five-tenths of a percent, but when the volatile energy and food categories were excluded, the index actually fell a tenth of a percent.
Financial markets tend to set aside food and energy price changes and focus on the figure known as core inflation. The drop in the core rate last month was better than economists had expected.
The markets have been uneasy lately because of concerns that the Federal Reserve, which has already raised interest rates twice this year, would push rates higher a third time because of the economy's strength.
"This was pretty much the icing on the cake," said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C. "The market is correct to now relax, at least temporarily."
But while most stocks rose, the big industrial companies that dominate the Dow fell. Caterpillar tumbled 2, to 56 3/4, and Chevron, which rose throughout the week as crude oil prices improved, fell 1 5/8, to 95 15/16, as investors took profits.
Maytag, the appliance maker, plunged 14 13/16, to 41 3/4, after saying its third-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street analysts' estimates because of weak sales for its lower-priced goods.
Healthsouth, which runs rehabilitation centers, fell 2 3/16, to 5 11/16. The company, based in Birmingham, Ala., said late on Thursday that it would delay spinning off its in-patient hospitals and warned that its operating margins for the third and fourth quarters would fall below forecasts.
Hon Industries of Muscatine, Iowa, an office furniture company, eased 1 9/16, to 22 9/16. The company warned that third-quarter earnings would be below Wall Street estimates, citing difficulties in hiring new employees.
National Semiconductor gained 2 5/8, to 34 5/8, after reporting better-than-expected first-quarter earnings of $47.1 million, or 25 cents a share.
Amplidyne, a maker of power amplifiers for wireless and satellite telecommunications based in Raritan, N.J., climbed 2 1/8, to 12 1/4, after introducing a set of products to offer high-speed wireless Internet access.
Intuit, which makes Quicken and Turbotax software, gained 5 15/16, to 103, after announcing a 3-for-1 split.
"Most of the market came through this week fairly unscathed," said Mr. Hogan of Jefferies & Company. "But until we hear from the Fed, there's still resistance against taking the entire market to new highs."
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.42, to 441.19.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled 808.54 million shares.
Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.19 percent. European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 0.6 percent.

Producer Prices Jump, But Core Rate Slips
Producer prices, a gauge of wholesale price inflation, jumped five-tenths of a percent in August, the Labor Department reported. But the increase, the largest since last December, was largely confined to energy and food. 
 The core rate of wholesale price inflation fell one-tenth of a percent, after holding steady in July. Despite the huge jump in crude oil prices since the spring, producer prices other than for food and energy are just 1.3 percent higher than they were a year ago. Page C4.
 
Nasdaq Index Surges to Record
The Nasdaq composite index soared 35.04 points to 2,887.06, a record, as investors snapped up shares of Internet companies and software makers, but industrial stocks slid. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.97 points to close at 11,028.43, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index edged up 4.00 points to 1,351.66. C3.
 
Treasury bond prices rose, reflecting hope for tame inflation, sparked by the producer price report and the dollar's rise against the yen. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell to a two-week low of 6.04 percent. C3.
 
British Merger May Be Blocked
The European Commission seemed to be preparing to block the proposed $1.4 billion takeover of First Choice Holidays P.L.C. by Airtours P.L.C. The deal would create Britain's biggest single tour operator and narrow competition in a market that has been seeing price wars and falling sales. C2.
 
NEC Shares Jump 12% on Report
Shares of the NEC Corporation jumped 12 percent after a report in Japan's leading business daily, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, suggested that the technology and telecommunications giant planned a sweeping overhaul that would consolidate business units, give division heads greater authority and shed money-losing businesses. The steps are in line with plans announced by Koji Mishigaki when he was named president of the company in February. C2.
 
U.A.W. Demand to DaimlerChrysler
Stephen Yokich, president of the United Automobile Workers, is said to be demanding that DaimlerChrysler A.G. make it easier for the union to organize its workers, including those at a nonunion Mercedes plant in Alabama, if it is to lead industry contract talks. C4.
 
Oil Settlement Is Reported
Chevron, BP Amoco P.L.C. and Conoco Inc. have agreed in principle to pay about $155 million to settle charges filed by two whistleblowers that they underpaid oil royalties, according to published reports. Neither the companies nor the Justice Department would confirm the settlement reports. C2.
 
MGM Plans $750 Million Stock Sale
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., owner of one of the world's largest film libraries, said it would sell $750 million of new common shares and reduce some of its debt. Tracinda, the investment company owned by Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire, holds about 89 percent of MGM's shares and may buy more. C3.

HEADLINE: Indian Tribes Approve Gambling Compacts With California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis and more than 50 California Indian tribes agreed today to binding compacts intended to keep slot machines operating at Indian casinos around the state, and the State Legislature voted to put a referendum on the ballot next March to exempt tribes from the state Constitution's ban on casino gambling, paving the way for a substantial expansion of gambling in the West.
The agreements, reached after an overnight scramble at the end of the annual legislative session in Sacramento, were intended to avert a threatened Federal shutdown of tribal slot machines in the wake of a State Supreme Court ruling last month. That ruling overturned an earlier ballot measure that would have expanded the $1.4 billion annual industry. 
 The constitutional amendment would have to be approved by voters before the tribes would have the right to offer slot machines and blackjack card games and they still would not be allowed to offer roulette or craps games.
But if the constitutional amendment is approved, which seems likely because voters approved the earlier ballot measure, the number of slot machines at Indian casinos around the state could more than double, to 43,000. So could jobs in an industry that already employs about 16,000 people statewide in a no-frills, close-to-home alternative to the grander temptations of Las Vegas, Nev. A separate agreement giving casino employees the right to organize a union must be endorsed by each tribe by Oct. 13, or the 20-year compacts will be nullified.
"For those tribes that adopt it, this compact offers security and economic promise," said Mr. Davis, a Democrat who received more than $750,000 in Indian contributions in his election campaign last year.
He had vowed to help the tribes find a way to preserve their gambling after the court decision last month, but was also under pressure from allies in organized labor to assure rights to collective bargaining.
Daniel Tucker, vice chairman of the Sycuan Band of Mission Indians and a spokesman for the California Indian Gaming Nations Association, said the compacts and the proposed constitutional amendment would "finally allow California Indian tribes to achieve the self-reliance that we have long been seeking."
Indian gambling has been a hotly disputed issue in California for much of the last decade, as impoverished tribes expanded from traditional bingo games into more lucrative slot machines and card games. But under Federal law, tribes are not allowed to offer such gambling without first signing compacts with the state, and former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican and a staunch opponent of gambling, refused to negotiate a compact with any tribe that already had slot machines, though he reached limited compacts with a handful of tribes.
In an effort to get around Mr. Wilson, about 40 other tribes sponsored a ballot measure, Proposition 5, that essentially required the state to sign a gambling compact with any tribe that wanted one.
That measure was approved with 63 percent of the vote after a $100 million spending campaign, a national record, that pitted the tribes against Nevada casino interests wary of competition. But the State Supreme Court ruled last month that the statute violated the state Constitution's longstanding ban on Nevada-style casinos, rejecting the tribes' arguments that their machines and card games operated more like a lottery than a traditional casino bank. As a result, Federal prosecutors, who had previously won court orders against about 10 casinos, threatened to seize their machines by mid-October unless tribes reached compacts with the state.
Prosecutors had said that if the tribes signed compacts as a show of good faith, they would hold off any further action until a constitutional amendment could be considered by the voters.
At least 58 tribes agreed to sign the new compacts. But Richard Milanovich, chairman of the Agua Caliente band of Indians in Palm Springs, whose 1,150 video slot machines are among those Federal officials have threatened to seize, said his tribe was leaning against signing the measure and would seek a vote of the whole tribe next week. Among his objections was that the tribe would have to contribute some of its gambling profits to a state fund that would then be distributed to tribes that choose not to have gambling.
"We have difficulty with that because it sets artificial limits on the economic viability of those machines and it creates another state bureaucracy that handles money for tribes," said Mr. Milanovich, whose tribe's casino is one of the state's biggest. He said that ceding such authority to the state could violate Indian sovereignty.
Under the compacts, tribes without slot machines would have the first chance to draw from a pool of new machines, and would be allocated 350 machines each. Tribes that already offer gambling could increase their number of machines by acquiring unused allocations from other tribes. There is a limit of 2,000 machines per tribe. A percentage of gambling revenues would also be turned over to the state to be used for programs to treat gambling addiction and to finance local infrastructure needs generated by gambling.
Under the compacts Mr. Wilson, the former Governor, had reached with a handful of tribes, they were limited to no more than 990 machines each. Those agreements were superseded by the new compacts today.
Indian gambling interests have become a major political force in the state and this week, Common Cause announced that for the first time, three tribes have earned places on the group's list of the 10 biggest donors to state legislators over the past two years. Together, the three tribes gave more than $3.6 million to legislative campaigns.
Other businesses in the state, including race tracks and card clubs, have pressed for expanded gambling rights to match the tribes, and bills to allow that moved through the Legislature this week.
A spokesman for Governor Davis, Michael Bustamante, said Mr. Davis would not support any such efforts this year and did not intend to allow "a major expansion of gambling in the state, period." He said the Governor was "still very optimistic," that the handful of the state's tribes that have yet to sign the agreement would do so before the deadline.
But Cheryl Schmit, co-chairwoman of Stand Up For California, a statewide group opposed to gambling expansion, said, "This was not a moderate expansion of gambling, this was a huge expansion."
The Legislature's decision to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot next March eliminates the need for a costly petition-gathering effort that the Indians were preparing, but both sides predicted there could yet be a costly replay of last year's battle over Proposition 5.
"I think the campaign is going to be very heated," said Penny LeDoux, one of the plaintiffs who sued to overturn Proposition 5. "We're disappointed in the compact. It just allows for huge expansion of gambling and has no requirements for involvement or approval by local communities that are affected."
Ms. Schmit said: "This is an unending saga. We're bitterly disappointed with the compacts that the Governor signed. There is money given from tribes to the state to help local communities, but now we'll have to go lobby our legislators to persuade them to help individual communities. That doesn't seem very fair."

HEADLINE: Debt Reduction Gains Appeal In the Capital

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Representative Baron P. Hill, a moderate Democrat from Indiana, spent a good part of August walking across his district, talking with constituents about what to do with the Federal budget surplus.
Mr. Hill says he heard little enthusiasm for the $792 billion Republican tax-cutting plan, which President Clinton has pledged to veto. Instead, he heard a remarkably consistent call for Congress and the Administration to use the surplus for a purpose long supported by economists but until now seen as a political yawner by both parties: reducing the $3.6 trillion national debt. 
 "The American people get this," the Congressman said. "They want the national debt paid down."
Coming from a Democrat, Mr. Hill's account of what he heard is perhaps not surprising. But having failed to rally strong public pressure in support of their tax cuts, Republicans as well now increasingly see debt reduction as having far more appeal to voters than they previously assumed. And that changing political calculation could prove to be crucial in determining whether the White House and the two parties in Congress push this year for a big compromise deal on taxes and spending, or leave the issue to be fought out on the campaign trail next year.
The reason is that if there is partisan gridlock over how to divide up the surplus, it automatically gets channeled into debt reduction. To the degree that debt reduction is seen as a political winner, both parties will be more willing to walk away from any proposed deal on the surplus, and that seems to be what is happening.
Republican leaders said over the last few days that they would consider the issue closed for the year if Mr. Clinton vetoes their tax-cut bill when they send it to him next week.
They left open the possibility of a negotiation with the White House to salvage a tax cut, their most cherished legislative goal. But they said that locking away most of the surplus for debt reduction -- and keeping Democrats from spending it -- would be accomplishment enough for them to take home to voters in an election year, especially since cutting the debt would leave the nation in better financial condition to deal with looming shortfalls in the Social Security and Medicare programs.
Asked by a reporter on Thursday if this session of Congress would be a failure if it did not produce a tax cut, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert replied that preserving for debt reduction the biggest portion of the surplus -- the part generated by excess Social Security revenue -- would be "a real step forward in most people's minds."
Mr. Clinton also has a case for refusing to budge. In the view of the White House, blocking the Republican tax cut would not be about denying taxpayers their due or fueling wasteful Government spending, as Republicans assert; it would be about insuring that surpluses go primarily to reducing or perhaps even eliminating the debt.
"We have an historic opportunity to lift the burden of debt off the next generation," Mr. Clinton said in an appearance at the White House on Thursday.
Many liberals say that spending on education and health, for example, yields greater benefits to the nation than debt reduction. Many conservatives say tax cuts can do more to stimulate economic growth.
But centrist economic thought holds that debt reduction brings great benefits by holding down interest rates, freeing capital for investment in new technologies and factories, and giving the Government greater borrowing power in the future if needed to deal with a problem like a shortfall in Social Security.
Although polls show some backing for tax cuts, they also support the notion that debt reduction has become a priority for voters. In a poll by ABC News and The Washington Post last week, 43 percent of respondents identified shoring up Social Security as the best use for the surplus, with 24 percent supporting debt reduction and 20 percent backing tax cuts. Given that debt reduction and shoring up Social Security are closely linked, the polls may even understate the support for debt repayment.
While they have argued all year about whose plan would do more to reduce the debt, the two parties are not far apart. Both parties have agreed that the portion of the surplus generated by excess Social Security revenue -- about $2 trillion over the next decade -- should be used only for debt reduction (although some Republicans would use a portion of it to allow individuals to invest some of their Social Security money in the stock market).
The battle has been over the remaining $1 trillion in projected surpluses, the portion that comes from general tax revenue. The Republicans would use that money for their tax cut, saying they could find additional money for debt reduction by cutting spending further. The White House wants to divide it among spending programs and a complicated plan under which the interest savings from additional debt reduction would go to help Medicare.
Whether either approach is credible remains to be seen. Even without a tax cut, Congress is on track to spend next year's non-Social Security surplus of about $14 billion, and Republicans are resorting to every gimmick they can think of to avoid dipping into the $147 billion projected Social Security surplus, money that would otherwise go to debt reduction.
Democrats and the White House have also pledged to keep their hands off the Social Security surplus next year, but are having as much trouble as the Republicans in making the numbers in their proposals add up.

Militias Menace Refugees At U.N. Center in Timor
Most of the staff evacuated the besieged United Nations compound in East Timor, and shortly after men with hand grenades arrived to menace the remaining workers and 1,000 refugees taking shelter there. Witnesses said the men looted supplies with the help of Indonesian soldiers and fired at refugees who tried to flee. Indonesia's armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said his country might accept the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force. A1 

Secretary General Kofi Annan said that if Indonesia did not accept immediate international military assistance to restore order in East Timor, the Indonesian leadership might be guilty of crimes against humanity. A6
 
President Clinton accused the Indonesian military of direct involvement in the savagery that has swept across East Timor and affirmed Mr. Annan's assertion that an international peacekeeping force must be allowed to restore order. A6
 
Venezuela Assembly Relents
The Assembly that was elected to draw up a new Constitution for Venezuela is backing away from further confrontations with rival institutions.

Puerto Rican Militants Are Freed From Prison
Eleven members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group walked out of Federal prisons under an act of clemency by President Clinton that has sparked a political firestorm. The prisoners were members of the F.A.L.N., which was responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970's and early 1980's, though none of the prisoners were convicted of crimes that resulted in death or injuries. A1
 
Ruling Ends First Busing Plan
A Federal judge ruled that forced school integration was no longer necessary in Charlotte, N.C., because all vestiges of intentional discrimination had disappeared. The Supreme Court first approved busing for desegregation nationwide in a 1971 ruling on Charlotte's plan. A1
 
Missing Page in Waco Report

HEADLINE: MILITIAS IN TIMOR MENACE REFUGEES AT U.N. COMPOUND

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Moments after most of the staff had evacuated the besieged United Nations compound in East Timor today, men with hand grenades arrived to menace the remaining workers and the 1,000 terrified refugees taking shelter there. Witnesses said the men had looted supplies with the help of uniformed soldiers and fired at refugees who tried to flee.
As international pressure grew, the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, said for the first time that Indonesia might in the future accept the deployment of the United Nations peacekeeping force that has been the insistent demand of foreign nations. 
 Pressure this week came from a range of sources, but it is not clear which influence might have changed the general's mind. A United Nations delegation came to Indonesia to press the Government to allow peacekeeping troops to try to bring order to East Timor. And Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that continued violence in East Timor and repeated rejections of outside help could lead to charges of crimes against humanity.
President Clinton, en route to an economic meeting in New Zealand, said today in a statement from Air Force One, "It is now clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and abetting the militia violence." He said an international peacekeeping force was crucial. Page A6.
The commander of American forces in the Pacific, Adm. Dennis Blair, traveled to Jakarta to meet General Wiranto and to emphasize the general's responsibility to control the military, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, has talked by phone with the Indonesian commander several times this week about East Timor.
The turbulence in East Timor has begun to shake the political position of President B. J. Habibie, who has come under criticism from his own party as well as his political opponents and who is the subject of increasing derision in the press.
Reports from East Timor's capital, Dili, today described a scene of continuing tension and fear.
Staff members who had evacuated the United Nations compound, upon arriving in Darwin, Australia, said they had been fired on as they headed in a convoy to the tiny airport in Dili. Around them, they said, lay a devastated city where almost every building had been burned or vandalized and where the only people in evidence were armed men on motorcycles.
As night fell, Brian Kelly, a United Nations official reached at the compound by telephone, said the tension at the unguarded compound had increased as the armed men continued to threaten the occupants.
"What this is is a further racheting up of intimidatory tactics and a further example of the porosity of the security fence we have been offered by the military," he said. "It's all part, I'm sure, of a game plan. The fact is that there is no way of predicting day to day how much more they will attempt."
Recent violence has included the burning of churches and the killing of priests and nuns around the territory. Pope John Paul II sent a telegram to Roman Catholics in East Timor condemning the violence against his followers and saying, "I implore those responsible for so many acts of wickedness to abandon their murderous and destructive intentions."
General Wiranto, in what seemed to be a plea for international understanding, given escalating demands for an end to the violence, said: "We do not object to the idea of foreign peacekeeping troops, but it is not really the appropriate time for a foreign security force to enter East Timor. But we are open for future discussions on such matters."
After weeks of absolute refusal to consider the involvement of foreign troops, the admission by the general that he might need outside help to control the situation -- and even to bring to heel some units of his own military -- illustrated the political toll East Timor has begun to take here in the Indonesian capital.
The violence is the direct result of what clearly seems to have been a sudden offer of independence by Mr. Habibie and of what also clearly seems to have been a deliberate plan by the military to undermine the process by staging a campaign of terror by irregular, military-backed militias.
"Last week Wiranto send battalions supposedly to protect people, but in the night they dress as militia with guns and weapons, and they go around the villages shooting," said East Timor's spiritual leader, the Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo. He spoke in London after having been forced to flee the territory when gunmen burned his home in Dili and shot some of the 6,000 refugees who had taken shelter there.
In the referendum on Aug. 30, the former Portuguese colony voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975 but never completely subdued a separatist insurgency.
Today, a faction of Mr. Habibie's political party, Golkar, demanded that he withdraw as its candidate for president in an electoral assembly planned for November, which follows a general election that was held in June.
Mr. Habibie's political stock had already been falling sharply. Many commentators say his disastrous policy regarding East Timor, and the weakness he is now demonstrating, have doomed his hopes for re-election.
The most likely candidate at the moment is the chief opposition leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri. She has maneuvered adeptly around the Timor issue, voicing support for the politically powerful military, which is resisting the separation of East Timor, while asserting that she will honor East Timor's right to independence. On Tuesday she said Mr. Habibie was "not fit to be a presidential candidate."
Public opinion, which has only begun to be aroused here in Jakarta on the issue of East Timor, was violently divided today. In one demonstration, protesters set fire to the flags of the United States and Australia, which they accused of meddling in Indonesian affairs. In another, a group of 80 women demonstrated outside the Defense Ministry calling for an end to military violence.
In Dili, the United Nations evacuated about 300 staff members, including all local workers, who are under threat of reprisals from the militias. The militias opposed the holding of the referendum under the auspices of the United Nations.
About 80 staff members remained in the compound, most of them having refused to leave as long as the refugees there remained under threat. A handful of journalists remained with them, and in telephone interviews their voices shook with exhaustion and emotion.
"The situation here deteriorated dramatically after the convoy left evacuating the U.N. staff and local staff and their families," said Marie Colvin, a British journalist reporting for The Sunday Times of London.
"They took away most of the army, and we were almost immediately besieged by militia," she said. "But this is not chaos. The militia certainly, from what I could see, was operating closely with the army. When the militia threatened to throw grenades over the wall, the army came and said we should give them a truck and they would go away."
When militia members tried to break into a truck filled with supplies that was parked adjacent to the compound, she said, "we saw that when they were unable to smash in the windshield the army came over and smashed it in with a rifle butt."
In Jakarta, the chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Sudrajat, denied that the militia had threatened the United Nations compound.
"There are soldiers there to protect it," he said.

In Praise of Hard Industries
 Why Manufacturing, Not the
 Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity.
 By Eamonn Fingleton.
 273 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $26. 
 Eamonn Fingleton is the sort of journalist economists despise. He is a mercantilist, judging economic activities by their contribution to exports. He is a protectionist, favoring high tariffs. He believes that the United States is heading toward a competitive crisis, caused by our faddish choice of unsustainable postindustrial activities -- finance, computer software, information. He believes that the advanced manufacturing industries should be actively supported by government to block the "leakage of world-beating production technologies abroad."
These are provocative arguments not very persuasively made. "In Praise of Hard Industries" is anecdotal, spurning statistics or other corroboration. It is overstated: American manufacturing isn't exactly dead, something that, reading between the lines here about Kodak and Boeing, one learns. The policy prescriptions (savings tax incentives, tariffs) are shallow. And sometimes the argumentation is daft. In two places Fingleton asserts that the high-tech hotshots who make so much money in San Jose are so bright that they could do equally well in, let us say, Akron, if only they chose to move there. So why didn't they?
And yet Fingleton is right on a basic fact. Manufacturing is and will remain the central economic activity in world trade. This book is best at its descriptions of modern manufacturing processes -- Nikon's stepper machines, central to semiconductor production, for instance, or Sony's laser diodes -- and for its screeching critique of our Internet-obsessed business press. New Age gurus take deserved hard hits -- though Fingleton is silent on their leading acolytes, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
Fingleton laid out his view of the hidden strengths of the Japanese economy in "Blindside." Here he says that in the 1990's Japanese policy makers decided to play down their continuing successes (notably in isolating their financial crash from their still strong industrial sectors), partly to stay below American political radar. Hence the looming crisis as he sees it: Japanese (and German) manufacturing continue to advance while Americans place vain hopes on service sectors like software, dominated by small, overvalued companies like Microsoft, highly vulnerable to piracy, outsourcing and low-wage imports.
O.K., but so what? Can the United States survive and prosper as a financial services, software, information and entertainment-producing society whose role in the world is also anchored, as Fingleton does not say, by its position as chief military enforcer and supplier of the world's reserve currency -- the dollar? The fact is, we have full employment without inflation, declining inequality and a balanced budget. There is no very obvious evidence the party will end soon. Would we be better off with high tariffs and so higher prices -- and foregone use of Japanese microelectronics in favor of inferior home production? Would we be better off supplying fewer dollars to world finance and forcing reserves to be shifted to the Euro?
Economists typically respond to arguments like Fingleton's with a one-size-fits-all attack on protectionism and the mercantile fallacy. This is a mistake. The mercantilists in their day (Elizabethan England and 19th-century Germany under the influence of Friedrich List) knew what they were doing. And the pursuit of industrial advantage and of a reserve of treasure is sensible policy for middling powers in an unstable world -- as Japan learned and both China and Taiwan, the survivors of last year's crisis, can attest.
Yet the same course is not necessarily sensible for the leading financial and imperial powers. Countries like ours, or the elites that run them, have other interests. Whether we should, in fact, anchor the world system, whether we can effectively do so, whether it is good for us morally -- these are important issues. But Fingleton does not address them. They would require a more searching critique of the American fin de si<heart>cle than one finds here.

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON/POP AND JAZZ;
Melancholy Babies: Angst Is In Again

BYLINE: By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
POPULAR music, the id of American culture, market-tests attitudes along with rhythms and tunes. For most of 1999, the pop charts have been divided among four disparate, teen-centered moods: the gooey romance of groups like the Backstreet Boys, the peppy Spanglish pop of Ricky Martin (who is scheduled to perform amid bilingual squeals at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 28), the frat-boy boorishness of bands like Limp Bizkit and the action-movie nihilism of gangsta rap. Part of the audience is soaking up sweet nothings; another part fantasizes on lashing out.
What has been missing for some time amid pop's puppy love and acting up is a mentality that was a staple of early-1990's rock: brooding, questioning, self-lacerating angst. With a buoyant economy and a pop-cultural landscape full of pumped-up wrestlers and invincible action-movie heroes, pop audiences grew impatient with troubled rock stars who turned their frustrations inward, especially when they proclaimed their need to be alone while they worked the arena circuit. 
 But in the 1999 season, angst is going to try for a comeback. Leading the misery brigade is Trent Reznor, who has taken five years to come up with a sequel to "The Downward Spiral." Between albums, he has steered Marilyn Manson to notoriety and supervised the soundtrack to "Natural Born Killers," but Nine Inch Nails's particular blend of industrial crunch and Beatles melody, self-loathing and blurted confessions of bad impulses went silent. Worked over in studio solitude for years, the new Nine Inch Nails album, "The Fragile," which is due Sept. 21, seeks new nadirs of bitter disclosure matched to fine-tuned sonic assaults.
Another forlorn character, Fiona Apple, returns in November with her second album, which, cantankerously, has a 90-word title. Her songs provide a corrective to the dewy-eyed, happy-ever-after romance that has retaken the Top 10; she remembers the ups and downs and messy, self-destructive details of love and lust, and she sings about them in a voice with a melancholy bitterness that makes her seem far older than 22. The reception of both albums will measure whether adolescents still want to admit they're tormented from within. Other songwriters who are about to release albums that are neither sunny nor belligerent include Tori Amos and a subdued David Bowie.
But all those performers have to wonder whether listeners are still interested in the continuity of a career. From the 1960's onward, rock songwriters have been able to depend on loyalty from radio programmers and fans. But newer bands face shorter attention spans and the proliferating choices open to listeners on radio, cable television and the Internet. Having bought one sample of a musical persona, consumers may decide they don't need more of the same -- even as, for instance, Mel C. of the Spice Girls (remember them?) releases a solo album this fall.
Garth Brooks, a commercial champion of the 1990's, has come up with a strategy to beat the burnout. On his next album, he becomes an invented character, Chris Gaines, who wears a toupee instead of a cowboy hat. A tie-in film is expected in December 2000. Mr. Brooks conquered country music by merging it with 1970's pop-rock tactics, from Don McLean to Billy Joel, and turning a country band into an ever-smiling choreographed revue. His less than startling strategy for "Chris Gaines" is to straightforwardly revive 1970's and early-1980's rock in new songs, providing one more reprise for people who miss the sounds of John Denver, Loggins and Messina or Styx.
Since it put the band in bandwagon, pop will also be following through on current hit-making styles in the new season. Expect more teenypop sensations -- recording companies are probably scouting high-school assemblies by now -- and a salvo of tough-talking rap, with new albums due from Nas, DMX, Jay-Z and Method Man before the end of the year. Rappers like DMX and rap-rockers like Limp Bizkit are sharing bills for this fall's second annual Family Values tour, to the enrichment of insurers and security guards nationwide.
The surge of Latin pop holds more promise. It has created opportunities that could stimulate new cultural hybrids, as Hispanic singers with voices to match pretty faces -- notably Marc Anthony, the celebrated young pop-salsa tenor who will release his English-language debut on Sept. 28 -- get a chance to be heard outside their ethnic strongholds.
An infusion of Latin rhythms can only perk up popular music; rumba, guajira and son montuno have already revitalized 1990's dance music and jazz. And for concertgoers who want to look beyond Ricky Martin's grin, this fall brings the chance to hear a plentitude of more seasoned Latin musicians. The wave of music from Cuba brings national tours by Eliades Ochoa, Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez, all from the Buena Vista Social Club, as well as Cuba's long-running dance band, Los Van Van. A Brazilian master, Gilberto Gil, is touring the United States this month, and this fall so are the genre-crunching rock en Espanol bands Cafe Tacuba and Jaguares, both from Mexico, and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, from Argentina.
Unlike many of their neighbors north of the border, Latin rock musicians don't sound jaded or rule-bound. Following the example that Mr. Gil set in the late 1960's with Brazilian tropicalia, Latin rockers bend old forms and borrow from all over the place with a gleeful disregard for precedent. As they mash up styles and cross borders, the Latin bands show by example that pop doesn't have to confine itself to predetermined forms and attitudes -- a lesson that, sooner or later, ought to reach the United States mainstream.

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON/ARCHITECTURE;
Imaginative Design Finds It's Homeless No Longer

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
THE top pick in architecture this season is New York, the city entire. Architects, planners, developers, policy makers, civic groups: we are watching you. You get one chance to make a difference. Don't blow it.
The millennial threshold could be a pivotal moment for architecture in New York. Already, good economic times have sparked a new cycle of building, with construction cranes swiveling their hips all over town. More important is the change in atmosphere. Recently, there's been a break in the climate of hostility toward architecture that has prevailed here for two decades. People are tired of developer schlock and Art Deco retreads, tired of hearing that the only good buildings are dead buildings: new ones that fake the past. 
 Several recent projects have begun to raise the stakes. These include the LVMH Tower, the Austrian Cultural Institute, the New York Presbyterian Church and the recent design for Pennsylvania Station. And in January, Conde Nast employees will have the opportunity to refresh themselves at the Titanium Cafe, the first New York project by Frank O. Gehry. But when is the country's leading architect going to get a shot at the skyline?
For a long time, architecture in this town has been boxed up behind closed doors, as if it were something to be practiced by consenting adults in the privacy of their own homes. You can find architecture in lofts, shops, restaurants or shop windows, but out on the street -- democracy's great forum for celebration and debate -- this ancient art form has long lain dormant. Where are the buildings that interpret the life of the contemporary city to its inhabitants? Buildings as lively as those hips-notizing cranes? Please show us the way to Ricky Martin Tower.
As the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas has pointed out, our older urban centers are survivors. They've earned the right to set their own terms. At the same time, American cities must compete with the suburbs for the attention and dollars of the middle class. But don't middle-class people want more than complacency, reassurance and nostalgia? Don't we know that there's a difference between a city and a theme park? These are the questions that have to be asked.
A city that prizes its social diversity lags behind other places in its efforts to protect the biodiversity of the planet. Apart from Audubon House on Broadway, a project by the Croxton Collaborative, no major building in New York has been designed with ecological factors uppermost in mind. The Architectural League of New York, a veteran team of troopers led by Rosalie Ginevro, hopes to change this. The league will dedicate its entire program this season to the subject of sustainable architecture. Entitled "Shades of Green," the schedule of lectures, shows and panel discussions will explore different ways of building for an environmentally ravaged world. The season will culminate in March, with an exhibition at the Urban Center in Manhattan that will feature 10 recent examples of architecture that responds to ecological as well as esthetic issues. Organized by Peter Buchanan, the British architecture critic, the show will include buildings by Lord Norman Foster, Thomas Herzog and Francoise Jourda.
From Oct. 18 to Nov. 19, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art will exhibit a full-scale segment of Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe, Peter Eisenman's design for a Holocaust memorial in Berlin. The project has generated considerable controversy, less for its design than for its prominent location in a city haunted by the frightened ghosts of its past.
In the cold war years, it was apparent that the West had a considerable stake in Berlin as an instrument of geopolitical strategy. Since the toppling of the Berlin wall in 1989, the city has emerged as a key to understanding the past, and even a model for reckoning with it. Eisenman's task is to show that contemporary forms can be more powerful than historical ones in linking past to present. The Cooper Union show will also include sketches and models and will be followed, in December, by an exhibition first shown in Germany, "The German Army and Genocide: Crimes Against War Prisoners, Jews and Other Civilians in the East 1939-1944."
From Nov. 14 to April 23, the Jewish Museum in Manhattan will survey the urban sensibility that Hitler's tribes set out to exterminate. Entitled "Berlin Metropolis: Jews and the New Culture, 1890-1918," the show will include paintings, posters, theater memorabilia and other turn-of-the-century artifacts. Could be essential viewing for those contemplating a visit to Berlin, a city that was poised to become the cultural capital of the 20th century before it destroyed itself.

HEADLINE: THE ANNOTATED LISTINGS -- POP AND JAZZ

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:

September
 
GILBERTO GIL
The main concern that this Brazilian master songwriter always brings to the table is renewal -- personal, ecological, social, economic, technological. And his concerts are parties, too, with a lot of elastic vocal improvising over reggae, funk and samba. Tuesday. Irving Plaza. 

WOODY GUTHRIE
"The Asch Recordings Vol. 1-4" is a four-disk set, beautifully annotated, that includes unissued and remastered material. The set makes a case that Guthrie's work -- picked from all his life experiences, from the mythopoetic to the political to the domestic and the trifling -- holds up as well as that of any musical figure from this century. Tuesday. Smithsonian Folkways.
 
TOM HARRELL
Mr. Harrell, a trumpet and fluegelhorn player, is regularly cited as one of the best melodic improvisers of his generation, but he's also an ambitious composer, and the arrangements on his records have become increasingly bold. "Time's Mirror" is his first full-fledged big-band album. Tuesday. RCA Victor.
 
STEFON HARRIS
It's exciting to see the rapid growth of the young jazz vibraphonist Stefon Harris, who began as a classical percussionist; he's hanging out with challenging players, writing his own music and making high-quality records like "Black Action Figure," his second. Tuesday. Blue Note. (Mr. Harris will also perform at the Village Vanguard the week of Oct. 19 through Oct. 24.)
 
IGGY POP
His latest release, "Avenue B," begins with the famous wild-child croaking a sober prologue in his thick Midwestern accent about how he has grown inward and bookish in his 50's. Then it proceeds to his stock topic: freaky girlfriends. Tuesday. Virgin.
 
FEMI KUTI
The son of Fela Ransome-Kuti salts his Afrobeat with the kind of sinuous old-school funk Americans have come to love in Lauryn Hill and Macy Gray; his libidinous live performances do the rest. His first domestic album, "Shoki Shoki," will appear in January from MCA; his two local performances are on Wednesday at the Roxy, 515 W. 18th St. (645-5156), and on Saturday at Vinyl, 6 Hubert St. (343-1379)
 
"ROCKIN' IN RHYTHM: THE SMALL-BAND MUSIC OF DUKE ELLINGTON"
Ellington's legacy brings to mind the sight of 14 musicians on stage, but many of his sidemen broke off from the orchestra to record small-group versions of his tunes. The guest music director for this Jazz at Lincoln Center event is the trumpeter Nicholas Payton; the vocalist Dianne Reeves and the saxophonist Joe Lovano are special guests, with members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Thursday through Saturday. Alice Tully Hall.
 
MASTERS OF INDIAN MUSIC
The sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan, one of India's best, performs duets with his son, Shujaat Husain Khan, and the tablaist Sabir Khan. Presented by the World Music Institute. Friday. Town Hall.
 
TORI AMOS
"To Venus and Back," a double-disk outpouring from the myth-obsessed pop star, has a new sound; but the fresh studio technique can't bury a music driven by Ms. Amos's actorly hunger to express herself and her Dionysian poetry. One disk is new studio material, the other live recordings. Sept. 21. Atlantic.
 
CHRIS CORNELL
In Soundgarden, Mr. Cornell was one of the few great rock singers of the 90's, and with "Euphoria Morning," the first album released by any of the band's members after its breakup two years ago, he proves with a flourish that he can write, produce and sing all by himself; his new mood in the wake of Soundgarden's sludgy sturm und drang is more fragile, full of acoustic guitars and insinuating vocals. Sept. 21. A&M. (Concert at Town Hall on Tuesday.)
 
MAGNETIC FIELDS
The witty singer and songwriter Stephin Merritt has pulled off a dare with "69 Love Songs," a triple-disk album. It seems like an attempt to raid every kind of pop song genre, from country-rock lopers to English music hall ditties to chilly electro. For some it's too clever by half, but this kind of lavish ambition, recorded with a budget that's obviously not Beck-size, is rare. Sept. 21. Merge Records.
 
NINE INCH NAILS
Trent Reznor is still miserable after all these years. But misery has rarely sounded so technologically advanced; the production values on his new album, "The Fragile," are through the roof. Sept. 21. Nothing/Interscope.
 
MATADOR RECORDS SHOWCASE
Just a little while ago, the label that defined early-90's indie rock seemed on its knees; all of a sudden it made some shrewd signings, including the hip-hop band the Arsonists and the British ditty machine Belle and Sebastian, and it's rolling again. Its 10th anniversary will be marked by three New York shows at Irving Plaza. Performers include Cornelius, Arsonists and Red Snapper on Sept. 23; Pavement, Cat Power and Chavez on Sept. 24, and Yo La Tengo, Mary Timony and Solex on Sept. 25.
 
TOM WAITS
"Mule Variations," Mr. Waits's latest album, was a comeback for the reluctant idol. It sounds like a funky, overstuffed scrapbook, and it will be interesting to see how the new material translates to the stage in Mr. Waits's first tour in a decade. Sept. 23 through Sept. 25 and Sept. 27. Beacon Theater.
 
JIM LAUDERDALE AND RALPH STANLEY
Jim Lauderdale, among the in-crowd of Nashville singer-songwriters, has teamed up with the great patriarch of bluegrass, Ralph Stanley; the result, "I Feel Like Singing Today," is a collection of old-time songs perfectly in the language of Mr. Stanley and his great ghostly tenor. Sept. 24. Rebel Records.
 
10TH ANNIVERSARY CABARET CONVENTION
Each of its seven nights presents a separate program, from "Standards for a New Generation" to a 75th birthday tribute to Julie Wilson; with appearances by Ms. Wilson, Karen Akers, Ann Hampton Calloway, Cy Coleman, Mary Cleere Haran and dozens more. Sept. 27 through Oct. 3. Town Hall.
 
MARC ANTHONY
The most popular singer in the history of salsa dares to tamper with success, seeking an audience beyond Latinos with "Marc Anthony," a record that's almost all in English. Sept. 28. Columbia. (He will appear in concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Oct. 3.)
 
EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL
"Temperamental," an opulent, gauzily lovely record informed by English club music -- house and drum-and-bass -- which somehow sums up a genre despite taking it mainstream. Sept. 28. Atlantic.
 
SOUNDTRACK FOR A CENTURY
A carefully curated, heavily annotated 26-CD boxed set covering jazz, country, Broadway, movie music, classical, rock, gospel and so on -- everything Columbia Records and its associated labels Okeh, Epic, Vocalion and others have touched since 1900. Sept. 28. Sony Music/Legacy Recordings.
 
GARTH BROOKS
His latest release, "Garth Brooks . . . in the Life of Chris Gaines," is a "pre-soundtrack" to the film "The Lamb" (to be released by Paramount toward the end of 2000) in which Mr. Brooks plays a pop singer named Chris Gaines. Mr. Brooks has said: "There's no story here about an alter ego. There's no story about Garth wanting to break out of country. There's no story here about Garth getting so fed up he's got to stretch out." Is this a Zen riddle or something? Sept. 28. Capitol.
 
LOS FABULOSOS CADILLACS
The rock-punk-rap-ska band from Argentina is the granddaddy of the rock en Espanol movement, the first group of the genre to win a Grammy; its new album is called "La Marcha del Golazo Solitario." Sept. 28. BMG/US Latin. (The band plays at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Oct. 8)
 
ISOTOPE 217
A jam band with an ever-changing lineup, it's the more jazz-related version of the Chicago band Tortoise, including some of its members. Their live shows get their fuel from Miles Davis's early-1970's methods -- polyrhythms, dense funk, Rob Mazurek's sweet trumpet lines, unexpected dropouts of sound here and there. Sept. 30-Oct. 1. Knitting Factory.
 
October
 
DAVID BOWIE
After a side trip into electronica, a return to rock-and-roll psychodrama with "Hours . . . " Oct. 5. Virgin.
 
LACE
If the Dixie Chicks weren't Spicy enough, this trio of young women aims with a new album, "Lace," to corner the young new-country market with three-part harmony and post- (or possibly pre-) feminist lyrics like "I don't want a man I can live with / I want a man I can't live without." Oct. 5. 143/Warner Brothers.
 
PAUL McCARTNEY
A new album, "Run Devil Run," includes 12 rock-and-roll oldies, 3 new McCartney originals, no oratorios. Oct. 5. Capitol.
 
TERI THORNTON
"I'll Be Easy to Find" is the second-time-around debut of a jazz singer who's been at it for four decades but found new interest from the music business upon winning the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz vocal competition last year. Oct 12. Verve. (Ms. Thornton will perform at the Village Vanguard the week of Oct. 12 through Oct. 17.)
 
THE MUSIC OF CHARLIE PARKER
An evergreen subject for institutional jazz orchestras; this one splits the bill between a quintet featuring the saxophonist Charles McPherson and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band playing new arrangements of classic Parker tunes. Oct. 14. Carnegie Hall.
 
COME FLY WITH ME: THE SONGS OF JIMMY VAN HEUSEN
The second season of Lincoln Center's American Songbook series opens with a homage to the writer of some of Bing Crosby's and Frank Sinatra's biggest songs. With Gregg Edelman, Jackie Cain and Roy Kral, Maureen McGovern and Leslie Uggams. Oct. 15 and 16. Alice Tully Hall.
 
HANDSOME BOY MODELING SCHOOL
The new project from Prince Paul, the former De La Soul producer whose last move was a surprisingly effective narrative drama -- complete with a cast of characters -- pulled across the length of a hip-hop album. It's called "So . . . How's Your Girl?" Oct. 19. Tommy Boy.
 
ARTO LINDSAY
The American-born, Brazilian-raised Mr. Lindsay has a good sense for what sounds stimulate the intelligentsia just on the tail end of its hanging-out years; his recent records are smart dance music for the home stereo, with hints of Brazilian rhythm rumbling underneath Mr. Lindsay's serene croon. "Prize" comes out on Oct. 19. Righteous Babe.
 
ORQUESTA IBRAHIM FERRER/RUBEN GONZALEZ Y SU GRUPO
Two years later, "Buena Vista Social Club," the album that piqued North America's interest in Cuban culture, is still selling well, thanks in part to Wim Wenders's documentary film about its genesis. These are the next two appearances (with more to come soon) of the Social Club's stars, the charismatic singer Mr. Ferrer and the pianist Mr. Gonzalez. Oct. 22 and Feb. 4 and 5. Beacon Theater.
 
BOB MARLEY: A REBEL'S DREAM
A tape-manipulated duet-remix-tribute album, organized by Marley's son Stephen. Marley's voice accompanies new vocal and instrumental tracks with Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, the Roots, Busta Rhymes, Guru and others. Oct. 26. Island/Def Jam.
 
PAOLO CONTE
A hero in Italy and France with a pothole of a voice, he's an appealingly gruff chansonnier: he sings songs in Italian about memories, his own stubbornness and the loveliness of jazz. If an American did this, kitsch would take it over. But Mr. Conte plays it straight, making us think for ourselves. Oct. 28. Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th St. between Park and Lexington Aves. (772-4448)
 
RICKY MARTIN
His publicists have done their work; now it's time for Mr. Martin himself, the crossover prince, to impress audiences here. Oct. 28. Madison Square Garden, Seventh Ave. at 32d St. (465-6741)
 
DAVE DOUGLAS
It's a typically busy season for the trumpeter and band leader, whose many different bands explore different angles. His Tiny Bell Trio, with a large repertory of skewed Balkan tunes, plays the Knitting Factory Oct. 28 through Oct. 31; his jazz-quartet album "Leap of Faith" will be released by Arabesque on Feb. 1; his sextet album, with violin and cello, appears on RCA Feb. 8, and his debut week at the Village Vanguard, with his quartet, is set for Feb. 15 through Feb. 20.
 
November
 
THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS PRINCE
There's no way to predict gold or dross in the Artist's unstoppable flow, but his next album, "Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic," intriguingly says that it's produced by someone named "Prince." Nov. 2. Arista. (A related article appears on page 89.)
 
FRANK EMILIO
A creator of Cuban jazz in the 40's and the 50's, Mr. Emilio is a blind pianist a stone's throw from the age of 80; "Ancestral Reflections" is an elegant record of rumbas and danzones about his musical past, with an eight-piece Cuban band. Nov. 2. Metro Blue/Capitol. (Recitals at the Stanley Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center, Jan. 13 and 14.)
 
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE
This band will never have a shortage of political topics to fume about, and its steamroller sound directly inspired much of the new hard rock; with its next album (as yet untitled), it must prove its staying power. Nov. 2. Epic.
 
COMPAY SEGUNDO
A new album, "Calle Salud," from the 90-plus guitarist who took part in the "Buena Vista Social Club" sessions. Nov. 2. Nonesuch/Atlantic. (Concert at Town Hall, Nov. 3.)
 
"MUSIC OF THELONIOUS MONK: A NEW PERSPECTIVE"
There's much still to be done with Thelonious Monk's work, which was harmonically rich and implied as much as it stated. The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, with a reputation for radical reinterpretation of the jazz canon, is perfect for the job. Guest artists are two pre-eminent interpreters of Monk's music: the pianist Kenny Barron and the soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy. Nov. 4. Carnegie Hall.
 
CAVESTOMP '99
A garage-rock bonanza, disinterring some great bands from the 60's and combining them on three days of long bills with their neoprimitivist progeny. Headlining Nov. 5: the Monks, a German band that hasn't performed in 32 years and has never performed in America. Nov. 6: the Chocolate Watch Band, who in 1967 asked provocatively, "Are You Gonna Be There (at the Love-In)?" Nov. 7: the Standells, who haven't sung about Boston's dirty water in 30 years. Dress code: love beads and motorcycle boots. Westbeth Theater Center, 151 Bank St. (691-2272)
 
SONIC YOUTH
The members of Sonic Youth have accomplished quite a lot of things -- dueting with Cecil Taylor, modeling, popularizing alternative rock, playing feedback solos at Avery Fisher Hall. But with their new album, "SYR4," they try something they they have not done before: making a sobersided double-disk album of notated pieces by avant-classical composers like James Tenney, Christian Wolff and John Cage. Nov. 8. SYR/Smells Like Records.
 
FIONA APPLE
If "Fast as You Can," the single from Ms. Apple's second album, "When the Pawn . . . ," is a portent, we can expect curiously written songs with shifting tempos; if these songs had eyes, they would be staring at you, making you uncomfortable. Nov. 9. Clean Slate/Epic.
 
BECK
His new album is positioned as the sample-mad, ultra-witty follow-up to "Odelay"; last year's "Mutations" was merely a soothing intermission act. Nov. 16. Geffen/Interscope.
 
ENRIQUE IGLESIAS
The debut English-language album (as yet untitled) from a new Latin crossover pop star whose single "Bailamos" has been a No. 1 hit this summer. Nov. 16. Interscope.
 
D'ANGELO
There are a lot of pop stars fighting to become prince of retro-soul, and "Voodoo," the second album by this young performer, may render them weaponless. Recorded live in the studio, finally finished after an eternity of rumors, it's going to be good, but the question is whether it will be as lasting -- in the mercilessly shifting context of pop today -- as records like Sly and the Family Stone's "There's a Riot Goin' On" or Stevie Wonder's "Innervisions," two of its templates. Nov. 23. Cheeba Sound/Virgin.
 
WYNTON MARSALIS
"Live at the Village Vanguard," a seven-disk set drawn from concert performances from 1985 to the mid-90's, may be the most powerful among Mr. Marsalis's onslaught of album releases in 1999; it will show us what we're missing by not having his small band around anymore. Nov. 23. Columbia Jazz.
 
December
 
MAD ABOUT THE BOY
A full-fledged tribute to Noel Coward in his centennial year, using Coward's memoirs, lyrics and scripts, and featuring Karen Akers, Barbara Cook, Michael Feinstein, Bobby Short, Lynn Redgrave and many more. Dec. 1. Carnegie Hall.
 
METHOD MAN
Always the most widely appealing of the Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man is a showman, a bearish rapper who aims to please, rather than to freak you out. Having struck gold with his solo album last year, he's looking to capitalize on his success with his next CD (as yet untitled) -- and perhaps to gain distance from the Clan's dropping stock. Dec. 8. Def Jam.
 
IN HIS SOLITUDE: THE SACRED MUSIC OF DUKE ELLINGTON
Eric Reed conducts the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra in this Jazz at Lincoln Center program, which will include some of Ellington's last works, the relatively underappreciated "Sacred Concerts." It's time for a re-evaluation, and the gospel singer Shirley Caesar, one of the greatest performers on American stages right now, will help that happen. Dec. 9 through Dec. 12. Alice Tully Hall.
 
PARTY AT THE END OF TIME: 1999 LIVE
Featuring the Roots, with Vernon Reid, P.M. Dawn and N'Dea Davenport. Live shows are the essence of the Roots: they've got a live band to make their hip-hop more immediate and flexible. Usually they're following their own agenda, doing their own workshop, but here they'll be the house band for a beginning-to-end cover of Prince's album "1999." Dec. 11. BAM Opera House, 30 Lafayette Ave., Fort Greene, Brooklyn. (718-636-4100).
 
TROMBONE TITANS
Get three jazz trombone players together -- with the battling aggression of trumpeters, but more of a sense of humor -- and there's bound to be trouble. Al Grey, Ray Anderson and Wycliffe Gordon have that humor, as well as virtuosity, making this show look memorable. Dec. 16. Pace Downtown Theater, 3 Spruce St. (346-1715)
 
DMX and JAY-Z
Two separate end-of-the-year mop-up records by the hottest names in hip-hop -- one rapper whose material is growled and encoded to describe a black Gotham, another whose last few records have been the shiniest, bouncingest blowout parties of rap. Dec. 21 and Dec. 27. Def Jam.
 
NEW YEAR'S EVE
Will the power turn off at midnight? Working at the Javits Center, 655 W. 34th St. (216-2000), if there are enough generators: Andrea Bocelli, Aretha Franklin, Chuck Berry, Enrique Iglesias, Sting, Tom Jones, Kool and the Gang. At Irving Plaza: Maceo Parker. Dec. 31.
 
January
 
SHELBY LYNNE
From a virtual unknown, a Southern singer-songwriter album that really sticks in your head. Her new album, "I Am Shelby Lynne," mixes rhythm machines with string sections, flute with pedal steel, guitar-driven Memphis soul with folk music; her voice lurches and staggers and then hits you over the head with a bright, well-written chorus. Jan. 11. Mercury/Island/Def Jam.
 
CLINTON
It's the return of Cornershop, the Indian-English band, under a different name; the idea is to give its new material -- sly, warped, low-fidelity drone-disco -- a new package. The album, "Disco and the Halfway to Discontent," is out in England now, and it may turn out to be one of the funny-but-funky pleasures of the year. January. Luaka Bop Records.
 
February
 
CAMPBELL BROTHERS WITH KATIE JACKSON
Chuck and Phillip Campbell's band has a regular gig at the House of God, a Pentecostal church in Rochester. Their sound incorporates the steel guitar, and it's a natural fit -- it slides, wails and swoops around spirituals. Katie Jackson, a singer from Baltimore, does the rest of the vocalizing. Opening is McCollough's Sons of Thunder, a Harlem-based gospel "shout" band that battles its way to grace with a phalanx of trombones. Feb. 19. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th St. (864-5400)
 
March
 
LOUIS ARMSTRONG: ONE HUNDRED YEARS
A centennial bash thrown by the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band for the musician who invented hipness; the trumpeter Clark Terry is the guest performer in a repertory drawn from the Hot Five and Hot Seven records, as well as Armstrong's 1930's big band. March 16. Carnegie Hall.

HEADLINE: Back to School, 1958

BYLINE: By Frank McCourt; Frank McCourt is the author of "Angela's Ashes." This is an excerpt from his new memoir, "'Tis," to be published this month by Scribner.

 BODY:
In the middle of March 1958, there's a notice in the paper, "Vacancy for English teacher at McKee Vocational and Technical High School, Staten Island." The assistant principal, Miss Seested, examines my license and takes me to see the principal, Moses Sorola, who doesn't move from his chair behind the desk where he squints at me through a cloud of smoke drifting from his nose and from the cigarette in his hand. He says this is an emergency situation. The teacher I'd be replacing, Miss Mudd, has made an abrupt decision to retire in the middle of the term. He says teachers like that are inconsiderate and make life hard for a principal. He doesn't have a full English program for me, I'd have to teach three classes in Social Studies every day, two in English.
But I don't know anything about Social Studies. 
 He puffs and squints and says, Don't worry about it, and takes me to the office of the academic chairman, acting, who says I'll be teaching three classes of Economic Citizenship and here's the textbook, "Your World and You." Mr. Sorola smiles through the smoke and says, Your world and you. That should cover just about everything.
I tell him I know nothing about economics or citizenship and he says, Just stay a few pages ahead of the kids. Everything you tell them will be news. Tell them this is 1958, tell them their names, tell them they live on Staten Island, and they'll be surprised and grateful for the information. By the end of the year even your name will be news to them.
He takes me to see Miss Mudd. When he opens the classroom door, boys and girls are leaning out the windows calling to others across the schoolyard. Miss Mudd sits at her desk, reading travel brochures, ignoring the paper airplane that zooms over her head.
Miss Mudd has retired. Mr. Sorola leaves the room and she says to me, That's right, young man, I can't wait to get outta here. What's this? Wednesday? Friday's my last day and you're welcome to this loony bin. Thirty-two years I've been at this and who cares? The kids? Parents? We teach their brats and they pay us like dishwashers. What was the year? Nineteen and twenty-six. Calvin Coolidge was in. I came in.
I worked right through him and the Depression man, Hoover, and Roosevelt and Truman and Eisenhower. Look out that window. You got a good view of New York Harbor from here and Monday morning if these kids aren't driving you crazy you'll see a big ship sailing by and that'll be me on the deck waving, waving and smiling, because there's two things I never want to see again in my life, with God's help, Staten Island and kids. Monsters, monsters. Look at 'em. You'd be better off working with chimpanzees in the Bronx Zoo. What's this? Nineteen and fifty-eight. How did I ever last? You'd need to be Joe Louis. So, good luck, son. You're gonna need it.
before i leave mr. sorola says i should return the next day to observe Miss Mudd with her five classes. I'd learn something about procedure. He says half of teaching is procedure and I don't know what he's talking about. He pushes my typed program across the desk, three classes of E.C., Economic Citizenship, two classes of E4, sophomore English in the fourth term. The top of the program card says, "Official Class, P.R.A.," and at the bottom, "Building Assignment, School Cafeteria, fifth period." I don't ask Mr. Sorola what these mean for fear he might think I'm ignorant and change his mind about hiring me.
As I make my way down the hill to the ferry a boy's voice calls, Mr. McCourt, Mr. McCourt, are you Mr. McCourt?
I am.
Mr. Sorola would like to see you again.
I follow the student up the hill and I know why Mr. Sorola wants to see me again. He has changed his mind. He's found someone with experience, someone with a grasp of procedure, someone who knows what an official class is. If I don't get this job I'll have to start my search again.
Mr. Sorola waits at the front door of the school. He lets his cigarette dangle from his mouth and puts his hand on my shoulder. He says, I have good news for you. The job is opening sooner than we expected. Miss Mudd must have been impressed by you because she decided to leave today. In fact she's gone, out the back door, and it's barely noon. So we're wondering if you can take over tomorrow and then you won't have to wait till Monday.
But I. . . .
Yeah, I know. You're not ready. That's O.K. We'll give you some stuff to keep the kids busy till you get the hang of it and I'll look in from time to time to keep them in line.
Of course I say, Yes, I'll be in tomorrow.
I sit on the Staten Island Ferry thinking of teacher recruiters at N.Y.U. from suburban high schools, how they told me I seemed intelligent and enthusiastic but really my accent would be a problem. I wanted to work in one of their suburban schools, Long Island, Westchester, where the boys and girls were bright, cheerful, smiling, attentive, their pens poised as I discoursed on "Beowulf," "The Canterbury Tales," the Cavalier poets, the metaphysicals. I'd be admired and once the boys and girls had passed my classes their parents would surely invite me to dinner at the finest houses. Young mothers would come to see me about their children and who could tell what might happen when husbands were absent, the men in gray flannel suits.
I'll have to forget the suburbs. I have here on my lap the book that will help me through my first day of teaching, "Your World and You," and I flip the pages through a short history of the United States from an economic point of view, chapters on American Government, the banking system, how to read the stock market pages, how to open a savings account.
At the end of each chapter there are questions of fact and questions for discussion. What caused the stock market crash of 1929? How can this be avoided in future? If you wanted to save money and gain interest would you (a) keep it in a glass jar, (b) invest in the Japanese stock market, (c) keep it under your mattress, (d) put it in a savings account?
There are suggested activities, with insertions penciled in by a former student. Call a family meeting and discuss your family finances with Dad and Mom. Show them from your study of this book how they might improve their bookkeeping. (Insertion: Don't be surprised if they beat you up.) Take a tour of the New York Stock Exchange with your class. (They'll be glad to get out of school for a day.) Think of a product your community might need and start a small company to supply it. (Try Spanish fly.) Interview a number of people who remember the crash of 1929 and write a 1,000-word report. (Ask them why they didn't commit suicide.)
The ferry sails by Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty and I'm so worried about Economic Citizenship I don't even think of the millions who landed here and the ones who were sent back with the bad eyes and the weak chests. I don't know how I'll be able to stand before these American teen-agers and talk to them about the branches of Government and preach the virtues of saving when I owe money everywhere myself. And with the ferry sliding into its slip and the day that's facing me tomorrow why shouldn't I treat myself to a few beers at the Bean Pot bar and after those few beers why shouldn't I take a train to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village to chat with Paddy
and Tom Clancy and listen to them sing in the back room? When I call my girlfriend, Mike Small, to tell her the good news about the new job she wants to know where I am and gives me a lecture on the stupidity of staying out drinking beer the night before the most important day of my life.
Even though I have a college degree I don't know what I'm going to say to Miss Mudd's classes. Should I be Robert Donat in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" or Glenn Ford in "The Blackboard Jungle"? Should I swagger into the classroom like James Cagney or march in like an Irish schoolmaster with a stick, a strap and a roar? If a student sends a paper airplane zooming at me should I shove my face into his and tell him, Try that one more time, kid, and you're in trouble? What am I to do with the ones looking out the window calling to their friends across the yard? Paddy Clancy leaves his singing in the back room of the White Horse and tells me he wouldn't be in my shoes for anything. Everyone knows what the high schools in this country are like.
Back in my apartment I fall into bed with all my clothes on and even though I'm worn out with the long day and the beer I can't sleep. I keep getting up to read chapters of "Your World and You," testing myself with questions of fact, imagining what I'm going to say about the stock market, the differences between stocks and bonds, the three branches of Government, the recession of this year, the depression of that year, and I might as well get up, go out, and fill myself with coffee to keep me going the rest of the day.
At dawn I sit in a coffee shop on Hudson Street with longshoremen, truck drivers, warehousemen, checkers. Why shouldn't I live like them? They work their eight hours a day, read The Daily News, follow baseball, have a few beers, go home to their wives, raise their kids. They're paid better than teachers and they don't have to worry about "Your World and You" and sex-crazed teen-agers who don't want to be in your class. In 20 years workingmen can retire and sit in the Florida sun, waiting for lunch and dinner. I could call McKee Vocational and Technical High School and tell them, Forget it, I want an easier life. I could tell Mr. Sorola they're looking for a checker at the Baker and Williams Warehouse, a job I could easily get with my college degree, and all I'd have to do the rest of my life is stand on the platform with manifests on a clipboard checking what comes and what goes.
Then I think of what Mike Small would say if I told her, No, I didn't go to McKee high school today. I took a job as a checker with Baker and Williams. She'd have a tantrum. She'd say, All that work in college to be a goddamn checker down at the docks? She might throw me out of the house and return to the arms of Bob the football player and I'd be alone in the world, forced to go to Irish dances and take home girls reserving their bodies for the wedding night.
The school secretary tells me to see Miss Seested who tells me to see Mr. Sorola who tells me to see the chairman of the academic department who says I have to check in with the school secretary to get my timecard and why were they sending me to him in the first place?
The school secretary says, Oh, back already? and shows me how to dip my timecard into the time clock, how to place it in my slot on the In side and how to move it to the Out side. She says that if I have to leave the building for any reason whatsoever, even during my lunch period, I'm to sign out and back in with her because you never know when you might be needed, never know when there might be an emergency and you can't have teachers wandering in and out, back and forth at will. She tells me, See Miss Seested, who looks surprised. Oh, you're back, she says, and gives me a red Delaney book, the attendance book for my classes. She says, Of course you know how to use this, and I pretend I do for fear of being thought stupid. She sends me back to the school secretary for my homeroom attendance book and I have to lie to the secretary, too, and tell her I know how to use it. She says if I have any problems ask the kids. They know more than the teachers.
Students jostle me in the hallway. They push and scuffle and laugh. Don't they know I'm a teacher? Can't they see under my arm two attendance books and "Your World and You"? The schoolmasters in Limerick would never tolerate this carrying-on. They'd march up and down the halls with sticks and if you didn't walk properly you'd get that stick across the backs of your legs so you would.
And what am I supposed to do with this class, the first in my whole teaching career, students of Economic Citizenship, pelting one another with chalk, erasers, bologna sandwiches? When I walk in and place my books on the teacher's desk they'll surely stop throwing things. But they don't. They ignore me and I don't know what to do till the words come out of my mouth, the first words I ever utter as a teacher, Stop throwing sandwiches. They look at me as if to say, Who's this guy?
The bell signals the start of the class and the students slide into their seats. They whisper to one another, they look at me, laugh, whisper again and I'm sorry I ever set foot on Staten Island. They turn to look at the blackboard along the side of the room where someone has printed in a large scrawl "Miss Mudd Is Gone. The Old Bag Reetired," and when they see me looking at it they whisper and laugh again. I open my copy of "Your World and You" as if to start a lesson till a girl raises her hand.
Yes?
Teacher, ain'tcha gonna take the attendance?
Oh, yes, I am.
That's my job, teacher.
When she sways up the aisle to my desk the boys make woo woo sounds and, Whaddya doin' the rest of my life, Daniela? She comes behind my desk, faces the class, and when she leans over to open the Delaney book it's easy to see her blouse is too small and that starts the woo woo all over again.
She smiles because she knows what the psychology books told us at N.Y.U., that a 15-year-old girl is years ahead of a boy that age and if they want to shower her with woo woos it means nothing. She whispers to me she's already going out with a senior, a football player up at Curtis High School, where all the kids are smart, not a bunch of auto mechanic grease monkeys like the ones in this class. She takes her time with the attendance book and I'm a fool standing off to the side, waiting. I know she's teasing the boys and I wonder if she's toying with me, too, showing her control of the class with a well-filled blouse and keeping me from whatever I might want to do with Economic Citizenship. When she calls the name of someone who was absent yesterday she demands a parent's note and if the absentee doesn't have it she reprimands him and writes N on the card. She reminds the class that five N's could get you an F on your report card and turns to me, Isn't that right, teacher?
I don't know what to say. I nod. I blush.
Another girl calls out, Hey, teach, you cute, and I blush harder than ever. The boys roar and slap the desks with their open palms and the girls smile at one another. They say, You crazy, Yvonne, to the one who called me cute, and she tells them, But he is, he's really cute, and I wonder if the redness will ever leave my face, if I'll ever be able to stand here and talk about Economic Citizenship, if I'll be forever at the mercy of Daniela and Yvonne.
Daniela says she's finished with the attendance and now she needs the pass to go to the bathroom. She takes a piece of wood from a drawer and wiggles her way out the door to another woo woo chorus and one boy calling to another, Joey, stand up, Joey, let's see how much you love her, let's see you stand, Joey, and Joey blushes so hard there's a wave of laughter and giggling across the room.
We're halfway through the period and I haven't said a word about Economic Citizenship. I pick up "Your World and You" and tell them, O.K., open your book to chapter, ah, what chapter were you up to?
We weren't up to no chapter.
You mean you weren't up to any chapter. Any chapter.
No, I mean we weren't up to no chapter. Miss Mudd didn't teach us nothing.
Miss Mudd didn't teach you anything. Anything.
Hey, teacher, why you repeating everything I'm sayin'? Nothing. Anything. Miss Mudd never bothered us like that. Miss Mudd was nice.
They nod and murmur, Yeah, Miss Mudd was nice, and I feel I have to compete with her even if they drove her into retirement.
A hand is up.
Yes?
Teacher, you Scotch or somethin'?
No. Irish.
Oh, yeah? Irish like to drink, eh? All that whisky, eh? You gonna be here Paddy's Day?
I'll be here on St. Patrick's Day.
You not gonna be drunk an' throwin' up at the parade like all the Irish?
I said I'll be here. All right, open your books.
A hand.
What books, teacher?
This book, "Your World and You."
We ain't got that book, teacher.
We don't have that book.
There you go again repeatin' everything we say.
We have to speak proper English.
Teacher, this ain't no English class. This is Ecanawmic Cizzenship. We supposed to be learnin' about money an' all an' you ain't teachin' us about money.
Daniela returns just as another hand is raised. Teacher, what's your name? Daniela returns the pass to the desk and tells the class, His name is McCoy. I just found out in the bathroom an' he ain't married.
I print my name on the blackboard, Mr. McCourt.
A girl in the back of the room calls out, Mister, you got a girlfriend?
Open your books. Chapter 1. We'll start at the beginning. "A Brief History of the United States of America."
Mr. McCoy.
McCourt. McCourt.
O.K., yeah, we know all that about Columbus an' everything. We get that in history class with Mr. Bogard. He'll be mad if you teach history an' he's gettin' paid to teach it an' that's not your job.
I have to teach what's in the book.
Miss Mudd didn't teach what's in the book.
And when the bell rings and they rush from the room Daniela comes to my desk and tells me not to worry, don't lissena these kids, they're all so stoopid, she's taking the commercial course to be a legal secretary, and who knows she might be a lawyer herself someday.
There are 35 girls in the next class, all dressed in white with buttons down the front from neck to hem. Most have the same hairstyle, the beehive. They ignore me. They set up little boxes on their desks and peer into mirrors. They pluck their eyebrows, they dab at their cheeks with powder puffs, they apply lipstick and pull their lips back between their teeth, they file their nails and blow at the nail dust. I open the Delaney book to call their names and they look surprised. Oh, you the substitute? Where's Miss Mudd?
She has retired.
Oh, you gonna be our regular teacher?
Yes.
I ask them what shop they're in, what they're studying.
Cosmetology.
What's that?
Beauty Culture. And what's your name, teacher?
I point to my name on the board. Mr. McCourt.
Oh, yeah. Yvonne said you was cute.
I let this pass. If I attempt to correct every grammatical error in these classes I'll never get to Economic Citizenship and, worse, if I'm asked to explain the rules of grammar I'm bound to show my ignorance. I will put up with no distractions. I will begin with Chapter 1 from "Your World and You," "A Brief History of the United States." I flip the pages from Columbus to the Pilgrims to the War of Independence, the War of 1812, the Civil War, and there's a hand and a voice in the back of the room.
Yes?
Mr. McCourt, why you telling us this stuff?
I'm telling you this because you can't understand Economic Citizenship unless you have a grasp of the history of your country.
Mr. McCourt, this is an English class. I mean you're the teacher an' you don't even know what class you're teaching.
They pluck their eyebrows, they file their nails, they shake their beehives, they pity me. They tell me my hair is a mess and it's easy to see I never had a manicure in my life.
Why don'tcha come up to Beauty Culture Shop an' we'll do you?
I have to take control. I have to be the teacher. After all, I was once a corporal in the United States Army. I told men what to do and if they didn't do it they'd be in direct defiance of military regulations and subject to court-martial. I will simply tell these girls what to do.
Put everything away and open your books.
What books?
Whatever books you have for English.
All we got is this "Giants in the Earth" and that's the most boring book in the world. And the whole class chants, Uh, huh, boring, boring, boring.
They tell me it's about some family from
Europe out there on the prairie and everyone is depressed and talking about suicide and no one in the class can finish this book because it makes you want to commit suicide yourself. Why can't they read a nice romance where
you don't have all these Europe people all gloomy on the prairie? Or why couldn't they watch movies? They could watch James Dean, oh, gawd, James Dean, can't believe he's dead, they could watch him and talk about him.
Oh, they could watch James Dean forever.
When the Beauty Culture girls leave there is homeroom, an eight-minute period when I have to take care of the clerical work for 33 students from Printing Shop. They swarm in, all boys, and they're helpful. They tell me what has to be done and not to worry. I am to take attendance, send a list of absentees to Miss Seested, collect absentee excuse notes supposedly written by parents and doctors, distribute transportation passes for bus, train, ferry. The boys tell me I don't have to take attendance every day but once I start I can't stop. Most are Italian and taking the attendance is light opera: Adinolfi, Buscaglia, Cacciamani, DiFazio, Esposito, Gagliardo, Miceli.
I'm supposed to lead the class in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing "The Star-Spangled Banner." I barely know them but that doesn't matter. The boys stand, place their hands on their hearts and recite their own version of the Pledge, I pledge allegiance to the flag of Staten Island, and to one-night stands, one girl under me, invisible to all, with love and kisses for me only me.
When they sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" some hum along with "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog."
There's a note from the academic chairman requesting I go to his office next period, the third, my prep period when I'm supposed to plan my lessons. He tells me I should have a lesson plan for every class and there is a standard form for lesson plans, I should insist all students keep notebooks that are clean and neat, I should make sure their textbooks are covered, points off if they don't, I should check to see that windows are open six inches from the top, I should send a student around the room at the end of every period to collect litter, I should stand at the door to greet classes entering and again leaving, I should print clearly on the blackboard the title and aim of every lesson, I should never ask a question requiring a yes or no answer, I shouldn't allow unnecessary noise in the room, I should require all students to stay in their seats unless they raise their hands for the bathroom pass, I should insist on boys removing their hats, I should make it clear that no student is allowed to speak without first raising his hand. I should make sure all students stay till the end of the period. If my students are caught in the hallways before the end of the period I'll have to answer to the principal himself. Any questions?
The bell rings for the fifth period, my Building Assignment, the school cafeteria. The chairman tells me that's an easy assignment. I'll be up there with Jake Homer, the teacher the kids fear most.
I climb the stairs to the cafeteria, my head throbbing, my mouth dry and I wish I could sail away with Miss Mudd. Instead I'm pushed and jostled by students on the staircase and stopped by a teacher who demands to see my pass. He's short and broad and his bald head sits, neckless, on his shoulders. He glares at me through thick glasses and his chin is a challenging jut. I tell him I'm a teacher and he won't believe me. He wants to see my program card. Oh, he says, I'm sorry. You're McCourt. I'm Jake Homer. We'll be in the cafeteria together. I follow him upstairs and along the hallway to the students' cafeteria. There are two lines waiting to be served in the kitchen, a boys and a girls. Jake tells me that's one of the big problems, keeping the boys and girls separated. He says they're animals at this age, especially the boys, and it's not their fault. It's nature. If he had his way he'd have the girls in a separate cafeteria altogether. The boys are always strutting and showing off and if two like the same girl there's bound to be a fight. He tells me if there is a fight don't interfere right away. Let the little bastards go at it and get it out of their systems. It's worse in the warm weather, May, June, when the girls take off their sweaters and the boys go crazy. The girls know what they're doing and the boys are like lap dogs, panting.
Jake asks if I've ever been in the Army and when I tell him yes he says, Bet you didn't know you'd be pulling this kind of detail when you decided to become a teacher. Bet you didn't know you'd be a cafeteria guard, a garbage supervisor, a psychologist, a baby sitter, eh? Tells you what they think of teachers in this country that you have to spend hours of your life looking at these kids eating like pigs and telling them clean up afterward. Doctors and lawyers don't run around telling people clean up. You won't find teachers in Europe stuck with this kind of thing. Over there a high-school teacher is treated like a professor.
A boy carrying his tray to the kitchen doesn't notice that an ice cream wrapper has fallen from his tray. On the way back to his table Jake calls him over.
Kid, pick up that ice cream wrapper.
The boy is defiant. I didn't drop that.
Kid, I didn't ask you that. I said pick it up.
I don't have to pick it up. I know my rights.
Come here, kid. I'll tell you your rights.
It is suddenly quiet in the cafeteria. With everyone looking on, Jake grabs the skin over the boy's left shoulder blade and twists it clockwise. Kid, he says, you have five rights. No. 1, you shut up. No. 2, you do what you're told, and the other three don't count.
As Jake twists the skin the boy tries not to grimace, tries to look good, till Jake twists so hard the boy's knees buckle and he cries, All right, all right, Mr. Homer, all right. I'll pick up the paper.
Jake releases him. O.K., kid. I can see you're a reasonable kid.
He stands by me near the kitchen and tells me, You gotta come down on the little bastards like a ton of bricks. Then he says to a boy standing before us, Yes, son?
Mr. Homer, I gotta give you back the dollar I owe you.
What was that, son?
Day I didn't have lunch money last month. You gave me a lend of a buck.
Forget it, son. Get yourself an ice cream.
But, Mr. Homer.
Go on, son. Get yourself a treat.
Thanks, Mr. Homer.
O.K., kid.
He tells me, That's a nice kid. You wouldn't believe what a hard time he has, still comes to school. His father tortured, nearly killed by a Mussolini gang in Italy. Jesus, you wouldn't believe the hard times they have, these kids' families, and this is the richest country in the world. Count your blessings, McCourt. Mind if I call you Frank?
Not at all, Mr. Homer.
Call me Jake.
O.K., Jake.
It's my lunch hour and he directs me to the teachers' cafeteria on the top floor. Mr. Sorola sees me and introduces me to teachers at different tables, Mr. Roantree, Printing, Mr. Kriegsman, Health Ed., Mr. Gordon, Machine Shop, Miss Gilfillan, Art, Mr. Garber, Speech, Mr. Bogard, Social Studies, Mr. Maratea, Social Studies.
I take my tray with sandwich and coffee and sit at an empty table but Mr. Bogard comes over, tells me his name is Bob, and invites me to sit with him and the other teachers. Jack Kriegsman says, Your first day, eh? You sure you want to do this?
Some teachers laugh and shake their heads as if to say they're sorry they ever got into this. Bob Bogard doesn't laugh. He leans across the table and says, If there's any profession more important than teaching I'd like to know what it is. No one seems to know what to say after that till Stanley Garber asks me what subject I teach.
English. Well, not exactly. They have me teaching three classes of Economic Citizenship. When the bell rings Bob Bogard and Stanley Garber walk me downstairs and Bob tells me he knows the situation in Miss Mudd's classes, that the kids are wild after weeks where there was no teaching, and if I need help to let him know. I tell him I do need help. I'd like to know what the hell I'm supposed to do with Economic Citizenship classes facing midterm exams in two weeks that haven't even looked at the book. How am I supposed to give grades on report cards based on nothing?
Stanley says, Don't worry. A lot of the report card grades in this school are based on nothing anyway. There are kids here reading on a third-grade level and it's not your fault. They should be in elementary school but they can't be kept there because they're six feet tall, too big for the furniture and trouble for the teachers. You'll see.
He and Bob Bogard look at my program and shake their heads. Three classes at the end of the day. That's the worst possible program you can get. The kids have had their lunch and they're all charged up with protein and sugar and they want to be outside horsing around. Sex. That's all it is, says Stanley. Sex, sex, sex. Good luck, says Stanley.
Let me know if I can help, says Bob.
I grapple with the protein and the sugar and the sex sex sex in periods six, seven and eight but I'm silenced by a hail of questions and objections. Where's Miss Mudd? She dead? She eloped? Ha ha ha. You our new teacher? You gonna be with us forever and ever? You got a girlfriend, teacher? No, we don't have no "World and You." Dumb book. Why can't we talk about movies? I had a teacher in fifth grade talked about movies all the time and they fired her. She was a great teacher. Teacher, don't forget to take the attendance. Miss Mudd always took the attendance.
The sophomore English students break into cheers at the news that Miss Mudd is gone forever. She was mean. She tried to make them read that boring book "Giants in the Earth," and she said when they were finished with that they'd have to read "Silas Marner" and Louis by the window who reads lots of books told everyone it's a book about a dirty old man in England and a little girl and that's the kind of book we shouldn't be reading in America.
Miss Mudd said they'd have to read "Silas Marner" because there was a midterm exam coming up and they'd have to write an essay comparing it with "Giants in the Earth" and the students in eighth-period sophomore English would like to know where does she get off thinking you can compare a book about gloomy people on the prairie with a book about a dirty old man in England?
They cheer again. They tell me, We don't want to read no dumb books.
You mean you don't want to read any dumb books.
What?
Oh, nothing. The warning bell rings and they gather up their coats and bags to pile out the door. I have to shout, Sit down. That's the warning bell.
They look surprised. What's up, teacher?
You're not supposed to leave at the warning bell.
Miss Mudd let us leave.
I'm not Miss Mudd.
Miss Mudd was nice. She let us leave. Why you so mean?
They're out the door and I can't stop them. Mr. Sorola is in the hallway to tell me my students are not supposed to leave at the warning bell.
I know, Mr. Sorola. I couldn't stop them.
Well, Mr. McCourt, a little more discipline tomorrow, eh?
On St. Patrick's Day, they bring me green things, a potato sprayed, a green bagel, a bottle of Heineken because it's green, a head of cabbage with holes for eyes, nose, mouth, wearing a little green leprechaun cap made in the art room. The cabbage is Kevin and has a girlfriend, an eggplant named Maureen. There is a greeting card 2 feet by 2 wishing me Happy St. Paddy's Day signed by dozens of students from my five classes and decorated with happy faces shaped like shamrocks.
The classes are noisy. Hey, Mr. McCourt, how come you ain't wearin' green? Because he don't have to, stoopid, he's Irish. Mr. McCourt, whyn't you goin' to the parade? Because he just started this job. Chrissakes, he's here only a week.
Mr. Sorola opens the door. Is everything all right, Mr. McCourt?
Oh, yes.
He comes to my desk, looks at the card, smiles. They must like you, eh? And you've been here how long? A week?
Almost.
Well, this is very nice but see if you can get them back to work. He goes toward the door and he's followed by, Happy Paddy's Day, Mr. Sorola, but he leaves without turning around. When someone at the back of the room says, Mr. Sorola is a miserable guinea, there is a scuffle that ends only when I threaten them with a test on "Your World and You."
All right, I say, open your notebooks.
They're indignant. Open our notebooks? Paddy's Day an' you're telling us open our notebooks after we got you the card an' everything.
Mr. McCourt, I seen this Irish movie, "The Quiet Man," on TV an' John Wayne was beatin' up his wife, what's her name, and is that what they do in Ireland, beat up their wives?
They would do anything to avoid "Your World and You." Mr. McCourt, did you keep pigs in your kitchen?
We didn't have a kitchen.
Yeah, but if you didn't have a kitchen how could you cook?
We had a fireplace where we boiled water for tea and we ate bread.
One girl said she felt so sorry for me growing up like that, if she could go back in time she'd take me home and let me take a nice bath as long as I liked and then I could eat everything in the refrigerator, everything. The girls nodded and the boys were quiet and I was glad the bell rang so that I could escape to the teachers' toilet with my strange emotions.
I am learning the art of the high-school students' delaying tactics, how they seize on any occasion to avoid the work of the day. They flatter and cajole and hold their hands over their hearts declaring they are desperate to hear all about Ireland and the Irish, they would have asked days ago but they delayed till St. Patrick's Day knowing I'd want to celebrate my heritage and religion and everything and would I tell them about Irish music and is it true Ireland is green all the time and the girls have those cute little upturned noses and the men drink drink drink, is it true, Mr. McCourt?
There are muttered threats and promises around the room. I ain't stayin' in school today. I'm goin' to the parade in the city. All the Catlic schools have the day off. I'm Catlic. Why shun't I have the day off? End of this period you'll see me on the ferry. You comin', Joey?
Nah. My mother would kill me. I'm not Irish.
So what? I'm not Irish neither.
I end up telling them about Ireland because I have no choice. If I insisted on hewing to the curriculum today I'd be talking to myself and my instincts tell me one group of experienced students in an American classroom can break one inexperienced teacher.
How about high school, Mr. McCourt?
I didn't go.
Sebastian says, Yeah, it shows.
I'll get you later, I promise myself.
They tell him, Shut up, Sebastian.
Mr. McCourt, didn't they have no high school in Ireland?
They had dozens of high schools but kids from my school weren't encouraged to go.
Man, I'd like to live in a country where you didn't have to go to high school.
When I tell my students to bring their books to class they claim, Miss Mudd never gave us no books. Economic Citizenship classes say, We don't know nothin' about "Your World and You," and English classes say they never saw "Giants in the Earth" or "Silas Marner." The chairman of the academic department says, Of course they got books and when they got them they had to fill out book receipts. Look in Miss Mudd's desk, excuse me, your desk, and you'll find them.
There are no book receipts in the desk. There are travel brochures, crossword puzzle books, an assortment of forms, directives, letters Miss Mudd wrote and never sent, a few letters to her from former students, a life of Bach in German, a life of Balzac in French, and there are innocent looks around the room when I say, Didn't Miss Mudd hand out books and didn't you fill in book receipts? They look at one another and shake their heads. Did you get a book? I don't remember getting a book. Miss Mudd, she never did nothin'.
I know they're lying because in each class there are two or three with books and I know they got the books in the normal way. Teacher distributes them. Teacher gets book receipts. I don't want to embarrass the students who have the books by asking them how they came by them. I can't ask them to make liars of their classmates.
The chairman stops me in the hallway. Well, how about those books? I tell him how I can't embarrass the students who have the books. He storms into my class next period. All right, the ones who have books, raise your hands.
There is one hand.
All right, where did you get that book?
Ah, I got it, ah, from Miss Mudd.
And you signed a receipt?
Ah, yeah.
What's your name?
Julio.
And when you got that book didn't the rest of the class get books too?
I feel my heart beating hard and I'm angry that even if I'm a new teacher this is my class and no one should barge in here and embarrass one of my students and, Christ, I have to say something. I have to come between this boy and this chairman. I tell the chairman, I already asked Julio about that. He was absent and got the book from Miss Mudd at the end of the day.
Oh, yeah. Is that right, Julio?
Yeah.
And the rest of you. When did you get your books?
There is silence. They know I lied and Julio knows I lied and the chairman surely suspects me of lying but he doesn't know what to do. He says, We'll get to the bottom of this, and leaves.
The word goes from class to class and next day there is a book on every desk, "Your World and You" and "Silas Marner," and when the chairman returns with Mr. Sorola he doesn't know what to say. Mr. Sorola gives his little smile. So, Mr. McCourt, we're back in business, eh?
There may be books on every desk this one day when students and teacher present a united front to the outsiders, the chairman, the principal, but once they leave the honeymoon ends and there is a chorus of complaints about these books, how boring they are, how heavy, and why do they have to bring them to school every day? The English students say, Oh, "Silas Marner"'s a small book, but if they have to carry "Giants in the Earth" you need a big breakfast, it's such a big book and it's so boring. Will they have to carry it every day? Why can't they leave it in the classroom closet?
If you leave it in the closet how are you going to read it?
Why can't we read it in class? All the other teachers tell their classes, O.K., Henry, you read page 19, O.K., Nancy, you read page 20, an' that's how they finish the book and when they're reading we can put our heads down an' take a nap ha ha ha, just kidding, Mr. McCourt.
It is 2 o'clock in the morning, few people, an occasional car. I walk and look back over the eight and a half years since I arrived in New York, days at the Biltmore Hotel, the Army, N.Y.U., jobs in warehouses, on the docks, in banks. I never dreamed I'd be able to get a college degree and become a teacher and now I'm wondering if I can survive a vocational high school. The office buildings I pass are dark but I know that during the day people sit at desks, study the stock market and make millions. They wear suits and ties, they carry briefcases, they go to lunch and talk about money money money. They live in Connecticut with their long-legged Episcopalian wives, who probably lolled in the lounge of the Biltmore Hotel when I cleaned up for them, and they drink martinis before dinner. They play golf at the country club and they have affairs and no one cares.
I could do that. I could spend time with Stanley Garber to get rid of my accent though he told me already I'd be an ass to lose it. He said the Irish accent is charming, opens doors, reminds people of Barry Fitzgerald. I told him I didn't want to remind people of Barry Fitzgerald and he said, Would you prefer to have a Jewish accent and remind people of Molly Goldberg? I asked him who Molly Goldberg was and he said, If you don't know who Molly Goldberg is there's no use talking to you.
Why can't I have a bright carefree life like my brothers Malachy and Michael, uptown in the bar serving drinks to beautiful women and bantering with Ivy League graduates? I'd make more money than this $4,500 a year for regular substitute teachers. There would be large tips, all the food I could eat and nights in the beds of Episcopalian heiresses frolicking and dazzling them with bits of poetry and scraps of wit. I'd sleep late, have lunch at a romantic restaurant, walk the streets of Manhattan, there would be no forms to fill out, no papers to correct, the books I'd read would be for my own pleasure and I'd never have to worry about sullen high-school teen-agers.
I think of the longshoreman in the coffee shop working for years so that his son can go to St. John's University to become a teacher. What would I say to him?
If I told Mike I was planning to leave teaching for the exciting world of the bars she'd surely run off and marry a lawyer or a football player.
So I won't give up teaching, not because of the longshoreman or Mike, but because of what I might say to myself at the end of a night of serving drinks and amusing the customers. I'd accuse myself of taking the easy way and all because I was defeated by boys and girls resisting "Your World and You" and "Giants in the Earth."
They don't want to read and they don't want to write. They say, Aw, Mr. McCourt, all these English teachers want us to write about dumb things like our summer vacation or the story of our life. Boring. Every year since first grade we write the story of our life and teachers just give us a check mark and they say, Very nice.
In the English classes they're cowed by the midterm test with its multiple-choice questions on spelling, vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. When I hand out the tests in Economic Citizenship there is muttering. There are hard words against Miss Mudd and how her ship should hit a rock and she should become fish food. I tell them, Do your best, and I'll be reasonable with report card grades, but there is a coldness and resentment in the room as if I had betrayed them by forcing this test on them.
Miss Mudd saves me. While my classes are taking the midterm test I explore the closets at the back of the room and find them stuffed with old grammar books, newspapers, Regents exams and hundreds of pages of uncorrected student compositions going back to 1942. I'm about to dump everything into the trash till I start reading the old compositions. The boys back then yearned to fight, to avenge the deaths of brothers, friends, neighbors. One wrote, I'm gonna kill five Japs for every one they killed from my neighborhood. Another wrote, I don't want to go in the Army if they tell me kill Italians because I'm Italian. I could be killing my own cousins and I won't fight unless they let me kill Germans or Japs. I'd prefer to kill Germans because I don't want to go to the Pacific where there's all kinds of jungles with bugs and snakes and crap like that.
The girls would wait. When Joey comes home me and him gonna get married and move to Jersey and get away from his crazy mother.
I pile the crumbling papers on my desk and begin reading to my classes. They sit up. There are familiar names. Hey, that was my father. He was wounded in Africa. Hey, that was my Uncle Sal that was killed in Guam.
While I read the essays aloud there are tears. Boys run from the room to the toilets and return red-eyed. Girls weep openly and console one another.
Dozens of Staten Island and Brooklyn families are named in these papers so brittle we worry they'll fall apart. We want to save them and the only way is to copy them by hand, the hundreds still stacked in the closets.
No one objects. We are saving the immediate past of immediate families. Everyone has a pen and all through the rest of the term, April till the end of June, they decipher and write. Tears continue and there are outbursts. This is my father when he was 15. This is my aunt and she died when she was having a baby.
They are suddenly interested in compositions with the title "My Life," and I want to say, See what you can learn about your fathers and uncles and aunts? Don't you want to write about your lives for the next generation?
But I let it pass. I don't want to interfere with a room so quiet Mr. Sorola has to investigate. He walks around the room, looks at what the class is doing and says nothing. I think he's grateful for the silence.
In June I give everyone a passing grade, thankful I've survived my first months of teaching in a vocational high school, though I wonder what I would have done without the crumbling compositions.
I might have had to teach.

HEADLINE: Where W. Got Compassion

BYLINE: By David Grann; David Grann is a senior editor at The New Republic.

 BODY:
One Sunday afternoon in Austin, Tex. -- not far from the Governor's Mansion -- Marvin Olasky, the man widely regarded as the godfather of "compassionate conservatism," is working on his most recent disciple. As we drive through the city after services at the Redeemer Presbyterian Church, Olasky keeps looking in his rearview mirror at Fred Cantu, a tattooed ex-con who is sitting in the backseat, as if trying to discern something he can't quite make out.
Cantu has just been released from prison for the third time, and Olasky, an ordained elder, is trying to help him -- not through the state's traditional welfare services but through his own faith-based program, New Start, a model of the philosophy on which George W. Bush is staking his Presidential campaign. 
 "Fred just needs to show he can stick to a job," Olasky says to me as he eyes Cantu. "Then he can take some writing classes at the community college, and then who knows?"
Cantu blinks, as if trying to imagine it. "I hardly write nobody," he says. "I was writing my mother, but I stopped doing that because I don't want to upset her."
Olasky is still wearing his church clothes -- khakis, a blazer and tie -- and tightly grips the steering wheel as the car rumbles through the Texas hills. A delicate man with little round glasses and a neatly cropped beard, this former Communist seems like an unlikely figure to have emerged as one of the stars in Bush's constellation of policy wonks. Yet Olasky, once a relatively obscure author of a dozen books, has hit the conservative movement, in the words of The Weekly Standard's editor, Bill Kristol, like "a thunderbolt."
In July, Bush vowed, in his first major policy speech as a candidate, to "rally the armies of compassion in our communities to fight a very different war against poverty" -- one based on religious and community groups like New Start -- and afterward he paused to thank Olasky. "He has really been one of the people who has been most helpful," Bush told me, in shaping these ideas. Indeed, when I ask one of Bush's top aides to explain what a compassionate conservative administration might look like, he says simply, "Talk to Marvin."
Now, in the car, Olasky describes all the things that Cantu will have to do when he enrolls in New Start -- everything from attending Bible study and meeting with a church mentor -- that are central to what Olasky and Bush have called "the transforming power of faith."
But whether faith or even private charities are really a viable or appropriate alternative to government assistance is open to debate. "To expect small-scale fragmented groups to bear the brunt of the most pressing concerns of society is foolish," says Thomas Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. Liberals and even some conservatives observe that the welfare state arose precisely because in the first part of this century, private charities failed to adequately address the needs of the poor.
And so far, Olasky's own personal test with Cantu does not appear to be going well. The subject, who has just served a three-year stint for burglary, seems to be only partially listening.
"Can I borrow your truck?" he asks suddenly. Olasky squints in the mirror. "We'd have to work out an arrangement," he says. "We would know the mileage -."
"Obligations are O.K.," Cantu interjects. "I need that discipline."
By the time Olasky pulls into the bus station, Cantu has seemingly undergone a miraculous transformation. "I'm enthusiastic about God," he says. "I'm on fire to serve Jesus Christ!"
He then slams the door, leaving behind the faint smell of tobacco. As we drive back through the valley, I ask Olasky if he thinks Cantu will make it this time out. "The question is," he says, "has this been a genuine conversion?"
Olasky has always had the conviction of a convert, of someone who is not only embracing one set of beliefs but is also actively repudiating another. He was born in Massachusetts in 1950 to second-generation Russian Jewish immigrants, and early on began his search for a unifying theory of the universe, his own private Big Bang. Initially, he found it where all the Olaskys had -- in the Torah. But as a teen-ager, he grew increasingly skeptical of religion, until, under the spell of his older brother and the writings of H. G. Wells, he disputed God's existence altogether. "I was bar mitzvahed at 13," he says, "and an atheist by 14."
It wasn't until college, however, that he truly renounced his roots. In 1968, as Bush was finishing his four years at Yale as a cocky athlete and member of the secret fraternity Skull and Bones, Olasky was enrolling as a shy and awkward freshman. Both men -- in what would be essential to their eventual spiritual and intellectual convergence -- were equally adrift. But while Bush drank to excess and purportedly participated in branding rituals with his fraternity brothers, Olasky grew his sideburns long and read Marx and Lenin. Even in his activism, his classmates say, he was oddly "puritanical" and "monkish," once going on a five-day hunger strike to improve the conditions of university workers.
After graduating in only three years, he married his high-school sweetheart and settled in Oregon, where, consumed with visions of revolution, he became almost an ascetic. Thin and drawn, he grew a beard down to his chest like Fidel Castro's and did something almost unheard of at that late date: he joined the Communist Party. To sign up then "was truly outlandish," says Todd Gitlin, a leader of the New Left. "It meant to join the party of Brezhnev, to join the party that had invaded Czechoslovakia."
For Olasky, however, Communism represented what he had always been looking for -- a codified worldview, a theory with neat rules and by-laws. He wasn't an idle member. "Lenin had said it would be necessary to 'crawl on one's belly, like a snake,' for the good of the revolution," he once wrote, "and I was ready to slither." As his marriage crumbled, he hopped a Russian freighter and toured the Soviet Union. Upon his return, he propagated his beliefs as a graduate student at the University of Michigan, often bullying his fellow students in class.
But while researching his dissertation, in part on the persecution of Reds in Hollywood, he underwent his ultimate conversion. "God changed my worldview not through thunder or a whirlwind," he later wrote, "but by . . . a repeated, resounding question in my brain: What if Lenin is wrong? What if there is a God?" During this time, he met Susan Northway, who would become his second wife.
By 1973, he had resigned from the Communist Party and, once again, turned against everything he had earlier believed. "We asked ourselves which denomination represented the extreme opposite of the hard left," Susan recalls. "Then we looked in the phone book and found the Conservative Baptist Church. By the end of that summer of '76, we had come to Christ."
When he finally handed in his dissertation -- hailing the anti-Communists instead of denouncing them -- his teachers were stunned. "I couldn't accept it," says Cecil Eby, his professor at the time. "I felt like he had gone from being extremely partisan on one side to being extremely partisan on the other. It was baffling."
Jew, atheist, Communist, evangelical Christian -- Olasky has been on quite a journey. Despite alienating his former comrades and family -- I didn't tell my friends," his mother says now -- Olasky pursued his new faith with the same zeal he had pursued his old ones. As if in penance for his heretical past, the one-time Marxist went to work for the public-affairs office at DuPont, where he cranked out endless speeches on capitalism.
Later, when he took a job teaching communications at the University of Texas and couldn't find a traditional enough congregation, he founded his own -- a breakaway faction of the Presbyterian Church -- with a handful of families. It wasn't, though, until 1989, while on leave and researching a new book on charities, that he stumbled upon what would become the cornerstone of his and, to a large extent, Bush's political philosophy.
In the stacks of the Library of Congress, Olasky found dusty texts on 19th-century philanthropists, men and women like Charles Brace, a writer and missionary who worked with abandoned children in New York. Rather than merely distributing handouts, they imposed demands and discipline on the poor, and in contrast to the current welfare state, in Olasky's view, provided the spiritual as well as material sustenance that shapes character.
To test his theories, Olasky dressed up as a beggar -- complete with stocking cap and plastic bag -- and visited several shelters in Washington, D.C. For two days, as he wandered from kitchen to kitchen, he received plenty of soup and bread. But no one, he says, ever asked him why he was there or helped him to help himself. Nor did anyone, even in the church-run charities, offer him the one thing he says he kept asking for: a Bible. "Most of these places," he says, outchurching the churches, "have forgotten that people have souls." In 1992, Olasky finally published his findings in "The Tragedy of American Compassion."
Initially the book went almost unnoticed, and those few who reviewed it decried it as "romantic," "shallow" and "bizarre" -- the work of a "utopian" crank. But although most academics dismissed the book, a small coterie of Beltway conservatives began to circulate it privately. Former Secretary of Education William Bennett hailed it as the "most important book on welfare and social policy in a decade" and handed a copy to the new Republican Speaker, Newt Gingrich. Gingrich read it from cover to cover and liked it so much, he had it distributed to all the incoming freshmen. In his first address to the nation, Gingrich declared: "Our models are Alexis de Tocqueville and Marvin Olasky. We are going to redefine compassion and take it back."
Overnight, Olasky, the perennial convert, had seemingly converted an entire party. A small band of policy wonks and legislators -- many of whom would go on to work for Bush -- began calling themselves "compassionate conservatives." This little-known professor was suddenly a fixture on the television talk shows and in the back corridors of Congress. While slashing the welfare state, Olasky's disciples sought to unleash an outpouring of charitable works through Federal grants, tax credits and partnerships between church and state. These measures represented only the first step in what Olasky regarded as a revolution -- turning the Government's responsibility to the poor over to private charities.
Yet despite all the lip service paid to compassionate conservative ideas, even these modest initiatives never materialized. Almost all of the proposals, which were sponsored by Senator Dan Coats of Indiana and had names like the Character Development Act, were killed before they even reached the floor -- largely at the hands of the same Republicans who had wrapped themselves only months earlier in Olasky's language of compassion.
Far from helping the poor, his critics charged, Olasky had provided a smokescreen for guiltlessly cutting back the welfare state. Even Olasky compares what some Republicans did to the poor to pulling the knife out of the back of a person who had been mugged and then leaving him on the street to bleed. "You can't just say, You're fine -- get up," he says. "You have to spend a lot of time patching the guy up." But to his critics, Olasky's outrage only seemed like evidence of his naivete.
Dejected and dispirited, Olasky returned to Austin, where he, like Charles Brace in the 1800's, waged his solitary crusade. He helped found the New Start program through his church; he worked with Labor Integrity Faith Thrift (LIFT), which eased people off welfare, and with his wife he ran a crisis center for pregnant women. Their house, which overlooked the Shinoak Valley, soon overflowed with good works. At one point, Olasky showed up with a homeless woman he found living in a car. Later, he adopted a 3-week-old black child, telling his family, "God adopts all of us." It was as if he were single-handedly trying to prove the viability of his own theories.
In 1993, Olasky got a phone message from George W. Bush asking to meet. By this time, Bush, who was running for Governor of Texas, had also "recommitted his life to Christ." Both men prayed daily and had a visceral sense of their own sins. While Bush had drunk too heavily in the 1980's, Olasky had divorced his first wife -- an act that contrasted markedly with his later Christian writings about family values. Both also concealed the details of their transgressions: while Bush has dodged the drug question, Olasky had -- until a family member accidentally mentioned it to me -- carefully hidden his divorce from the press. After an hourlong meeting with Bush, Olasky was sure he had found a new messenger for his ideas. But Bush didn't call again for two years.
Then in 1995 -- six months after Bush was swept into office -- state employees of Texas threatened to close down Teen Challenge, a drug program centered on religious conversion, ostensibly because it had violated safety codes. Some 300 supporters of the organization -- holding signs that read "Because of Jesus I Am No Longer a Debt to the State of Texas" -- staged a small rally at the Alamo, the Lone Star symbol of defiance.
In the dual role of advocate and journalist, Olasky showed up with pen in hand. "It was real hot, and we were both sweating," recalls the Rev. James Heurich, executive director of Teen Challenge of South Texas. "He was just smiling and grinning at me, and I had the sense that this was fun for him. But I didn't think anything was going to come of it. Next thing I know, we're in The Wall Street Journal."
Governor Bush, caught in one of the first crises of his administration, tried to turn the confrontation into a political opportunity. Seeking out Olasky for guidance, he quickly set up a task force, which recommended unraveling the state's regulatory grip over faith-based groups. Despite charges that he was violating the separation between church and state, Bush enacted a spate of legislation that promoted religious drug-treatment centers, prison ministries and church-run day-care centers. The legislation didn't allocate more money for the poor so much as redirect it to faith-based programs by removing regulations that stood in their way -- allowing Bush to win accolades with the religious right and at the same time to avoid spending more money on social services. Olasky, the congenital true believer, became a Bush convert. "I don't think this is just rhetoric," he says.
The conversion seems to be mutual. By this summer, Bush had not only made Olasky the head of his policy subcommittee on religion but also embraced broad strokes of Olasky's vision. In addition, he anointed Stephen Goldsmith, the Mayor of Indianapolis, who has already implemented key elements of Olasky's policies, his top domestic adviser for the campaign. Goldsmith, who told me he wishes he had written Olasky's book, quickly became the author's main conduit to the Governor. And at a small church in Indianapolis in July, Bush called for more faith-based programs that practice "severe mercy," approvingly citing Teen Challenge's maxim, "If you don't work, you don't eat."
Bush then rattled off various proposals to promote charities, including $8 billion worth of tax credits and other incentives. The emphasis, however, was as much on the power of faith as on the power of new programs. "Sometimes our greatest hope is not found in reform," he said. "It is found in redemption."
"Did you hear the speech?" Olasky asked me afterward. "This is effective compassion." But this religious component is also what Olasky's critics find so terrifying. Even Bush's aides take pains to distance their candidate from Olasky's proselytizing. "Marvin is an evangelical Christian, and Bush is an evangelical Christian," says John J. Dilulio, one of Bush's informal advisers. "But Bush does not believe that every faith-based program is about religious conversion." Many of the programs that the Governor supports, however, are on a proselytizing mission. Heurich at Teen Challenge sums up the secret of his success in two words: Jesus Christ. And Olasky's ultimate goal is not simply to help the poor through private or nonprofit charities but also to push religion -- specifically evangelical Christianity -- deep into the public sphere.
When I ask Olasky if people should be afraid of widespread conversions under a compassionate-conservative order, he says they will face a utilitarian choice. "Are you willing to put up with these religious practices that you feel very uncomfortable with but nevertheless you see the success of? Or would you rather end those practices and see more assaults, rapes, drug use and homicides?"
At one point, as we are driving around in his car, Olasky even attempts to convert me. "I don't want to be pushy," he says, but "there's a good church you should go to" in Washington. He also recommends I read "Christianity Is Jewish" and join an on-line Bible study for journalists. His mother later tells me, "If I converted, it would make Marvin happy."
Indeed, on close inspection, many of Bush's "armies of compassion" resemble tiny battalions of Marvin Olasky's. This summer, Olasky set out on a poverty tour with his 14-year-old son to study the first seeds of his brave new world. Traveling from the ghettos of Houston to Philadelphia with his Bible and his maps laid out on his dashboard, he encountered ex-cons, drug addicts and gang members who had committed their lives to Christ.
When I catch up with him in Indianapolis, he and his son are visiting a small warehouse that has been converted into a gymnastics school for inner-city children. The program's director, the Rev. Tim Streett, talks about his own conversion after his father was shot in front of him as a boy. In the background, two kids jump in their bare feet on a trampoline to the beat of a Christian rock song: "Let us pray, let us pray . . . every moment of the day."
That same afternoon, at a small two-story school financed in part by city grants, Ermil Thompson, a frail 68-year-old woman, tells Olasky that in 1990 she had a vision from God to transform the building into a refuge for children from Satan. "Lord bless you," Olasky says, pumping her hand.
Such people are reminiscent of the missionaries from the end of the 19th century. Dedicated and devout, they possess the rare energy and drive to run such programs, where the pay is poor and the prestige is worse. "Our most successful people," says Goldsmith, "are zealots in the good sense of the word."
Yet if Streett and Thompson represent the "quiet river of goodness and kindness" that Bush will need to supplement the welfare state, they also present the most difficult and delicate issue for the Bush campaign: how do you promote faith-based healers -- these so-called zealots -- without allowing them to proselytize their faith?
In Indianapolis, there is actually evidence of the increasingly blurred line between church and state. "I encourage them to play a shell game," says Bill Stanczykiewicz, who until recently was in charge of running Goldsmith's initiatives. When we arrive at Village House, which offers a summer program that the Mayor's office has assisted with thousands of dollars in grants, students are hanging signs in brightly colored crayon that read, "Listen to Jesus."
Olasky's eyes initially brighten with excitement, then narrow, as he contemplates the reaction of city officials and private donors. "I hope that doesn't make them go ballistic," he says. "Don't worry," says the program director, the Rev. Ann Henning-Byfield, "they'll be down by the time they come by."
Goldsmith, like Bush, insists that under compassionate conservative policies, no one will be forced into a faith-based program. There will always be options -- and many of the charities like Big Brothers/Big Sisters will have no faith component at all. But if religion is the most provocative element of Bush's vision, critics say its bigger challenge is more worldly: there simply aren't enough Marvin Olaskys out there to replace Uncle Sam.
Even Bush acknowledges on the stump that Government cannot be completely replaced by charities, and his aides say his administration would conduct only a kind of grand experiment -- a four-year trial period to see which programs actually work best: the state's, the private sector's or a combination of the two. But many fear that any experiment at all that depends on the altruism of local individuals will mean, as Dianne Stewart of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Texas puts it, a "step back even further from a safety net for the poor."
Modern American life doesn't leave much time for sainthood. Colin Powell's volunteer summit has not produced the philanthropic outpouring that many expected. According to Investment Sector, the percentage of American adults who volunteer has actually declined since the late 1980's. And despite the robust economy, corporate giving is down.
"If everyone was like Olasky," says Representative Mark Souder, the Indiana Republican, "he would be right: we wouldn't need government." But if everyone isn't, who will man Bush's armies of compassion?

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON/FILM: HOLLYWOOD;
Hollywood's Uneasy, Maybe for the Better

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
SOMEONE contemplating the list of films for most recent movie seasons might have been forgiven for wondering whether Hollywood had a hole in the bottom of its ideas bucket. Strip away the sequels, pare away the remakes, ignore the big-screen versions of television chestnuts, discard the book adaptations and the (increasingly rare) play adaptations and often there was not much left.
Add to this the anxiety in Hollywood over recent waves of cost cutting at the studios -- some making fewer movies, others sharing the risk of big productions between a pair of studios or between a studio and an independent production entity, much of the digital filmmaking being done outside the Hollywood orbit in San Francisco and elsewhere, shooting more and more films in Canada or New Zealand or any place cheaper than Hollywood, asking whether that $3 million shot of a tanker ship exploding is really necessary to make the audience happy -- and there is a very real sense of unease here. People wonder whether Hollywood will still make offbeat and sophisticated films, or even survive as anything more than a financing source and distribution-and-marketing service for other peoples' risky visions. 
 No one really knows, of course. Hollywood, bent and twisted by all of these financial, technological and artistic pressures, is clearly in the process of becoming something else, but becoming what? It's a guessing game. But perhaps we are beginning to see, with this year's fall and holiday lineup, just what kinds of movies Hollywood studios and the major independents are going to be making in response to all of the corporatizing and cost-cutting and hand-wringing.
"The period we are coming out of, the one people are lamenting, is one of the weaker periods in the history of movies, a largely boring decade of movies," said one top studio executive. "At times you could feel during the Oscar period that there were no films to vote for."
To this newcomer to Los Angeles -- and a newcomer to the task of covering movies and the movie industry -- this sense of creative unease and financial anxiety seems to seep into every conversation. And yet more than 30 recent interviews with studio executives, producers, writers, directors and, yes, bean counters reveals a growing, if sometimes tentative, hope for Hollywood.
MANY of those interviewed remarked, sometimes with apparent wonder, how good much of this year's fall and holiday lineup looks. Of course, they're paid to say things like that, at least about their own films, and there is always a certain amount of breast-thumping about any approaching movie season, leading to inevitable speculation about how such a period of cost-cutting could have produced such a roster. When the bean counters come in and the budgets go down, shouldn't the movies suffer?
Though many of the films are still in the finishing stages, others have begun to make the rounds either in final form, in rough cuts or in small snippets screened for a select handful. "This fall looks much stronger to me than last fall," said Mark Gill, president of the Los Angeles division of Miramax Films, whose "Shakespeare in Love" won the Best Picture Oscar last year. "Just look at the range of films, how many more things there are that appear to be genuine Oscar contenders."
And although the season has its share of sequels ("Scream 3"), remakes ("The House on Haunted Hill"), long-running series ("The World Is Not Enough," the 19th and latest James Bond adventure) and more than a dozen book adaptations, the evidence also shows that despite fears that cost cutting would make studios timid and shave the sharp edges from quirky films, the reality is oddly different.
"I think this is a surprisingly unpandering-to-the-mainstream movie season coming up," is the way Amy Pascal, president of Columbia Pictures, put it.
Three years ago, Hollywood had just one film ("Jerry Maguire") among the five contenders for the Academy Award for best picture. This year, that will not be the case, executives vow.
"The studios are back," said Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures. "That's the story."
Granted, the beginning of almost every movie season -- especially the fall and holiday season, when so many movies are pitched toward older audiences and Oscar voters -- seems to promise more joy than it eventually delivers. ("Personally, I don't believe anything anybody says about a movie coming out in the fall unless they have actually seen it themselves," said one veteran Hollywood publicist. "There's too much hype and buzz going around at this time of year.") And the financial anxiety at the studios may be creating a bumper crop of wishful thinking. But even if half of these films turn out to be turkeys, it will still be a formidable roster.
When asked to assess those films they have seen -- in either finished form or rough cut or in sufficient clips for them to make what they consider a sound judgment -- or those films about which they have heard detailed descriptions in the etherlike buzz on which Hollywood floats these days like a hydrofoil, those interviewed came up among them with a list of more than a dozen films that they believe will be fighting it out for the top Oscar nominations early next year. (Note: when asked this question, almost everyone of course mentioned either their own film or the films from their studio; all such votes were discounted.)
The films mentioned most frequently (that is, by more than 10 of those interviewed) were "The Green Mile," the director Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's Death Row tale starring Tom Hanks; "Three Kings"; David O. Russell's story of three G.I.'s searching for buried loot in the waning days of the Gulf War; "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's classic dark thriller; "The Insider," Michael Mann's retelling of the clash between a tobacco industry whistle-blower, a "60 Minutes" producer and the forces of big tobacco and big media; "The Hurricane," Norman Jewison's film starring Denzel Washington, and "American Beauty," the theater director Sam Mendes's inaugural Hollywood effort, about the emotional damage caused when a married man develops an infatuation with one of his teen-age daughter's young friends.
Not bad -- if it's true -- for an industry that sometimes sounds like it's on life support. The story of the movie business's financial woes, particularly in the last several years as top star salaries rose above $20 million and production and marketing costs also soared, is like an old, favorite set of worry beads that Hollywood people like to finger in the gathering gloom.
"The town has become much more cost-conscious," said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. "We have become aware over time that the economics of the movie business are tougher and tougher, and the only way to make that better is to make your movies cheaper."
But how can this possibly translate into better films? "I think it results in new voices and new ideas and new ways to tell stories in a way that's actually really exciting," Ms. Snider said.
The problem is that something happened over the last several years; the cost of making a movie has skyrocketed, both because of higher salaries for the top actors and directors and other "above the line" talent and for the physical, "below the line" costs of actually making the film. The old formulas (star-studded big-budget explosion pictures, for instance, built on macho images and paper-thin characterizations) don't work reliably enough to be worth the money they cost, and even a summer as successful as the one just passed, with more than a half-dozen movies surpassing $100 million at the box office, isn't enough for the studios to turn a sufficient profit to satisfy their corporate bosses.
"The business is broken," said Bill Mechanic, chairman of 20th Century Fox. "The business fell apart when the budgets of pictures went running sky high." The only answer, he and others said, is to cut costs, so that's what the studios, to varying degrees, have been trying to do. While a few stars will earn astronomical fees, secondary stars are earning less ("the $10 million sidekick," is how one insider put it), and the studios are always on the lookout for cheaper, younger talent. "The cost of a movie is too high to recoup its investment," Mr. Mechanic said. "A film that used to be $15 million is now pushed up to $50 million, but the return is the same as if you'd made it for $15 million. It means you're only going to lose money."
Some filmmakers and studio executives said they believed one reason the coming season looked to be strong was that in order to get top-name actors and directors to work for less than their normal fees, producers were pushed toward the kind of projects that such artists would find appealing rather than those projects that the studios' marketing departments might find appealing.
"The only thing that will attract people to do it for less money is something that's more interesting in terms of material," said Mr.Mechanic.
Another factor that is driving the studios toward finding new voices and richer films is the perception that the audience is revolting against the familiar and the formulaic.
"Sometimes, I think the people making movies are out of touch a bit," said Jeanine Basinger, chairman of film studies at Wesleyan University, whose research takes her into movie houses. "I think they don't realize how cranky a lot of people in the audience have become. People shout out at the screen, 'He's the killer,' and someone on the other side of the theater will shout back, 'I know that, shut up.' " People are bored and they're angry."
The studios do know that, Mr. Mechanic said, or should. "There's something happening out there," he said. "People have just rejected seeing the same thing time in and time out. It's a rejection of the mainstream, in a way, of the same old way of telling stories. I mean, they're booing trailers out there now."
The full impact of having fewer films in the pipeline won't be felt until around the middle of next year, executives say. Projects that might have been made in the past will hit a brick wall, unless their makers can come up with a way to do it cheaper. "I think we'll find that the holes in the sieve are getting smaller," said Dick Cook, president of the Walt Disney Motion Picture Group.
ALL of the filmmakers interviewed said they had felt the economic crunch at the studios in one fashion or another.
"When you make a film that's off the beaten path, there's an enormous amount of pressure to make it for a price that makes sense to the studio," said Sydney Pollack, whose romantic drama "Random Hearts" opens next month with Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. "It costs so much money to market a film today, the advertising costs and the marketing costs are oftentimes more than the cost of the negative. That would have been heresy 20 years ago."
Oliver Stone, whose gritty football drama, "Any Given Sunday," will open on Christmas Day, has noticed the same thing.
"It's an eternal battle that goes back to the beginning of the movie business, but certainly it's getting tougher," Mr. Stone said. "I liken our jobs, that of the film's director and its marketing director, to co-directors these days. They both spend sometimes the same amount of money. The marketing director has enormous power here."
Filmmakers can make suggestions about the movie's trailer, its poster, its advertising campaign, but in most cases the final decision is not theirs. "Ultimately, you have no say," Mr. Stone said. "You can say, I hate it, I want to change it. You plead. You cajole. You try everything you can, but it's really out of your control."
For some of the directors, the change has been not so much in the drive to save money as in the growing sense that a corporate mind set is taking over the studios. All of the major Hollywood studios are now owned by larger conglomerates, for which the movie business is just one segment of a multi-faceted business empire, and the recent appointment of several top executives who were seen as more from the corporate side than the creative side has also increased some filmmakers' wariness.
Lasse Hallstrom, whose adaptation of John Irving's novel "Cider House Rules" is due for release on Dec. 10, said he had given up trying to understand. "I am not as well educated as I ought to be about all of the financial side of the movie business," he said. "It's still a mystery to me, what happens behind those closed doors. You're always trying to find someone who has the responsibility to make a decision, but it is sometimes impossible. All these mysterious reasons, and you never get to the truth of it."
Those who have been at it longest feel the corporate creep more strongly. "The big change for me as a filmmaker, making films since 1961, is that I used to be able to get an answer on stories I wanted to tell as a filmmaker very quickly," said Norman Jewison, whose film about the incarceration and eventual exoneration of the boxer Ruben Carter, "The Hurricane," is set for an Oscar-aimed limited release on Dec. 29. "Over the last 10 years it's become more and more of a corporate decision. You get the feeling that some of these people think that they are making a product. Good films have never been a product. They are individual statements of their makers, pieces of a very, very fragile vision. I have never felt there was any equation between money and art."
Some of the studio executives just shrug off these kind of complaints. "Movies have always been a business," one said. "We have all decided to go into a very expensive art form; we didn't go into finger-painting or poetry."
Others argue that the cost cutting is not so much imposed by corporate bosses as by the economic realities of an increasingly expensive and mercurial business. "The people who run these studios are highly qualified executives," Mr. Friedman said. "It's not a candy store."
The puzzle is this: There were fears that when studios responded to this -- and to increased pressure from higher-ups in the corporations that own all of the studios -- there would be a rush to the mainstream, seasons of little more than sequels, formulaic comedies, teen-age sex romps and remakes of every television show ever made. How then to explain this coming season?
"It certainly looks like it's going to be a good final quarter, maybe even a great one," said one producer and former studio boss. "And it's coming on the heels of a very lucrative summer, when there were successful movies all over the place, in almost every genre. But people still feel uneasy because, no matter what they tell you, they really don't know what's coming next."

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON/FILM: NEW HEROINES;
Mothers and Daughters, Tangled Together Anew

BYLINE: By MOLLY HASKELL; Molly Haskell's most recent book is "Holding My Own in No Man's Land: Men and Women, Films and Feminists." She is working on a memoir about her mother.

 BODY:
ALWAYS lurking in the wings, waiting for a lull in the conversation, jokes about mothers enjoyed a flurry of activity this summer. There was the New Yorker cartoon showing the corpse laid out in the funeral parlor, lifeless but not speechless, berating her son for not wearing a tie. And the joke making the rounds of the Hamptons might have come from a Woody Allen movie: What's the difference between a Jewish mother and a Rottweiler? The Rottweiler eventually lets go. Then real life supplied juicier fodder in the story of a Presidential toddler in Arkansas, torn between devouring mother and grandmother love -- and proved there's no ethnic monopoly on the stereotype of maternal excess. Even when there's a male parent who's a partner in dysfunction, the woman from Venus takes the hit.
In movies as in one-liners, she is a creature of extremes, loving too much or too little. She cradles her grown gangster-son in her lap (Margaret Wycherly and James Cagney in "White Heat"), floats blimplike through space, haunting her son ("New York Stories"), sacrifices her own happiness so that her daughter may rise in the world (Barbara Stanwyck in "Stella Dallas"), turns her son into a psychopath (Mrs. Bates in "Psycho"), competes with her daughter for a man (Joan Crawford in "Mildred Pierce," Anne Bancroft in "The Graduate"). There's no such thing as the "good enough mother," in the British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott's fine and forgiving phrase. 
 Would audiences accept such a figure of moderation? In the subversive comedy "Mother," Albert Brooks countered the image of a nasty, sex-starved older woman in "The Graduate" with a more complex image: Debbie Reynolds as a mother with an adult sex life, a creative urge of her own and no particular desire to have her son back in the nest. On the soundtrack, Mr. Brooks's theme song, "Mrs. Henderson," explicitly opposed the more derisive Simon and Garfunkel "Mrs. Robinson," and moviegoers didn't buy it.
From Woody Allen to Bill Clinton, mother-son relationships are part of folklore, but mother-daughter jokes are less frequent because the role of women is not clearly defined, even today (especially today). In following the prescribed path, boys fulfill their destiny and become men by breaking away. But for girls, who become women partly by identifying with their mothers, even the desire for independence will be felt on some level as an act of betrayal.
In "The Turning Point," which crystallized the conflict between career and home as it was beginning to be felt in the 1970's, Shirley MacLaine's character has given up dance to bring up her family, only to have her daughter choose the alternative: ballet under the guidance and surrogate motherhood of Ms. MacLaine's old friend and rival, played by Anne Bancroft. Although the role is, happily, a far cry from Mrs. Robinson, it nevertheless captures the perennial ambivalence toward the working woman: the aging Ms. Bancroft, once a successful diva, is lonely and unfulfilled as a woman.
Two fall films boldly dive into the murky waters of this most complex relationship with stories of moms on the run and the daughters who take care of them. In uncannily similar and very 90's role reversals, it's the single mothers -- middle-aged hellions, slatternly yet seductive -- who must grow up and the daughters who become women, not by identifying with the mothers but by becoming surrogate parents, in fact by displaying the solid, responsible virtues of the husbands the mothers should have had. "Anywhere but Here," with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, and "Tumbleweeds," with Janet McTeer and Kimberly Brown, are, in addition, female road movies, spins on "Thelma and Louise," in which women head westward into the sun, leaving men behind, at least temporarily, in a quest for a better life.
IN "Anywhere but Here"(opening Oct. 22), Ms. Sarandon's Adele August abandons Wisconsin, family and friends, virtually kidnapping her daughter, Ann, whom she intends to turn into a child star in -- where else? -- Hollywood. In "Tumbleweeds," a more improvisational independent film, Ms. McTeer's much-married good ol' Southern babe flees into the night from her abusive husband in a ritual that has evidently occurred many times before. Each story springs from the imagination and memories of a daughter who survived to tell the tale: the first is Alvin Sargent's adaptation of the Mona Simpson novel, directed by Wayne Wang; the second is an original autobiographical screenplay by Angela Shelton, working with the screenwriter and director Gavin O'Connor.
What's new is the picturing of women with at least the option of mobility but hemmed in economically by being alone, middle-aged and without marketable skills. These and movies like Allison Anders's "Gas Food Lodging" (1992) are the artistic children of divorce, testimonials from the survivors showing mothers starting over, back on the marriage block, feeling their sexual oats, while at the same time struggling to make ends meet and, fitfully and incongruously, giving their daughters moral guidance. Like most teen-agers, the daughters long for a normal life -- school, friends, stability -- while the mothers delude themselves that they are providing something better in the form of bohemianism and excitement. Who's to say, the movies imply, that someday the daughters won't be the better for it?
Raucous and outrageous maternal heroines, divorcees with big plans and near-empty pocketbooks, have a long and notorious lineage: witness such extreme mothers as Stella Dallas and Mildred Pierce. But there was nothing sororal about those ladies, awesome in their authority, majestic in their willingness to martyr themselves on the altar of their offspring's upward mobility. But the new mothers, vulnerable and without society's support, have surrendered the mantle of infallibility for the instant gratifications of paldom. Moreover, the idea of sacrifice that motivated Barbara Stanwyck's vulgarly ambitious climber and Joan Crawford's pie-baking entrepreneur "to do everything" for their daughters, to provide them with the things they never had, has become suspect in a post-analytic age. Every time Ms. Sarandon piously intones, "After all I've done for you . . . ," Ann and the audience are hip to the hidden agenda of emotional blackmail: a mother using her daughter to fulfill her own ambitions.
Yet in their timeless stories of maternal aspirations and adolescent angst, "Anywhere but Here" and "Tumbleweeds" echo themes and emotions from those earlier films, with their roots in the immigrant experience and the American dream of progress, with the notion of a daughter's having more taste, more of an aptitude for education, than the mother. In "Stella Dallas," "Mildred Pierce" and the immensely moving film "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," the child has more refinement, and therefore more opportunity, than the mother (even if Ann Blyth's Veda in "Mildred Pierce," with her deliciously raised eyebrow and purse-lipped snobbery, is a mockery of true refinement). Lauren Dallas, with her aristocratic genes, and Francie (Peggy Ann Garner), the budding writer in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," are girls whose eyes open onto a wider world.
Directed by Elia Kazan from the autobiographical novel by Betty Smith, "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1945) deals with the conflict within a working-poor Irish family over the daughter's desire to continue her education. Dorothy McGuire is the mother whose stern practicality is felt as harshness by her children, in contrast to the charms of the seductive alcoholic father. (James Dunn even won an Oscar for his role, thus confirming the popularity of male charm over female strength.) He encourages Francie, while her mother makes her quit school for reasons that become apparent only later. Mr. Kazan, who made his directorial debut with this film, later discounted both the book (as mushy) and the movie (for its soft-focus treatment of a Brooklyn tenement), but it is a beautifully acted film that earns its emotions, particularly in the denouement when Francie realizes how much she is her mother's child and understands why the mother has made the choices she has.
The same year, "National Velvet" introduced another precocious child, a dazzling 13-year-old Elizabeth Taylor, who became an instant role model to millions of horse-loving, jockey-wannabe little girls like me. It is one of the rare movies in which the mother (Ann Revere) totally nourishes the daughter's ambitions, even though she has had to give up her own career as a prize-winning swimmer. Yet in both films there is a lingering melancholy, a sweet sadness on the part of McGuire and Revere, not just at the prospect of losing their daughters, but also over their own lost dreams. "What might I have done if I'd been born later, started earlier, stuck with it?" are the words they can't even bring themselves to say.
The American investment in education, the mandate of rising expectations (each generation should surpass the previous one) and the new credo of feminist fulfillment run headlong into the unresolvable quandaries of mother-daughter love: how can a daughter separate from her mother without losing some core part of herself? How can a mother let her daughter go without yanking the soul out of her breast?
And yet let go she must. Such is the message hammered home in the old films and the new, although in the latter case their emotional temperatures are as different as black and white. The rollicking spirit of "Anywhere but Here" barely masks the chill of the hapless odyssey and a mother's monstrous theft of her daughter's childhood. Even Ms. Sarandon's bravura acting (she has never been so out-and-out funny) can't quite redeem the selfishness of the character, nor can Ms. Portman's finely tuned adolescent lift the daughter above her unhappy role as sullen teen-age raisonneur. That she is smarter and smoother and more adult than the girl in the novel only makes the gulf between her and her mother seem wider.
"Tumbleweeds" (opening Nov. 19), on the other hand, is all sloppy charm and conspiratorial warmth, picturing mother and daughter as soul mates, reveling in each other's company, roaring at shared jokes in a rapturous affinity, the daughter as often delighted as embarrassed by her mother's Stella Dallas shenanigans. This mother's version of letting her daughter go is to let her stay -- and grow roots and have her own friends.
Yet the final irony of both films is that while grades and jobs and boys will come and go, mothers are forever, deep in the heart and nerve endings. The daughters are indebted to them for the creative juices and the spirit of adventure -- not to mention the hilarious good times -- that these films celebrate.

HEADLINE: THE NEW SEASON/TELEVISION AND RADIO;
Capturing New York's Promethean Fire

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

 BODY:
A WORD to the National Endowment for the Humanities, corporate underwriters like Chase, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and viewers like you: Ric Burns is running out of space.
Not that he's complaining. It's just that as his production company, Steeplechase Films, grows into a purveyor of ever-larger documentary sagas -- from an hour to 3 hours to 10 hours and more -- the need for Lebensraum increases. But public television budgets and the Upper West Side of Manhattan being what they are, Steeplechase now operates out of two small suites in two separate buildings a block apart, off 72d Street and Broadway. 
 "There's something to be said for this cordon sanitaire," Mr. Burns said, referring to the production team in one building, the editing team in another and the artistic negotiations that can create occasional friction. Especially now, in the frenzied final weeks of assembling Mr. Burns's most ambitious solo work to date, "New York," an admiring portrait of the city from Henry Hudson's arrival, in 1609, to the millennium.
More than five years in the making, "New York" is 12 hours in 6 equal parts, or as Mr. Burns puts it, the story of Prometheus retold from era to era. The first five parts will be broadcast in November (Sunday through Thursday, Nov. 14-18, 9 P.M.). A sixth episode, scheduled for the spring, will focus on the last 60 years of the century.
When Mr. Burns's co-writer, James Sanders, an architect and historian, and his co-producer, Lisa Ades, sat down at the start of the decade to map their plans, it quickly became clear that New York was indeed Promethean. It had also proved to be a city perpetually engaged in creative destruction -- the process of tearing down the old and rebuilding, in many cases, bigger and better.
It was the ultimate harbor, the ultimate trading post, the ultimate real estate deal and, most important, a crucible of democracy and capitalism like no other.
"It's the simple core of the story, stealing fire from the gods," Mr. Burns said. "This city in the New World, from the very beginning, felt that there was no enterprise too lofty, too difficult for human beings not to accomplish."
"In the 19th century, in a particularly intense way," he said, "the powers that were previously thought to be -- metaphorically anyway -- divine came within the grasp of human beings, transforming the physical, political, social and cultural shape of the city."
If this sounds like the kitchen sink approach, it is. It's also the quintessential Burns approach. Why compose a short story when you can film "Middlemarch"?
THE son of an anthropologist, Mr. Burns, 44, is a polymath with a narrative mission, at 24 frames per second. His conversation bristles with literary references and allusions, as befits a former doctoral student at Columbia University. In his dissertation, he said, he intended to trace the nature of revolutionary ideas in the 19th century and, at the same time, "bring all the qualities of modern literature into focus -- Carlyle, Flaubert, Dickens, Rimbaud -- in explaining the transformation of cultural, political and social authority."
Instead, he fell in step with his older brother, Ken, and helped produce the 11-hour 1990 PBS series "The Civil War." That was the end of the dissertation, but the start of even more research that led him to documentaries like "Coney Island" (the name Steeplechase Films is derived from Coney's famous amusement park) and "The Donner Party." Even now, he has begun work on a three-hour film about Eugene O'Neill, collaborating with O'Neill's biographers Barbara Gelb and her husband, Arthur, a former managing editor of The New York Times.
On his decision to switch to film, Mr. Burns seems to harbor few doubts: "I could have spent 50 years as an academic writing four books for an audience of 3,000 or a life spent telling stories for a larger audience."
Stepping through the office's dormlike clutter, Ms. Ades, whose next project is the history of the Miss America Pageant, remarked, "We're all hunter-gatherers."
Hiding out at the New-York Historical Society, Ms. Ades (pronounced AD-us) pored over uncounted thousands of prints and photographs. "What keeps me awake at night is thinking that I might have missed one."
For fans of Burns brothers documentaries, the format will be familiar: passionately written but with low-key narration. Interspersed with contemporary video of New York are close-ups and pans of etchings, paintings and historical maps as well as early photographic stills; original musical themes repeated in rhythms and keys both joyful and mournful; and the voices of actors and writers breathing life into the words of those who watched or commented on history as it was being made.
There are also "witnesses," contemporary experts whose comments amount to a Greek chorus on the theme. They include Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Martin Scorsese, E. L. Doctorow and Fran Lebowitz.
"Bob Stern compared the city to the greatest fireworks you ever saw," Mr. Burns said, referring to the architect Robert A. M. Stern. "Out of each cascade comes yet another, higher, higher and louder still. Narratively, this aspect of the city's history is a gift. At each stage along the way it seems to be saying, 'You ain't seen nothin' yet.' And you haven't."
Consider this bit of synthesis. "When New York was founded at the dawn of the modern age," says the narrator, David Ogden Stiers, "London and Paris were already 1,500 years old; Rome and Beijing, 2000; Jerusalem, 4,000. And yet somehow, in the centuries to come, the tiny colony on the edge of the world would rise to become the greatest city on earth -- the undisputed cultural and economic capital of the world -- and the supreme laboratory of modern life."
What follows is stunning, though not because New York turns out to be unique in all the ways he and others say it is. It's that the New York story, from raunchy Dutch trading post to luminous global icon, seems to be all of a piece these last 350 years. The more it changes -- and New York is forever changing -- the more it stays the same.
"New York City was founded by the Dutch," says Brendan Gill, the New Yorker writer and preservationist who died in December 1997. "The Dutch didn't give a damn about anything except making money."
New York -- crowded, dirty, noisy, disorganized and often violent -- was home to more people of more different ethnic and religious backgrounds than anywhere else. Yet its blend of frontier democracy and greed acted as a growth hormone of frightening power. It still does.
Expanding on Mr. Gill's observation, John Steele Gordon, a historian who writes the "Business in America" column in American Heritage magazine, said: "New York was founded for no other reason than to make a buck. The Puritans came to New England to worship God as they saw fit. The Catholics came to Maryland, the Quakers to Pennsylvania. The Dutch came to Manhattan to get beaver skins.
"They didn't get around to even building a church for 17 years," Mr. Gordon said. "And ever since, you know, however big the city has gotten, somewhere deep in its soul it is always New Amsterdam. Where modern capitalism was invented."
Everything right down to the Manhattan street grid, adopted in 1811, seems in retrospect to have been designed uncannily to propel the city into yet another era of growth, prosperity and power.
AND just 200 years after the city's founding, DeWitt Clinton proposed what Mr. Stiers, the narrator, describes as a "363-mile-long ditch that if completed would transform forever New York's relation to the entire American continent": the Erie Canal. When it was completed in 1825, "it made New York the only American city that connected Europe on one side with the heartland of the continent on the other," Mr. Stern, the architect, said.
"And that has been New York's strength ever since," he continued. "It still is the major port of entry and transfer point for people flying from Europe to the rest of the country. You see New York, and then you see America."
What you really see, Mr. Burns said, is something he recalled from Ezra Pound, writing about the city in 1913. He recited it from memory:
 "And is New York the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban nights are like the nights there. I have looked down across the city from high windows. It is then that the great buildings lose reality and take on magical powers. . . . Squares and squares of flame set and cut into the ether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will."

HEADLINE: A SEASON TO USHER IN 1,OOO MORE;
A Marathon of Midnights In Times Square

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER REARDON; Christopher Reardon, a former fellow of the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, writes frequently for Arts & Leisure.

 BODY:
SOMETIME back in the 80's, Peter Kohlmann and his wife decided to celebrate New Year's Eve with a couple hundred thousand strangers. Late in the evening, they made their way to Times Square, melted into the crowd and began to wait. Mr. Kohlmann, who was an aide to Mayor Edward I. Koch at the time, remembers little else about the event, but then there was only so much to remember.
"At midnight the ball came down, everyone cheered and 10 minutes later they went home," he recalled one day last month. "That's about all there was to it." 
 It's safe to say nobody will find this year's festivities so rudimentary, and Mr. Kohlmann is a primary reason. As the executive producer of "Times Square 2000, the Global Celebration at the Crossroads of the World," he is betting the farm to turn a familiar sight into a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. The 26-hour extravaganza, estimated to cost at least $7 million, is arguably the most daunting event ever planned in New York City, a double wager in theatrical production and crowd control.
The cast and crew number nearly 1,000, and there is no rehearsal. The total audience clogging midtown is expected to reach 1.5 million, prompting one of the largest police details in the city's history. (More than 1 billion television viewers are anticipated.) What's more, the timing has made it necessary to prepare contingency plans for a winter storm or a global computer meltdown.
"You can't go to a textbook and figure this out," said Mr. Kohlmann, who serves as vice president for marketing and special events at the Times Square Business Improvement District. "You have to rely on intuition and sensitivity to what the crowd is going to be feeling."
Geoff Puckett, the creative director for this year's gala, likens it to a pagan festival with high-tech trimmings. Starting at six in the morning, huge video screens mounted throughout the theater district will show distant crowds greeting the new year in each of the world's time zones. Dancers will perform on a central stage as music fills the air and confetti showers the streets. Meanwhile, a cavalcade of giant puppets designed by Michael Curry will try to evoke the splendor of the natural world and the epic span of civilization.
The climax comes at midnight, of course, but this year a new Waterford crystal ball, activated by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a surprise guest, will descend the flagpole atop One Times Square. And unlike the first time Mr. Kohlmann rang in the new year there, the show will carry on until the Midway Islands follow the rest of the world into the 21st century.
David Parsons, who is choreographing the dance and puppetry segments, welcomed the unpredictability of it all. "After midnight, what's the feeling going to be?" he mused in a recent interview. "Are people going to hang out for six more hours or go home? It's terribly exciting to think about. What do a million people do on the last day of the millennium?"
"Times Square 2000" is not the biggest New Year's Eve celebration -- after all, four million revelers are expected to gather on the beaches in Rio de Janeiro -- but it is a telling one. Like Olympic ceremonies and Super Bowl halftime shows, it reflects a mass-media imperative to keep outdoing itself. At the same time it seeks to transcend its own tradition and, like Napoleon's coronation or the ticker-tape parade for the first men to walk on the moon, mark a singular historical moment.
"This is like a performance that's always been waiting to happen," said Mr. Curry, 41, who is best known for his work with Julie Taymor on "The Lion King." "There's an established audience, and the whole world knows about it. In terms of preproduction and promotion, it's a dream."
Some New Yorkers are less enthusiastic about the event. "I suspect this is just going to be a wink and a nod and a flash and it's gone," said the historian Mike Wallace, who won a Pulitzer Prize this year for "Gotham, a History of New York City to 1898," which he wrote with Edwin G. Burrows. "It's an ersatz thing, a number clicking over."
The enormous festivals that marked the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the laying of the Atlantic Cable in 1858 sprang from a very different source, Mr. Wallace said. "In those cases there was a palpable sense of accomplishment, and you could see the city's tremendous economic engines revving up."
Mr. Burrows also anticipates a hollow ritual, but he marvels at its appeal. "It's amazing that people still do that in a media age," he said, "that there are still places where people like to gather."
The real puzzle is where to fit them all. This year, streets will be closed as far north as Columbus Circle and as far south as Madison Square Garden. Latecomers who don't have a direct view will be able to watch the events unfold on the outsize video screens.
Such a spectacle was unthinkable a decade or two ago, when rowdy throngs choked the streets. But the police have since mastered the technique of shepherding spectators into neat pens, four per block, and keeping the emergency lanes clear. While the number of arrests has plummeted -- only four people were charged last year for disorderly conduct -- the average turnout has doubled to half a million, 85 percent of them out-of-towners.
Still, there is something incongruous and inhibiting about the idea of making merry in the presence of thousands of police officers. As Mr. Wallace and Mr. Burrows point out in "Gotham," New Year's Eve has historically been a time of plebeian revelry, when spontaneous packs known as "calithumpian bands" ran through the streets beating on pans and hollering into the night.
Letting people vent social tensions has been the impulse for many officially sanctioned spectacles as well, from Dionysian festivals in ancient Greece to Carnival in Rio. In many cases, participants were encouraged to flout cultural norms through cross-dressing, ritual madness or frenzied dancing.
OF course, the observance of such customs was one factor that led area businesses and property owners, including The New York Times Company, to establish the Times Square Business Improvement District in 1992. With an annual budget of $8 million, the BID is a nonprofit organization that seeks to spruce up the neighborhood by deploying extra sanitation and security crews. It also produces annual events like Broadway on Broadway, a one-day musical showcase that takes place today at noon, and the New Year's Eve celebration.
Planning for the millennial gala began in 1994, when the BID invited suggestions for how to mark the occasion. The winning idea came from a Belgian student and four Americans -- a mother, a molecular biologist, a software programmer and a news producer -- who each proposed a marathon of midnights using live video links to other time zones.
Turning that rough concept into a viable production has not been easy, though. While offering a ready-made rhythmic structure, with hourly highs and intermediate lows, it also left some gaping holes to fill. The size of the audience and the location, a famously busy thoroughfare, didn't make things any simpler.
"This is, without a doubt, one of the most bizarre venues I've ever worked in," said Mr. Puckett, 41, whose resume lists numerous Superbowls, Olympics and Disney productions.
The job of solving these quandaries fell to Mr. Kohlmann, who can seem an unlikely impresario for such a splashy event. Tall and trim at age 46, he is more deliberate than Dionysian. But his cautious reserve plays well with the city officials, building owners and business managers whose consent he needs to go ahead with the show.
His track record also inspires their confidence. In 1986 he served as Mayor Koch's liaison with the planners of the three-day celebration of the Statue of Liberty's centennial, which drew two million people. A year later he led the city's bicentennial salute to the Constitution, then orchestrated Earth Day in 1990, which drew 750,000 to Central Park, and a ticker-tape parade for Gulf war veterans in 1991. In 1992 he joined the newly formed Times Square BID, which had just taken over the annual New Year's Eve celebration from the owners of One Times Square.
Mr. Kohlmann set out to restore some cultural cachet to the event, whose television ratings were in free fall. To make it "more telegenic and more exciting," he brought in Treb Heining, 45, a California balloon and confetti artist who had worked on the Gulf war parade. Then he added a light show, refurbished the ball (which had been in use since 1907) and started offering a free video feed to broadcasters around the world.
"Almost every year we've introduced a new element," he said. "But we don't want to stray too far from the tradition. I've always felt this thing is about the crowd, the ball and the space."
Even so, the millennium clearly called for something special. Casting about for reliable talent, he assembled a team that was comfortable straddling the line between art and entertainment. After ruling out costly celebrities and dangerous stunts, they held a series of brainstorming sessions to drum up scenarios for the event. Eventually, Mr. Puckett said, they agreed on a sequence of hourly themes, one for each time zone, and sets of images evoking indigenous "animals, architecture, metaphors, colors, textures and moods."
Mr. Curry saw the unconventional venue as an opportunity to change the dynamic between the performers and the audience. "My first thought was to have something like an overhead stage or an aerial procession," he said.
Last year he tried out a prototype of Father Time that was roughly the size of a city bus; nine puppeteers raised it aloft with long fiberglass poles and paraded through the 12-foot-wide emergency lane.
This year Mr. Curry is using a 40-foot scroll to map out the daylong procession, which includes such fanciful figures as a jellyfish, a sailing ship and a whirling dervish.
Like the theater director and designer Max Reinhardt, who was known for using outdoor venues and open stages, Mr. Curry strives for a kind of transparency. He often makes his puppets, which he likens to kites, out of mesh fabrics that allow light to pass through. What's more, he prefers that his puppeteers remain visible to the audience, as they do in "The Lion King."
"I love the authenticity and challenge of live movement in front of a crowd," he said. "And I love the idea that people can look a performer in the eye and have a pure human connection."
MR. PARSONS, 39, who was a leading dancer for Paul Taylor before starting his own modern dance troupe in 1987, is choreographing parts of the procession, including a duet by Father Time and Baby Time. He is also arranging periodic performances on a stage, which will be erected between 45th and 46th Streets, by his troupe, dozens of folkloric dancers and gymnasts in scuba gear and other whimsical attire.
Mr. Parsons' penchant for combining formal artistry with crowd-pleasing theatrics seems to suit the job. In his signature piece, the 1982 solo "Caught," he uses a strobe light to create a sequence of stop-action images of himself in midair. More than a photographic gimmick, it's an engaging dance where movement is implied and imagined, but never seen.
"Times Square 2000" goes to the other extreme, where the audience sees all. Ordinarily, performing for a big crowd calls for sweeping steps and exaggerated gestures that are visible from afar. But because of the simultaneous television broadcast, Mr. Parsons must also work in finer moves for the camera.
Or rather, 15 cameras. David Stern, the video producer, will edit two shows at once: one for broadcasters and the Internet, and one for the video screens around Times Square. The prospect of all that improvising thrills him. "That's what I do for a living," he said. "I watch a lot of monitors and I make split-second decisions. It's live editing, and it's a lot of fun."
Lately Mr. Puckett has been compiling a script with split-second timing references that will be synchronized with the atomic clock in Colorado. But he emphasized that it would be a story told through images, not words. There will be no host and no singers. The musical score, which will play over a wireless, 16-channel system, includes many vocal tracks, but few are in English.
One advantage of visual pageantry is its appeal to international viewers, but Mr. Puckett said it was primarily an esthetic choice harking back to customs that predate the information age.
"The concept of festival is a lost art in America," said Mr. Puckett, whose research took him to see ceremonial bonfires in Valencia, Spain, ice-sculpture contests in Alaska and other quirky rituals. "We wanted to get off the beaten path."
Some time zones will occasion more fanfare than others. One of the louder flourishes will come at 6 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, when midnight arrives in 41 countries in Africa and Europe. Mr. Puckett plans to set the mood and modulate the energy level of the crowd by shifting attention from the stage to the street or the video screens, or cutting from one song to another. "You want them to feel they've experienced it all," he said, "without sending them into a complete frenzy."
"There was a lot of concern last year that the music might make the audience more active," he said. "But in fact they were less inclined to do their own thing. The music brought people together around a shared experience."
Periodically, Mr. Heining and his rooftop crew will give the audience things to do, like catch confetti. Along with 3,000 to 4,000 pounds of brightly colored tissue paper, he said, they will scatter foam or paper maple leaves and butterflies over the crowd as mementos.
"We're trying to make New Year's Eve a little gentler," said Mr. Kohlmann. "It's an important marketing tool, a way to project the image of Times Square as a fun and exciting place."
A short while later, in his corner office overlooking Times Square, Mr. Kohlmann reached to his bookshelf and pulled down a biography of P. T. Barnum. Leafing through it, he confessed an affinity with the legendary showman. But while he shares Barnum's desire to regale the masses, he is not a man who speaks in superlatives. Rather than promising the greatest show on earth, he opts for the soft sell of elliptical understatement. "We're not claiming to be anything more than a Times Square New Year's Eve."

HEADLINE: A Team That Makes Bright Ideas Brighter

BYLINE: By DOMINIC MARIANI 

 BODY:
JUST about everyone can come up with an idea for a new product. The trick is how to make it and how to sell it.
If you live in Connecticut, there's a group you can talk to: the ProduCTeam. 
 ProduCTeam is a collaborative effort that develops and markets products. The team brings together inventors, manufacturers and business professionals.
The team is a Connecticut-based network of manufacturers, marketers and distributors that was started to study the manufacturing sector of the economy with a state grant seven years ago, but is now almost totally independent. The group is funded by member dues and royalty arrangements from successful products.
ProduCTeam is part of the Institute for Industrial and Engineering Technology in New Britain, an outreach educational function affiliated with Central Connecticut State University's School of Technology. It is dedicated to building and expanding the state's 6,000 small- to medium-sized (under 500 employees) manufacturing companies.
"We like to think of ourselves as a one-stop shopping center for product development," said Alan Kendrix, ProduCTeam's director. "We start with someone's concept and if we like it, we develop it straight on through to taking it to the consumer."
One product the group brought to market was a cocktail waitress's idea for a new kind of insole for high-heeled shoes, called High Heals. Another was the brainchild of a Waterbury police officer, an exterior light, called Life Light, that blinked from any house that 911 was called from.
After witnessing a ladder accident, Bill Moselsky came up with the idea for Shur-Foot, a four-footed, nonskid ladder attachment to prevent slipping.
Another product is the Rapor Fast-Trac Door that prevents unauthorized people from entering a building and stops employees from exiting with confidential equipment or products. The door is used at The Connecticut State Lottery headquarters and in several I.B.M. locations.
There are 100 units in production at Scan-Optics Inc. in Manchester.
The typical ProduCTeam process begins with someone contacting Mr. Kendrix with an idea, often communicated over the network's Website at www.producteam.com.
"I prefer to work with someone who already has a patent or a patent pending," Mr. Kendrix said. "If neither exists yet, we and our manufacturers sign a non-disclosure agreement to protect the intellectual property of the inventor."
Then he and the inventor present the new product idea at one of the thrice-monthly, early morning meetings with associate members (usually 10-12 people). Generally, three new products will be reviewed at each meeting.
Associate members include patent attorneys, engineers and designers, marketing specialists and master product brokers. They offer design, material, packaging and manufacturing suggestions, but also exchange information with one another that improve their own businesses.
If there is any interest shown, an evaluation form is passed out and members exchange ideas on what they call "the road to revenue." The inventor then comes back for another meeting with those interested associates and this time Mr. Kendrix will invite one or more of the 20 manufacturer members of the network.
Once a manufacturer is determined they may be given production space in one of the 14 subsidized "incubation centers," or work/office spaces in the Manufacturing Applications Center in the institute's building on Main Street. Office support, skilled professionals and student engineers are provided to work on developing a prototype of the product.
The Rapor Door group is completing two years of product development in one of the incubation centers. Its operation made use of nearly 3,000-square-feet of university-owned space at $8 a foot. It now has patents for its product in Japan, Israel, Canada, Mexico and the European Economic Community.
"There's no way we could've managed it otherwise," said Joseph Black, the chief executive of Rapor. "Not only was the space essential, but all the other personnel resources as well. And we are now a successful Connecticut company with no intention of ever leaving the state."
Once a prototype has been completed, various marketing and selling functions are farmed out through the network until someone places an order for the product.
"What ProduCTeam and the rest of us here at I.I.E.T. do is essentially to try to bring in manufacturing work to the state of Connecticut," said the institute's executive director, Dr. Edward Rybczyk. "If you bring in the work, businesses will create the jobs."
Mr. Kendrix is a big believer is what he likes to call "social capital."
"We've found that relationships are the best way to drive business," he said. "Someone who knows someone in the right place can help move things along."
According to Mr. Kendrix, if an inventor made a cold call to a major retailer to get that buyer to see his product, the call probably wouldn't get returned. But if one of his ProduCTeam associate members made the call, there would be a much better chance.
Mike Casale of Liazon Marketing in Newtown in an associate member of ProduCTeam.
"What I like best about being part of the group is its multilayered nature," he said. "There are some members with experience in consumer products, others with industrial connections and some who have expertise in mass merchandising. And they all share their ideas and contacts freely."
And it's because of this close-knit network, according to Mr. Casale, that they can surround a product with as many as 10 to 100 seasoned, well-versed professionals in a matter of a few telephone calls. If the network likes the product, they begin to try and sell it. But even if they don't, the very least an inventor will get are experienced opinions as to what's wrong and how the idea can be modified.
According to Jeff Blodgett, vice president of research for the private, nonprofit Connecticut Economic Research Center in Rocky Hill, small and middle-size manufacturing in the state has remained relatively constant since 1977.
However, since 1984 the state has lost one out of three manufacturing jobs, but manufacturing output has increased by about a third due to technological advances and increased productivity. Yet only one out of six residents work in manufacturing compared to one out of two 50 years ago. One-third of all Connecticut manufacturing is exported abroad.
"Areas such as apparel and textiles, primary metals and munitions are down," Mr. Blodgett said. "But the manufacturing of medical instruments and pharmaceuticals have increased. The manufacturing sector as a whole is still vital to the state's economic health."

HEADLINE: ON THE WATER WITH: THE HOUSEBOATERS;
Afloat but Not Adrift, Residents Call House Barges Home

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
SUE SANCHEZ and her 15-year-old son, Justin Spratt, are at home on the water. Standing on the floating deck that serves as their backyard, Ms. Sanchez looks out over Seaman's Creek and a breathtaking view of Fire Island, Jones Beach and the Atlantic beyond.
"You drive down Merrick Road, where there is store after store and you know you're on Long Island," she said, pulling aside the hair blown across her face by a steady ocean breeze. "That's all different. This is where we live." 
 As the summer winds down and boat owners prepare their craft for dry dock, Ms. Sanchez prepares for another season on the water. Living in one of the handful of floating homes moored along a stretch of shoreline in Seaford, she is one of the few dozen hardy souls who reside on area waters year round.
Bilevels, A-frames and cottages built on hulls of fiberglass and styrofoam provide affordable waterfront -- usually a Long Island oxymoron -- by the boatyards of the North and South shores. Unlike the flotilla of pleasure craft with which they share the marina, these house barges have no engines and are not powered to move themselves. And though local regulations and the hardships of living on the water have caused their numbers to dwindle, the houseboaters who remain say they have no desire to leave.
"You're always on vacation," said Ms. Sanchez, waving to a fisherman known as Captain Seaweed on his daily trip through the channel. Justin, a sophomore at Seaford High School, is certified for scuba diving and is now an accomplished waterskier and wakeboarder. Living in their floating cedar-sided contemporary for 10 years, the family has made a lot of friends, like the barnyard finches that nest under their deck, along with the swans, cranes and herons who call this shore home.
"Some of them have attitudes," said Ms. Sanchez of the waterfowl who also have names, bestowed by their human neighbors. "But you have to be kind of different to live here."
Ms. Sanchez has always been a fiercely independent spirit who fits in well with her houseboat neighbors. Known around the marina as Biker Sue, she has toured the country on a black, soft-tail Harley Davidson, and could often be seen riding it straight out of her boat's front door and onto the marina's gravel parking lot. Divorced for 13 years, she recently worked for an advertising firm in Manhattan but is now unemployed.
"The people who live here are more relaxed and self-sufficient," said Ms. Sanchez. "Timmy's an artist and plays guitar, Al's a dentist, Delores is a teacher, Steve's a welder. It's a nice bunch of people. We're always looking out for one another."
They all share a love for the water. Ms. Sanchez, who grew up in a conventional waterfront home in Massapequa, could not afford one now, so this two-bedroom, two-bath houseboat was the next best thing. Complete with a living room, eat-in kitchen, a laundry room that doubles as living space for her two Great Danes and a surfboard suspended from the ceiling, it has most of the comforts of a regular home, only on a smaller scale. "I've had to prioritize what we need," she said. "I don't have space for a closet full of towels."
Since they have to fit in a marina berth, most houseboats are not more than 45 feet long by 22 feet wide. But they can have as many as four levels. Like homes on terra firma, some houseboats are more elaborate than others, with accoutrements like central air-conditioning, oil heat and fireplaces. A few on this stretch of shore have fallen into disrepair, and one or two have been abandoned by their owners, but most are well kept.
Their prices vary from around $20,000 for a fixer-upper to nearly $100,000 for a deluxe model, according to real estate brokers. Rent to the host marina can range from $400 to $800 a month. Water is supplied by the marina; electricity and other utilities are metered separately.
"To me it's much more economical," said Joe Donahue, who rents a floating home at the Hidden Harbor Marina in Seaford, where about 15 houseboats are lined up like an aquatic trailer park. "I have a two-bedroom condo with a million-dollar view, and I'm paying less than a regular two-bedroom apartment."
Mr. Donahue, a systems engineer for Netscape, owns two homes on dry land in Valley Stream and Queens Village, and shares his water residence with Tom D'Elia, who came to visit one weekend and decided to stay.
"I lived in Manhattan but I traveled so much I couldn't justify paying the rent," said Mr. D'Elia, a sales representative for a transportation company who grew up with Mr. Donahue in Wantagh. "This was about one quarter of the rent in New York."
Complete with hardwood floors, a wet bar and hot tub, which makes the craft list four inches to port when filled up, their houseboat is very much a floating bachelor pad. Their social season begins just before the first frost, after most of the other boats have left. "During the summer, we're out on our boats all weekend," said Mr. Donahue, who owns a 28-foot Carver, docked just a few steps from his front door. "But around November, that's when the parties start."
While the marinas bustle with activity during the summer, the winter brings a peace that some houseboat residents look forward to. "Winters are rougher, but they're nicer," said Ms. Sanchez. "It's calm. You don't have all the boat traffic."
Mr. D'Elia said: "It's eerily quiet here in the winter. All of the boats are taken out of the water and shrink-wrapped in white plastic. Looking out on that is strange."
With winter comes the cold weather, the occasional frozen water lines and a few other problems. "We had one winter where the channel froze," said Ms. Sanchez. "I had to wake up at low tide and knock the ice off the poles so the house wouldn't sink." Parking areas are plowed by the marina, but residents must remove the snow that falls on the houseboats, which is often a difficult task. "If it snows too heavy, you have to shovel off the roof or it leans to the side really bad," said Mr. Donahue.
Houseboat living requires diligent upkeep and a close watch on the weather, as the homes rise and fall with the tide. "It's the wind more than the waves," said Justin Spratt. "But it just rocks you to sleep. It's the ultimate waterbed."
Longterm residents of floating homes complain about the salt that pervades the sea air and eventually corrodes televisions, stereos and other appliances.
"It's the worst of both worlds," said Gary Zaremba, a houseboater at the Capri Marina in Port Washington. "You have boat maintenance and house maintenance. There's always something to fix."
Houseboat veterans readily admit that life on the water is not for everyone. "You have to be self-reliant," Mr. Donahue said while repairing the garden hose that supplies his home with water. "A couple of girls moved into the end houseboat recently, and they didn't last a month."
In the early 1980's there were as many as 100 houseboats in the few miles of shoreline between Freeport and Seaford. But in 1984, the Town of Hempstead passed a houseboat code that required a sewage hookup to the mainland and said that houseboat owners must also own the upland property adjacent to its mooring, which made almost all of the floating homes in the area illegal.
"They were impacting the water quality," said Robert Wenegenofsky, an environmental analyst for the Hempstead Department of Conservation and Waterways. "We had to close a lot of the shellfish waters because of bacteria from the waste."
Enforcement of the regulations and attrition has thinned the area's houseboat fleet by nearly 75 percent, leaving about two dozen floating homes that town officials now ignore, save for an occasional summons.
"It's manageable and the water quality has improved," said Mr. Wenegenofsky. "Ideally, we'd like to see them all gone."
Many other local officials agree. In the Town of Huntington, no one can live on a boat moored in town waters for more than 14 consecutive days, according to a law also enacted in 1984. But while several municipalities have outlawed them completely, a few have made some exceptions.
The Village of Manorhaven in Port Washington will not allow any new houseboats in its waters, but the few that were already there have been allowed to stay. "You can be inundated with houseboats," said Jim Tomlinson, the Mayor of Manorhaven. "They enjoy all of the benefits of having property but there are no taxes they pay."
Houseboat owners pay no property tax on their homes, which has long been a thorn in the side of local officials. But the owners argue that the marinas where they rent space do pay property taxes, to which they contribute with their monthly rent. "I pay our fair share of school taxes," said Tony Luccaro, owner of the Thom's Point Marina on Manhasset Bay, where a dozen floating homes are docked.
Michael Mallon has lived on his 40-foot-by-15-foot houseboat in Thom's Point for nine years. He pointed proudly to a more elaborate floating home he had helped build just a few steps down the gangway, complete with shutters on the windows and a raised-panel front door. It was the last new houseboat to be added in the marina.
"The problem is where to put them," said Mr. Mallon, a tugboat captain and popular figure around the Port Washington waterfront. "A lot of towns just don't want them anymore."
Lately, fewer marinas are welcoming them, too. "We're in the marina business, not the floating homes business," said Mike Gagliano, general manager of Ocean Marine in Freeport, which does not rent space to houseboats. "A houseboat takes up the space of three boats. Half of them are a bunch of eyesores. That's not the image we're looking for."
There were more than 20 houseboats at the Treasure Island Marina in Seaford about 10 years ago, but its owner, Mike Leavy, said that he terminated their leases. "There's no money in it," he said, adding that the marina, the second-largest on the Island, rented slips for around $60 a foot, but that houseboats were charged much less. "You get rent, but you have to give services all year round."
Nonetheless, Anna DiPleco, a real estate agent for Accents Better Homes and Gardens in Port Washington, said that houseboats remained popular. "They don't come on the market very often, but when they do they don't last very long," she said. She is selling a fully furnished houseboat moored at Thom's Point for $89,000. Formerly a duck blind, the floating home has been renovated and now has hardwood floors, a wood-burning stove and an upright piano.
"I think it's a great way to live," said Ms. DiPleco, who said she was interested in a houseboat for herself.
Despite the reservations of other marina owners, Mr. Luccaro is pleased to host the floating homes. "They're not a problem if they're set up correctly," he said, adding that he charges about $500 a month for houseboat mooring. "It gives me a steady income. When I was 40 percent empty, that was important." Unlike the Seaford marinas, where most of the houseboats discharge sewage directly into the water, Thom's Point operates a portable pump station that sends waste from the floating homes into the local sewage system. Water supplied to the houseboats runs through two circulators to keep it from freezing. The marina is even wired for cable TV.
"Tony's the greatest landlord in the world," said Patti Daly, who has lived in her houseboat with her husband, Bob, for 10 years. "It's a nice community. Everybody's watching out for each other."
The Dalys' two-bedroom, two-bath home has central air-conditioning, a fireplace and a view of Manhasset Bay. Mr. Daly, who grew up in a bungalow in Rockaway, has always lived by the shore. "The water was always part of my life," he said.
Retired after 40 years with the phone company, Mr. Daly and his wife, who still works at Bell Atlantic, spend some of the winter on St. John in the Caribbean. But Mr. Daly does not know if he could permanently drop anchor anywhere else. "We're just so comfortable here," he said. "It's a great life."

HEADLINE: Welcome to Steakhouse Row

BYLINE: By JOAN SWIRSKY 

 BODY:
NIGHT after night, the parking lots are jammed with expensive cars as patrons crowd into four restaurants along the two-mile strip of Northern Boulevard between Great Neck and Roslyn. In the spring of 2000, another one will open on the strip, and a sixth is 10 miles down the road in East Norwich.
These are not places where you will learn the names of obscure French mushrooms and the presentation will be so artful you won't want to mess it up. These are steakhouses, where the menu needs no translation and the food laps over the plate. In spite of more than two decades of warnings about the dangers of red meat, there are more steakhouses feeding more steaks to more Long Islanders than ever before. 
 Leading the way are the establishments on Northern Boulevard, a k a Steak Row -- Peter Luger, the North Shore Steak House, Bryant and Cooper, Burton & Doyle and Rothmann's, with Morton's scheduled to join the lineup next year. While each of these restaurants claims to be different, they all share stratospheric prices, a clubby atmosphere, dark wood and subdued lighting, jam-packed bars miasmic from cigar and cigarette smoke, and addresses near the asset-rich ZIP codes from which they draw their customers. Though steak rules, they all serve lobsters, fish and a variety of other meat dishes like lamb chops and veal. And they all profess not to care about the competition down the road.
To be sure, steakhouses never vanished from the Long Island restaurant scene. The granddaddy of them all, Peter Luger, has been going strong in Great Neck for 39 years. But five steakhouses in a two-mile stretch of Northern Boulevard? What gives?
"People are going back to eating steak because they're reacting to what happened 10 to 15 years ago when, all of a sudden, every doctor in America was telling their patients to lay off red meat, that red meat and cholesterol were taboo," said Dr. John C. Peters, an internist and cardiologist at St. Francis and North Shore-Long Island Jewish hospitals. "We had an extreme opinion. You couldn't even go to a cocktail party where everyone wasn't discussing their cholesterol levels."
"Now we know that there's no reason not to have red meat once or twice a week," he said. "Moderation is really the answer to everything." Consuming meat this way doesn't change cholesterol significantlyy, he said, but warned that exercise was important and that "taking cholesterol-lowering drugs doesn't mean that you can have steak and Haagen-Dazs every night."
Jon Marin, a 61-year-old businessman from East Rockaway and a frequent patron of Bryant and Cooper in Roslyn, said that he had high cholesterol, took his cholesterol-lowering pill every day and gave up smoking 11 years ago.
"I eat lots of chicken, but as long as I take the pill, I'm entitled to eat steak once or twice a week," he said, echoing the sentiment heard among a wide swath of steakhouse customers who grew up in the 1950's, 60's and 70's and are now rolling in cash and imbued with a feeling of entitlement: I work hard, I deserve this!
Steak is a symbol of doing well, and with so many people doing well in the Island's red-hot economy, it makes sense that more people are eating it. It's also reminiscent of the meat-and-potatoes meals many customers remember Mom making, and thus is a comfortable way to splurge.
"When people are paying top dollar, they don't want to experiment," said one maitre d'hotel who asked not to be identified. "They want old, reliable standbys."
At Peter Luger, which the Zagat restaurant guide called "carnivore heaven," the manager, Robert Szkolnicki, said none of his customers worried about consuming meat, including doctors. "In fact, they're the first ones here," he said.
Gillis Poll, a co-owner of Bryant and Cooper, said that his Roslyn steak house drews a large clientele from St. Francis and North Shore-L.I.J. "who come in to unwind, meet on occasion with pharmaceutical salesmen and eat steak."
"A lot of the doctors have told me that it's not the cholesterol that will kill you," he added. "Maybe it's the stress."
"The cholesterol scare is an old wives' tale," said Seth Bromberg, general manager of Burton & Doyle, which opened in Roslyn on July 26 as the newest addition to Steak Row.
Mr. Bromberg would certainly get an argument from Dr. Frederic Vagnini, a former heart surgeon at North Shore University Hospital and owner of Cardiovascular Wellness Centers in Westbury and Manhattan.
"The studies haven't changed," he said. "People need constant education to remind them that the higher intake of saturated fat associated with steaks puts them at a higher risk for heart attacks, strokes and prostate cancer."
Dr. Vagnini said that he recently saw seven patients who suffered heart attacks or severe chest pain after eating a high-fat meal.
"They should have a tunnel from these restaurants to the cardiac catheterization labs of St. Francis and North Shore," said Dr. Vagnini, who recently co-wrote "The Carbohydrate Addict's Healthy Heart Plan." "I wouldn't be surprised if the cardiologists had an interest in the restaurants."
John Fives, co-owner of the North Shore Steak House, which has been grilling in Great Neck since 1980, dismisses what he has read about the dangers of red meat and high cholesterol. "So many of our customers are on the Atkins diet, which encourages lots of protein and fat, that this is the perfect place," he said.
Dr. Robert Atkins, who has set out his maverick diet and health ideas in six books that made The New York Times bestseller list, did not mince words. "The cholesterol issue was a fraud from the beginning," he said. "The epidemic of obesity in the last 20 years is totally a result of dietary changes recommended by our government and the American Heart Association."
"A steak-and-salad diet lowers cholesterol, period," he added. "The driving force behind heart disease is refined carbohydrates. The culprit is not meat, but flour and sugar."
At the North Shore Steak House last week, French-born Reine Stempa, 55, a dental assistant from Great Neck, dug into a porterhouse for two that she ordered for herself. "Meat is good for people," she said. "I never saw a vegetarian who looked good. They have no glow. In Europe, people enjoy every meal."
To explain the increasing consumption of red meat, Allen J. Bernstein, chief executive officer of Morton's, cited the writing of Lionel Tiger, a Rutgers anthropology professor who maintains that today's taste for red meat has an evolutionary basis dating back to the caveman.
"It may well be genetic," he said. "That craving appears to be as strong as ever."
At least he hopes so. Morton's, a well-known Chicago steak house, is due to open next door to Burton & Doyle next spring. Mr. Bernstein, who bought the chain a decade ago, moved its corporate headquarters to New Hyde Park and has expanded from 8 restaurants to 45, said he chose Great Neck after an analysis that considered population density, income, and the size of the area's likely customer base.
"I always felt that the first Long Island Morton's belonged on the affluent North Shore," he said, noting that an average dinner check was $65 per person and that his typical customer was a corporate executive or business owner between 35 and 55 years of age who earns $100,000 or more a year.
"The fact that there may be a variety of steak houses in an area is not a deterrent," Mr. Bernstein said. "We believe our food, service, decor, and price point set us apart from all the others."
Similar sentiments were also expressed at the other restaurants. Mr. Poll described his customers at Bryant and Cooper as loyal. "I don't mind the competition," he said. "It has actually improved my business. My customers try different places, but then they come home."
At Peter Luger, Mr. Szkolnicki said, "Maybe my customers will try another restaurant, but the new ones haven't hurt us."
Joe Walsh, the manager at Rothmann's in East Norwich, dug deepest for customer loyalty, saying that although it opened in December 1998, the steakhouse attracts "older money who remember the original Rothmann's and come back." The original opened in 1907 and was patronized by Theodore Roosevelt, who rode on horseback to eat there, and in later years by Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton and Bob Hope.
For some customers, loyalty is a thing of the past. George Liebner, a 77-year-old accountant from Lake Success, brought clients to Peter Luger and the North Shore Steak House almost every day for nearly 25 years (and to Peter Luger in Brooklyn for the previous 20 years). But he had a heart attack three years ago and forswore meat entirely.
"I can't eat meat," he said, "because the Federal Aviation Administration won't renew my pilot's license if my cholesterol is high. I can't take the chance."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
Taking and Teaching The Humbling Course Of Passive Resistance

BYLINE: By MARY ANN CASTRONOVO FUSCO 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
LIKE many teachers, Anna Brown spent part of her summer vacation traveling abroad. But what set Dr. Brown apart was the fact that the political science professor at St. Peter's College visited a country where she was -- in the government's view, at least -- unwelcome. She has been banned from Mexico, labeled a fugitive and a terrorist.
Last January, during a visit to the strife-torn Mexican state of Chiapas, Dr. Brown had her visa seized by Mexican officials who accused her and her fellow travelers with Global Exchange, a San Francisco human rights organization, of being "revolutionary tourists" living with the Zapatista rebels who have been pressing the Mexican government for agrarian and other economic and social changes. 
 On Jan. 4, she was ordered to go to San Cristobal de las Casas to be interrogated by immigration. Instead, she returned home. Published reports of her banishment conflict. Some say it's for life; others, two years. Unsure of her status, Dr. Brown has asked Representative Robert Menendez, a St. Peter's alumnus, to help clarify the situation.
"Who do you call?" she said, sitting in her office in the Dorothy Day House at St. Peter's, where the the six principles of nonviolence hang on the wall of the Martin Luther King Center. "I'm assuming that I am banned, but to be quite honest, I didn't get an official letter from them. But then again, only a gringo would think that. I could see myself sitting in a prison saying, 'Uh, but I didn't get a letter.' " And she laughs at the absurdity of the scenario.
Yet, she did return -- "quietly," she said -- this summer, but not to Chiapas. Although the 35-year-old professor can joke about her ambiguous status, the conflict in Mexico is no laughing matter to her.
"One of the reasons the Mexican government doesn't want people down there is because they can see what's going on," she said. "The more you can see, the more you make it visible, the harder it is in the public eye to get away with certain things."
She describes the situation in Chiapas as "a low-intensity war" being fought by Mexico against its own people. Internal refugees whose homes have been burned and crops stolen to harass them into submission live in makeshift encampments, often without electricity, running water or food.
Life has never been easy in Chiapas, which sits on the Pacific Ocean at the Guatemalan border. Mountainous and lush with rainforests, the land is "stunningly beautiful," said Dr. Brown, and is rich in coffee, cacao, timber, and oil, which makes it desirable to developers.
The current crisis stems from a Jan. 1, 1994, uprising of locals led by Zapatista rebels after a 1993 bill introduced under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sought to privatize the country's ejidos, or collective farms. Under the current Mexican president, Ernesto Zedillo, negotiations have been an on-again, off-again affair. But human rights organizations charge that Mexico has been using foreign aid earmarked to fight narcotics traffic to send soldiers into Chiapas to keep the natives from rebelling.
"One-third of Mexico's armed forces are in Chiapas now,' said Dr. Brown, who is on the board of the Strategical Pastoral Action Network, a religious human rights group in Rushville, N.Y.
In December 1997, 45 locals, mostly women and children and members of the Abejas, a nonviolent group allied with the Zapatistas, were murdered by pro-government supporters in Acteal.
"Now clearly that is wrong," said Dr. Brown. "I knew that I wasn't about to pick up a gun and go running down there, but I could go down and bear witness to what people were enduring. You don't go down and tell people how to live their life. 'Oh, you poor people, if you only lived like the Americans lived, or if you only did X, Y, and Z.' "
During the trip Dr. Brown took to Mexico during her winter break last December and January, which ultimately led to her banishment, she attended a five-hour commemorative service, including a re-enactment of the murders and a Mass, for those slaughtered in Acteal. During the ceremony, a military helicopter hovered menacingly.
Not all of the causes she champions arouse as much sympathy as that of barefoot peasants being massacred by armed forces. A member of Kairos-Plowshares, New York City, a religious activist group cofounded by Daniel Berrigan, Dr. Brown said she had been involved in 40 acts of civil disobedience, including an effort to shut down the Liberty Bell on July 3 in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who is on death row for killing a Philadelphia police officer.
Knowing her political leanings, one could easily conjure an image of Anna Brown as a militantly strident, tie-dyed remnant of the 60's. Indeed, her office is papered with posters proclaiming an array of pacifist and social justice causes. But in a recent interview, she appeared as a nonthreatening icon of neutrality, with a physique closer to that of a model than a guerilla.
She spoke with obvious affection about her parents, siblings, and nieces, and jokingly bemoaned her single status. She praised the work of her colleagues, particularly the Rev. Robert Kennedy, chairman of the college's theology department and a zen master who leads her and and a group of others in meditation each morning.
Her blue eyes sparkled with intelligence as she spoke in a gentle voice of the deprivation and humiliation endured by the poor. Resolute in her faith and convictions, she also made it clear that she knows her way is not for everyone. "I never demand that they think the way I do," she said of her students. "I want them to think about how and why they think the way they do."
To Eugene J. Cornacchia, chairman of the political science department at St. Peter's, "she's absolutely one of the most popular professors here.
"I think it's because she's so sincere in her commitment to social justice, but also to them," Dr. Cornacchia said. "I've seen her work long hours with individual students. She seems to be boundless with her energy. Through her example, she's showing them that you defend what you believe in."
Although he worries for her safety and occasionally teases her by saying, "I hope you'll be here Monday, and not in jail," he allowed that "not everyone would probably agree that it's appropriate for a faculty member to be so active so publicly."
But not everyone teaches at an institution run by Jesuit priests, who historically have been noted educators, intellectuals, missionaries, and most recently, proponents of liberation theology.
"This is a community that seems to be extraordinarily tolerant of faculties pushing students and ideas to the edge," said Dr. Cornacchia. "We have a responsibility, particularly in a Jesuit Catholic institution, to educate our students and enlighten them to the social, political, and economic impacts of what businesses do."
Or, as Dr. Brown says with a laugh, "I always blame the Jesuits for my downfall."
Born in Allentown, Pa., the eldest of four children, she was attracted to the study of political science by an interest in service and leadership instilled in her by her parents, both schoolteachers. "My parents, in many ways, lived the example of what some of the gospel stories are all about. They really led the way."
In 1986, she graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in political science from Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales in Center Valley. But an internship on Capitol Hill during her junior year soured her on the practice, but not on the study, of politics. "When I saw what it was really like, I wanted to get out as soon as possible," she recalled. "There was a lot of showmanship. It was sad which letters got read and didn't get read from constituents."
She then earned advanced degrees at Fordham University, where she also worked full-time as assistant director of the government relations and urban affairs office. Stimulated by the diversity of people and ideas she encountered, Anna the altruist became Anna the activist.
"Intellectually I was really challenged," she said. "At Fordham, a political consciousness began to be developed, a consciousness that was a bit more radical and now engaged in resistance and civil disobedience."
While at Fordham she participated in her first act of civil disobience, blocking the entrance to the Salvadoran consulate to protest the murder of Jesuit missionaries in El Salvador, with the Rev. Dean Brackley, who is now the rector of the University of Central America in El Salvador. She also served on the board of the POTS (Part Of The Solution) soup kitchen and homeless shelter near the campus, and distributed meals to the homeless living in subway stations.
In this vein, Dr. Brown now gives community service classes through St. Peter's Community Service Office, guiding students in local service projects. She also moderates the campus branch of Pax Christi, an international Catholic peace movement with headquarters in Brussels.
Interestingly, however, with Wall Street just across the Hudson and an array of multinational corporations nearby, many students at St. Peter's yearn to work precisely for the privileged institutions whose policies Dr. Brown decries.
She resists being tagged a communist. "I don't know what that word really means," she said with a laugh. But radical is a label that does not offend her.
"If people have a sense of what the word radical means, it's root," she explained. "Rootedness and roots go down real deep, and they're the base of support. So what comes from that root? What can grow from that root? For me, thought and action should pretty much be linked."
 
'Perfect' Place for an Office
THE letters identifying the three-story building with the yellow brick facade that houses the political science department at St. Peter's College are barely visible. But if you look closely, you can make them out: Dorothy Day House.
Born in Brooklyn in 1987, Dorothy Day cofounded the "Catholic Worker," a publication that supports social reform and opposes war. Having begun her career as a reporter for socialist publications, she was a member of the Socialist Party and of Communist Party affiliates before converting to Catholicism in 1927. She established more than 30 houses of hospitality for the poor and homeless during the Depression. Throughout her life, which she lived in voluntary poverty, she campaigned for racial justice, pacifism, and disarmament. She died in New York City in 1980, and has been proposed as a candidate for sainthood.
"It's so perfect that here is Anna's office," said Dr. Eugene J. Cornacchia, chairman of the political science department. "She's such a perfect example of Dorothy Day's philosophy and values."

HEADLINE: Making Money, But Not Grades. The Next Step?

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
FROM Montclair to West Windsor, Maplewood to Whippany, school doors opened last week for the state's 1.3 million children. But they opened wider for some pupils than for others, and it is that nagging yet delicate issue that is drawing increasing attention from parents, teachers and administrators.
What can be done to improve the test scores and academic performance of minority students -- even those in the more affluent districts -- which continue to lag behind those of white and Asian students? 
 "There has to be much more monitoring of student achievement," said Elaine Davis, the principal at Montclair High School, who has made closing the achievement gap one of her highest priorities. "In fourth and fifth grade, we have to be asking, 'What is the reading level and what is the math level?' I'm seeing for the first time nonreaders at the high school level."
Schools in Lawrence Township and Maplewood-South Orange as well as Montclair are trying to close the gap in student achievement with new efforts even as a national task force is preparing suggestions for improving academic performance among minority groups.
"This issue is on the front burner," said Dr. Michael Knowlton, superintendent of the Summit public schools, who last spring met in Montclair with administrators from New Jersey, New York and Connecticut who are all dealing with the same problem.
In a report to be issued next month, the College Board's national task force on minority high achievement will take a hard look at the economic and educational factors that contribute to the relatively low number of high-achieving African-American, Hispanic and native American students.
In addition, the report will focus on why minority high school graduates often earn lower grades in college than their high school grades and SAT scores would indicate. And, perhaps most important, it will suggest strategies for improving grades and test scores that will include involvement by parents, schools and the communities themselves.
The task force is also examining social and cultural issues -- including racial prejudice -- as well as educational factors that influence a student's performance from pre-school to graduate school, said L. Scott Miller, director of the task force who wrote "An American Imperative: Accelerating Minority Education Advancement (Yale Press, 1995).
"The issue has emerged in a visible form in part because of the end of affirmative action in some states," Mr. Miller said. "In the process, people became more clearly aware that many of the kids in these programs were middle-class minority kids. Many people were surprised. Suddenly, people can see that these middle-class kids have needs, when they are no longer being admitted to schools that have rolled back affirmative action."
He added: "My hope is that the report will not just bring a greater awareness of the issue. We hope that several different actors will go to work on this issue," including university presidents, minority organizations and foundations willing to invest time and money in poor and middle-class minority children.
It is a subject that many educators prefer not to discuss. New Jersey's Department of Education does not break down test scores by race, and many public school administrators have in-house data that they use for planning but choose not to make public. But the College Board, and districts natiownide that do keep statistics by race, say their results show that black and Hispanic students lag from elementary school all the way through 12th grade.
For instance, black students continue to trail white students on the SAT's, even when the parents of black students have graduate degrees. According to 1998 data, black students whose parents had at least one graduate degree scored an average verbal score of 482 and 472 in math. The average score for a white student with at least one parent with a graduate degree was 566 in verbal and 568 in math.
And in New Jersey, the 1998 SAT scores showed white students received an average score of 519 in verbal and 527 in math, as against 428 in verbal and 427 in math for African-American students and 461 in verbal and 463 in math for Hispanic students.
Nationwide, among students who reported that their family income was from $80,000 to $100,000 a year (70,000 whites and 4,200 blacks), black students averaged 482 in verbal and 472 in math, as against 543 in verbal and 547 in math for white students.
Faced with such disturbing trends, 14 school districts in nine states have formed the Minority Student Achievement Network to encourage research on this gap in achievement and to share information when programs aimed at shrinking that gap appear successful. Although the organization, headed by Dr. Allan Alson, superintendent of Evanston Township High School in Illinois, does not include any New Jersey schools, administrators from Montclair and Maplewood-South Orange have been in contact with Mr. Alson and say they plan to share information with the group.
In Evanston, where about 42 percent of the 2,900 students are black, almost 25 percent of the black students failed at least one course in the 1997-98 school year, as against 4 percent of the white students. Moreover, state reading tests showed that almost half the black students were reading below grade level.
"The very first step is explicit honesty of where we stand," said Dr. Alson, who started the group last year. "If we don't say where we stand, we can't fix it. There are many success stories embedded in the data. You have to understand the success stories as well as the disappointments. I feel shame on us if we are not open in having the discussion. We need teamwork to get this done."
Several districts in New Jersey are beginning to confront the problem head-on.
In Lawrence Township Public Schools, where there are 4,000 pupils, the minority students do "60 percent as well as non-minority students" in testing, said Superintendent Claire Sheff Kohn. The district, which is made up of about 30 percent minority students, has instituted after-school tutoring programs and is working with pupils as young as pre-school to close the gap.
"This is something we are looking at constantly and trying to bridge that gap," said Ms. Sheff Kohn. "We do have a gap and it tends to also be correlated with socio-economic status."
The district is also trying to identify by the end of kindergarten students who are showing the potential for having difficulties in reading and working with those students in first grade so that they do not fall behind in reading skills.
In Montclair, where about 44 percent of the 1,600 public high school students are white. black students scored lower in math, reading and language on the Metropolitan Achievement Test -- a standardized test that rates students on math, reading and language abilities. In ninth-grade reading, 54 percent of the black students -- many of whom come from middle-class families -- scored higher than half of the students taking the test, as against 95 percent of the white students. In math, 69 percent of the black students did better than half of the students taking the test, as against 97 percent of the white students.
The district, which expects 1,800 students at the high school by 2001, spends a healthy $8,782 for each pupil and is a community of many well-educated professionals. Still, Ms. Davis, the principal at Montclair High School, believes students need to be watched more closely in elementary school so the district can intervene early to help with problems in basic reading and math skills.
Indeed, in 1997 she hired a reading specialist, Pamela Joyce, who teaches five reading and writing classes to high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors.
Better reading skills, Ms. Joyce is quick to point out, can make a difference in test scores, "You have to use more higher-level thinking skills when you read," she said. "You have to analyze, interpret and evaluate. On the tests, those are all the things that they are testing. The skills on the tests are also life skills, so it's scary when kids don't achieve."
Last week, before school opened, Ms. Davis summoned students to ask their opinions on the most important issues facing the school, including raising test scores. Students told her that their peers needed to be encouraged to take the tests more seriously and to drop the notion that it isn't cool to be smart and do well in school.
"We have to change the paradigm that learning is not in," she said. "It's not just looking at instruction. It's also looking at their attitude when they take the test."
Students told her that there should be an effort to increase the number of African-American and Hispanic students in honors classes and that students need to encourage other minority students to take these classes and then provide a support system for them by ogiving help with study skills.
The students also said that it would help to enlist successful minority college freshmen in the effort to persuade high school pupils that there is a "a big payoff" for working hard in school.
Marlo McGriff, a senior, is an A student and president of the school orchestra at Montclair, takes all honors courses. Yet Marlo, who is black, does not think the school can solve all the problems that create underachievement. "A lot of this has to do with the resources you have," he said. "The disparity comes from the family."
Marlo said he sees many minority students from single-parent families and many -- unlike himself -- do not have a home computer that can scan photographs into a report. Marlo, who was the only black student in his honors English and history classes last year, said his parents have always insisted that his education is a top priority. His father owns a manufacturing company and his mother stays home.
"Education is all they ask of me right now, that is my sole focus," he said.
If he is working on a report and needs something at 11 P.M., his parents will get it for him, he said. "I know a lot of people's parents can't do that."
Suzanne Podhurst, a senior and close friend of Marlo's, believes that support from parents and peers helps academic performance, she said.
"Just having support makes a difference," Suzanne said. "My parents are amazing, they help a lot.'
Her friends, like Marlo, don't find it odd if someone stays home to study on a Saturday night rather than going to a party. They even get together and study and keep each other calm through the heavy pressures that go with honors classes.
Edmund W. Gordon, a professor emeritus of psychology at Yale University who is co-chairman of the College Board's national task force on minority high achievement, agrees that better attitudes about education and intellectualism would make a difference in school performance.
"I place a high degree of responsibility at the feet of the schools, but I don't blame the schools alone," said Mr. Gordon, who is black. "Within the black, Hispanic and Native American communities there is not the same respect for intellectual activity."
Economic factors still play a major role in minority students not doing as well in testing, he said. Even families that have now achieved affluence may have been poor just one generation ago. "They have recently gotten there and they have not come out of middle-class traditions," he said.
It is important that attention and resources be given to poor children, Mr. Gordon said, but also to middle-class minority students who could be doing much better in school.
"If society will become integrated, society must be integrated at all levels," he said.
Schools must also work to make minority students feel that they are in the learning community where they belong, said Peter Horoschak, superintendent of Maplewood-South Orange School District, who for six years was superintendent in Shaker Heights, Ohio.
The district in Ohio, Dr. Horoschak said, was a racially mixed district not unlike Maplewood-South Orange and Montclair in economic make-up and with a similar gap in test scores. While Maplewood-South Orange does not separate the scores of its 6,100 students' tests by race, the gap is evident to administrators who see that the elementary schools with greater minority populations are not scoring as well as those with more white students.
"This is also related to socio-economic status," Dr. Horoschak said. "Our job is to help every student achieve. Number one is that the student feels accepted in the environment. This is the place for them and that they are suppose to be here and they belong."
This year, Dr. Horoschak said, he hired Marilyn Davenport -- who was an elementary school principal in New Mexico when he was superintendent in Albuquerque -- to be director of elementary instruction in the district. He said he plans to concentrate her efforts in Seth Boyden and Clinton Elementary Schools, which have had lower test scores than other schools in the district and have 60 to 80 percent minority students.
Ms. Davenport's program, built around a theory developed by a clinical psychologist, Howard Gardner, that children have multiple intelligences, will include working on new techniques with teachers, tapping into parent and community resources, holding seminars for parents and encouraging teachers to share their success stories.
"We teach the children how to get smarter," she said. And teachers "constantly point out how they are smart," to build confidence and self-esteem.
In New Jersey, as around the rest of the country, the consensus is that the racial gap cannot be closed without intervention in the young grades. In Madison, Wis., one of the 14 districts participating in the Minority Student Achievement Network, administrators and teachers are trying to make sure that students are reading at grade level by the third grade.
"Reading is the first major thing for us," said Art Rainwater, superintendent of schools in Madison, a district with 25,000 pupils, of which about 8,000 are minority students.
"We believe that reading is the key," Mr. Rainwater said.
The district has trained 500 community volunteers who tutor and aid in reading in the schools. In math, the district is requiring students to complete algebra and geometry by the end of tenth grade and begins teaching strands of those concepts as early as kindergarten.
The district also brings successful black professionals into the school to mentor and serve as role models.
Another focus of the Madison school district is to raise minority attendance in middle school and high school. On any given day in Madison's ninth grades, 91 percent of the white students will be in attendance, 84 percent of the Hispanic students will be there and 78 percent of the black students will attend, said Kurt Kiefer, coordinator of planning, research and evaluation in the district. "It's phenomenal," Mr. Kiefer said. "On average, every kid misses one day per week."
While educational institutions struggle to lift minority test scores, some educators believe that a portion of the problem lies in the test.
"Montclair's situation is totally common," said Monty Neill, executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing in Cambridge, Mass. "Test scores parallel race and class. The only distinction is how much. Test items will assume a cultural knowledge. The cultural knowledge of upper middle-class whites is on the test."
Then, some districts will use that data to "track" students and put them at levels in math and reading where they will stay throughout school. This takes away the opportunity for higher level courses, like honors classes, that benefit test takers in exams including the SAT tests.
"Instead of relying first on standardized tests, let's rely on what teachers see in their classrooms and what they learn about students," Mr. Neill said.
Calling the test culturally white is "nonsense," said Brian O'Reilly, executive director of guidance and admissions testing program for the College Board.
The racial gap in scores "is an extremely complex issue," Mr. O'Reilly said. "It would be nice if there were an easy answer. If there were, something would have been done about this years ago."
Test data must also be looked at more carefully than just one set of numbers, administrators say. Students who do extremely poorly on a test pull down the average of those doing very well.
"We have black students do exceedingly well and others way below," said Jeanne Pryor, assistant superintendent in Montclair. "A very low performance will negate a very high one."
Still, no one expects this issue to have a quick fix.
"Montclair, like so many districts is really struggling with this problem,' Dr. Pryor said. "I would hope we will make more gains in the next five years than we've made in the last 10."
 
Just What Are All Those Tests, Anyway?
DURING the 1999-2000 school year, more than 215,000 New Jersey public school students will take mandatory state tests to assess their skills in reading, writing and math.
Since the state began testing in 1978, the exam has continued to evolve. In the next decade, it will become more comprehensive, including portions on science, social studies, languages, physical education and visual and performing arts.
Most districts give additional skills tests, but the assessments in grades four and eight and the junior year of high school are the only ones required by the state. The scores are not broken down by race, but do look at the socio-economic factors of the districts.
The function of the state tests is to evaluate the student's progress and to determine if the school is succeeding in teaching the necessary skills.
"It also gives schools a wealth of information about their curriculum and individual teachers," said Richard Vespucci, spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Education.
The tests are an early indicator as to whether a student in fourth grade needs help with basic reading and math skills. Students cannot graduate from high school unless they pass all three portions of the High School Proficiency Test.
The state's 80,000 fourth-grade students in the public schools will take the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment in May that tests language arts and literacy and math and requires the student to give a speech. Fourth graders will also take field tests in social studies and visual and performing arts, but those scores will not be placed in their records.
In March, 75,000 students will take the Grade Eight Proficiency Assessment, which will include tests in language arts and literacy, math and science and a field test in social studies.
In October, high school juniors will be tested in reading, writing and math and take the trial field tests in science, language arts and literacy and math. This will be the last year of the High School Proficiency Test. In the 2000-2001 school year, the exam will be called the High School Proficiency Assessment. It will be "more rigorous and cover a broader area" than current tests, Mr. Vespucci said.
Students will still be required to pass the test for graduation. If they fail in October of their junior year, they are allowed to take the tests again in the spring and in their senior year.

HEADLINE: The Return of the Adjustable Mortgage

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
DAVID HOCHEISER, a loan officer at Bank of America Mortgage in Fairfield, N.J., is struck by how much the mortgage market has changed in recent months.
"I have 27 loans in my pipeline right now, but only two of them are 30-year fixed-rate loans, while the rest are adjustables," Mr. Hocheiser said. "We're coming into a whole different kind of mortgage market." 
 By many accounts, that is not an understatement. While rates for conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had sunk to less than 7 percent as recently as April, they have been mounting rapidly and hit 8.31 percent in mid-August, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Butler, N.J., that tracks the market. Meanwhile, the difference in cost between fixed-rate loans and adjustables has widened enough since the beginning of the year to make fixed-rate mortgages no longer look like "virtual no-brainers," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an HSH vice president.
The result?
In contrast to the pattern of the last two years, in which historically low rates have made fixed-rate mortgages, which carry the same annual rate over the term of the loan, the all-but-automatic choice of most consumers, "we're seeing a shift," said Neil Bader, chief executive of Skyscraper Mortgage, a Manhattan-based mortgage broker. "We're seeing people lock in at shorter-term adjustables, usually where the rates are adjusted every three or five years," Mr. Bader said. Rates on such mortgages are recalculated after an initial period, and frequently yearly thereafter, to reflect changes in such interest indexes as the one-year Treasury bill rate.
Of course, in a real estate market where houses often seem to be mercilessly scarce and home prices are still skipping upward, mortgage rates are not necessarily a top concern for all consumers.
At White Horse Financial Services in Bronxville, N.Y., Edna Haber, a mortgage broker, reports that most of her customers -- in a market where "20 people seem to be chasing every house" -- are more concerned with simply getting the property they want.
Mortgage rates have softened a bit since mid-August, averaging 7.88 percent as of midday last Thursday. And by historic standards -- as well as the standards of the 1990's -- such rates are still low, Mr. Gumbinger said. Still, the recent rate increase seems to have already spurred many consumers to look hard at adjustable-rate mortgages.
"I'm seeing a huge change in thinking," Mr. Hocheiser said. "Even when the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 8 percent some two years ago, we were still putting people into 30-year fixed-rate loans. But now people are asking more for adjustables."
One consumer who recently decided to opt for an adjustable-rate mortgage over a fixed-rate product is Robert Maina, who works for an investment bank. Mr. Maina and his wife, Claire, who now live in Bayside, N.Y, are buying a three-bedroom colonial-style home in Rockville Centre, N.Y. When Mr. Maina began looking into mortgages in early July he discovered that the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan would have been roughly 8.25 percent. He subsequently decided to go with a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage on which the rate will be fixed at 7.75 percent for the first seven years, and adjusted annually after that.
"As first-time home owners we wanted to be as conservative as possible," said Mr. Maina. "Besides, we view this home as a starter home and I don't plan on being in the house more than seven years. After that, if we're still there, we can always adjust our payment after we refinance."
Rate changes and a renewal in the popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages are not the only recent developments in the mortgage market. There has been a dramatic increase in the amount of mortgage-related information available on the Internet and the number of lenders participating. New mortgage products include loans whose rates can only go down, as well as those that can be used to pay off other debts, like credit card loans.
A new Federal law has been enacted that gives homeowners the right to cancel private mortgage insurance once their equity reaches 20 percent. Borrowers who have less-than-terrific credit are finding it easier to obtain mortgages than they once might have. And finally, there has been a dramatic shift by consumers away from refinancings, which accounted for a whopping 70 percent of all mortgage volume a year ago.
Chase Manhattan Bank now offers its customers a home equity line of credit that carries none of the expenses usually associated with mortgages -- like closing costs or appraisal fees -- yet still lets them take a tax deduction on their interest payments, as well as consolidate outstanding bills, like credit card payments, often at lower total monthly payments.
AND some companies, including City Line Mortgage, a small mortgage banker in San Diego, now offer mortgages whose rates automatically go down when prevailing rates decrease, as a way of hanging onto customers who might otherwise go elsewhere to refinance. City Line is licensed to do business in 26 states, including New York and New Jersey, but not Connecticut.
On the mortgage insurance front, the Homeowners Protection Act, which took effect on July 29, gives consumers who are getting mortgages the right to cancel their private mortgage insurance once their equity reaches 20 percent. Such private mortgage insurance -- known as P.M.I. -- is usually required when down payments are less than 20 percent; its costs are added to the monthly payments on the mortgage itself. Under the new Federal law, cancellation is supposed to become automatic at 22 percent.
Consumers who have less than exemplary credit have benefited lately from lenders who are willing to overlook bad credit histories. In August, these mortgage shoppers found that they were in a better position when using the Internet as well. That is when Mortgage.com, an on-line lending site, announced a partnership with Intuit Inc. to provide "subprime" mortgages at Intuit's QuickenMortgage.com Web site.
Some of the recent changes in the mortgage market have had widespread effects. The rise in interest rates, for example, has reduced the number of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages.
"Refinancings have just about completely dried up," said Sterling Edmunds, president of Crestar Mortgage. "Consumers feel that because rates have gone up they've probably missed the boat, and they're probably right."
Donald E. Lange, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, agreed. "Refinancings are the first casualty when rates rise," Mr. Lange said, "and we've seen our refinancings drop from about 50 percent to about 20 percent" since the beginning of the year for the industry as a whole. Mr. Lange is also president and chief executive of Pacific Financial Services in Torrance, Calif.
Use of the Internet by mortgage shoppers, either to look up mortgage-related information or to get actual loans, has been rising, and is expected to increase even more.
Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., projects that on-line mortgage lending will grow from $18 billion in 1999 to more than $91 billion in 2003, a figure representing 10 percent of the value of all mortgages. James P. Punishill, an analyst at Forrester, points out that compared with a year ago, consumers now have a veritable bonanza of choices on line.
Interest rates are not necessarily lower on line, he cautioned. But instead of automatically going to a mortgage broker, consumers can save money by quickly comparing rates from dozens, if not hundreds, of lenders at sites like QuickenMortgage.com, LendingTree.com and RealEstate.com, which provides rates from more than 220 lenders.
"A year ago the choices were still pretty limited; we had a handful of lenders, and none had their own products," Mr. Punishill said. "But now consumers have the pricing transparency that can help them save."
Mr. Punishill has noticed another significant change on line: instead of encouraging consumers to bypass mortgage brokers, a growing number of Internet firms, like LoanCity.com, are offering consumers access to brokers as part of their services.
LoanCity.com offers a "personalized service" feature that the company claims lets consumers work with brokers to complete all the paperwork and still saves them about a third of the fees involved in a traditional loan. "A lot of consumers don't want to eliminate brokers entirely," Mr. Punishill said. "As a result, these firms are now offering what might be described as 'lite' advisory services."
While most mortgages being issued in recent weeks continue to be the traditional fixed-rate types, the increase in interest rates in recent months has changed the focus of many consumers. Adjustable-rate mortgages are "the hottest product right now," said Mr. Lange of the Mortgage Bankers Association.
"The borrower has become much more sophisticated than even two or three years ago," he said. "They're looking at mortgages and are asking themselves how long they really intend to live in their new home."
The result?
"Borrowers now may decide to go for a mortgage where the first five years are fixed, and the next 25 years are adjusted," Mr. Lange said. "They've decided that such a product works just fine for them, and also that they can save between three-quarters and one percentage point in interest to go from a fixed product to an adjustable. Also, by moving from a fixed rate to an adjustable, they can effectively negate the fact that rates have gone up between one and one-and-a-quarter percentage points lately."
MR. LANGE added that relatively attractive terms are helping ease the risks of adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, he pointed out that the interest rates on most adjustable mortgages can increase by only one to two percentage points per year, as well as a lifetime cap of about six percentage points.
"That cap may seem high," Mr. Lange said, "but the perception now among consumers is that the Federal Reserve has a good handle on inflation, so there is now a higher comfort level switching over to an adjustable than there was in the past."
The switch to adjustable-rate mortgages has not been a landslide. Margaret Scott, a senior mortgage consultant at the New York Mortgage Corporation, a mortgage broker, said most of her customers choose 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, like the couple who came to her in late August. They were thinking of either buying a $1.2 million home or having one built for them.
"I started talking to them about other mortgage products, but they quickly rejected them," Ms. Scott said. "From their perspective there were so many other things to think about other than rates, like whether they should put a lot of money down to reduce the overall cost. Like many people today, they were looking at their home as a long-term investment."
Nevertheless, real estate experts say adjustable-rate mortgages are more popular than they have been in years. Last fall, for example, adjustable-rate mortgages accounted for just 2 to 3 percent of the mortgage business at Crestar, but that number has now swollen to 25 to 30 percent, with most customers interested in one-, three- and five-year adjustable-rate products, said Mr. Edmunds, the company's president.
Like many mortgage lenders, many of whom have seen their business volume shrink as interest rates have climbed, drying up their refinancing business, Crestar has been busy rolling out more options for adjustable-rate customers.
"We've come up with numerous mortgages that have all sorts of features," said Susan Huber, a senior vice president of secondary marketing. Last spring, for example, Crestar began offering a 30-year annually adjusted mortgage that lets consumers pay interest for only the first 10 years, and whose rates, Ms. Huber said, are far less than those of similar products. Crestar's product, she added, is pegged to carry an interest rate that is just 1.5 percentage points higher than the Treasury security to which such loans are generally pegged. By contrast, she said, similar loans now run 2.75 or 2.875 percentage points higher.
Despite the growing appeal of shorter-term adjustable-rate mortgages, experts urge consumers to look before they leap.
"People are so used to lower rates, but they should be careful not to lock in too short a period, perhaps with a one- or three-year product," said Mr. Bader, the chief executive at Skyscraper Mortgage. He pointed out that on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage, consumers can still get a rate in the range of "the low sevens," and if they are willing to pay points -- the upfront fee of a percentage of the total loan, with one point being one percent of the mortgage -- they can get a rate in the "high sixes." He recommends that consumers pay a few extra points and buy down their interest rate. Each point paid will lower the interest rate by roughly one-quarter of a percent.
"People have all but forgotten about points, but remember that each point is one percentage point of a loan and two points is effectively a half-percent of interest rate reduction," he said. "By paying two points on your mortgage, you can bring rates down to where they were five months ago."
BUT Mr. Bader also advises consumers to ask their banks about longer "lock-in" periods -- the time for which a lender promises to hold a certain interest rate while a loan is being processed -- in case interest rates keep going up. While banks usually lock in rates for 60 days, some banks are starting to tout 90-day locks, he said. He emphasized that the longer lock-in periods are especially critical in fierce housing markets like that of Manhattan.
"The market is so tight now that sellers can't find new houses to move into, so they're asking for longer closing periods," he said. At Bank of America, Mr. Hocheiser said he has noticed that while mortgage loans used to close within 35 to 60 days as recently as a few months ago, they now tend to close within 60 to 120 days.
Some consumers, however, may find that it pays to speed up the closing process. Mr. Gumbinger said one way consumers can soothe some of the sting of the recent rate hikes is to ask for a shorter commitment period, which is the time between when a lender promises to make a loan -- generally after it has already been approved -- and the time the loan is actually made. Consumers who have good credit, as well as their paperwork in order, may be able to close their loan in just 30 days, he said, allowing them to get a slightly lower interest rate, perhaps in the range of an eighth of a percentage point.
What about other defense strategies?
Mr. Gumbinger advises consumers to consider offsetting the recent increase in interest rates with a larger down payment, as well as getting a "float-down" option in case rates might actually be lower by the time the buyer closes on the loan. While a float-down option usually entails paying a small fee -- such as one-eighth or a quarter of a percent -- they give consumers access to lower rates if they fall during the closing process.
Finally, Mr. Gumbinger urges consumers not to panic. "When rates are higher and rising, it's more important to sit down and really try to decide how long you plan on staying in a home so that you can find the best mortgage," he said. "With a 30-year fixed-rate loan, you're buying stability, but it's expensive."
Ms. Scott also urges consumers to shoot for the future. "Today, it's more about a home being a long-term investment," she said. "It's not so much about rates as it is about a good buy."

New Brunswick Adding to Its Revival

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE dreary slice of New Brunswick at the southern end of the city's reviving downtown is not much to look at. It is occupied by a timeworn 1929 hotel and a huddle of small shops covering a triangular block.
But last month the city's Redevelopment Authority designated the nonprofit New Brunswick Development Corporation to transform the block with a 550,000-square-foot, 15-story mixed-use building. Christopher J. Paladino, the corporation president, has announced plans to develop the $100-million project with public and private funds over the next two-and-a-half years in partnership with the Advance Group of Bedminster. 
 Called Heldrich Plaza, the project will combine conference and retail space with a 200-room hotel, 198 rental apartments and a new home for the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, part of Rutgers University. There will also be a 300-car underground garage on the 1.8-acre site, bounded by Livingston Avenue and George and New Streets.
The center and the plaza are named for the chairman of the state's Employment and Training Commission, who is also a retired Johnson & Johnson executive. Mr. Heldrich is credited with convincing the pharmaceutical giant in the 1970's to remain in New Brunswick, a decision that spurred the downtown revival.
The Heldrich Plaza site is considered pivotal to the downtown's 25-year-old revival. It is framed to the west by the city's cultural district, where three theaters stand, along with a 175,000-square-foot structure housing the university's planning and arts schools. To the east it faces a 135,000-square-foot block-long building that houses a retail component and offices of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. To the southeast is an underdeveloped stretch of land.
More than $80 million in public and private money has been invested in the southern end of New Brunswick's downtown since 1994, according to city figures.
The project "will have a major impact on the downtown and fill in the last side of the triangle," said Glenn Patterson, director of the city's Department of Planning, Community and Economic Development. It is expected to create 2,500 construction and permanent jobs and when completed, in 2002, generate about $1 million a year in taxes, he said.
It is also intended, said Mr. Paladino, to be a catalyst in moving redevelopment in a southeasterly direction along George Street to a five-block stretch extending from New Street to Commercial Avenue and connect to Rutgers' Douglass/Cook campus.
The project started modestly enough 18 months ago out of the need to build a new 50,000-square-foot home for the Heldrich Center, a two-year-old national training and research institute that holds conferences on labor issues. It now occupies 10,000 square feet at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, across from the development site.
Since then the center's search for a new home has attracted a $24 million commitment from the state, which along with the city saw it as the anchor to a major redevelopment effort. In the process, the project blossomed to its current size.
Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the state's Department of Community Affairs, said the project reflected not only "the continuation of downtown New Brunswick's revitalization," but the state's pledge "to provide the resources to put cities back in business."
The state has already provided a $3.4 million grant to the Heldrich Center. The next step, said Carl Van Horn, its director, is to enter a long-term agreement with the state's Department of Labor to provide the balance of the funds for new headquarters space, which is needed because "we're busting at the seams." Mr. Van Horn said that given the current support for the center he is optimistic the funding will be granted.
So is Mr. Paladino, who said the state commitment would enable his corporation to attract the remaining $76 million for the overall project. Most of it will come from the sale of bonds by the New Brunswick Redevelopment Authority, he said, noting that about 25 percent would come from private banking sources.
He said his corporation had also received a $1.6 million state loan as part of the funds needed to acquire the site, adding that he expected the City Council to approve the nonprofit group as the redeveloper this week. Before construction can begin, the 82-room hotel, home to more than 200 long-term residents, and 12 shops must be razed and the tenants must be relocated.
As with other redevelopment efforts in the city some shop owners on the site have voiced concerns over the process. Mr. Paladino said his company, as it has done before, would help all viable businesses that want to continue to relocate elsewhere in the city.
THE new building, designed by Ford Farewell Mills and Gatsch, Architects in Princeton, will have shops on the ground floor and conference space for the Heldrich Center and the hotel on the second floor.
The third and fourth floors will be occupied by hotel rooms and Heldrich Center offices; the rest of the hotel will rise through the seventh floor.
The apartments will occupy the eighth through the 13th floors and the building's mechanical systems will be housed in what Michael Farewell, one of the architecture firm's partners, calls "a lantern-like crown" on the 14th and 15th floors.
While the varied uses will "feed off one another," said Mr. Farewell, each will have a separate entrance and lobby.
There were previous attempts to redevelop the site, all of which focused on recycling the hotel into such uses as housing for students or the elderly. But none moved forward.
"The earlier efforts were not large enough to turn around the block," Mr. Paladino said, noting that until recently timing also was not on the side of a project the scale of Heldrich Plaza. Today, he said, "we can use the additional investment in the downtown as leverage," noting that it was the state's commitment that "makes it all work."
Peter Cocoziello, president of the Advance Group, the co-developer, said those factors along with what he called "a general push back to the cities" were the reasons his company, known as a suburban office developer, was drawn to the project. Mr. Cocoziello was referring to such state initiatives as its buying a million acres of open space, making development more difficult in the suburbs, and encouraging the reuse of former polluted sites in the cities.
Mr. Cocoziello also said that tenants in Heldrich Plaza apartments would be offered, for an extra fee, hotel services, from housekeeping and room service to the use of the swimming pool and health club. Estimated rents for the studio to two-bedroom apartments, ranging from 675 to 1,150 square feet, are $1,150 to $1,750.
The hotel and conference center will cater to small business groups. A feasibility study done by PKF Consulting, a real estate and hotel consulting firm in Manhattan, said there would be a demand for such a center from corporations in northern New Jersey, which is "an underserved marketplace." As home to Rutgers, Johnson & Johnson, St. Peter's Medical Center and the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, the city also has a built-in market niche, added Mr. Paladino.
David E. Arnold, executive vice president at PKF, said for the hotel/conference center to succeed it not only must be part of a larger project, but the city must continue to improve.
Local officials said the Heldrich Plaza project will help do just that by fueling development farther south. There are signs such a ripple effect is possible.
One is the recent $14 million purchase by the Matrix Development Group of Cranbury of two office buildings, totaling 210,000 square feet, and nine acres, now used for parking, just southeast of the Heldrich Plaza site. The plan is to invest $10 million to renovate the buildings in the coming year, and twice that amount in the next few years to develop the parking lots into a mix of housing, retail, garage parking and possibly more offices, said Joseph Taylor, the company's president.
Key to that five-block area's revival is the city's plans to raze the four-building, 246-unit Memorial Homes public-housing complex, just off Route 18, and replace it with 198 rental and for-sale town-house residences. They will rise on six parcels in the area, including the old Memorial Homes site, Mr. Patterson, the city's planning director said, adding that construction could begin on the first 64 residences by next spring or summer.
A new elementary school now under construction at the corner of Throop and George Streets will replace an existing school two blocks to the east, bringing the redevelopment just about to the doorstep of the Douglass/Cook campus, Mr. Patterson added. The existing school will be converted into 32 apartments, he said.

HEADLINE: DOWN THE SHORE;
Hot and Heavy

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
Lawns were parched; the Governor issued a drought warning.
New Jerseyans were parched; July was the hottest on record. 
 Life was good. Just ask merchants, restaurateurs and hotel owners along the 127 miles of Jersey Shore.
Officials said the beach communities saw increases of up to 10 percent in beach tag sales, many realtors said all of their properties were rented and the Garden State Parkway -- the state's Shore highway -- reported a 3 percent increase in traffic, according to the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission.
The season did end on a downbeat note for some, however, because of rainy weather and beach closings over the Labor Day weekend caused by Hurricane Dennis.
"It was a banner season," said Carl Jennings, the recreation director in Long Branch. "Unfortunately, the last three weekends were a little washed out, particularly Labor Day weekend, when we were closed. I'd say it's the most patrons we've had in the past 10 years. In July our revenues were really up."
In dollar terms, the sale of beach tags from Memorial Day through the end of August raised $185,227 in Long Branch, as against last year's total of $147,784, which included Labor Day Weekend. The township's monthly total for this past July was $83,386, compared with $65,037 last summer.
The additional revenue came in handy, Mr. Jennings said, since beachgoers were so hot they often stayed on the township's 2.3 miles of public beach well into the evening, making it necessary for lifeguards to work overtime.
In Cape May, Dane Wells, an owner of the Queen Victoria bed and breakfast and Queen Victoria Hotel, said revenue at the 21-room inn and the 11-room hotel was up 7 percent over last year.
There was at least one other difference this year, said Mr. Wells, a board member of the New Jersey Hotel/Motel Association.
"This is the first time I've ever seen our guests pleased to see rain," he said.
Mr. Wells said he also noticed some changes in his clientele. For one thing, he said, they have become more upscale, asking for amenities not typically associated with bed-and-breakfasts, like private baths with whirlpools.
Karen Crossland, the night manager at the Pilot House restaurant in Cape May, said she had noticed more automobile and even shopping cart traffic this summer.
"In the supermarket, finding a place to park, just getting from point A to point B, it was just more difficult," she said.
Ms. Crossland said the few rainy days at the end of the season actually helped her local antiques business, Promises Collectibles, because the sunshine is "very hard on straight retail."
Bruce Dwyer, manager of The Crab Trap, a restaurant in Somers Point, said that while the hot economy and the hotter summer helped fuel tourism, it also made it harder for him to keep waiters, busboys and other seasonal help. "I guess the job market's too good," Mr. Dwyer said.
Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, said most of her information was anecdotal because "we won't have the '99 data till March."
The scant information reported by the commission was based on a survey conducted before Labor Day. For more comprehensive figures, the state hires a Canadian tourism research company, Longwoods International, to begin gathering information after Labor Day on overnight visits, sales tax revenue and overall economic activity and employment and then breaks down the information by county.
Nonetheless, Jeanne DiPaola, executive director of the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce, said, "Just from general conversation with business people, for the Long Beach Island and southern Ocean County area, it looks like it was a good season, but no record breaker."
Despite the sunshine and the strong economy, Ms. DiPaola said, power failures on the July 4th weekend and bad weather over Labor Day meant the season was probably about as good as last year. "If there was any chance of breaking records this season, it was kind of diluted by that," she said.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
That Never-Ending Spending

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
THE stack of beautiful shirts on the cover of Roger Rosenblatt's book about why Americans buy (and buy and buy) is exactly right. A visual reference to "The Great Gatsby" -- specifically, the moment in the novel when Jay Gatsby tries to woo Daisy Buchanan by heaping his exquisitely tailored blouses on a table -- it neatly sums up both the style and the substance of the subject matter within.
"Consuming Desires: Consumption, Culture and the Pursuit of Happiness" (Shearwater/Island Books, $24.95) is a dazzling stack of essays itself, finely observed and thought-provoking over all. It examines what its editor calls "the painful and thumping heart of the rapacious American appetite." 
 Mr. Rosenblatt, an essayist for Time magazine, has assembled 13 writers: economists, novelists, short-story writers, journalists. The idea is to figure out what's frantic and what's sensible about consuming, and to reflect on the cost of our national spending spree.
True, Mr. Rosenblatt notes in his useful and literary introduction, consumption has long been a particularly American activity. But these days, he writes, "ordinary citizens are becoming like the big spenders of the past, going on near-desperate hunts for new stuff to buy and to long for."
In explaining this, he says, the book's essays yield two main thoughts. One is that our consumption is driven by an inchoate, unsatisfied yearning for family love and for community. The other is that our striving Western -- especially American -- sense of self demands outer expressions of individualism.
Several of the essayists bring up the idea of longing. Edward Luttwak, a critic of what he calls "turbo-capitalism" at home and abroad, considers the buying frenzy (with consumer debt at 89 percent of household income in 1997) as a misery indicator. Purchases temporarily repair the wounds arising from repeated job relocations, fractured families and isolation, says Mr. Luttwak, an expert in both military affairs and economics. "Americans are emotional destitutes," he writes, "as poor in their family connections as are Afghans or Sudanese in money."
THEN there is our frantic consumption of popular culture and style as a substitute for real community connection. Films have always been a binding force for our economically and ethnically disparate population, explains the critic Molly Haskell, adding that in the movies, characters can "consume without the tedium of labor."
And looking at the apparent paradoxes in suburban and hip-hop fashion, Alex Kotlowitz, who often writes about race and poverty, says poor, black, urban teen-agers aspire to Coach wallets and the outdoorsy look of Ralph Lauren as a way of belonging to the larger society. Their white, middle-class counterparts, trying to be edgy at a safe distance, affect an inner-city style -- huge, low-slung jeans and unlaced high-tops. It's a gesture of commercialism, Mr. Kotlowitz says, "that in the end only accentuates and prolongs the myths we have built up about each other."
As for that Western sense of individuality, Juliet Schor and Bill McKibben each write convincingly about the Americanness of acquiring things for comfort or cachet.
Ms. Schor, a women's studies professor at Harvard, repeats some of the theories she expounded in her 1998 book, "The Overspent American." But they bear repeating here. Identity in America, she argues, increasingly depends on prestigious brand names. And who we are, or think we are, has little to do with keeping up with the Joneses these days. It's about identifying with people on the upper rungs of the socioeconomic ladder -- the boss, say, or characters on television dramas, or celebrities.
Mr. McKibbon, who often writes about the environment, says his identity, too, is defined by consumerism -- in his case, the rejection of it. In a witty meditation on blackflies and other hardships of rural living in upstate New York, he comments on the "catechism" of the consumer society ("the elevation of each one of us above all else") and jokes about his voluntary simplicity.
He writes that he feels "special" because of his wreck of a car, his old clothes and because "it's a 20-mile round trip to get a quart of milk."
AT the same time, "Consuming Desires" goes beyond the ideas of identity and yearning. In one delightful essay, the writer Bharati Mukherjee wickedly exults in a trip to the mall. In another, the novelist Jane Smiley muses on the link between feminism and consumerism. It all began with housework, she argues entertainingly, describing the history of labor-saving gadgets in this country.
There's even something for a book reviewer -- a complaint by Andre Schiffrin, editor in chief of The New Press, about the quality of the books we consume today. Nonfiction, especially, has suffered under the new economic order in big-time publishing, he argues.
That's certainly true when it comes to business titles, where such bottom-line thinking has produced its share of junk: books written as advertisements for consultants, books that promise quick riches, books that glean "management lessons" from sports, war, nursery rhymes or the animal kingdom -- books, in other words, with the wispiest or silliest of premises. "Consuming Desires," published by a small press, is a welcome exception.

Some Birthday Cake For a Toothless Wonder

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, the rising powers of the Pacific organized a loose economic confederation known as APEC to bind together their fractious region. Each year since 1993, the region's leaders have donned silly shirts, flown to some spectacular setting and held a summit meeting. The latest one starts here this morning, in a country much more like England in the '50s than Asia in the '90s.
An opportune time and place, then, to pose this question: Should everyone acknowledge that this whole idea of creating a "Pacific Community" to rival the European Community has been a failure and put APEC out of its misery? 
 Maybe so. After 10 years, no one quite knows what the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation -- the name just stops there because its members could not agree on "Organization" or "Forum" or even whether some among them were really countries at all -- is supposed to do.
When its big chance to ride to the rescue arrived -- in the form of the Asian economic meltdown of 1997 -- APEC froze in the headlights. It could not come up with an agenda of economic reforms or even coordinate emergency financial aid. That work was left to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United States Treasury.
APEC's record on trade is only slightly better. The first summit conferences produced agreements in principle to dismantle all tariffs and other trade barriers in the Pacific by 2020. But like a vow from the Red Sox to win the World Series by 2020, those are hopes, not plans. Tariffs were indeed reduced on some high-technology goods, but on everything else, Japan dug in its heels, and many other countries, reeling from economic crises, slammed on the brakes. These days, the World Trade Organization does most of the globe's rule-setting and dispute arbitration.
Then there is the biggest failure of all: the enormous hesitation to turn an economic organization into a political one, capable of decision-making on issues that affect the world's prosperity.
THE phrase "Pacific Community" was first used by President Clinton at the initial conference, in Seattle in 1993. "We can't imagine now how we could have weathered the cold war without NATO," Mr. Clinton said then. "In the same way, future generations may look back and say they can't imagine how the Asian-Pacific region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony without the existence of APEC."
As he attends the meeting this weekend, Mr. Clinton won't be talking much about the Pacific Community. His theory that economic cooperation would beget political cooperation was appealing when Asia was in economic ascendancy. But now the region is doing more fraying than knitting. From North Korea to the Taiwan Strait, from unrest in Indonesia to nuclear tensions in the subcontinent, Asia appears more chaotic, more unstable and more susceptible to implosion than at any time since the Vietnam War.
That doesn't mean that meetings like this one are useless. They create an easy, natural forum for leaders to talk. Imagine what diplomatic gymnastics it would take to get Bill Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China speaking face to face without the cover of an annual regional get-together.
But many former optimists in the Clinton Administration acknowledge, at least privately, that APEC's utility is diminishing. "If we come out of this with nothing, absolutely nothing, on Indonesia and East Timor, you've got to wonder, what's the use?" one Cabinet member said the other day.
The problem is partly that the so-called community is an artificial one. NATO was bound together by a common desire to contain Communism. The European Union is bound together by tight geography and a semblance of ethnic and cultural cohesion. But these days, APEC stretches to include the United States and Vietnam, Canada and Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Malaysia, Japan and Russia -- an easy recipe for political paralysis.
"It's been a disappointment," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who has long experience in Asia. "The idea was right, but it involves too many countries with too many diverse agendas."
One result is a growing racial divide. The largely Anglo-Saxon nations of North America, Australia and New Zealand keep pressing for faster trade liberalization, Western-style economic reforms and United Nations peacekeeping forces in places like East Timor, against resistance from the Asians, who are far more loath to mess with the internal affairs of neighbors and who resent what they view as American-inspired domination. "There's a sense that Washington is trying to use this as another tool of influence," a senior Japanese official complained recently.
Perhaps that is all it is good for. President Clinton will endure the leaders' meeting in the hope of accomplishing some serious work on the side, chiefly with the Chinese. As for the community, the trade ministers have so far agreed on nothing of substance, and Indonesia's president, B. J. Habibie, has decided not to show up -- for fear, many here think, of a coup while he is chatting with the neighbors.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Edward P. Owens;
Vanguard Health Care Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
EARLIER this year, as worries piled up about everything from an overheating economy to possible Government price controls on drugs, the stock market took a scalpel to the health care industry. The Standard & Poor's health care composite index fell 20.4 percent from its peak in mid-April through early August.
But more than a few pockets of strength remain. "The selloff was concentrated in big-cap stocks that had done well for many years," said Edward P. Owens, who runs the $10.65 billion Vanguard Health Care fund. "The biotechnology and Japanese drug sectors have been strong through the year." 
 Looking ahead, he sees health care stocks tracking the general market. "It's pretty unlikely that the 30-plus percent gains of the last four years will continue," Mr. Owens said from his office overlooking Quincy Market in Boston, where he is senior vice president at Wellington Management, a money management firm.
The best values may be found in a hard-hit group -- health care services stocks, like drugstore chains, pharmaceutical distributors and hospitals. "Health care services has been left far behind," he said, "and probably will be the best-performing part of the health care sector over the next three or four years."
The fund has managed to stay in positive territory this year, returning 6.7 percent through Sept. 3, compared with 6.0 percent for the average specialized health care fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 0.25 percent for the S.& P. health care index. For the three years ended Sept. 3, the fund returned 28.7 percent, annualized, versus 16.9 percent for its peers, according to Morningstar, and 32.5 percent for the index.
Vanguard closed the fund to new investors in February, when it hit $10 billion in assets, and has no plans to reopen it, a company spokesman, John Demming, said.
Mr. Owens takes a measured approach to health care investing. "I'm a very conservative, fundamentally oriented investor with a value approach to a growth sector of the economy," he said. The fund also maintains an unusually low turnover rate of 11 percent, far below that of the average health care fund.
Mr. Owens checks a computer program that shows relative valuation, price movement and other characteristics of 1,600 health care companies worldwide, but usually concentrates on corporate developments.
"I spend most of my time studying medical and trade journals and analyst reports," he said. "I don't have any hard 'sell' or 'buy' points."
And Mr. Owens asks many questions of companies' management. He meets with executives of three or four companies in his office each day, travels to others and sees 15 to 20 companies a day at four or five annual health care conferences. One focus is on research and development. "The drug pipeline is a leading indicator of changes in growth rates," he said. "You can see a company improving ahead of everything else if you see a pipeline that's big relative to the company's size."
He is not wedded to a particular measurement of value and looks at factors ranging from balance-sheet strength to price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios.
ABOUT 21 percent of the fund is invested overseas, the high end of its historical range, including 9 percent in Japan, the highest level ever. "In the last three or four years, the Japanese F.D.A. tightened drug approval procedures and created a major slowdown in drug approvals," Mr. Owens said, referring to the Japanese equivalent of the United States Food and Drug Administration. "They're coming out of that now, and approvals will start to increase."
He bought Eisai, a Japanese drug company, in late 1998 and early 1999 at an average cost of $16 a share. "We think the pipeline will allow it to become a global pharmaceutical firm over the next decade," he said. Eisai brought to market Aricept, the first effective palliative for Alzheimer's, marketed with Pfizer, and has launched a new ulcer drug, Aciphex, marketed worldwide by Johnson & Johnson, he said. He expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent over the next three years. On Friday, the stock closed at 2,585 yen, or $23.7505, 33.9 times his 2000 earnings estimate of 70 cents a share.
In April, Mr. Owens increased fivefold his position in McKesson HBOC, the drug distributor based in San Francisco. McKesson's purchase in January of HBO, a health care information company, was a "disaster," he said, because financial results had to be restated as a result of accounting irregularities at HBO. That led to a big charge as well as the ouster of some top executives and pulled McKesson's price down to $32 a share by the end of April, from a high of $89.75 in January.
But he said that McKesson's distribution business is sound, and that, despite the problems, HBO remains a leading provider of health care information technology. "We think the reaction to the bad news was excessive, and over the next year or two the correct valuation will surface," he said, adding that he expected the share price to rise 30 to 50 percent in two years.
He estimates an earnings growth rate of 30 percent a year over three years. The stock is now at $34.125, 19 times his 2000 earnings estimate.
Mr. Owens recently added to his position in Monsanto, whose Searle division produces Celebrex, the first of a new class of arthritis drugs. "I think success with this drug will make them one of the better-performing drug companies over the next two years or so," he said. The company's agricultural division, which does work in genetics, is a worry for investors because of opposition to genetic engineering of crops. "We think the value of the stock is supported by the pharmaceutical division alone," he said.
He estimated annual earnings growth of 25 percent over three years. The stock closed on Friday at $38.0625, 29.3 times his 2000 earnings estimate of $1.30 a share.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
When an Expense Is Not an Expense

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
CORPORATE profits are surging this year, to the delight of those who thought a slowdown might crimp results at United States companies. Earnings at S. & P. 500 companies rose 10.5 percent in the first quarter, 14.7 percent in the second.
All the more remarkable, then, that corporate tax receipts are down this year from last. Through July, according to the Treasury, corporations paid $140.7 billion, 6.4 percent less than in the corresponding period last year. 
 Obviously, companies are reporting lower earnings to the Government than they are to their shareholders. Nothing new there. After all, tax accounting methods differ from those used to compile shareholder reports.
But the downturn in tax receipts is new. Corporate tax receipts have not dropped since 1983, and that was when the United States was shaking off a crippling recession. And the decline comes at a time when individual tax receipts are running 6.7 percent ahead of 1998.
Forget, for a moment, what the drop might say about how inflated the earnings reported to shareholders have come to be. What's behind the decline?
Corporate tax shelters are an explanation offered by Christopher E. Bergin, editor of the magazine Tax Notes, which published an article about falling tax receipts in late July. "Increasingly, U.S. corporations are looking at their tax departments as profit centers," he said. Once, tax staffers were ridiculed as numbers nerds; now they are revered.
Martin A. Sullivan, the economist who wrote the Tax Notes article, said that if the decline in taxes continues through the rest of fiscal 1999, which ends in September, overall taxes paid by American companies as a percentage of their profits would be about 19.9 percent, the lowest rate since 1984. Five years ago, corporations paid 24.6 percent of profits in taxes.
The trend may indicate "that corporate tax receipts are being adversely affected by corporate tax shelters," Mr. Sullivan said.
What sorts of shelters? Only the financial engineers know for sure. But Robert Willens, managing director at Lehman Brothers, said corporations could legitimately reduce their tax bills by structuring asset sales as tax-free exchanges and using government-bestowed tax credits, like the one benefiting companies with heavy research and development costs. And, the more income a company generates overseas and leaves there, the lower its tax bill.
But one of the biggest contributors to the falloff in tax receipts may be stock options.
Here's why: Under shareholder accounting, stock options are not considered an employee compensation expense, even though they clearly are. So companies that use them -- and rare is the publicly traded company that doesn't -- effectively overstate their earnings.
But for tax accounting purposes, when an employee exercises an option, the difference between that option's strike price and the prevailing market value of the underlying stock is an expense to the company that issued the option.
So the widespread use of options not only hypes corporate earnings, it cuts companies' tax bills and Treasury receipts. What a combination.

HEADLINE: Bringing Good Things to Fiat?

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy

 BODY:
FOR most of Fiat's 132,000 Italian employees, breakfast usually consists of little more than an espresso and a newspaper. But on a recent morning, Paolo Fresco sat ramrod straight in a dining room of Fiat's executive suite and, in vaguely accented English, ordered "scrambled eggs, very soft, and a side order of bacon -- very, very crisp."
Mr. Fresco, 66, a large athletic man with silvery hair, was born in Italy and holds an Italian passport. Fourteen months ago, he became chairman of Fiat S.p.A., the industrial giant that is one of Italy's biggest corporations. He is, in short, as Italian as they come. But as his culinary preferences reflect, Mr. Fresco's fabric goes well beyond his heritage. For nearly four decades, he worked for General Electric, a darling of American investors, climbing the corporate ladder to become vice chairman under John F. Welch Jr. before retiring from the company last year. 
 Now he is bringing some of his -- and perhaps Jack Welch's -- American ways to the task of revitalizing Fiat.
Mr. Fresco is not the first of Mr. Welch's disciples to carry G.E.'s genetic code elsewhere. In 1991, Lawrence A. Bossidy left the company to lead a turnaround at Allied Signal; the next year, Glen H. Hiner departed to test his mettle at Owens Corning.
What makes Mr. Fresco's story intriguing is his effort to take a chapter from the Welch book of American-style management to Italy, a land of cosseted industries and traditions like lifetime employment.
The tenets of G.E. management include being No. 1 or No. 2 in a business, or getting out of it; picking managers that can motivate people and make them work as a team; encouraging communication; thinking long-term and strategically, instead of just tactically; building shareholder value.
"The company that doesn't change doesn't survive," Mr. Fresco said, downing his bacon and eggs while quoting Mr. Welch, then washing it all down with a cup of American coffee topped with a dollop of cream.
Americans think of Fiat as an auto company, but its empire extends far beyond cars, to farm equipment, insurance and even a daily newspaper here, La Stampa. This year, for the first time, cars will account for less than half of Fiat's roughly $50 billion in revenue, and it is Mr. Fresco's charge to run Fiat as a modern conglomerate, like G.E.
That could entail fundamental change for a company celebrating its 100th birthday. Fiat's car division is losing ground in global rankings. Producing fewer than three million cars a year, it lacks the scale of General Motors, Ford Motor or Toyota Motor and faces powerful new alliances like the DaimlerChrysler combination and the Renault's tie-up with Nissan Motor. Losses for the unit in the last four quarters underscore Fiat's weakness.
And so Mr. Fresco, a lawyer by training, may end up presiding over the company's departure from the car business, through a merger or sale.
"We can continue to be alone," he said. But, he added, "that doesn't mean you turn down an offer if it comes across."
His comment echoes the views of Gianni Agnelli, Fiat's chief shareholder and honorary chairman. Mr. Agnelli's grandfather founded the company and he has known Mr. Fresco since the early 1960's, when Mr. Fresco was hired by an Italian G.E. unit of which Fiat was part-owner, to set up a legal department.
"Today, Fiat cars is in a position to proceed on its own, but it neither can nor wants to do that forever," Mr. Agnelli, 78, told a shareholders meeting in July. "It is destined to find some form of alliance. Which and when, I do not now know. I do know, however, that it is equipping itself."
One Fiat executive with regular access to Mr. Fresco is more blunt: "Fresco's role is to get the bride ready for a suitor."
 
Let's Make a Deal
The chairman has wasted no time putting to work for Fiat the deal-making skills that he honed at G.E.
In May, he rushed to Racine, Wis., to sign a $4.3 billion deal to buy the Case Corporation, the heavy-equipment manufacturer that he is combining with Fiat's New Holland unit. The size of the merged company will rival that of Deere & Company in farm machinery and that of Caterpillar and Komatsu in construction equipment.
Two months earlier, he agreed to pay $350 million to acquire Progressive Tool and Industries of Southfield, Mich., for Fiat's Comau unit, now among the world leaders in automobile manufacturing systems. Before that, Comau acquired control of Renault Automation, which also makes auto factory equipment.
And there have been other deals. Last year, for instance, Fiat and Renault agreed to merge their foundry units, which cast heavy metal parts, and their bus-building businesses. At the same time, Teksid, Fiat's foundry company, struck a deal with the Eaton Corporation of Cleveland to make cylinder head systems, following a trend for components manufacturers to produce large subassemblies for cars and trucks. This summer, Fiat agreed with Mitsubishi to develop a sport utility vehicle for sale in Europe.
But Mr. Fresco's most daring bid failed. Earlier this year, he and Paolo Cantarella, Fiat's chief executive, offered $15 billion to acquire Volvo, whose car, bus and truck operations Mr. Fresco says were a perfect fit for Fiat's similar businesses. Volvo's unwillingness to sell the entire operation -- and a $6.5 billion counterbid by Ford for Volvo's car business alone -- thwarted the plan.
The episode has been the lone major setback for Fiat shareholders since markets shook off Russia's financial problems last fall. Fiat shares closed on Friday at 32.1 euros, up from about 21 euros early last October.
"We're striving for excellence," Mr. Fresco said with a soft reserve that sets him apart from more vociferous executives in his country. "The best way is obviously to pursue growth of the organization by a focus on quality and customer satisfaction. But acquisitions can accelerate it."
And, he said, "Cantarella and I have been accelerating the process."
 
A Lieutenant as Rising Star
Certainly, Mr. Fresco has the global grasp needed to face Fiat's problems.
He has traveled widely, first while based in Italy from the time he joined G.E. and then from the company's headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., where he joined Mr. Welch in 1990. When based in the United States, he kept an office and an apartment in London. At Fiat, he keeps an apartment in Turin, not far from Fiat's headquarters, but has a home in Florence. An avid sailor and mountaineer, he has summer homes in Portofino, on the Mediterranean, and in Cortina d'Ampezzo, in the northern Italian Alps. His British secretary followed him to Fiat, providing continuity for his global reach.
It was in the 80's, as head of G.E.'s operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, that Mr. Fresco became a corporate star. He had told his superiors that the fall of inner-European trade barriers, scheduled for 1992, would offer enormous opportunities to companies with a strong European and global presence. Partly in response, Mr. Welch began a globalization drive -- and Mr. Fresco was his chief lieutenant.
In 1987, they were side by side as G.E. agreed to swap its consumer electronics division -- America's biggest maker of television sets and videocassette recorders -- for the medical imaging unit of Thomson-CSF S.A., the French electronics giant.
Soon thereafter, the team snagged several big international prizes, acquiring control of Tungsram, the Hungarian light bulb maker, in 1989 and, the next year, the light bulb division of Britain's Thorn EMI. The acquisitions gave G.E.'s lighting division the size to face down global competitors like Royal Philips Electronics of the Netherlands.
Through these deals and others, the men cemented a close friendship. "He is an incredibly thoughtful, strategic guy," Mr. Welch said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Fresco also served as Mr. Welch's roving ambassador, smoothing the way for the American's annual worldwide tours to meet government and business officials.
"He's remarkably -- what's the right word? -- sociable," Mr. Welch said. "He adjusts to any culture. He's an American in America. He's a Saudi in Saudi Arabia."
Now, Mr. Welch is paying back the favors. In July, he joined the Fiat board -- his only such membership, besides his post as G.E.'s chairman.
"That exactly reflects the depth of the relationship," said Noel M. Tichy, a University of Michigan business professor and co-author of "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will" (Doubleday, 1993), an analysis of Mr. Welch's management methods. "Jack Welch does not go on boards."
Mr. Welch's role is still undefined, though he will serve on a committee examining executive compensation. Mr. Fresco "has been a great sounding board for me over the years," Mr. Welch said. "I'd like to repay him for what he's done for me."
Mr. Fresco is equally effusive. "He's the best chief executive in the United States," he said of Mr. Welch. "It's nice to have him around."
 
Looking Beyond Italy
 At least in part, Mr. Fresco's arrival here is a result of big changes in Fiat's corporate governance -- changes that demanded someone with a global perspective on business.
In the past, the company was a fief of the Agnellis. But the family's holdings have dipped to 30 percent, from 70 percent right after World War II. At the same time, the Agnellis have increased their investments outside Fiat and Italy, most notably in France. Ten years ago, Fiat represented 80 percent of the Agnellis' holdings; today the figure is 57 percent.
At Fiat, too, the strategic thrust has been out of Italy.
The company vastly expanded its presence in Poland after the collapse of Communism there in 1989, as a base for serving Central European markets, and it has joint ventures to produce cars in China and Russia. Fiat has built factories in Latin America for its Palio world car -- a vehicle intended for sale in many countries, with few modifications -- and other plants are planned or are under construction in India, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.
The Italian Government, nonetheless, has been a friendly partner.
When Fiat decided in 1994 to lay off 14,000 Italian workers, Rome jumped in with about $100 million for early-retirement packages and for a fund to pay the workers 90 percent of their salaries for up to a year. A few years earlier, the Government provided infrastructure and other aid worth about $1 billion for an innovative factory at Melfi, in southern Italy. And in recent years, much of Fiat's success in Italy was a result of Government incentives that subsidized purchases of new cars.
Some Welch-like changes were evident even before Mr. Fresco's arrival. By 1998, the number of employees at Fiat's core holding company had been cut by more than half, to 257 from 565 five years earlier, shortening lines of command between the center and Fiat's 10 operating companies. Fiat had been selling businesses, too -- shedding interests in chemical fibers and bioengineering and even a stake in the port of Genoa, which it sold to the Singapore port authority.
Today, Mr. Fresco attributes Fiat's car problems to a pernicious combination of internal and external factors. The economic meltdown in Brazil, where Fiat is market leader, has hurt badly; in Italy, the end of the Government incentives in July 1998 led to a drop in sales that was aggravated by a vicious price war with European and American competitors, including Renault and Ford.
Within the company, the product cycle was of no help: the original Punto compact car -- Fiat's entry, in the early 90's, into the biggest and most lucrative market segment in Europe, and Europe's best-selling car in 1997 and 1998 -- was reaching the end of its shelf life. Its top-of-the-line Alfa Romeo and Lancia models were also reaching the end of their cycles.
 
Guiding the Team
Mr. Fresco says the car division is now on the right track. In July, Fiat introduced a redesigned Punto. And the company is reviving the sporty Alfa Romeo brand with two stylish models, the 156 and 166, and the big-car Lancia brand with a new model called the Lybra.
Mr. Fresco also defends Fiat's strategy of focusing on emerging markets. "Those are the only markets where you can expect growth," he said, adding, "I believe our specialization in small cars, where we have competence, puts us in an attractive strategic position."
Fiat, he said, will continue to hunt aggressively for partnerships with other car and component makers and will work on cutting costs in production and distribution, where it has already begun to weed out dealerships. By the last quarter of the year, he vowed, Fiat cars will be back in the black.
With nine years to go before he reaches Fiat's mandatory retirement age, Mr. Fresco may find that his success will depend at least in part on his ability to get the company's work force to match his energy and focus on results.
Traditionally, Fiat's ability to reward merit has been bogged down by internal rules, often demanded by powerful labor unions, requiring carefully staggered pay raises and at least two years between promotions, said Nevio Di Giusto, senior vice president for development.
"If Fiat had a weakness, we were accused of treating people indifferently of their performance," he said.
That must change, Mr. Di Giusto said -- and managers must learn to bring weaknesses to light mercilessly, rather than trying to conceal them. "The world's getting more open, and this has to find expression in Fiat," he said.
Already, Mr. Fresco has proposed stock options for Fiat's top 700 executives, and he wants to spread the reward system down to middle management. His own compensation and that of Mr. Cantarella includes stock options and is also linked directly to the performance of Fiat's stock, a rarity not only in Italy but in the United States as well.
His success may also depend on his ability to identify new areas of growth. In his Welch-style search, he is stressing services, including financial products.
"The idea is not so much to give some new widget to the customer, but total solutions," he said. "And in the car business, that means selling peace of mind." In one planned solution, he said, if a customer's car broke down, Fiat would supply a new one; in commercial vehicles, a total solution could mean expanding the leasing business. A plus is that the required investment is minimal, compared with changing manufacturing lines.
To prepare for the growth of the company's financial services businesses, Mr. Fresco has recast the financial management, appointing Damien Clermont, a Frenchman who previously was senior vice president for management control at Fiat, as chief financial officer.
Here, too, parallels with G.E. are inescapable. "Welch ran a top team, very informally, with lots of interaction," Professor Tichy said. "Everyone is expected to add value. It's not a one-man show."
Indeed, Mr. Fresco bristles at those who refer to a Fresco era at Fiat. On a recent Sunday, he watched television aboard his yacht as Fiat's fabled Ferrari racing team finished one-two in the German Formula One Grand Prix. Mika Salo, a Ferrari driver, moved aside to let Eddie Irvine, another Ferrari driver, win the race, raising Ferrari's overall standing in the season's ranking under a complex tallying system.
"This was not just one man; it was a team," Mr. Fresco exulted. "And that's the way we want to be -- a team. We want to win."
 
Ex-Lieutenant's Own Lieutenant
 IF Paolo Fresco's prospects for reinvigorating Fiat are promising, it is largely because of the efforts of Paolo Cantarella, 54, the mechanical engineer who became chief executive in 1996.
A former aide to Cesare Romiti, Mr. Fresco's predecessor as chairman, and then head of the Comau machinery unit and the Fiat Auto division, Mr. Cantarella marries technical ability with strategic vision. Fiat's innovative car factory in Melfi, Italy, designed for lean production, and its main product, the Punto compact car, were his projects. So was the grand design to cast Fiat's net wide in emerging markets.
A man with gasoline in his veins, Mr. Cantarella often spends Saturdays at Fiat's test track outside Turin, driving Fiat models and those of the competition. In 1995, when Le Journal de l'Automobile, a French magazine, named him the industry's man of the year, Jacques Calvet, then head of Peugeot, lauded him as an executive who "fundamentally loves the product."
The two Paolos get along well, according to John F. Welch Jr., chairman of General Electric and a member of Fiat's board, and each has a clear sphere. "Paolo Cantarella is very operational," Mr. Welch said. "Paolo Fresco is very strategic and very people-oriented."
Alec Shutze, a Merrill Lynch analyst in London who follows Fiat, said he expected Mr. Fresco to get his chief executive to focus on shareholder concerns. Mr. Cantarella, he said, often spoke in the past about "economic value added," but could "never give an answer what it was."
Mr. Fresco, he said, will teach Mr. Cantarella to stress "share price appreciation, and building value."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Paradox of the Internet Era;
Behemoths in a Jack-Be-Nimble Economy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the modern Internet economy, the race of capitalism belongs to the fleet and nimble. The preferred organizational model, it seems, is the Silicon Valley start-up -- informal, entrepreneurial and youthful. "Three people, under 25, with a hot idea -- those are the companies we're backing," explained Ron Conway, who heads a start-up investment fund in Silicon Valley.
Yet across much of the corporate America the ethos of "bigger is better" is flourishing -- and last week's announcement that Viacom Inc. agreed to buy the CBS Corporation for $37.3 billion is merely further confirmation of the recent trend. 
 The five biggest merger deals ever came last year, when the total value of corporate acquisition activity reached a record $1.6 trillion, equal to 19 percent of the annual output of the economy. So far this year, reports Thomson Financial Securities Data, a research firm, the mergers total $1.06 trillion, only slightly behind the 1998 pace. Business deals on this scale have not occurred since the turn-of-the-century days of J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller.
The forces behind many of the big deals are rapid technological change, deregulation and freer trade, which make it more efficient to market products and manage operations globally. The booming stock markets have fueled the merger binge because most of the corporate purchases are made with shares instead of cash.
Such mergers seem to pass the logic of a high-school economics course. They are intended to expand a network for the distribution of goods or services or consolidate overlapping networks. The goal is to more efficiently use a high-fixed-cost network -- whether that network distributes phone calls, banking services or gasoline.
Yet the logic behind many deals is tricky to explain -- and ego, hubris and management fads are often part of the motivation. Over the years, research on mergers has found that many fail, as post-deal returns for shareholders often trail the market averages. Putting together two large organizations is a difficult management challenge, business analysts say, even when the two companies are a good fit strategically.
"The companies are so large in most of these deals that they already have all the sins of bureaucracy," observed Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at the Harvard business school. "Some of the merger activity we're seeing is defensive strategy in times of rapid technological change and uncertainty. It's an attitude that we'll link up with another company before someone else does."
Merger deals are always oversold when they are announced. A helping of hyperbole is expected, but certain arguments are particularly suspect, business experts warn. Deals are often presented as a "merger of equals," an ego-stroking euphemism intended for the ears of the chief executive and staff of the acquired company. "The merger of equals is a myth," Ms. Kanter said. "Show me one."
Another suspect assertion is that a big merger will result in the new economic math of synergy -- a term that first gained currency during the wave of conglomerate mergers in the 1960's, a business fad that in hindsight appears to have been folly. But today's executives still sometimes play the synergy card when justifying a deal, saying that "one plus one will equal three" or "two plus two will equal five."
The hoped-for synergy rarely materializes. "Most of the time, it's two plus two equals three," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.
The modern synergy strategy usually involves putting together two companies in related fields, and then trying to cross-promote the offerings of each. An example is Travelers Group's purchase last year of Citicorp for nearly $73 billion, assembling a financial services empire that includes insurance, commercial banking, investment banking and a stock broker.
The "financial supermarket" is a catchy phrase, but it is not yet proved to be a winning business strategy, industry analysts say. A notable failure is Sears, Roebuck's venture into financial services, which it abandoned in the early 1990's.
The big media mergers are partly inspired by visions of the payoff from combining related businesses. Michael Eisner talked a lot about synergy when Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1995. And the Viacom's planned purchase of CBS is similar. Both deals link entertainment studios with television networks for distributing that programming to the households of viewers. Yet the Disney-Capital Cities/ABC merger has proved to be a disappointment so far, most industry analysts agree, and the Viacom-CBS merger faces some of the same challenges.
THE business strategy, it seems, runs counter to some basic free-market principles. Isn't the producer of entertainment programming better off having several networks bid for his programs? And isn't a television network better off being able to choose among competing suppliers of programs?
Is becoming a much bigger corporation a stimulus to creativity -- vital to the entertainment business -- or a hindrance to it?
"The challenge for the big combined media companies like Disney, Time Warner and now Viacom is how to make these very large corporations with complex sets of relationships work in ways that pay off," said David Nadler, chairman of the Delta Consulting Group Inc., a management consulting firm. "Just owning a bundle of different properties doesn't mean you get the profit-making synergies that executives talk about when they announce these mergers."
BIG companies, to be sure, can succeed in being creative, even entrepreneurial, if organized and managed properly. The Microsoft Corporation, for example, has become a huge company, but it keeps its software programmers working in modular teams of three to eight people.
Perhaps the leading big-company success story, though, is the revival of the International Business Machines Corporation under Louis V. Gerstner Jr. When he took over the stumbling computer maker in 1993, Mr. Gerstner was widely expected to turn the bigger-is-better rationale on its head, breaking up I.B.M. into a group of smaller companies, which, it was assumed, could better keep pace in fast-changing technology markets.
Instead, Mr. Gerstner kept the company together. He decided I.B.M.'s huge investment in research and development was an underused asset that could be spread profitably across the company's many computer divisions. And he streamlined management, slashed bureaucracy and built up I.B.M.'s faster-growing services and software businesses.
The results have been impressive, as profits and I.B.M.'s stock price have rebounded. The laudatory reviews extend well beyond Wall Street. The Washington Monthly recently published an article, "What Lou Gerstner Could Teach Bill Clinton: Lessons for Government from I.B.M.'s Dramatic Turnaround."
Even those Silicon Valley start-ups, of course, are eager to get bigger, and the hopes of many involve mergers. Microsoft and America Online, for example, are frequent buyers of other companies. With the exception of America Online's multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape last year, most of the Microsoft and America Online deals are smaller purchases, up to a few hundred million dollars, of promising start-ups that have begun to take off.
The new economy may favor the nimble, but a paradox is clear.
"The dream of those three-person Internet start-ups is to grow to a 100-person company and get bought out," observed Eric Greenberg, director of management studies at the American Management Association.

HEADLINE: Brainstorming at 7. Kayakingat 11. Now That's Teamwork.

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WINGATE INNS INTERNATIONAL wanted to hold its first chain-wide conference in a resort big enough to accommodate 305 people for four days, yet small enough to convey a sense of intimacy during meals and receptions. Because the working sessions would deal with financing, risk management and similarly unexciting topics, Wingate also wanted a range of recreational options where guests could unwind.
And so it was that the owners and general managers of the 65 Wingate properties -- mid-priced hotels aimed at business travelers -- spent four days last month at the Chateau Elan Winery and Resort in Braselton, Ga., 30 minutes from Atlanta. In addition to the skull sessions, there were tournaments on both of the resort's golf courses, plus opportunities to play tennis, jog, indulge at the spa or hike the trails through the resort's 3,100 acres. 
 "The most successful meetings," said John Paul Nichols, chief executive of Wingate, a three-year-old chain and a unit of the Cendant Corporation, "are interspersed with free time."
Jennifer Seifert-Brenna, general manager of a Wingate Inn that is scheduled to open this December in Fargo, N. D., agrees. "During the free time," she said of the conference, "I had a lot of one-on-one talks with corporate executives and other general managers that I wouldn't have had time to talk with otherwise." She also had time to hike the trail and enter a golf tournament that, considering her score, she would just as soon forget.
With the American economy in its ninth consecutive year of growth, it should be no surprise that there are more corporate meetings, conferences, retreats and seminars than ever -- 805,000 in the last fiscal year, compared with 580,000 two years earlier, according to Ed Griffin, chief executive of Meeting Planners International, a 9,000-member organization in Dallas.
Economic growth, he said, means that companies are holding more training sessions and sales meetings and offering more incentive trips.
Barbara Moch, senior manager of corporate events for Novo-Nordisk Phamaceuticals Inc., a Danish company with North American headquarters in Princeton, N.J., said its sessions " have probably increased 50 percent in the last two years."
One reason for the spurt, Ms. Moch explained by telephone from the Peabody Orlando hotel in Florida, where she recently was attending yet another meeting, is that "we found meetings more effective for introducing and explaining new products than some of the trade shows we regularly attended."
RETREATS come in all shapes, sizes and price ranges, and they aim to gather everyone from top executives based in distant lands to employees who work together yet barely know one another.
Next spring, for example, 30 or so top editors of Southern Living and five other magazines owned by Time Warner are scheduled to get together, possibly at the Sundance ski and summer resort near Park City, Utah, to discuss common problems.
"We've never done this with all the magazines at the same time," said Michael Carlton, editorial director of the six magazines, which also include Southern Accents and Coastal Living, "but we feel this will be a good opportunity to get to know one another better." Even though a number of the editors work in the same building in Birmingham, Ala., he added, "we don't seem to have the time or take the time for that."
For decades, the best-known corporate retreat sites have been plush resorts with manicured golf courses and well-known chefs. They still are. But even in these prosperous times, many budget-conscious corporations schedule their retreats during a resort's off season, when rates fall as much as 50 percent.
Golf and tennis are still the main recreational choices. At the luxury Mauna Lani Hotel and Bungalows on the island of Hawaii, breakfast often begins at 7 A.M. so executives can get down to business early and be on the golf course soon after lunch.
But with the roaring 90's minting so many young executives from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, more active pursuits -- jogging, hiking, horseback riding, volleyball and even hot-air ballooning and paragliding -- are making inroads.
Younger executives have changed the corporate retreat industry in other ways, too. "It used to be that Mobil would send 100 people to London or Paris for a week or more," said Jack Sammis, president of International Meeting Network, a conference management company in Arlington, Va. But the younger set, he said, "doesn't want to be away from their families that long."
Still, Generation X hasn't exactly taken vows of poverty. When the top people at Imaginary Forces -- a Hollywood design firm where the median age of employees is 26 -- went on retreat early this year, they headed not for the hills or countryside but for the sidewalks of Manhattan.
"We're in a creative business," "so it's important for us to spend time together," said Peter Frankfurt, a managing partner.
By day, the team took in the Jackson Pollock show at the Museum of Modern Art. At bedtime, they repaired to The Mark, the small luxury hotel on the upper East Side, where single rooms range from $395 to $435 a night, and suites $600 to $2,500.
"The hotel isn't trendy, but we like it because it's serene and very civilized," said Mr. Frankfurt, 40, sounding not unlike corporate moguls half again his age.
MOST retreats go unnoticed, except by those in attendance. But over the years, unwanted publicity has spurred enough stockholder anger that many companies are loath to talk about their meeting plans.
For example, a Fortune 500 food company that has chartered a ship for an employee cruise in Europe next year refused to discuss it for this article. "Some stockholders will be sure to say the money to pay for the cruise came out of their dividends," its president explained, on the condition that neither he nor the company was named, "and some customers will say it came out of their pockets in the form of higher prices for our products."
On the other hand, former employees of Commercial Financial Services Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., must be wondering if similar generosity on the part of their company was worth the cost.
Founded in 1986, CFS, as it was known, was in the business of collecting credit-card debt, and it quickly became one of the fastest-growing companies in America, with a payroll reaching almost 4,000 workers.
It was also exceedingly generous. In October 1997, the co-founder and chief executive, William R. Bartmann, played host -- at company expense -- to 6,000 employees, spouses and friends at a retreat in Las Vegas. At one point, he stood in a boxing ring, dressed as Julius Caesar, to lead the crowd in cheers for the company and one another.
Seven months earlier, the company flew almost 2,300 employees and guests to Miami for a three-night cruise aboard Royal Caribbean's Sovereign of the Seas. The event included a performance by Bill Cosby.
But now the party's over. Three months ago, CFS went out of business, after filing for bankruptcy last December amid accusations that it had exaggerated its success in collecting bad debts.
OFTEN, the costliest outings are held for clients, not workers. Allen & Company, the investment bank, stages lavish annual get-togethers in Sun Valley, Idaho, for media movers and shakers; the events have helped sustain its prominence in the information industries.
Likewise, the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, a $4 billion concern with headquarters in Novato, Calif., sponsors deluxe retreats that its officials say pay off in increased revenue.
"We do maybe three or four of them a year -- although we call them 'corporate advances' instead of 'retreats,' because we're always looking forward," said David Kliman, the company's vice president for corporate communications.
In mid-July, five top Fireman's Fund officials, including the chief executive, Joe Stinnette, met with 11 chief executives of regional insurance agencies and their guests for a three-day retreat -- whoops, advance -- at The Inn at Spanish Bay in Pebble Beach, Calif. The gathering included morning discussions about business, and the choice of golf, horseback riding or ocean kayaking in the afternoon. A highlight was a catered dinner in the living room of an elegant home that Fireman's Fund rented for the occasion.
"These meetings do not come cheap, and we would never do them for our employees," Mr. Kliman said. "But these are people who have signed contracts with us worth millions of dollars. So what do you do to create something extraordinary? We look at it in terms of return on investment."
Judy Siguaw, an associate professor of marketing at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration, said the returns on such retreats are hard to measure. "I don't think anybody really knows how cost-effective they are," she said.
But meetings outside the work environment can be good for motivating employees and for generating ideas and solutions, Ms. Siguaw said. "Sometimes when you step away from a problem and you're in an informal setting, a solution will come to you unexpectedly," she said.
Many corporate meetings, even small ones, are still held in big luxury resorts because of the amenities, the food and the aura of success that permeates such graceful redoubts as the Broadmoor, in Colorado Springs; the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., and the Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.
Last month alone, two publishers, Prentice Hall and Houghton Mifflin, were at the Breakers; Paine Webber was there a few weeks earlier. Nike held a week-long meeting in August at the Mauna Lani, while various units of Coca-Cola, Samsung, Toyota and Goodyear Tire and Rubber have also met there this year.
"A lot of people might not go for that any more, where everything's taken care of for you," said Reva Revis, who spent four days last month at the Broadmoor with senior officers and guests of her employer, Interface Inc., a commercial carpet manufacturer in Atlanta. "But when we had six hours' free time on Saturday afternoon, instead of our corporate planners having to scramble around to find what there was to do, it was all there at the Broadmoor."
"All," in this case, included golfing, tennis, a spa, 28 boutiques and other shops, fly fishing, horseback riding, mountain biking and hot-air ballooning. Ms. Revis spent much of her free time working out in the fitness center, followed by aromatherapy massages in the spa.
WHILE companies can save on room rates by scheduling retreats in the off season, the cost of meals is rarely discounted; a dinner at a luxury resort can cost as much as $85 a person, not including wine or liquor.
Having held 180 meetings last year, Brown-Forman Corporation watches that part of its corporate ledger carefully. "Every meeting is driven by our budget," said Dennis Boyd, the manager of meeting planning and media services at the company, the Louisville, Ky.-based distributor of Jack Daniels, Southern Comfort, Korbel champagnes and Bolla wines. "We try to do what we can for the least amount."
Most Brown-Forman meetings are held at full-service hotels -- including properties owned by good customers -- but some sessions are at luxury resorts. "When we go there, we're not being extravagant," Mr. Boyd said. "It's a cost of doing business."
Still, Brown-Forman is hardly averse to saving money. It schedules meetings on Sundays, when possible, to take advantage of bargain air fares that require a Saturday-night stay. "The savings from that are incredible," Mr. Boyd said.
Such a perspective is a far cry from the 1980's, according to David Burke, the vice president of sales and marketing at the Breakers. Back then, when he was regional director of sales for Hyatt resorts in Hawaii, "there was a lot of frivolous spending," he said. "I could name 20 corporations that didn't care what the budget was. They just wanted to have a good time."
While some corporations shun Las Vegas, especially for meetings intended as working sessions, the city's reputation for gambling and glitz is hardly a deterrent. Last year, Domino's Pizza Inc. held its annual convention, for 3,000 employees and franchisees from 63 countries at the 5,000-room MGM Grand hotel.
"For people within the U.S., it's inexpensive to get to," said Tim McIntyre, a Domino's spokesman, "and our international travelers are intrigued by Las Vegas."
There have been many changes in corporate meetings in recent years. While men still outnumber women, as in the higher corporate echelons generally, the ratio is slowly shrinking. And as the average age of the participants drops, the food tends toward lighter and healthier fare, with chicken, fish and vegetarian meals steadily squeezing prime rib and steak off the menus.
Many corporate meetings include team-building projects and physical challenges like ropes courses.
Hal Rosenbluth, the chairman of Rosenbluth International, a travel management company based in Philadelphia, built Rivery Ranch, the company's retreat in Linton, N.D., to accommodate a range of team-building activities.
There are scavenger hunts, trail rides in a covered wagon and the company rodeo, at which employees ride horses while trying to balance eggs on spoons. When Rosenbluth meetings are not being held there, the Rivery is rented to Rosenbluth clients like Ikea and Merck.
"The scavenger hunts and rodeo allow individuals to break down barriers and traditional roles in a totally new environment that encourages competition, teamwork and fast thinking," said Shelley Kwatny, Rosenbluth's director of corporate events.
Teamwork was modeled at the Domino's meeting in Las Vegas by Jon Wee and Owen Morse, entertainers whose act, "The Passing Zone," involves juggling chain saws on stage.
In recent months, Mr. Wee said, the Los Angeles-based comedy team has also performed in Boston for American Express, in Austin, Tex., for State Farm, in Los Angeles for Northrop Grumman, in Las Vegas for Texas Instruments and in Palm Springs, Calif., for Farmers Insurance. He has a ready explanation for corporate America's fascination with this controlled mayhem.
"You could say our performance is about team-building, because juggling chain saws requires trust and cooperation," Mr. Wee said. "But when you're throwing chain saws, 'downsizing' isn't just about losing your job; it could mean losing your arm."

A Boom for Builders, But Not for Their Stocks

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER 

 BODY:
IS it tag-sale time for home-building stocks?
Nobody disputes the causes for the sector's recent selloff: Interest rates have generally been rising, prompting skittishness over these notoriously rate-sensitive stocks. Investors worry that the economic expansion is growing long in the tooth -- and fear that Americans' zest for buying new homes will soon subside. 
 The Standard & Poor's Supercap home-building index, tracking 15 such stocks, is down 33.1 percent this year. Yet with most builders trading at seven times 1999 earnings per share, or less, far below the wider market, and with huge backlogs at many builders, some analysts think the market has overreacted.
"The multiples are just absurd," said Timothy L. Jones, a managing director at Southeast Research in Boca Raton, Fla., who follows the industry. "There's a paranoia about interest rates."
Highly cyclical, the sector has often required investors to have strong stomachs. In 1994, when interest rates rose sharply, the group was down 23 percent while the S. & P. 500 was flat. The next year, the group climbed nearly 61 percent, while the S.& P. rose 34.2 percent.
Sales of new homes are, in fact, booming. Late last month, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes were expected to reach 980,000 by year-end, up nearly 11 percent from 1998.
"We're surprised at how strong new-homes sales have been," said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. And while it typically takes about six months for a mortgage-rate increase to put a damper on new-home sales, Mr. Carliner sees rates remaining relatively stable the rest of the year.
Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages have recently dipped back below 8 percent, after climbing above that mark in mid-August for the first time in two years, according to surveys by HSH Associates of Butler, N.J., a mortgage research firm.
Individual companies also report strong numbers, though you wouldn't glean that from stock performance. The Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, a Los Angeles-based builder, reported that earnings per share for the quarter ended May 31 were up 36.4 percent and that July orders were up 30 percent in California and 43 percent in the rest of the country. But its stock, at $19.9375 on Friday, is down more than 30 percent this year.
Toll Brothers, of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., posted third-quarter profit of 80 cents a share, beating the analysts' consensus by 6 cents. But that has not helped the stock, which, at $21.1875, is down 6.1 percent this year.
"This has nothing to do with individual companies," said Barbara K. Allen, an analyst at Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder in Manhattan. "The market seems to be convinced that the housing cycle has peaked."
Ms. Allen has buy recommendations on Kaufman and Toll Brothers, and on the Centex Corporation of Dallas, down 37.3 percent since January, the Lennar Corporation of Miami, down 30.2 percent, and the Pulte Corporation of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., off 15.5 percent. She says the stocks should trade at 10 to 12 times analysts' estimates of 1999 earnings, not the current multiples of 7 or less.
That has prompted some value investors to take a closer look. Thomas Corkill, a partner at Harris Associates in Chicago, had 1.49 percent of the Harris Insight Small-Cap Opportunity fund invested in Kaufman & Broad as of June 30. Other Harris funds hold Lennar, Centex and D. R. Horton of Arlington, Tex.
"We're not necessarily saying that this is one of the best places to be, but it's cheaper when compared with a lot of other places," he said. He added that the consensus may be acting rationally in pounding housing stocks, but "we disagree to the point at which they're being pounded."

The Check Is in the Mail And So Is A Headache

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
IT was two days before Christmas in 1996 when Virginia Keenan received a phone call that left her dumbfounded: Avco Financial Services wanted to know why she had not made any payments on a $2,500 loan that she knew nothing about.
What happened, she said, was that Avco, then a consumer-finance and insurance subsidiary of Textron Inc., with which she had no previous dealings, sent her a mailing that included a check she could use to write herself a loan. But her mail was somehow intercepted, she said, and the loan check was cashed without her knowledge. It took nearly two months to clean up the mess. 
 Mrs. Keenan said the company eventually told her not to worry about the bill any longer. But in the meantime, the Keenans feared that a blight on their credit could prevent them from buying a new house. "I was afraid it was going to affect the mortgage we were applying for," said Mrs. Keenan, 56, an administrative assistant who lives in Woburn, Mass. Not only did she have trouble setting things straight, but she says the stress contributed to a mild heart attack her husband suffered.
Avco has since been sold to the Associates First Capital Corporation, and a spokesman for Associates said the company could not comment on the Keenan case because it "predates our purchase of Avco."
Stories of the misuse of checks -- as well as other reports, some involving desperate consumers buried under mountains of expensive debt -- are behind a fresh push to outlaw loan checks, formally called live-check loans by mail. The loans, typically for a specific four-figure amount, are negotiable checks from a bank or other lender with which the recipient has had no relationship. By signing and cashing them, the recipients are effectively borrowing money at interest rates as high as 25 percent, according to the Consumer Federation of America.
A similar product, called a convenience check, is issued by companies with which the consumer already does business. These checks, typically mailed in sets of three, let the recipient write in the amount of cash he wants to borrow. Issuers often send them during the holiday shopping season, but sometimes attach them to monthly bills, too.
No one knows how many Americans have been victims of loan-check fraud or have used the checks to borrow beyond their means. Last summer, a General Accounting Office report said that there were no comprehensive figures on the extent of loan-check use, but that one institution, Fleet Financial Group, had provided some data. Between 1995 and 1997, Fleet mailed 4.35 million live-loan checks; about 155,000 borrowers cashed checks, thereby accepting loans totaling more than $680 million. Fleet told the G.A.O. that there were 68 confirmed cases of fraud.
Consumer groups and some legislators are urging measures to ban loan checks. "These checks serve no useful purpose while endangering many consumers," said Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. "The nation is awash in consumer credit that is readily available to all who can afford it -- and to many who cannot."
Calling the checks "pernicious," she compared their issuance to the mailings of credit cards that were outlawed in 1970. The mail is still full of card offers, but the consumer must respond to the offer before being sent a card. "Instead of sending unsolicited credit cards, now they're sending unsolicited live checks," Ms. Fox said.
Lenders stoutly defend loan checks, saying that they are convenient and useful for millions of people and that there has been relatively little fraud or abuse.
 "Consumers ultimately make the final decision about these offers -- if they don't want them, they can simply tear them up and throw them away," said Randy Lively, president of the American Financial Services Association, when first faced with a hostile Federal bill in 1997. He reiterated that position last week. The 1997 bill went nowhere, but it did prompt the association -- a trade group that includes finance companies and credit-card issuers but not banks -- to create voluntary standards for disclosure and fraud protection. Minnesota incorporated the voluntary standards into law and Massachusetts legislators are collecting information for possible action. In New York, the legislature has been unable to pass a bill regulating the practice.
"Lending institutions have crossed the line," said Cheryl Jacques, chairwoman of an investigative arm of the Massachusetts Senate, noting that consumers sometimes confuse the checks with government benefits or insurance reimbursements.
This summer, Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of Buffalo and the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee, introduced a new, more narrowly focused bill to ban loan checks. Quick Congressional action is unlikely, however.
While critics contend that the industry has neither confined solicitations to financially qualified consumers nor lived up to its standards -- for example, requesting that offers not be forwarded by the post office -- government regulators have expressed little urgency on the issue.
Unsolicited loan checks are less prevalent than unsolicited credit cards were in the late 1960's, the Federal Reserve told Congress two years ago, and some consumers undoubtedly value the ability to get credit instantly without making a formal application. "We are inclined to let the market work without the intervention of new legislation," the Fed concluded then.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for HARLEY S. SHAIKEN;
Paradoxes Of G.M.'s Promise

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

 BODY:
A FEW short years ago, many working Americans worried about the seemingly constant downsizings by major corporations, and there was much hand-wringing about whether anyone could expect to join a company fresh from school and work there long enough to retire with a gold watch. In board rooms, the worry was the opposite: that decades of steady gains by unions on job security and work-rule issues in the prosperous 1950's and 60's had made the labor force in many American factories too expensive and inflexible to compete in the global economy, especially during recessions.
The long economic expansion of the 1990's has created so many new jobs that downsizing has lost its capacity to terrify most workers, and young people joining the work force often tell survey takers that they don't expect to stay at one company for a decade, never mind a career. 
 Against this backdrop, the General Motors Corporation, one of those perhaps most buffeted by the global economic forces said to drive all the downsizing, dropped an anachronistic bombshell last week: an offer of lifetime employment to unionized workers with at least 10 years' seniority, as part of the company's efforts to reach a new labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union. The offer comes as a wave of G.M. workers hired in the 1960's and 70's nears retirement.
What could G.M. have in mind with an offer that seems to fly in the face of sweeping, decades-long trends? Harley S. Shaiken, a professor specializing in labor and global economic issues at the University of California at Berkeley, delved into the issues it raises. ROBYN MEREDITH
 
Q. With companies in the auto industry and elsewhere pushing steadily toward outsourcing and seeking greater flexibility to compete globally, and even the Japanese beginning to abandon lifetime job tenure, how is G.M.'s offer of lifetime employment guarantees possible?
A. In a way, this is lifetime job security that probably envisions downsizing -- that's the paradox. The paradox is they're willing to guarantee increased job security but they're asking for increased flexibility, which may result in outsourcing. In the context of the G.M. offer, the devil really is in the details.
Q. What does a promise of lifetime employment really mean when auto industry labor contracts typically last only three years?
A. Usually when a company says "lifetime job security," they mean two things. First, they are willing to put aside a pool of money to guarantee jobs. Second, they are often asking for a considerable amount in return.
Whatever is negotiated now can be renegotiated in three years. The guarantee is only as good as the goodwill involved. Previous attempts at lifetime job security in this and other industries have generally fallen short of people's life spans.
Q. Can G.M. afford to make this offer precisely because so many of its workers are eligible to retire within a few years?
A. The cost is high up front, but it could be one of the better investments that G.M. makes. The job security provisions really are a down payment on a more motivated work force, a better relationship with the U.A.W. -- and ultimately a more competitive G.M.
Q. Will Ford and DaimlerChrysler be forced to follow G.M.'s lead?
A. There's nothing in what we've seen so far in the job security provisions that is going to cause a major roadblock, certainly at DaimlerChrysler, and likely not at Ford either. In fact, a settlement could come first at DaimlerChrysler, and then Ford will have a pretty powerful precedent to follow.
There is little question now in the entire post-World War II era that the auto union has led the way in a lot of innovations in labor. What happens here will be closely watched in virtually every other manufacturing industry. As workers retire, you could have lifetime job security and a smaller work force.
Q. Does this kind of offer appeal more to rank-and-file auto workers than it does to their union?
A. I don't think so, and that goes to an unusual quality of the U.A.W. and this industry. A U.A.W. worker in Flint says, "Is my niece going to be able to get a job in this plant? Is my son-in-law?" The concern for creating new jobs isn't just felt at the leadership level.

HEADLINE: Many Media Voices of a Few Merged Masters

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF the media and telecommunications giants have their way, decades' worth of Federal rules intended to guard the marketplace of ideas may soon fall, all in the name of the Internet.
In the last few days, top executives from four of the information industries' largest corporations -- Viacom, CBS, AT&T and Mediaone Group -- have asked the Government to give them a break from tight restrictions intended to prevent cable and broadcast television from falling into too few hands. 
 The theory behind the rules is that, in allocating a limited spectrum of communications frequencies, the Government must insure that there are enough different voices, opinions and news gatherers to keep its citizens informed.
Never before has a corporate merger threatened to exceed the current limits on concentration of media ownership. But two of this year's biggest deals -- Viacom's planned acquisition of CBS, announced Tuesday, and AT&T's pending purchase of Mediaone -- cannot be completed without either changes in the rules or significant divestitures.
Hoping to avoid selling assets that could be combined profitably, top executives of the companies told the Federal Communications Commission last week that the concentration rules are now archaic -- obsolete in an Internet world that unshackles producers of programming from old economic restraints and assures diverse voices and original content.
"There is no question that that rule is no longer relevant in a broadband Internet world," Mel Karmazin, chairman and chief executive of CBS, said of the regulation that would force Viacom and CBS to sell some stations to stay within rules limiting a company to stations serving 35 percent of the nation's homes.
A remarkably similar position was articulated to challenge the rules governing cable TV systems. To replace regulations left unenforced after an adverse court decision seven years ago, the F.C.C. had been prepared to issue new rules this week, but postponed them for at least a month after fierce lobbying from AT&T.
"Very significantly, the market has changed," said James Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations for AT&T, which with the Mediaone acquisition will become the nation's largest cable company. "The Government should now take a look at whether the original rationale of the rule is still valid -- namely, the ability to bottleneck programming."
What is the answer? Has the Internet indeed promoted new and original voices to the point that traditional concerns about diversity of content can be abandoned? Or, despite the easy, low-cost access it provides to a cybermarketplace of ideas, is the Internet quickly being dominated by a handful of big corporations, just like television, radio, the movies and newspapers before it?
Some critics are concerned that the arguments in favor of media mergers confuse content with delivery -- that while there are many new channels to deliver information, there is remarkably little original information being gathered or produced.
At bottom, these analysts say, media companies are making claims for a diversity that simply doesn't exist.
"The same big players are every bit as keen on swallowing the Internet as they have the traditional media," said Mark Crispin Miller, director of the Project on Media Ownership and a professor of media studies at New York University. "The consensus is that the Internet is getting less diverse and more homogenized as it becomes more commercial."
Certainly, trends in the older media are hardly reassuring for the Internet.
The declining number of American newspapers is an old story. Where a half-century ago there were some 2,200 daily newspapers, there are now about 1,500; most cities have only one.
Radio has fallen on even harder times. While it used to be that many stations in even midsized cities had their own reporters, that has become the rare exception. Instead, most stations rely on the same handful of national and local news services. Metro Networks, a Houston-based company that supplies traffic, weather and sports reports to about 1,700 radio stations, has lately become a huge new presence in radio news, often supplying coverage to many stations in one market, sometimes with the same reporters appearing on several stations under different names to give the appearance of competing, exclusive reports. In New York, for example, Metro works for 41 stations.
While the number of television stations has grown sharply, from 96 in 1950 to 1,216 this year, studies show consistently that they give local news short shrift. "There is actually more local news than there used to be," said Janine Jaquet, research director for the Media Ownership Project. "The flip side is that a lot of this stuff is coming from fewer sources." Many stations rely heavily on wire-service offerings, syndicated features and the kind of crime and violence stories that they -- and their competitors -- can cover easily by listening to a police scanner. Other topics, however, may be neglected.
"A principal accused of child abuse makes the news; general problems in education don't," said Paul Klite, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Media Watch, a Colorado organization that studies news content around the nation.
The television industry points to cable as evidence that new media give rise to new sources of information. C-Span brings live Congressional proceedings into cable subscribers' living rooms, and three 24-hour news and information channels -- CNN, MSNBC and Fox News -- vie for viewers' attention. Moreover, cable systems in a growing number of cities and regions are now offering 24-hour local news channels that some analysts say are bringing original reporting to their areas.
STILL, some of cable's early promises of diversity have gone largely unfulfilled. In exchange for their local monopolies, for example, many cable companies vowed to serve the public interest by devoting channels to civic-minded topics like local government, education and the arts. But in many cities, critics say, public access programming is mediocre at best.
"The public access channels on cable are virtually entirely unused," said Lawrence Grossman, the former president of both NBC News and PBS, at a Fordham Law School symposium earlier this year on the impact of large media mergers. "The last I saw, 18 percent of public access education and government channels were being used. And when they are used, they are virtually unwatchable."
Some viewers prefer a camera's unmediated broadcast of a city council meeting to a reporter's filtered account. But analysts say neither public access programming nor cable TV's heated chat-show debates substitute for original investigative reporting, or even the pedestrian but thorough coverage of public affairs once provided by local and national broadcasters.
"What you've got is a huge diminution of the number of voices providing information that is necessary for an informed citizenship, and the Internet doesn't change that," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington group that promotes diversity on the airwaves.
"It certainly reduces the barriers to organizing and to discourse. That's important for democracy," Mr. Schwartzman said. "But it's no replacement for journalism and news gathering."
By all accounts, the Internet was supposed to break the mold of the older technologies by offering a vast new array of voices and opinions. And indeed, a rich cast of original content of varying degrees of usefulness now flows from the Internet, from The Onion and Salon to Matt Drudge.
But while experts are divided over what the Internet may look like in the future, many agree that the most popular Web sites -- all controlled by commercial interests -- are already beginning to look alike.
"The notion that technology will create competition and new voices, and so we don't have to worry about these companies getting bigger, is false," said Robert W. McChesney, a professor of communications at the University of Illinois and author of a new book, "Rich Media, Poor Democracy" (University of Illinois Press).
Mr. McChesney contends that powerful economic forces will inevitably lead to the domination of information on the Internet by today's media giants.
First, he said, because they have the newsrooms and production studios, the big media companies already control the means of producing the Internet's content. Even wealthy companies like Microsoft, he noted, have found it difficult to compete.
Second, Mr. McChesney said, established media companies already have both brand names to attract viewers and relationships with advertisers.
Finally, it is the established companies, he said, not the start-ups, that have the wherewithal to invest in the Internet for the long term, swallowing heavy losses for a few years in the hope of gaining longer-term profits.
 IN any event, his research shows, about half of the venture capital provided to Internet start-ups is coming from established media companies. So they are likely, he said, to have a big interest in many of the new Internet companies that survive.
Other experts are more optimistic, seeing the Internet as a powerful forum for diverse and informative voices.
Andrew L. Shapiro, a senior adviser at the Markle Foundation, has written a book titled "The Control Revolution: How the Internet Is Putting Individuals in Charge and Changing the World We Know" (Century Foundation/Public Affairs).
He points to what happened in December 1996 when Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav leader, shut down an independent Belgrade radio station, Radio B92, which had regularly broadcast news of protests against his regime. The station rerouted its programming to the Internet, where it was available to computer users in Serbia and around the world.
"That was an outstanding example of how human rights advocates can use the Internet in ways they could never use television or newspapers to get around a thug like Milosevic," Mr. Shapiro said.
"It's certainly true that a lot of things that happened with cable, television, and radio -- that have led to the dumbing-down of content -- are now happening on the portal sites. But I'm still optimistic. A lot of it will take steering people to the appropriate content: away from the commercial portals to the more diverse sites."
WHILE there will almost certainly be Congressional hearings on the Viacom-CBS merger, there has been far less hand-wringing among lawmakers about the recent information industry deals than there was even just a decade ago, when the trend of big media mergers began to take off.
Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who was the only Senator to openly criticize the Viacom-CBS deal for its possible effects on public discourse, said the politicians' silence was a clear reflection of both Washington and media economics. There is no lobby these days for media populism.
"When you look at the mix of money and politics, it's all on one side," Mr. Wellstone said. "The political dialogue and political imagination is set within a narrow parameter."

HEADLINE: The World: Command Performance;
America Talks and (Some) Others Listen

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand

 BODY:
ON the very day that the United States helped bring one more Middle East peace agreement to fruition and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright witnessed its signing, a crisis broke out at the other end of the world. Again, Washington was called on to find a solution. But this time, in East Timor, the United States found it not so easy to make the problem go way by simply swaggering in at the opportune moment and brandishing its influence.
The contrast is stunning, if only because the world has long thought of the Middle East, not some tiny corner of Indonesia, as the toughest nut to crack among all the world's many intractable disputes, and because the world has recently come to think of the United States as the one power with enough influence to make just about anybody sit up and listen -- the "indispensable nation," in one of Ms. Albright's favorite phrases. 
 But just what does this singular American power consist of, and how and where can the United States use it? More important, are there still moments, as with the Indonesians last week, when Americans might be tempted to just throw up their hands and say it is beyond their power to do anything?
The question is hardly academic. Right now, Washington is trying to help end a war in East Africa between Ethiopians and Eritreans. In North Asia, it wants to stop the North Koreans from test firing a ballistic missile, a threat that worries South Korea and Japan. And in South Asia, the Administration is unofficially adjudicating the dispute in Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
The impulse for Americans to get involved in East Timor was sudden and sharp, after murderous militias rampaged through the Portuguese-speaking territory last week in an effort to overturn the results of a referendum in which the population voted overwhelmingly for independence. At least at first, Indonesia flatly rejected United Nations efforts to send in a peacekeeping force, leading American officials to step in and try to persuade them to either restore order quickly or let outsiders do so.
IN the initial moments of frustration with Indonesia, it might have been tempting to think of the way American clout had just played so important a role in the Middle East. But in fact, the decision to get peace talks back on track with a revamped land-for-security deal between the Palestinians and Israelis hardly represented a precedent for success in Indonesia. Instead, it was an unusually easy opportunity to make America seem irresistible.
First, the immediate question to be mediated in the Middle East wasn't really so tough. There was a quibble here over the release of prisoners, a quibble there over the right to launch unilateral actions. And a larger question underneath hinted at inevitable American success. The Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, had wanted as little American input as possible, preferring to bargain on his own with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. But Mr. Arafat waited for the comfort of an American presence not just at the signing, but in the deal-making itself.
In the end, it was the presence of Ms. Albright that gave the Palestinian the confidence to sign up. For Mr. Arafat, this made Washington a court of last appeal. Now, he can reason, if something goes wrong with the implementation of the deal he can turn to the Clinton Administration for help.
But a lot of history has gone into that understanding -- nearly three decades of a tenacious, expensive and often frustrating American commitment to help the Middle East find a lasting peace. The question in other parts of the globe now is whether the United States can similarly play the role of "indispensable nation" in helping resolve situations like the one in East Timor.
By some measures, Washington does seem to have a long history of involvement, and hence considerable leverage, with Indonesia -- certainly a lot more than can be claimed by neighboring Australia, one of Washington's staunchest and now most nervous allies. Australia, whose northernmost port of Darwin is only about 400 miles from East Timor, clamored all week for American help in calming the violence and for American logistical support in mounting a peacekeeping mission to be sponsored by the United Nations. Very quickly, senior American military officers were in contact with General Wiranto, the head of the Indonesian Army, telling him to curb the militias or face consequences.
But as General Wiranto listened by telephone to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Indonesian knew he had a very good hand to play as well. All of Washington's history of backing the Indonesian military during the cold war in fact brings it little leverage these days; in recent years, almost all military assistance has been cut by Congress because of the Indonesian Army's abuse of human rights. And as General Wiranto listened he knew something even more important: that the United States is not about to totally abandon Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation and the master of sea lanes through which American naval vessels and oil carriers pass.
In short, Indonesia is a strategically important country for the United States in Asia, one that serves as a counterbalance to China as well as Japan. (The Israelis have known something similar over the years, of course, but their calculations have been different: While no American President could abandon Israel, the United States also wasn't about to abandon its Arab allies who gave America access to oil. Hence the pressure for all sides to seek peace.)
Last week, before he left Washington to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in New Zealand, where East Timor's plight is sure to dominate the discussions, President Clinton suggested he might push for the International Monetary Fund to curb economic assistance to Indonesia. But on hearing this, General Wiranto may well have calculated that this was not a serious threat either. The end of financial aid to Indonesia, where the economy is in perilous shape, would produce the very troubles that the United States would like to avoid.
"The United States would hate to carry out that threat because you would create chaos," said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is writing a book on the history of American diplomacy. "The last thing we want to be forced to do is shoot the Indonesians in the head. To block all aid would hurt United States interests as much as Indonesia's."
While Washington was displeased last week with the Indonesian Army's refusal to put out the fire in East Timor, the Administration also had reason to fear putting too much pressure on the Indonesian military. With the decline of the major political party, Golkar, and with democratic reforms in their infancy, the United States still sees the army as the only national institution capable of holding together an archipelago nation strewn across thousands of miles.
Mr. Mead also argues that Washington is hampered in the new crisis by a lack of past identification with East Timor. In the Middle East, for example, Administration negotiators, who have been dealing intensely with Mr. Arafat for nearly a decade, can tell him: "Don't declare statehood, don't mess it up, you can't do that," Mr. Mead said. And then the Administration can -- as President Clinton did last April -- promise to hold a summit meeting, always an attractive offer for Mr. Arafat.
In many cases, the lure of the United States as a broker is the lure of the United States as a dispenser of economic assistance. In the Middle East 20 years ago, Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt did not make peace with Israel primarily out of a desire for peace itself, said Itamar Rabinovitch, a former Israeli Ambassador to the United States who has just written a history of Middle East negotiations, "Waging Peace" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). "He wanted to disengage from the Soviet Union and have ties with the United States," Mr. Rabinovitch said. Mr. Sadat's reward for settling with Israel at Camp David consisted of huge infusions of annual aid to Egypt in subsequent years.
Similarly, Mr. Rabinovitch argues, the priority today for the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, is not so much to make peace with Israel as to make peace with Washington and then hopefully reap economic assistance. Thus, Mr. Assad is insisting on an American broker as he contemplates whether to get serious and start negotiations with Israel.
In Korea too, money plays a big role; it is why North Korea accepts the United States as a mediator between it and the South. In essence, Washington has been bribing crop-starved North Korea with food aid to try to keep it from firing a missile. And for some smaller countries, good behavior in American eyes can result in largesse from the international financial institutions. With American involvement as mediator in the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, it is almost certain that financial support would follow peace.
In the end, then, it is the use of American economic power as a club or carrot that may prove the most promising way to persuade the Indonesians to let the world help stem the violence in East Timor. Indonesia is, after all, only now emerging from the economic crisis that shook all of Asia just two years ago, and that brought about the collapse of Indonesia's last government, under Suharto.
"It is as though an industry of peace is our greatest export," said Mr. Mead.

HEADLINE: The Russian Money Trail

 BODY:
Despite great infusions of outside assistance and promises to carry out reforms, Russia appears to be sinking ever deeper into bankruptcy and corruption. The latest allegations are that Boris Yeltsin and his family may have taken bribes. Mr. Yeltsin dismissed the charge in a phone conversation with President Clinton last week, but there are also growing suspicions that aid from the International Monetary Fund and other institutions may have gone into the pockets of Russia's new oligarchs. With elections approaching in Russia and the United States, investigators must follow the trails of corruption and money laundering and re-examine policy decisions that may have aggravated the problem.
Well before the Communist era, corruption was a part of the Russian fabric. As the economist Anders Aslund points out, Russian elites in the final years of the Soviet Union were reaping fortunes, a practice that helped discredit Communism in Russian eyes. It is now in the West's interest to insure that capitalism, free markets and privatization are not similarly discredited. Certainly there are limits to what outsiders, including foreign lenders, can do within Russia. But American and Swiss banking regulators can take the lead in investigating this problem, forcing Russian regulators to act and teaching them some monitoring techniques at the same time. 
 A separate issue relates to evidence of official corruption, possibly involving illegal diversion of billions in aid from the I.M.F., the World Bank and other institutions. The suspicion is also growing that in a bid to speed privatization, stabilize Russian currency and encourage greater private investment, American policy makers may have looked the other way when charges of wrongdoing first surfaced. Some Republicans have suggested that Vice President Al Gore was among those in the Administration more interested in propping up Mr. Yeltsin than in holding his Government to account.
These are significant questions. Later this month, Representative Jim Leach of the House Banking Committee will open hearings on what he says is a Russian kleptocracy. He would do well to give the Administration an ample chance to air its position, which is that it has encouraged openness and even pressed Mr. Yeltsin to sign a money-laundering bill passed by the Russian parliament. The committee must also look searchingly at whether Administration officials or banks ignored evidence that economic aid was funneled out of Russia almost as fast as it was poured in.
It would be a mistake, however, if any investigation discredited the need for the United States to remain engaged with Russia. The Administration has already begun to shift gears and insist that a more clear accounting of international assistance be made before further loans can be granted. At the very least, the I.M.F. needs to demand greater disclosure of what happens to its aid. But whether in Kosovo, the Middle East, Iraq, or in nuclear disarmament, Russia has a crucial role to play. Its leaders will demand to be taken into account, and they will be able to make things difficult if they are ignored.
It is also important to remember the progress that Russia has achieved. Although the economy has steadily contracted since 1991, Russia has 2.7 million legally registered private enterprises. Mr. Aslund and others have pointed to some signs of increased tax collections, and indications that the budget crisis could shrink unhealthy subsidies to industry.
In the end, however, the Russians must reform their system. Outside leverage cannot by itself change old habits, much less transform a culture. Mr. Leach's committee needs to examine foreign-aid blunders, but its more important task may be drawing guidelines for how the United States can spend wisely to help Russia's struggling democracy. Future financial dealings can be safeguarded with full disclosure, the rule of law and a phaseout of the subsidies, state regulation and cronyism that have enriched the Russian elite.

HEADLINE: Airlines Prepare to Disclose Pledges of Customer Service

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The major airlines will disclose next week exactly what pledges of customer service they are making as part of a voluntary program they agreed to earlier this year to stave off Federal legislation on passenger rights.
Each airline is supposed to tell the Transportation Department by Wednesday how it will implement the voluntary plan. David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the big airlines' trade group, said that the airlines would probably post their plans on their Web sites soon. The promises are to take effect on Dec. 15. 
 Consumer advocates say they hope the plans will help travelers learn about their rights, even though some of the rights are not new.
A new study by the General Accounting Office says that many of the guarantees the airlines are expected to offer are already required by other laws, or are practices that are widely followed in the industry.
Other guarantees, while offered voluntarily, would become legally enforceable if published by the airlines, the G.A.O. said. The agency, an investigative arm of Congress, solicited an opinion from the Transportation Department, which regulates airlines. The Transportation Department said that failing to fulfill such promises -- concerning issues like offering the lowest available fare to a customer shopping for tickets, or responding to customer complaints -- would be an unfair trade practice.
By law, airlines must have copies of their legally binding contracts of carriage, the fine print that backs up an airplane ticket, available for inspection at ticket counters, but "most consumers don't even know what that is, or even ask for it," said one expert, Laurie J. Berger, the editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter, published by Consumers Union.
Earlier this year, some lawmakers tried to write this kind of guarantee into a new law, but the airlines sidestepped that move by telling Congress they would act voluntarily.
The new G.A.O. report, scheduled to be released on Monday, compares the voluntary agreement, announced in June by the Air Transport Association, with contracts of carriage and with pertinent Federal statutes and rules. It found that many of the new promises were not mentioned in the contracts of carriage, a point that had been raised by passenger rights advocates, who questioned whether the voluntary agreements are enforceable.
"If it is in the contract of carriage, a passenger can clearly bring a breach of contract case if a violation of the contract occurs," said a senior lawyer at the G.A.O., David K. Hooper.
But, Mr. Hooper added, "if they hold out a promise and renege on that promise, the Department of Transportation can go after them under unfair and deceptive trade practices statute."
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who favored legislation and requested the G.A.O. report, said he was unhappy with the airlines' being allowed to write their own rules.
"What we've got here is scattershot gobbledygook," he said in a telephone interview on Friday. "Some airlines will do a better job than others, but it's going to take months to sort all of this out."
Among the 12 voluntary measures, the airlines are promising to make every reasonable effort to return checked bags within 24 hours. The issue is not addressed in contracts of carriage, but the Transportation Department said it would be unfair and deceptive not to deliver bags in a "reasonable" period of time, the G.A.O. reported.
Under the customer service commitment, airlines are also promising to disclose policies for accommodating the disabled. But Federal regulations already provide specific guarantees, the G.A.O. noted. The airlines are also promising to establish a policy for carrying children without their parents. Contracts of carriage already specify the minimum age for unaccompanied minors (5 years old) and set conditions for nonstop and connecting flights, the G.A.O. said.
Airlines are also promising to inform customers about delays, cancellations and diversions in a timely manner. The issue is not addressed in the contracts of carriage, the G.A.O. found. But the report said that according to the Transportation Department, it would be an unfair practice to say that a flight was canceled because of weather or mechanical breakdown if it was actually canceled for economic reasons like a lack of passengers.
Some items in the customer service plan are new, like allowing customers to hold a reservation while they shop for better deals.
Mr. Wyden said that the voluntary commitments left out some rights he would like to establish for fliers. "The one that concerns me the most is, if you call this afternoon and they're overbooked, they won't tell you that before they sell you a ticket," he said.

HEADLINE: America's Unmet Obligation

 BODY:
Though rivals for the Democratic Presidential nomination, Al Gore and Bill Bradley are both trying to restore a shamefully neglected issue to its rightful place at the forefront of public debate. The issue is health insurance -- specifically, this country's grievous failure to provide coverage for nearly one-sixth of its population.
Many politicians -- and public attention -- have turned from this issue ever since President Clinton's proposal for universal health coverage crashed in 1993, a victim of political mismanagement. But the problem has not gone away, and remains a vivid and embarrassing rebuke to American democracy. As Mr. Bradley observed last week in announcing his candidacy, "While kings and dictators come to this country for the best health care treatment in the world, you and I both know that this care is not available to the 45 million citizens who have no health insurance at all." 
 Indeed, as Congress bickers over regulating health maintenance organizations, and otherwise seeks to improve the system for people who do have health insurance, the plight of those who do not have insurance gets worse by the day. Despite an extraordinary economic boom and an unemployment rate that is at the lowest level in more than 25 years, the number of uninsured Americans has steadily risen by about one million a year over the past decade. This number will probably continue to rise as more children are born, more Americans switch from manufacturing jobs that provide insurance to service jobs that do not, and more Americans leave the welfare system, which provides health benefits.
Mr. Bradley has yet to propose a specific program, although he is expected to soon. Mr. Gore is further down the programmatic road, having last week unveiled a plan to provide health insurance for 11 million to 15 million uncovered Americans, mostly children. The proposal is modest compared with Mr. Clinton's original plan to guarantee health insurance for everyone. Mr. Gore's rationale for not being more ambitious is that "we have all learned that we cannot overhaul the system in one fell swoop." He also notes that his program seeks to cover one of the most vulnerable segments of the population.
The centerpiece of the plan would expand the Children's Health Insurance Program, a Federally subsidized state-run program created in 1997 that helps insure children in families earning up to about $33,000 a year for four people. Mr. Gore would raise that income ceiling so that families earning 2.5 times the official poverty level, or about $41,000, could qualify. The program would also allow uninsured parents of children who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP to buy subsidized insurance for themselves, and in various ways would encourage states to seek out and enroll every child who may be eligible.
Constructive as they are, Mr. Gore's ideas will still leave some 30 million Americans without any real help. Most of these are working poor adults, including a disproportionate number of minorities. Mr. Gore may be right when he suggests that after the Clinton debacle in 1993, only an incremental approach will pass muster with Congress and the country. It may also be true that if he and Mr. Bradley continue to push health care to the front of their campaigns, the opportunity may come around again to force Congress to take a more sweeping approach. But for now, these Democratic rivals have helped put the question of universal health care back on the national agenda and, in so doing, have reminded everyone of America's unmet obligation to 45 million people for whom a medical setback could mean financial ruin.

Some Optional Ephemera

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
When Jerre L. Stead, chief executive of Ingram Micro, the world's largest computer distributor, says he was hoping that his stock options would be worth $100 million, he's unusual only in acknowledging an ambition that other chief executives keep to themselves. Mr. Stead was even more unusual in forgoing any salary since his hiring in 1996 to get even more options.
But his options, to buy shares at $18, have little immediate value now; the shares closed last week at $15.9375. 
 Mr. Stead, 57, says he has always planned to give away all his options wealth. He has assigned blocks of options to each of his four grandchildren. He plans to give the rest to causes including homeless relief, research into Alzheimer's disease (his mother's ailment) and the economic development of Maquoketa, Iowa, where he and his wife, Mary Jo, grew up. He also plans to support the Center for Ethics and Values at Northwestern University, where he teaches occasionally; the University of Iowa, his alma mater, and some Presbyterian and Methodist church projects.
"We never planned to spend the money," Mr. Stead said last week. "Mary Jo and I lived on $2,800 a year in a 40-foot trailer when we were in college."
A year ago, with Ingram's stock at $54 a share, Mr. Stead's options were worth $126 million. Last week, the stock's slide accelerated after the company announced a gloomy outlook and Mr. Stead's decision to step down as chief executive, though he will remain chairman.
Mr. Stead, professionally upbeat, with cards that read "coach" rather than "chief executive," says that his options have not expired and that the stock and the company will rebound.
In any case, he won't go begging. At the Legent Corporation, his former employer, he pocketed $15 million from options. SAUL HANSELL

HEADLINE: The Price of Low Inflation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Inflation? It Just Doesn't Add Up" (Economic View, Aug. 22), Sylvia Nasar looked at reasons the American economy is unlikely to return to the "bad old days" of high inflation rates. She noted how a study suggested "that a host of small, incremental changes -- including the decline of unions, the growing of temporary help firms, even welfare reform -- have made the labor market more efficient." 
 But so-called efficient wages are really stagnant wages, as employers have kept down labor costs as their dominant strategy to increase profits.
Even during good economic times, American companies have been downsizing, offering lower wage increases or eliminating cost-of-living increases, cutting health care and pension benefits, outsourcing and generally building an army of low-wage, low-benefit workers.
What are efficient wages to employers, and possibly to economists, are not efficient to American families, who now need two breadwinners just to get by. There is a hint of "let them eat cake" in much of today's economic writing.

Student Aid

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry and Purchase College have each received $800,000 grants from the United States Department of Education to begin a four-year program for high school students "of diverse economic and educational backgrounds." Known as Upward Bound, the program will provide students with additional academic support so they are more likely to complete high school and pursue post-secondary educations.
Westchester's first Upward Bound program will include 80 high school students from Sleepy Hollow and Yonkers, the colleges said. Beverly Army Gillen, a Mercy College spokeswoman, said the program would offer students academic enrichment, mentoring and tutoring assistance in math, science, literature and foreign languages. 
 Also, students will take part in six-week summer residential programs at the colleges.
Nationally, only 183 Upward Bound grants were awarded among a pool of 942 applicants, Wendy Serkin, a Purchase College spokeswoman, said. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: From Defending Big Tobacco to Fighting Ford Motor for a Lone Client

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 11

 BODY:
When C. Mark Pickrell was an associate at a big New York law firm three years ago, helping to defend a large cigarette company against anti-smoking lawsuits filed by Mississippi and New Jersey, a colleague nicknamed him Brimstone, joking that he would surely go to hell for having represented Big Tobacco.
Now Mr. Pickrell is in another courtroom struggle, fighting a big corporation, not defending one. 
 He is representing a one-man Internet newsletter against a lawsuit filed by the Ford Motor Company. And using skills developed in legal battles over smoking, he is trying to start a legal war over whether Detroit auto makers colluded to avoid the expense of manufacturing sport utility vehicles that might produce less air pollution while getting better fuel economy.
Mr. Pickrell sees many parallels between his former legal work and the current lawsuit. "As I look at it, I keep saying, 'It's like tobacco.' " Mr. Pickrell said. "The similarities that I've seen are unbelievable."
Ford officials declined to comment on any issue regarding the litigation with Mr. Pickrell's client, Robert Lane, any antitrust issues or any comparisons between smoking and sport utility vehicle issues. Auto industry officials in the past have dismissed suggestions of collusion.
Mr. Pickrell has won the first round in his fight. Ford had sought a preliminary injunction against Mr. Lane, who operates the Internet site, www.blueovalnews.com, which provides news on Ford vehicles for auto enthusiasts. The injunction would have prevented Mr. Lane from using, copying or discussing boxes full of internal Ford documents that someone had mailed him anonymously. But a Federal judge turned down most of Ford's request last Tuesday, saying that the free-speech provision of the First Amendment protected Mr. Lane. Mr. Pickrell, who is the sole lawyer in his law office in Nashville, heard about the lawsuit from a friend on Aug. 27, a Friday. He sent Mr. Lane a fax that afternoon, offering his legal services for a nominal fee. Mr. Lane called back that evening to say that he was due in Federal court in Detroit for a hearing the following Monday morning and did not have a lawyer.
Mr. Lane, a 33-year-old nursing student who lives several blocks from Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., could not afford to pay for a last-minute, full-fare airline ticket to Detroit for Mr. Pickrell. But Mr. Lane is married to a flight attendant for Northwest Airlines, who sent Mr. Pickrell a so-called "buddy pass" to allow him to buy a very cheap ticket at a rate available only to friends of airline personnel.
Arriving in Detroit on Sunday morning, Mr. Pickrell, also 33, spent all day and night looking up legal precedents on CD-ROM's and electronic data bases on his laptop, drafting a legal brief and making photocopies at a Kinko's store. Mr. Lane said that the two men were able to talk for only 15 minutes about what he would say on the witness stand.
"He said to me, 'Whatever you do, don't lie,' " Mr. Lane recalled.
One of the Ford lawyers mentioned in the hearing that what had really upset Ford was Mr. Lane's posting on his Internet site of internal Ford documents relating to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Mr. Pickrell contended that the lawyer's comment showed Mr. Lane should be treated legally not as someone who recklessly disregarded trade secrets and copyrights, as Ford asserted. but rather as a journalist who had been gathering news about a public policy issue involving the environment.
Even before the judge ruled in Mr. Lane's favor, Ford's lawyers had demanded from Mr. Pickrell extensive information about the contents and source of the documents in Mr. Lane's possession. Mr. Pickrell has responded by asking Ford for extensive documents regarding its discussions with competitors and the Environmental Protection Agency regarding air pollution technologies and regulations.
While representing Brown & Williamson, a large cigarette company, Mr. Pickrell had learned a lot about the issue of whether tobacco companies deliberately avoided selling cigarettes that would emit fewer carcinogens. R. J. Reynolds broke ranks with other tobacco companies in 1988 when it began marketing the Premier as a "safer" cigarette. While the Premier was a failure in the marketplace, plaintiff lawyers responded to it by saying that the product showed that less dangerous cigarettes had long been possible.
With this legal background, Mr. Pickrell said that during the current lawsuit he immediately became interested in Ford's decision 21 months ago to break ranks with other auto makers and redesign all of its sport utility vehicles to emit as little air pollution as cars. Federal regulations allow sport utility vehicles to emit two to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
Some top auto executives have suggested that Ford broke a "gentleman's agreement" among Detroit auto makers not to compete on who could build the least polluting vehicles. While Japanese auto makers have done well in the American car market, Detroit completely dominated the sport utility vehicle market until the last couple years.
By coincidence, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, read a news report in May mentioning auto industry cooperation and wrote a letter to the Justice Department urging an anti-trust investigation into whether auto makers had conspired not to install pollution-control equipment, particularly on sport utility vehicles. Mr. Nader became famous in the 1960's partly for persuading the Johnson Administration to file an identical anti-trust lawsuit then accusing Detroit auto makers of conspiring not to develop or install pollution-control gear; the consent decree from that case expired during the Reagan Administration.
Jennifer Rose, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said that the agency was preparing a response to Mr. Nader's letter, but she declined to elaborate.
Ford documents briefly posted this summer on Mr. Lane's Internet site show that the auto maker is working on improvements in pollution and fuel economy. One document, for example, projected that the fuel economy of Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles could be improved by 26 percent over the next decade. But the documents gave no indication of the cost or feasibility of such a change.

HEADLINE: Russians Say Bank Scheme May Not Be What It Seems

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN and MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Irritated by allegations of money laundering, some of Russia's leading businessmen insist that the West has overlooked a simpler explanation for the billions of dollars that have flowed through several suspicious accounts at the Bank of New York.
While acknowledging that some Russian money stashed abroad may have been gained from organized crime or other criminal activity, they suggest that many of the thousands of transactions now under investigation can be attributed to Russian importers engaged in old games of dodging Russian tariffs and taxes. 
 The businessmen agree that laws may have been broken, but insist that they were Russian, not foreign, laws. A government was cheated, they say, but it was the discredited Russian administration, not the United States Government or the International Monetary Fund. And yes, funds were used in dubious ways to buy goods, but it was furniture, food and electronics for consumers.
There is no question that these businessmen have their own motives in touting this explanation. They want to remove the taint of money laundering and organized crime that has cast a cloud over all Russian companies, legitimate and corrupt.
Still, in the context of Russia's chaotic economy and get-rich-quick approach to capitalism, their explanations appear largely plausible, if incomplete.
This week, in interviews with foreign and Russian reporters, businessmen described schemes that break or bend Russian law, but are nonetheless common in an economy in which many in business have learned to cheat the Government. Whenever possible, these businessmen say, profits are kept or taken abroad, and companies like Benex -- which is thought to have moved billions of dollars through the Bank of New York -- are essential to that process.
"No one is saying Benex was not partly criminal," said Yuliya Latynina, a respected financial journalist who has written several articles on the subject this week. "But it was a service that anyone could use, Russian companies or just ordinary people. It was very, very important for the importers."
According to one leading businessman, who says he has looked into the practice, the scheme, in its simplest form, works like this:
A Russian importer buys water at $3 a bottle from a foreign supplier. But to avoid a heavy tariff, he draws up an official contract setting the price at $1. The remaining $2 a bottle is paid under the table using fictitious shell companies and foreign accounts like Benex, which carry out wire transfers.
Schemes to transfer undeclared profits and payments out of Russia have been an open secret since the country plunged headfirst into free-market capitalism in the early 1990's.
They were developed by importers who first fed Russia's pent-up appetite for the Western consumer goods and quickly set about ways to duck rigid customs duties. These duties are not only high but unpredictable, changing profit levels with one stroke of a bureaucrat's pen.
Such schemes to shift or keep capital abroad may also have been used, even set up, by organized crime groups, many of which are linked with Russian importers. In the early 1990's, in the absence of any civil court and credible banks, such importers were extremely vulnerable to racketeers.
At this point, the businessmen say, only the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the people behind the Benex scheme can make an accurate accounting of where money came from and where it went, and they are not talking. Russians concede, however, that the amount of money passing through the mysterious accounts is huge.
"An awful lot of people in this town are afraid of this story," one leading Russian banker said.
One Russian businessman, who said he had looked into the allegations, said a total of $6.3 billion had passed through the mysterious accounts maintained by Benex and similarly murky organizations, like Lowland, and Becs, over the last four years. The newspaper Kommersant, citing its own sources, estimated the sums passing through these firms at $9 billion.
Reports in the United States have stated that $4.2 billion to $10 billion passed through Benex accounts over an 18-month period.
Since imports ran at $60 billion last year, and are estimated at up to $50 billion this year, the sums are credible, some analysts say.
But Benex clearly has other uses.
Russia's major banks, eager to dodge creditors after the August 1998 financial crash, may have used clearinghouse accounts like Benex to take money out of Russia, the analysts say.
"They had experienced people who targeted this niche," the banker said, so that after August 1998, they were the only ones with a reputation to pick up where the pseudo-bankrupt banks left off."
Others used Benex to get money into Russia. One foreign businessman in Moscow, who said he had contacted a service recommended by a business associate, said his company had transferred $70,000 through Benex from the United States. He said he had used the service when his own accounts in a Moscow bank were frozen during the financial crisis and he desperately needed dollars.
"I don't consider myself a money launderer, but I used the service because it was recommended to me as trustworthy," he said. "They only charged a 1.8 percent commission, compared with the 3 percent I had been paying at my bank."
Other banks, scouring their accounts, also turned up odd payments made through Benex. An official at Menatep, a major bank that has frequently been mentioned in connection with the Bank of New York scandal, said that an internal audit showed that $12 million had been paid through Benex, used exclusively to buy apartments in Moscow. Given the size of Menatep's banking business, the amount was relatively small, he said.
The Benex accounts may also have been used by Russians looking for a safe haven for their money and an alternative to a banking system that has all but collapsed.
According to a study by Canadian and Russian economic institutes, capital flight from Russia totaled about $130 billion from 1992 to 1998. It continues at a rate of up to $2 billion a month, according to economists here.
About a third of the capital flight, the study concluded, was legal. Demand for services enabling the flight was large, and the access to them, while a tightly held secret, was relatively easy for those with the right contacts.
"Russian businessmen have an almost pathological desire to keep their money abroad because they feel uneasy about keeping it here," said Aleksandr Lebedev, the chairman of the National Reserve Bank and a leader in the Our Home Is Russia party of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former Prime Minister and the chairman of the vast Gazprom concern. "Criminal money is not the lion's share. Most of the money leaving the country is legal, but for a lot of businesses, it is not easy to find a way to do it, so they are eager to find someone who can offer them a service."
Several businessmen, fearing that the practices of importers and other businesses will tarnish everyone, have criticized the Government for failing to conduct a vigorous and public investigation of the root causes of the Bank of New York scandal. "The Russian Government has to understand that this mess has to be cleaned up," Mr. Lebedev said. "But if the scandal succeeds in pushing money out of foreign banks, back to Russia, then it will be a good thing."
But some importers say that unless Russia's tax and customs laws are overhauled, they and their competitors could not survive without the kind of services that Benex and other brokers offer.
"If I obeyed the law I would pay $110,000 for a shipment of goods instead of $70,000," said one thriving importer who explained a tax-dodging scheme similar to the one ascribed to Benex. "There is no way I could do business. I would be undercut by all my competitors."
Another importer, an appliance wholesaler, said the scheme was carried out with a network of dummy companies, banks and the connivance of corrupt Government officials.
This importer faced customs duties and value added taxes totaling 60 percent of the value of the goods he bought. So instead of paying for the goods with an aboveboard contract, he turned to a broker who specialized in under-the-table money transfers.
The broker works regularly with two or three Russian banks, which the importer said sets up dummy companies whose sole function is to transfer money abroad. The dummy companies transfer money to accounts like Benex or directly to the supplier.
Typically, the dummy companies have a life span of three months, declaring bankruptcy just when they are required by Russian law to declare their earnings. No sooner does one company die than another is born -- sometimes registered in the name of people who have lost their passports, or alcoholics who have sold their passports for a drink, the wholesaler said. The final touch is added by the collusion of Government bureaucrats, the importer said.
"You have bureaucrats who dreamed up laws that are all but impossible to adhere to, and then you have bureaucrats who are supposed to implement the laws," he said. "The latter helps people find a way around the laws, in collusion with the former."

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND JIANG HEAL RIFT AND SET NEW TRADE COURSE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Sunday, Sept. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton and China's leader, Jiang Zemin, declared an end on Saturday to months of frozen relations following the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, and their trade ministers began meeting this morning in hopes of closing a broad deal that would get China into the World Trade Organization this year.
Both American and Chinese officials emerged from the two leaders' hourlong meeting, on the fringes of the annual Asian economic summit conference here, brimming with confident assessments of the encounter. It was the first between the two leaders in more than a year. 
 Chinese officials appeared particularly pleased that Mr. Clinton had been openly critical of President Lee Teng Hui of Taiwan for his statements this summer that described the island as a separate state.
Mr. Clinton, according to his national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, told President Jiang that Mr. Lee "had made things more difficult for both China and the United States" with his comments, which appeared to inch Taiwan toward independence. But Mr. Berger said Mr. Clinton had repeated a warning that if China resorted to military force against Taiwan "there would be grave consequences in the United States."
Much of the meeting was consumed with discussion of the final deal to usher China into the World Trade Organization, membership in which would give the Chinese prestige and protection from economic sanctions and trade disputes.
Mr. Clinton walked away from a deal in April, during a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, but soon came to regret the decision.
By all indications, any final deal negotiated in coming days or weeks is likely to resemble closely the offers to open markets that Mr. Clinton judged insufficient five months ago. The soured political atmosphere between the two countries appears to have affected the White House assessment of what constitutes a good deal.
After the accidental embassy bombing, which killed three Chinese, and charges of nuclear spying by the Chinese in American weapons laboratories, Mr. Clinton's aides apparently view the trade accord as the one concrete step they can take to begin to repair relations.
The issue now is how quickly a deal can be struck. The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, was negotiating today with her Chinese counterpart on the three big remaining differences: automobiles, textiles and the rules that prevent Chinese industry from "dumping" products in the United States at below-market prices.
"With the dose of political will, this is stuff that can be worked out in two days," an American official said.
But Mr. Clinton's national economic adviser, Gene Sperling, cautioned against expecting an agreement while the two leaders are in New Zealand for the summit meeting and simultaneous state visits.
"I think that there's enough issues that are on the table that I would not have significant expectations over the next several days," Mr. Sperling said.
China's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, also declined to estimate how long the negotiations might take.
"China will never accept terms that exceed the economic capacity of the country," he said, a reference to the fear in China that opening markets at a time of severe economic downturn would worsen unemployment and deflation.
"As long as the United States is flexible, I don't think the accession will be that difficult," he said, using the term for the process of joining the trade organization. "But if the U.S. persists in its high demands, that will be difficult."
For the United States, the advantage of an agreement is straightforward: All the concessions and reductions of trade barriers come from the Chinese, with none from Washington. For China, membership is a mixed bag. While it must agree to open its highly protected markets to foreign competition, as a member of the trade group it would gain protection against unilateral sanctions by all of its trading partners. Disputes would go to the World Trade Organization's court, and China would be able to challenge efforts by the United States and others to restrict imports of its goods.
Completing the deal is likely to prove politically difficult in both countries. At a time of growing economic troubles in China, Mr. Jiang risks accusations that he is allowing the world's most powerful economy too much access to China's markets. The complaints have been particularly strong in the telecommunications industry because the deal proposed in April would allow foreign companies to own a majority share of Chinese cellular telephone concerns.
Mr. Clinton must worry about a possible revolt in his own party, one that would particularly hurt Vice President Al Gore's candidacy for next year's Presidential race. Labor unions have already protested White House trade policy, and some have withheld endorsements of Mr. Gore.
Some of the country's biggest unions say they will actively oppose any trade deal with China. They are particularly incensed about China's insistence that the United States agree to curb its powers to act unilaterally against dumping. China is already at the center of several dumping charges.
Neither Mr. Clinton nor Mr. Jiang went into detail about those problems at the Saturday session, according to officials who were present. They left the hard bargaining to the trade negotiators.
"The leaders would step in only to resolve serious logjams," a Clinton aide said.
Mr. Jiang seemed particularly eager to score points at Taiwan's expense, telling Mr. Clinton, according to Mr. Berger, that the the island's status was "the most important" of the questions Mr. Clinton raised. At a photo session as the two leaders were sitting down, Mr. Jiang said in response to a reporter's question that "if there were to be any foreign intervention, or if there were to be Taiwan independence, then we would not undertake to renounce the use of force."
Apparently in an effort to defuse Chinese suspicions that the United States was behind Mr. Lee's statements that talks between Taiwan and the mainland should constitute "state-to-state relations," Mr. Clinton insisted that American policy toward Taiwan had not changed. The United States has recognized only one China since President Nixon's opening to Beijing a quarter of a century ago.
"We favor one China," Mr. Clinton said in the presence of reporters, eager to show he was not diverting from the policy of Democrats and Republicans before him. "We favor a peaceful approach to working out our differences."
Mr. Jiang urged Mr. Clinton to stop arms sales to Taiwan, particularly recent sales intended to counter growing missile threats to the country. Mr. Clinton declined, citing the requirements of the Taiwan Relations Act.
Mr. Clinton briefly raised human rights concerns, and Mr. Jiang responded by describing the recent crackdown on Falun Gong, a religious group that has attracted a huge following. Mr. Jiang called Falun Gong "a cult," and gave Mr. Clinton some books about it. Presumably they were officially sanctioned volumes that disparaged a group that was banned in July.
This morning, in his first detailed discussion of Asia's blossoming recovery from a two-year economic crisis, Mr. Clinton warned that many of the financial reforms that seemed so urgent a year ago had been quietly abandoned.
"This is not a time for complacency," he told an audience of chief executives of American and Asian companies. He called on the leaders here, who represent nearly half the world's economic activity and more than half its population, to endorse a series of free-trade initiatives that will be negotiated as part of a new global round of trade talks that begin in Seattle in December.

To the Editor:
Re "Americans Lead the World in Hours Worked" (Business Day, Sept. 7): 
 You say that "increasingly efficient Europeans and Japanese workers are chipping away at the United States lead in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked," implying that American workers are more productive per hour worked. Yet the numbers you report from the International Labor Organization study indicate otherwise.
American workers may produce more in a year, but their productivity is not greater in terms of output per hour worked. Compare the average total of $49,905 of goods per worker produced in the United States divided by the average 1,966 hours worked (for an average of $25.38 worth of goods produced per worker) with $46,100 for Germany divided by 1,560 hours worked (for an average of $29.55 worth of goods per worker).

HEADLINE: The State, as Seen by Centuries of Tourists

BYLINE: By ALBERTA EISEMAN 

 BODY:
THERE is a certain voyeuristic thrill in eavesdropping on people who are talking about us, especially when we learn that most of them really do like us after all. Now, a new book that reprints the writings of people who have traveled through the state since the 17th century shows that outsiders, from common folks to statesmen, have long been impressed, and sometimes unimpressed, with Connecticut.
The outspoken opinions of a Boston woman who traveled on horseback through coastal Connecticut in 1704; the musings of John Adams, seeking to restore his health by drinking the spring waters at Stafford in 1771, two decades before becoming President of the United States; the enthusiasm of a 19th century Englishman upon visiting the new factories of the Naugatuck Valley -- these are some of the first-hand accounts of travelers to the state, featured in a new book "Connecticut Observed: Three Centuries of Visitors' Impressions 1676-1940." Published by the Acorn Club, founded in 1899 to publish books about Connecticut history, in conjunction with the Connecticut Humanities Council which provided half the funding, the anthology introduces excerpts from the diaries of 18 visitors from other parts of the country and from Europe. 
 The writers comment on the geography, people, traditions and institutions that have shaped the state's identity, from descriptions of the primitive and wild landscapes of early colonial days to observations on the economic and social problems of Connecticut on the eve of World War II.
"It's a good snapshot of what was going on in Connecticut over the past 300 years," said Richard Buel Jr., professor of history on leave from Wesleyan University. "If you want a quick, enjoyable primer on the colony's and the state's past, this is a good way to get it."
Mr. Buel was co-editor of the book with J. Bard McNulty, emeritus professor of English at Trinity College. Both men are long-time members of the Acorn Club, an institution limited to 25 people whose major qualification for membership is an abiding interest in Connecticut history.
The project originated with a bibliography compiled by Christopher Bickford, former director of the Connecticut Historical Society, who recommended that the club assemble an anthology of the best of the travel literature available in the society's collection and in other libraries. The entire club took part in a preliminary review of the bibliography, chose the accounts that seemed most interesting and appointed committees to cut the list to 18 entries from the original 150.
"We wanted to give a sense of the development of the colony and the state in each of the particular periods covered by the anthology: the colonial period, the Revolutionary era, pre-Civil War, post-Civil War and the 20th century," Mr. Buel said.
The earliest visitors, residents of more developed areas like Boston, New York or European cities, tended to look down on Connecticut as a rustic, primitive place.
In 1676 an English traveler named William Edmundson described the area between New London and Hartford as "a great wilderness, and very dangerous to travel, the Indians being in arms," while Sarah Kemble Knight, the spirited Bostonian who journeyed to New Haven in 1704 to settle a cousin's estate, wrote that "the Roads all along this way are very bad, encumbered with Rocks and mountainous passages, which are very disagreeable to my tired carcass."
The religious fervor of the colony's early inhabitants met with criticism on the part of several visitors. Passing through Connecticut on a tour of New England in 1744, Alexander Hamilton, a Scottish-born physician residing in Maryland and not the future Secretary of the Treasury, commented on a group of residents of Saybrook who "fell to disputing upon points of divinity as learnedly as if they had been professional theologues. 'Tis strange to see how this humor prevails, even among the lower class of the people here. They will talk so pointedly about justification, sanctification . . . original sin and a thousand other such pretty, chimerical knick knacks as if they had nothing but studied divinity all their life time."
Conversely, John Adams, whose journal entries reveal a thoughtful, compassionate man, found much to praise during his restorative weeks in Connecticut in 1771.
"The place where I now sit has the command of a great view," he writes from Stafford, ". . . and here is a fine spacious road laid out very wide and of great length and quite straight, which lies right before me now, with the Meeting House in the middle of it, more than half a mile off."
Even during the Revolution, which is barely mentioned in the accounts, visitors commented on the beauty of the countryside, as well as on the rigid religious beliefs of the colony's residents. "Here we are in the center of Connecticut, whose inhabitants are bigoted and strict in their tenets," writes Elbridge Gerry Jr., son of the governor of Massachusetts, deploring the fact that traveling was prohibited on Sunday.
More temperate comments on laws governing the Sabbath appear in the memoirs of Captain Jean-Francois Landolphe, captain of a French vessel that was frozen in New London harbor during the notorious winter of 1779-80. He was finally able to sail back to France by having his sailors saw the ship out of the ice.
Visitors in the 19th century described the state's major cities, New Haven and Hartford, which were co-capitals until 1873, taking notice of the many new churches, the universities such as Yale and of pioneering institutions like Hartford's Retreat for the Insane and the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. Anne Newport Royall, a prolific journalist and author, described it in 1826 as "the glory of Hartford, and indeed of the United States."
By the late 1800's, it was the state's thriving industrial factories that were the focus of visitors' comments. Daniel Pidgeon, an English engineer, came to the state in 1883 "with the intention of visiting some of the Naugatuck and Housatonic factories, and of seeing how the homes of labor in New England differ from those of Old England."
In a 20-page excerpt from the book he wrote on his return, Mr. Pidgeon discusses the relationship between water power and industrial development, the role of interchangeable parts in manufacturing and every aspect of the industrial revolution in Connecticut.
He lauds the fine brick buildings.
"One scarcely knew in the distance whether they were factories or castles," he writes, describing the workers dining-rooms -- "very clean, well furnished . . . set with small, separate tables" -- the sprinkler systems, the "girls' toilet-rooms" and especially the machines: "pulsating and quasi-living beings," he calls a pin-making device.
While Pidgeon saw no drawbacks to the coming of industrialization, the last selection, written in 1940 by a journalist from North Carolina, emphasizes the darker side of the economic changes that had transformed the state.
Touring Connecticut for the first time to gather material for a book, Jonathan Daniels heard of factories closing and of businesses moving south. Jobs, in the waning days of the Great Depression, were hard to find and there was tension among the various ethnic groups of the labor force -- the very workers who had immigrated from Europe to do the work of the Industrial Revolution.
Written with insight and sensitivity, the account portrays a world that is still recognizable: a Connecticut of suburbs and cities, of rich and poor, of "the stone walls, the white houses with the green blinds, the churches and their spires, and the Common and the Town Hall," as well as "the back porches of tenements not lovely to behold."

The following are excerpts from "Connecticut Observed: Three Centuries of Visitors' Impressions 1676-1940."
 
Johan Adams, who became the second President of the United States, became ill in 1771 and traveled to Stafford (below) to visit its springs, which had a reputation for restorative powers. After three days there, he went on to explore more of Connecticut.
 "The place where I now sit has the command of a great view," he writes from Stafford, "... and here is a fine spacious road laid out very wide and of great length and quite straight, which lies right before me now, with the Meeting House in the middle of it, more than half a mile off."
 
Wearying of the waters and of "sauntering about" the neighborhood on his horse, he decided to explore the Connecticut River Valley.
"The State House is pretty large, and looks well," he writes of Hartford, where he stopped to "get my head and face shaved," and he finds Middletown "the most beautiful town of all." But his most impassioned words are reserved for the stretch of road between Hartford and Wethersfield.
 "I have spent the morning in riding through paradise. Nothing can exceed the beauty and the fertility of the country. The lands upon the river, the flat low lands, are loaded with rich, noble crops of grass, and grain, and corn."
 
 
Daniel Pidgeon, an English engineer, toured the factories of New England in 1883. He stopped in an Ansonia to visit it spin and telegraph wire factories and the clock factories of Waterbury. Below, the Scovill Manufacturing Co. in Waterbury.
 "One scarcely knew in the distance whether they were factories or castles," he writes, describing the workers diningrooms - "very clean, well furnished ... set with small, separate tables" - the sprinkler systems, the "girls' toilet-rooms" and especially the machines: "pulsating and quasi-living beings," he calls a pin-making device. Effusive as he is about the mills, it is the "Connecticut mechanic" for whom he reserves his highet praise.
 "This remarkable character, who, more than any other person or circumstance, has given its distinctive features to American manufacturer, is a figure of so much industrial importance that we cannot make his acquaintance one moment too soon. His natural bent is strongly towards mechanical pursuits, and he finds his way, very early in life, into the workshop ... whatever be the work on which he is engaged, (he) bends the whole force of an acute but narrow intelligence to scheming means for accomplishing it easily. ... The workshops of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and, especially, of Connecticut are full of such men."

FOR COMMON THINGS
 Irony, Trust, and Commitment
 in America Today
 By Jedediah Purdy.
 226 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $20. 
 NINETEEN SEVENTY-FOUR was a grim year for American public life. The Nixon White House was tottering through its last act. The huge civic hopes of the mid-1960's were long since dead, and into the resulting void had come private comforts of all kinds: jogging, yoga, quadraphonic stereo systems. That year pollsters found that the number of Americans who trust the Federal Government to "do what is right" most of the time had dropped from 53 percent to 38 percent. (It has never exceeded 44 percent since.)
But 1974 was also a time when American social movements, both left-wing and right, were rejuvenating public life through many hundreds of small-scale, local projects. Is there a food co-op or a battered women's shelter in your town? Odds are it was founded within a few years of 1974. This was the era when the political engagement of evangelical churches first bloomed, and also when caravans of exhausted urban new leftists trekked into Vermont and northern California, hoping to begin self-sufficient new communities in the spirit of Thoreau.
Jedediah Purdy is a child of this second 1974. He was born that year in West Virginia, shortly after his parents moved there to farm and (in his father's words) "to pick out a small corner of the world and make it as sane as possible." He was raised in a milieu of craftspeople and environmentalists, and was schooled at home by his parents before going on to Phillips Exeter and Harvard. In "For Common Things," Purdy argues that if we want to heal our national malaise, we should look toward the civic virtues of his parents' world: attentiveness, honesty, devotion to place.
Purdy begins with a description of the malaise. We have become a nation of small-souled ironists, allergic to "cleaving to demanding values, or respecting them in others." Even our cynicism about Washington is narrow and passionless. And our various withdrawals have placed us in peril: "Our private lives -- our work, our families, our circles of friends -- are pervasively affected by things that can never be private: law and political institutions, economics and culture. We ignore these essentially public matters at the risk of misunderstanding our own well-being."
The potential remedies? Purdy warns us against the "therapeutic politics" represented by President Clinton's various task forces. (On this point he is nicely -- and uncharacteristically -- blunt: "This President has made a practice of catching the public's eye by doing very little with great moral gravity.") He also warns against any revival of the "Promethean politics" represented by fascism and revolutionary socialism. Instead, we should learn from nonutopian reformers like . . . his West Virginia parents, whom he convincingly portrays as dogged and effective school and ecological activists. Theirs is "a politics not so much of transformation as of maintenance, of tending to human possibilities more than radically reworking them."
All of this is argued soundly enough. Sometimes, though, Purdy seems not to have absorbed his own lessons. He praises Vaclav Havel and the Polish dissident Adam Michnik for having made adjustments to the politics of banality and compromise in their newly democratic societies -- that is, for not having clung too long to the heroic mode of politics that they embodied under Stalinism. But 30 pages later, in a discussion of strip mining in West Virginia, Purdy frowns at the reformist proposal for a carbon tax that would help to mitigate the consequences of the coal industry's ecological crimes. He calls the carbon tax a "good idea," but worries that its advocates are too glib, too much like "optimistic bureaucrats." The situation requires "a more severe gaze." This passage is easy to applaud -- who isn't repulsed by glib progressive rhetoric? -- but it seems more hollow the more one looks at it. For Purdy doesn't offer a pragmatic critique of the carbon tax, and he doesn't explore whether populist social movements might directly challenge the coal industry's power. Boiled down, the passage tells us only that Purdy dislikes cant and admires honesty and severity. But this particular posture is awfully close to turning up one's nose at the everyday banalities and frustrations of political life, exactly as Havel and Michnik warn we must not do.
Purdy has exactly the right heroes: Czeslaw Milosz, Albert Camus, George Orwell. He worries about fundamental and difficult problems, and he has smart questions to ask. So it is with real sorrow that I report: "For Common Things" is written in a prose that does no honor to Milosz, Orwell or Camus. Purdy was plainly striving
for an austere, morally urgent voice -- and at a few points, when he touches on concrete bits of West Virginia life, he achieves this. But the vast majority of the book is weighed down by a plodding eat-your-vegetables earnestness: "I cannot help believing that we need a way of thinking, and doing, that has in it more promise of goodness than the one we are now following." After a hundred pages of this I found myself yearning for Thomas Geoghegan's recent "Secret Lives of Citizens" -- a book that asks many of Purdy's questions, but reads like a melancholy democrat's fever dream, with hundreds of small sad jokes, digressive stories about Chicago ward politics and glimpses of wry, self-possessed former girlfriends.
The esthetic weakness of "For Common Things" casts an interesting light on the book's argument. Purdy believes that his parents' civic virtue can survive even outside enclaves like their rustic world of West Virginia. But he has very little to say about how these virtues might be transmitted to the national stage -- nothing about the potential for reviving or cleansing real-world political parties, movements, institutions. (When he does write about political renewal, he turns to the heroic figures of Eastern Europe -- not the most relevant models for our own condition.) We're left with the impression that public virtues will be spread only through individual conversion and persuasion -- a method of transmission that has serious limits, as this book inadvertently demonstrates. When making abstract arguments about responsibility and public life, it's all too easy to wind up (like Bill Bradley and Al Gore in certain modes) choking on your own high-mindedness.

HEADLINE: East Timor Isn't Kosovo

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel teaches at the University of Southern California and is author of "Temptations of a Superpower."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Because we bombed in Kosovo doesn't mean we should bomb Dili," said Samuel Berger, the national security adviser, about the atrocities in East Timor, which seem to have been committed by militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military. Well, why not?
The case for intervention in Dili is stronger than it was in Kosovo. Kosovo, after all, was a province of Serbia and had been for centuries. East Timor was never a part of Indonesia until it was seized by the Jakarta Government in 1975. Its people overwhelmingly voted for independence in a recent United Nations-monitored election that the Indonesian Government promised to honor. Yet, after days of violence and hundreds of deaths, the West has only asked, albeit forcefully, that Indonesia allow international peacekeeping troops into East Timor. 
 If the United States intervened for humanitarian reasons to support the Kosovars, even to the point of bombing Serbia, why shouldn't it do the same against Indonesia?
One reason is that -- all the rhetoric aside -- we did not intervene in Kosovo primarily for humanitarian purposes. The plight of the Kosovar refugees is what tugged at the public's heartstrings. But if American foreign policy were driven mainly by such concerns, we would have sent a few thousand troops to Rwanda to stop the genocide of the Tutsis by the Hutus.
What tipped the balance in the case of Kosovo, as well as Bosnia, were two concerns: that the conflict would spread to other areas of the Balkans and beyond, and that American leadership of NATO -- and even the alliance itself -- would be thrown into question. The Kosovo operation was in part meant to prove that NATO was still relevant in a post-Soviet Europe.
None of this applies to conflicts outside Europe. Witness, for example, the West's nonresponse to, and even lack of interest in, the Russian repression in Chechnya. Of course, Indonesia may respond to pressure from the West and allow in troops. But that doesn't change the basic equation. East Timor is not Kosovo; the West will not start bombing to save it. This is not only because East Timor is far from the North Atlantic world, but also because of the size and importance of Indonesia.
It is the world's fourth most populous nation, rich in natural resources and a prime trading partner for American corporations. It is a logical counter to any potential Chinese expansion. Furthermore, unlike puny Serbia, it is a serious military power.
Moreover, we have good reason to avoid weakening the Indonesian Government. This is because the civilian officials do not appear to be in control of the military units carrying out repression in East Timor. Punishing the fledgling democratic Government by military action could defeat our own purposes.
So where does that leave the noble principle of humanitarian intervention, so triumphantly affirmed in Kosovo? About where it began: as the exception rather than the rule.
Intervention will occur where it can be done relatively cheaply, against a weak nation, in an area both accessible and strategic, where the public's emotions are aroused, and where it does not get in the way of other political, economic or military needs.
However realistic this may be, it is deeply regrettable on moral grounds. The special tragedy of this case is that the "international community" monitored an election whose predictable results -- an overwhelming vote for independence -- it had no intention of guaranteeing.
But in the end, the quest for self-determination -- which is what led to the current murderous repression -- is relative, not absolute. People have the right to seek their own independent state. But others will come to their defense only where they believe their own self-interest is involved. That is where the line is being drawn today in East Timor.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Agencies come and go, but Mercedes-Benz doesn't shift many gears in its campaign for 2000.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
EVER notice the resemblance between the Mercedes-Benz logo and the peace symbol? The first campaign for Mercedes-Benz USA from its new agency resembles recent campaigns from its previous agency even more closely.
Not that there is anything wrong with that. Still, the considerable publicity generated by an abrupt switch between the two New York agencies last winter, plus the acrimony -- as evidenced by a lawsuit seeking $25 million in damages -- led to some predictions that the campaign promoting the Mercedes-Benz lineup for the 2000 model year would differ from what went before. 
But the television and print campaign by the new agency, Merkley Newman Harty, echoes the work of its dismissed predecessor, Lowe & Partners/SMS, in content, style and attitude. The warmly emotional tone is back, intended to present the brand as less austere and more approachable. Returning, too, are elements like the one-word titles that appear in the lower right corner of the screen during television commercials.
Another constant is the wry, cheeky sense of humor that imbued past ads. Telly Savalas, for example, is shown playing the lollipop-loving detective Theo Kojak with a full head of hair. Rhett Butler tells Scarlett O'Hara, "Frankly my dear, I don't give a hoot." And Mercedes-Benz employees are portrayed as sufficiently dedicated to their jobs to replace the dummies in crash tests.
Those significant similarities between the campaigns are just what executives at Mercedes-Benz USA, a division of DaimlerChrysler A. G., said they wanted. The new effort begins today and continues through the fourth quarter with a budget of $50 million to $60 million -- the brand's largest model-year introductory spending ever.
"It's absolutely a continuation, building on what came before," said Mike Jackson, president and chief executive at Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J. "What makes it strong is consistency."
"We've had wonderful success in this glorious economy, which has been satisfying," he added, referring to record sales that have almost doubled the last three years. "But the strategies Mercedes-Benz has been pursuing since the early 90's are what has driven our success."
Mr. Jackson discussed the campaign last week at a meeting at the Merkley Newman office in lower Manhattan, where he was joined by colleagues and agency executives.
Joachim W. Eberhardt, vice president for marketing at Mercedes-Benz USA, said: "We had always been satisfied with the ultimate creative product from the former agency. That was never a bone of contention."
Rather, company executives have attributed the dismissal of Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to what they described as increasing difficulties in achieving what they wanted from the agency during the creative process. The dismissal also came after the retirement of Marvin Sloves, former co-chairman at Lowe, who had worked closely with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Eberhardt on Mercedes-Benz advertising.
Interpublic is suing Mr. Sloves for $25 million, accusing him of influencing Mercedes-Benz to leave his former agency and breach of fiduciary duty. Mr. Sloves has denied the accusations and is fighting Interpublic in New York State Supreme Court.
Though there was widespread industry speculation that Mercedes-Benz USA had wanted Mr. Sloves to join the agency that replaced Lowe, that has not happened. Other senior executives who worked at Lowe on the account, with total billings estimated at $125 million, did leave for Merkley Newman, which is a unit of Omnicom Group.
"There was a combination of continuity and new people who added some new strategic insight, some new creative strength," said Alex Gellert, partner and group account director at Merkley Newman, who had been executive vice president and group account director on Mercedes-Benz at Lowe.
Similarly, the partners and executive creative directors at Merkley Newman responsible for the 2000 campaign -- Andy Hirsch, Marty Orzio and Randy Saitta -- had been group creative heads on Mercedes-Benz at Lowe.
What is new is a theme, "The Mercedes experience," that celebrates the factory and dealer employees behind the scenes as much as the brand's logo, heritage, products and driving performance.
The goal is to "create advocates for the brand" among car buyers, Mr. Jackson said, because "there's still nothing as powerful as the word-of-mouth referral from those enthusiastic about your product."
The idea is "not 'Mercedes-Benz is the best car,' " he added, "but 'Mercedes-Benz is the best car for me.' "
The initial commercial, and a related print ad, present humorous mistakes like the hairy Kojak, the misspoken Butler and the Mona Lisa with a toothy smile. "Change one thing and it's just not the same," they assert. "But if every part is exactly right . . . magic. Welcome to the Mercedes experience."
One commercial is evocative of perhaps the best spot created by Lowe in the six years that agency handled the account. The spot used production techniques to make it seem as if people driving and building Mercedes-Benzes decades ago were joining Marlene Dietrich in singing "Falling in Love Again."
This time, special effects and recreated footage are combined with contemporary actors dressed in period costumes to offer an unusual retrospective of Mercedes-Benz safety tests since the 1930's.
Ten TV commercials will appear on local and national broadcast and cable stations and networks. Fourteen print ads will run in newspapers and magazines. There will also be Internet ads, brochures and materials for dealer showrooms.

HEADLINE: Bridging Two Worlds to Make On-Line Digital Music Profitable

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 11

 BODY:
An Internet start-up company plans to introduce a new Web site on Monday that is designed to bridge the competing worlds of on-line digital music and the traditional recording industry.
Garageband.com will focus on the thousands of small and struggling musicians and groups in the United States. Many have found it impossible to sign with a major recording studio but have also discovered that they cannot make a profit by giving their music away over the Internet. 
 Founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Tom Zito and Amanda Lathroum, with Jerry Harrison, a music producer who was a member of the rock group Talking Heads, the San Francisco-based company says it hopes to entice undiscovered musical groups with the promise of recording contracts and distribution agreements.
At the same time, it plans the use digital audience polling as a way to improve the company's odds for releasing commercially successful CD's.
Garageband.com is taking a new approach to the Internet MP3 phenomenon, which has frightened the nation's $13.5 billion recording industry with the specter of mass distribution of pirated music over the Internet.
MP3 is an Internet standard for the digital distribution of music, and in the last two years it has spawned an explosion of Web sites, including MP3.com, Shoutcast.com and Broadcast.com, offering Web surfers access to music on their personal computers. But these sites do not offer pirated copies of commercial recordings.
Instead, they aggregate the works of musicians who produce their own recordings and offer their music free to anyone who cares to download the MP3 files. And while some musicians use the sites to promote their CD's, the large majority do not have contracts with record labels.
For all the interest and controversy the MP3 standard has created, it has yet to generate a viable business model for sustaining small and innovative musical groups, said Mr. Zito, Garageband.com's chairman and chief executive.
"The MP3 advocates say record companies are toast," Mr. Zito said. "We believe record companies know a tremendous amount about marketing and promotion and getting music into the hands of consumers."
Moreover, he argued, the value of all music downloaded over the Internet last year was less than $1 million, suggesting that a viable Internet music economy is a long way off.
What is more, the exact shape of such an economy is still being determined as the recording industry and consumer electronics manufacturers struggle to agree on a format that will protect copyrighted music without alienating consumers.
"The Internet offers recording artists the ability to reach fans directly in a way that has never been possible," said Roger McNamee, a managing director of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. "Garageband has an interesting spin if they can figure out a way to scale it without becoming just like the record companies."
The idea for the new company was formed last year when Mr. Zito visited Mr. Harrison's home and saw a large pile of demo recordings sitting on his floor. They had been sent by aspiring music groups hoping that he would help them produce a CD.
"He asked me, 'Is there anything good there?,' Mr. Harrison recalled. "I responded, 'How would I ever know? I will never have time to listen to even a fraction of them.' "
Mr. Zito approached Ms. Lathroum, who was then an executive and market researcher at the Netscape Communications Corporation, and asked if it would be possible to use the Internet to create an effective audience rating system for music.
The resulting Web service will permit musicians to upload recordings that will be rated by music enthusiasts on the Web. By next year, Garageband.com plans to begin awarding a recording contract for the most popular music each month.
"I would say that this is an Internet version of Dick Clark's "American Bandstand," but I'm pretty sure few people on the Net are old enough to remember American Bandstand," Mr. Zito said.
Garageband.com is hoping to attract listeners who are willing to sample unknown recording artists by offering prizes like backstage passes to concerts and visits to recording studios.
But the emphasis will be on the people who make the music.
"We're creating an on-line community by musicians for musicians," said Mr. Zito. "Obviously, we believe the fans will come where the musicians are, because that's where they'll hear the best music."
Currently, only about 600 of the 30,000 CD's published each year are profitable, Mr. Zito said. The promise of Garageband, he said is that by employing sound statistical techniques he hopes to get a reliable indicator of which recordings will be popular -- and profitable.

HEADLINE: Why China Smiles

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Last year, in the aura of Bill Clinton's buoyant visit, the Chinese called the American President a great statesman and the United States a strategic partner.
Then suddenly this spring, as "U.S.-led NATO" bombed Yugoslavia and then hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Mr. Clinton was described as a fiend, and the United States as an evil empire. 
 With their meeting in New Zealand on Saturday, President Jiang Zemin is once again dancing with "my old friend" Clinton, as he put it a few days ago. Beijing newspapers this morning featured pictures of the two smiling leaders shaking hands and did not even mention the Belgrade Embassy disaster, which killed three Chinese and prompted days of angry demonstrations outside the American Embassy in Beijing.
Warier and perhaps wiser than before, China and the United States are starting to restore normal relations. They seem determined to seal the bond by finally, after years of tortured negotiations, agreeing on terms for China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
These wild gyrations in Chinese-American relations are a reminder of the subterranean passions that have always buffeted ties between the two countries.
But China's rapid return to smiles also reflects a more basic truth, Chinese foreign policy experts and Western diplomats say. For economic and strategic reasons, they say, China's leaders see no good alternative to cooperative relations with the United States in the years ahead.
Recent events, including the American pursuit of the Kosovo war and pugnacious assertions of virtual independence by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, have sharpened the sense in some quarters here, especially the military, that a showdown with the United States over Taiwan may occur at some point.
But for the immediate future, China's leaders hope their hand will not be forced on Taiwan, because they are far more anxious to concentrate on overhauling the economy and building up national strength.
"There's a large consensus here that the relationship with the United States is the cornerstone of our global strategy," said Jin Canrong, an expert on international politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. To speed China's modernization and avoid a costly arms race in Asia, he said, most officials believe that "we have to deal with the United States in a steady way."
China's renewed push to join the World Trade Organization shows how deeply its foreign policy has become intertwined with domestic goals. Entry into the trade body, the leaders feel, will aid their drive to shake out state enterprises and create a market-driven economy -- their only path to prosperity at home and greatness abroad.
Over the last year, with unemployment growing and sporadic reports of social unrest, the pruning of state enterprises slowed, and powerful industries lobbied against making deep concessions to the West on trade. Rumors spread this summer that Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the main torch-bearer for economic reform, had threatened to resign.
But by summer's end it appeared that the leaders had unequivocally decided to plunge ahead with ambitious economic reforms regardless of the short-term risks, and in so doing to resume trade talks with the United States.
In recent weeks, President Jiang has staked his own prestige on the state enterprise overhaul, blitzing the country to deliver speeches with titles like "Fortify Confidence, Deepen Reform, and Create a New Situation for State Enterprise Development." Proposals to speed along change -- consolidating and saving key state firms while letting others go private or bankrupt -- will be the centerpiece of a Communist Party meeting this month.
Entry into the W.T.O., officials here have concluded, is essential to that task.
Aides to Prime Minister Zhu have been heard invoking an old saying: "Let the water flow to wash the sand away." In this case, the water is the stiff competition that will result from trade organization membership, washing away the inefficiencies of hidebound enterprises.
Despite rhetoric about entering the W.T.O. on relaxed, developing-country rules, the Chinese have already agreed to make sharp cuts in farm and industrial tariffs and to begin opening industries like automobiles, telecommunications and banking to outside competition.
Membership, if it is achieved, will of course bring some direct economic benefits. A study by the China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank in Beijing that is a joint venture by the Government and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, concluded that the resulting freer trade would increase the gross domestic product by between one-half of a percent and 1 percent a year.
But that same report pointed to some of the hazards: millions more farmers would become redundant, for example, with no obvious new opportunities opening up soon. And China's fledgling social security systems are not ready for a new surge in industrial layoffs.
Officials from the United States and China have cautioned that a trade agreement has not been clinched.
In any case, Taiwan remains the most dangerous and convoluted issue in Chinese-American relations.
Despite continued bluster in the official press, Chinese officials have assured the Americans that they are not planning any military action unless Taiwan takes further steps toward formal independence. And for now, China appreciates President Clinton's restatement of American support for "one China" and counts on Washington to restrain Taiwan from precipitous moves.
Yet the Chinese also resent American arms sales to Taiwan and they know that if they ever do attack Taiwan, the United States is likely to join the battle.

HEADLINE: Disappointed Democrats Offer Chance for Bradley

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
There are a lot of things in Bill Bradley's biography that Joan Lydic likes: his Rhodes Scholarship, his Hall of Fame career with the New York Knicks, his three terms as a senator from New Jersey. And oh, yeah, he is a down-to-earth guy.
But Mrs. Lydic, 55, a family therapist from St. Louis who attended a rally last week for Mr. Bradley in Keokuk, Iowa, has another reason for supporting him over Vice President Gore, his sole rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination: he was never part of the Clinton Administration. 
 "I'm uncomfortable, being a mother, with what went on there," Mrs. Lydic said. "It sickened me. I know Al Gore is different. But if Al Gore were principled, he should have wanted to resign."
Mrs. Lydic and other disenchanted Democrats represent both the central opportunity and major challenge for Mr. Bradley as he gears up his insurgent challenge to Mr. Gore, the party's presumptive front-runner.
In interviews in a campaign swing through Missouri and Iowa last week, it was clear that many of Mr. Bradley's supporters are fueled, at least in part, by a deep disillusionment with Mr. Clinton -- and by extension with Mr. Gore. And while few blamed Mr. Gore for the Administration's ethical problems, many said they believed the Vice President had been badly tarnished by his close association with the President.
"I like Bradley, from a moral point of view," said Merel Young, 68, a retired teacher from Keokuk. "I think that makes him more electable than Gore."
But building a base among anti-Clinton Democrats is not likely to be enough for Mr. Bradley to wrest the nomination from Mr. Gore, whose support in the Democratic establishment runs deep. To win, Mr. Bradley will have to assemble a broader coalition that picks off Mr. Gore's supporters on the party's right and left, analysts say. And while the election is still a long way away, Mr. Bradley will have to hustle to widen his appeal by the early primaries this winter.
"Right now, two-thirds of Bradley's appeal is soft," said Fred Siegel, a professor of history at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan. "People like him because he's an adult, he seems like a fully formed human being with a backbone, who is not going to be tossed by the winds. And he's not caught up in the Clinton scandals."
"To vault to the next level, he has to go further," Mr. Siegel added. "He has to lay out specifics for what a Bradley Presidency would look like."
So far Mr. Bradley has been unwilling to do that, avoiding major policy pronouncements on the issues he says will define the coming election: the economy, health care, race relations and foreign policy. Those will come in the fall, when voters are more focused on the race, his campaign says.
But in his recent speeches, Mr. Bradley has provided clear indications of how he plans to establish himself as the anti-Gore alternative.
At the heart of every speech is a liberal critique of the Clinton Administration's economic policies: that the nation's roaring prosperity has not trickled down to struggling working-class and poor Americans.
It is a difficult argument to make, because the strong economy is probably Mr. Gore's strongest political asset. But with a New Deal-like pitch to traditional liberalism, Mr. Bradley evokes the spirit of his father, a small-town banker, who he says refused to foreclose on a single home during the Great Depression.
"If the stock market is skyrocketing and family farms are going bankrupt," Mr. Bradley told 18 people at a diner in Newton, Iowa, "you shouldn't feel good about where the economy is going."
Mr. Bradley has also placed race relations front and center in his campaign, saying, "The only thing deserving of hate is hate itself." Polls indicate that blacks -- who represent 30 percent or more of the Democratic primary vote in some Southern states -- remain loyal to Mr. Gore.
But in a sign of Mr. Bradley's desire to grab black votes from Mr. Gore's left, he appeared before a Harlem organization run by the Rev. Al Sharpton last month -- even though his visit angered centrist white voters and Jews who view Mr. Sharpton as divisive.
But Mr. Bradley is doing more than trying to outflank Mr. Gore in the party's liberal wing. He is a staunch advocate of sweeping gun restrictions and changes to the campaign finance system. Both are issues of concern not just for liberals, but also for middle-class reformers and centrist suburban voters.
Both candidates have extensive proposals on both issues, but Mr. Bradley's go significantly further. He has called for licensing all gun owners, registering all guns and banning so-called Saturday night special handguns, as well as for public financing of Congressional campaigns and free television time for candidates.
To broaden the appeal of his economic message beyond the very poor, Mr. Bradley advocates making it easier for workers to form unions, expanding access to health care and bolstering pensions.
And for independent voters, Mr. Bradley offers a populist, Perotlike critique of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore's leadership styles, asserting that politics today is "obsessed with the mechanics of winning, which is polling, fund-raising and spinning."
Finally, by focusing on the importance of character and virtue in politics, Mr. Bradley seems to be directly addressing the small-town, moderate Democrats who tend to vote in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, where he must perform well next year to survive.
It helps Mr. Bradley that most of this does not seem forced. He can fairly claim that he has been concerned about race relations since he was a boy and that the civil rights movement inspired him to enter politics.
And he was talking about the importance of character in politics long before Monica S. Lewinsky became a household name.
He also seems to benefit from his unhurried, easy manner. In Keokuk he shook hands and signed basketballs until the last supporter had drifted off, leaving him alone in the fading afternoon sun.
"He reminds me of a good old country doctor," Katie Wood, 48, of Hannibal, Mo., said.
But Mr. Bradley can be maddeningly short on specifics, and even some supporters say his gauzy appeals to human goodness may begin to lose voters if they do not soon include hard details.
"I've been on the campaign just two weeks, and people are already asking me where he stands on things," said Nancy Parrott, a Bradley organizer in southeastern Iowa. "Right now, we are just giving them resumes."
If Mr. Bradley often dodges questions on broad policy matters, he can be quite specific on issues that concern Iowa voters. In Ottumwa, he told farmers that he supported Justice Department oversight of agricultural mergers that threaten small farmers. In Des Moines, he told peace activists that he opposed sending American troops to East Timor. And in Grinnell, he told college students that although he opposed legalizing gay marriages, he supported giving homosexual partners legal rights and protections comparable to those of married couples.
By nature cautious and methodical, Mr. Bradley admits to fearing that candor will cause him problems as the campaign heats up.
When a woman in Newton asked him about his position on public financing of private schools, Mr. Bradley acknowledged that he had voted for a pilot voucher program while in the Senate, a position strongly opposed by the powerful teachers unions. But he added that he did not consider vouchers "the answer to the problems of public education."
"I've tried to be as candid with you as possible," Mr. Bradley told the woman. "That leads to the maximum possibility of distortion."

Complacency Is in Season

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
A new venue has been added for Fashion Week: the Tomar Studios, located on the 13th floor of a warehouse building in the far West 20's. It is a precinct enjoying its status as the art and fashion world's latest epicenter of hip, and so it seemed fitting that the sun-filled studios saw more than a half-dozen young, mostly unknown designers introduce their millennial lines over the weekend.
But these collections for spring 2000 had less in common with anything avant-garde than with an art exhibition just down the hall from Tomar Studios. Titled "Mainely Maine," it featured uncomplicated paintings of New England landscapes. Barrier-breaking it was not. 
 And neither were the clothes coming down the runways 100 or so yards away. The designers -- Fiona Walker, Lotta and Chompol Serimont, among others -- offered mostly wearable, almost quaint, daisy-trimmed sundresses, skirts of paisley and gingham, and coated linen sport jackets. All that accessibility can be slightly dull. Even the models sometimes seemed too bored to pout.
Those expecting complexity or, more likely, grand spectacle will have to wait for Alexander McQueen's much-anticipated show on Thursday, or perhaps the Mayor's NYC 2000 fashion show, to be held on an outdoor runway in Times Square tonight. It will feature the work of 90 designers from around the world, made specifically for the event, and will be emceed by the swimsuit model Vendela. The items will be auctioned later to support city schools.
There were attempts at drama over the weekend, but they tended to be misguided. Ms. Walker, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland, who now has a shop on West 46th Street, put welder's glasses on some of her models and set her collection to the blaring techno music of Bjork and Fresh Aire, ill-suited companions for her generally peaceful knits, cropped pants and pretty linens. Ms. Walker seemed desperate to supply the show with a homage to futurism that the clothes lacked. "I wanted everything to be about technology for the millennium," she said after the show. "The clear glasses enhanced that idea."
Antilika, a graduate of the Moscow College of Art and Design, also aimed to create clamor. Her clothes were the least commercial of those shown on Saturday, but her vision seemed the most contrived and regressive. She put images of babies as well as O'Keeffe-like representations of female body parts on the midsections of her uninventively cut dresses. A woman cannot escape her sexuality, Antilika very literally seemed to be saying. A woman is trapped by her function as a breeder. It's an idea that seems curiously out of step in these post-feminist times. What woman of any political stripe is going to feel empowered by putting on a dress that appears to have fallopian tubes depicted on it?
A more contemporary dissertation on female sexuality was in evidence on Sunday when a pair of evening-wear designers, Sully Bonnelly and William Calvert, unleashed their collections away from the West Chelsea venue. Mr. Bonnelly was born in the Dominican Republic, and wisely enough he has capitalized on the current American affection for Latin culture. His flared, fake suede pants and chiffon tops were shown in rich tropical limes and fuchsias. His cuts were slim and fabrics sheer in a brash, sexy manner that both Camille Paglia and Ricky Martin could appreciate. Mr. Bonnelly called one garment a "salsa dress." The designation seemed unnecessary; it was clear that the item was intended for the dance floor. It was clear that just about everything on view was intended for the dance floor -- one where an orchestra more electric than Lester Lanin's might be playing.
Young society women on the Lanin circuit will find one of their most passionate advocates in Mr. Calvert. Of all those who showed over the weekend, he possesses the most articulate vision. He is intent on dressing women who quietly appreciate all that the boom economy has provided. His geometrically cut gowns, inspired by Geoffrey Beene, and luxurious fabrics are meant for those who want to achieve an effortless beauty rather than worked-for glamour. He avers a girlish idea of femininity that has so many young designers in its grip and opts for making women look elegantly grown-up.
The new collection introduces more color than in Mr. Calvert's past collections. "Now, when you see someone walking down the street in black, you think how weird, how boring," Mr. Calvert said before his show. He isn't the first designer of late to express this thought, but he's certainly one of the more talented ones to convey it.

HEADLINE: Campaign Reform's Moment

 BODY:
One of the most important election events of the current season takes place this week, not in Iowa or New Hampshire or any other primary state, but on Capitol Hill. Tomorrow the House of Representatives votes on the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill to ban unregulated "soft money" donations to political parties, regulate phony "issue ads" on television and impose new fund-raising disclosure rules. The bill, which would curb abuses and practices at the heart of the 1996 fund-raising scandals, appears likely to pass. But the more votes it gets, the better the chances will be for Senate approval of what would become the most sweeping electoral reforms in a generation.
Congress and the political establishment have begun feeling the pressure from voters and even donors. The Committee for Economic Development is rounding up business leaders opposed to soft-money donations. Gov. George W. Bush last week announced that his campaign would list donors on its Web site, a positive step but nothing like real reform. The bill sponsored by Representatives Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts passed last year by a vote of 252 to 179, including 61 Republicans who broke with their party leadership to back the bill. If supporters stand firm, the majority ought to be just as big this year. But in a repetition of their junkyard tactics of 1998, House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, are offering amendments and substitutes that would gut the bill's main provisions or split the delicate coalition backing reform. 
Some Democrats and Republicans may be tempted to waver. Anti-abortion groups are pressuring their allies to support amendments that would gut the legislation's regulation of television campaign ads sponsored by independent groups. Republicans and Democrats who favor campaign reform have urged anti-abortion forces not to oppose the Shays-Meehan bill, but without success. Tomorrow they need to vote for reform, in defiance of the misguided wishes of people with whom they might agree on abortion.
Another danger to reform comes in the form of "poison pill" amendments. One would throw out the whole bill if any part of it was declared unconstitutional. Others would increase ceilings on donations to candidates, a premature step. Another would weaken the ability of unions to raise money. If passed, it would drive Democrats from the bill. A poison pill administered by Mr. DeLay would deregulate campaign activities as long as they were conducted on the Internet. Still another measure would require that a candidate raise at least 50 percent of his contributions in his home state, a measure that if passed would force blacks and other urban minorities to oppose the underlying bill.
The gravest danger to reform is posed by three seemingly attractive "substitute" amendments from Republicans that, if passed, would supplant the Shays-Meehan bill altogether. The one sponsored by John Doolittle of California would repeal all campaign limits and merely require disclosure, an obvious step backward. Another pushed by Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas would allow soft money for state parties, a loophole that would simply rechannel the flow of corrupt money. A third pushed by Bill Thomas of California sounds harmless enough. It would strengthen filing requirements and take other constructive steps. But because it is a substitute, its passage would defeat Shays-Meehan.
Without a campaign overhaul, the parties are sure to spend $500 million to $750 million in soft money this year, twice as much as in the last Presidential election. A "yes" vote on Shays-Meehan can head off more corrupt fund-raising and more scandals in the coming election cycle. Tomorrow the House faces a test of its members' sincerity and of whether it is listening to the public instead of special-interest donors.

Underground Dreams

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It could happen. I'm not saying it will happen. But the stars are moving ever closer to a favorable alignment. A subway line under Second Avenue in Manhattan -- a dream that has tantalized commuters for most of this century -- is now approaching the realm of the possible. Don't bet the mortgage just yet. The cynics and the naysayers are still holding the high cards. But it could happen.
And if you are one of the unlucky thousands who ride to work while being poked and jostled by the unruly elbows, backpacks and umbrellas on the hopelessly and sometimes dangerously overcrowded Lexington Avenue line, you know for sure that it should happen. 
 Construction of the city's subway system began 100 years ago. William McKinley was President and Robert Van Wyck was Mayor, the first Mayor of all five boroughs. The subways soon became indispensable and shortly after World War I East Siders were being told that a Second Avenue subway line was in their future.
They had no idea how far in the future. For one reason or another -- a Depression, a World War, a lack of vision, a fiscal crisis -- the Second Avenue subway never happened. Highways and bridges and tunnels and vast acres of parking lots materialized during those decades. But no subway under Second Avenue.
"The East Side of Manhattan was developed around the Second and Third Avenue els," said Bob Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, which is part of a coalition of civic and business groups that is calling for work to actually get started on creation of a Second Avenue line.
"When the els came down, the East Side was zoned with the understanding that there was going to be a Second Avenue subway replacing those elevated lines. But it hasn't been built. Consequently, the Lex is jammed well beyond its carrying capacity, to the point where it just doesn't work. People can't get on and off the trains. The platforms and stairs can't carry the numbers of people that are there. It is literally approaching an unsafe situation at the most crowded stations."
In the mid-1950's a full-scale Second Avenue line probably would have cost a few hundred million dollars. Now it would cost several billion. And yet, Mr. Yaro and many others are saying, "I think its time has come."
There are several reasons to be at least somewhat optimistic. To get the subway line built you have to have the support of top state officials. It so happens that Gov. George Pataki very much wants to build a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal. That would keep thousands of suburban Long Island commuters from having to travel to Penn Station on the West Side of Manhattan and then doubling back to the East Side by subway to get to work. (It would also add thousands of new passengers to the daily crush of the Lexington Avenue line.)
And it just happens that the Speaker of the State Assembly, Sheldon Silver, represents the Lower East Side, which is woefully short of subway service and would benefit tremendously if the Second Avenue subway were built.
One has to keep in mind, of course, that for Mr. Silver's local constituents to benefit, a full-length Second Avenue line would have to be built, not the truncated 125th Street to 63d Street proposal being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Mr. Pataki, friend of the suburbanites, meet Mr. Silver, who says he's a champion of the urbanites. Let's make a deal. If not now, when? The number of New Yorkers using mass transit has soared over the past couple of years. And these are the best of economic times, with the Federal, state and city governments all running surpluses. All we need is a little vision.
"We're running out of capacity to move people into the central business district," said Gene Russianoff, the senior attorney with the Straphangers Campaign, which is also part of the coalition supporting a new subway line. "If we want to have the jobs of a growing economy, we have to be able to get the people to them. And we've maxed out. The Lex is at 140 percent of capacity during rush hour. It's a nightmare."
There is wide support for the new subway line, ranging from the Auto Club of New York to the New York City Partnership and the Environmental Defense Fund. The stars are in alignment. All we need is leadership.
Mr. Pataki? Mr. Silver?

HEADLINE: THE DEBATE ON AID FOR THE ELDERLY FOCUSES ON WOMEN

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
It is not an accident that Flo, a feisty sixty-something woman, is the star of the pharmaceutical industry's latest advertising campaign in the battle over adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
Nor is it a coincidence that the White House held an event not long ago to focus on Medicare as a women's issue. Or that the Democratic women of the Senate formed a working group last year to examine what the various proposals to restructure Social Security would mean to women. Or that the Older Women's League, an advocacy group, issued a report on Mother's Day this year titled, "The Face of Medicare Is a Woman You Know." 
 All of this reflects a basic demographic and political reality that increasingly colors the debate over restructuring Medicare and Social Security: old age is largely a country of women.
Women not only tend to live longer; they also are more economically insecure, have more chronic health conditions and, as a result, eventually become more dependent on those basic safety-net programs, health policy analysts say. Politically, that means they are becoming a prime audience -- and target and symbol -- in the great struggles over entitlements. Some defenders of these programs say that highlighting this vulnerable population -- as opposed to the image of the more affluent retirees -- is not only good policy but could be a potent political appeal.
"Women perceive it as a twofold issue: One, they're more likely to have all the problems of old age because they're likely to live longer," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "And second, whatever caregiving responsibilities exist, women expect to fall squarely on their shoulders."
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the pharmaceutical industry, said, "When you do focus groups, women say, 'Look, I'm going to live longer. I could outlive my income.' Women just presume there's a higher chance they'll need a Government safety net more than men."
The demographics are clear: At birth, the American woman's life expectancy is 79.1, six years longer than a man's. Women account for 54 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries from age of 65 to 74, and 61 percent of the Medicare population from 75 to 84, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. They account for 71 percent of the 85-and-over Medicare population. Reflecting this skew, women make up more than two-thirds of the nursing home population and two-thirds of the users of home health-care services.
Older women also have higher poverty rates than their male counterparts: 17 percent of the women on Medicare have incomes below the Federal poverty level ($7,740 a year in 1996), compared with 11 percent of the men on Medicare, according to a report by the Older Women's League. Nearly 7 in 10 of the Medicare beneficiaries living below the poverty line are women, that report said.
"The good news is we live longer than men, and the bad news is that we live longer than men," said Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, a liberal advocacy group for such causes as expanded family leave.
Ann F. Lewis, a Presidential counselor, said, "When you start talking about the fact that women live longer, are paid less, are far less likely to have pensions with their work, and far more likely to carry the responsibility for caregiving in our families, every woman in the audience starts to nod."
Ms. Lichtman and other advocates say women's groups have long recognized that "aging is a women's issue," because of women's work patterns, caregiving responsibilities, economic status and longevity. But in the last few years, as Social Security and Medicare appeared headed for overhauls, advocates say these groups have organized to insure that women's interests are protected.
"The reason you're hearing more about this now is the programs that women and men, but especially women, rely on for old age, Social Security and Medicare, are under new strains," said Joan Entmacher of the National Women's Law Center, an advocacy group that focuses on women's legal rights.
Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, said the Democratic women in the Senate began meeting on the issue a year ago, when Social Security restructuring appeared imminent and the debate over privatizing the program was taking off. Any major restructuring is now considered unlikely until after the 2000 election. A few months ago, the Democratic women produced a checklist of necessary ingredients for any Social Security overhaul, including preserving the program as a guaranteed benefit with protection against inflation.
"Others wanted to talk about macroeconomics," Ms. Mikulski said. "We wanted to talk about it at the macaroni-and-cheese level."
There is a clear political rationale for presenting Social Security and Medicare as women's issues, just as liberal advocates a decade ago tried to cast welfare and poverty as children's issues. Preserving and improving expensive entitlement programs for frail and economically vulnerable widows is much more appealing than doing so for affluent retirees.
"It puts a human face on it," Ms. Mikulski said of the focus on women. "And I believe a far more realistic face. We're not talking about the gilded golf cart here."
While Democrats and their sympathetic advocacy groups have been hitting this issue particularly hard, the focus on women is bipartisan. Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican who is a senior woman on the House Ways and Means Committee, contends that Republicans have "been the lead party" in trying to protect older women's economic security through such measures as tax credits for caregivers and the purchase of long-term care insurance. "I think part of my job is to educate them about what we're doing and why we're doing it," Mrs. Johnson said.
In the near term, these demographic undercurrents are strong in the struggle over whether to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare, as proposed by the Clinton Administration this year. The Administration and the Older Women's League contend that this coverage gap is a particular hardship for older women, who spend a greater share of their income on health care than men, 22 percent compared with 17 percent.
Republican leaders, for their part, contend that they will focus on the needy in the debate over assistance for prescription drugs.
The drug industry, which fears that a major new Government benefit will lead to price controls, is sounding alarms in the person of Flo, who warns that "the White House plan puts bureaucrats in charge of our medicines."
The campaign presents Flo -- "an actress, but her story and concerns are real," according to campaign literature -- as being in the two-thirds of the Medicare population that has private drug coverage and plays to worries of people in this group that their insurance will be replaced by a less-generous and more-intrusive Government plan.
The advertisements say they are produced by Citizens for Better Medicare, a coalition of business, drug industry and some patients groups, but a spokesman for the group said they were primarily paid for by the pharmaceutical industry. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of American have taken the lead in this campaign.
Some advocates of new prescription drug benefits have reacted angrily to the Flo advertisements. "The Flo campaign is really outrageous," said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. Deborah Briceland-Betts, executive director of the Older Women's League, said her organization had mounted an anti-Flo campaign: "The message is Flo is a fake, and she doesn't represent the majority of older women in America who are trying to figure out how to cover the costs of drugs."
The struggle over Flo is a symbol of what is to come, advocates on both sides agree. "We're all talking to women on these issues," said Ms. Lichtman. "They are, we are."

HEADLINE: After Summer's Power Failures, Concerns About Large Utilities

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 12

 BODY:
Over and over again this summer, the lights went out in this muscular, make-it-work city.
There was the blistering midsummer weekend when temperatures topped 100 degrees and up to 100,000 homes in the Chicago area lost power, a weekend in which officials recorded more than 50 heat-related deaths. 
 There was the day the power company, faced with trouble in two transformers, plunged Chicago's downtown Loop into darkness in the middle of the afternoon, leaving 2,300 businesses in the dark, trapping people in elevators, short-circuiting Federal court proceedings and even silencing the cacophony at the Chicago Board of Trade.
And there was the Sunday that power failures prevented the city's Field Museum of Natural History from opening its doors on what was supposed to be one of the summer's busiest weekends.
Cities around the country have faced similar frustrations. In New York, on one of the hottest days of the year, a power cable short-circuited, leaving 200,000 homes in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan powerless for 18 hours, the worst blackout to hit the city in 22 years. In New Orleans, power plant failures led to blackouts that disrupted service for more than half a million customers.
The reasons behind the power failures vary, but they all hint at deep-seated problems at the nation's largest electric power companies. Utilities that are now the lifeblood of the electronic age are grappling with deregulation, aging and long-neglected equipment, new and sometimes confusing transmission networks and unprecedented demands for electricity to power the technology behind a booming economy.
Utility experts are warning that the industry's emergency power reserves are getting dangerously low, largely because of a decadelong reluctance by utilities to build power plants because of the costs and uncertainty of power demands.
While there have been a significant number of blackouts in the last few years, the high temperatures this summer thrust the utilities' problems into a particularly harsh spotlight, raising questions about whether they are adequately prepared to cope with the nation's soaring energy needs.
"There have been several high-profile outages that have caused people to get excited about reliability issues," said Eugene F. Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry trade group in Princeton, N.J. "It's not that the system is falling apart. But as you look at the next 10 years you don't want to wait for things to fall apart."
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has announced an investigation of the power failures. Some elected officials have filed suit against power companies over failures or taken steps to lure competing utilities in the hopes of creating alternatives.
After the Chicago power failures, Mayor Richard M. Daley, seething with anger, denounced Commonwealth Edison, the giant utility whose power system was at fault, because among other things it had failed to replace insulators made of plastic that were so old and faulty that most utilities got rid of them decades ago.
"We are sick and tired of them," the Mayor said of the power company, "and they had better change."
And regulators in several states are considering forcing utilities to pay a penalty for periods that they fail to provide power.
"I don't think I've heard as much complaining about electric utilities and shortages and outages in a long time," said Robert Burns, a senior researcher at the National Regulatory Research Institute, which does studies for state public utility commissions. "It's been decades since there have been this many problems."
As a result, the nation's utilities are redoubling their efforts to make sure this summer's experience is not repeated. Some are scrutinizing maintenance practices or, like Commonwealth Edison in Chicago, firing top-level executives. Others are trying to accelerate the pace at which they build plants, with their earlier reluctance overcome by the need for more power.
Executives at the nation's biggest utilities say the high-profile power failures are not representative of the industry. Yet many of them acknowledge that the utility industry is struggling through a period of major change. The advent of deregulation of the industry that began with the Federal Government meant new competition, new challenges and new sources of power.
Many utilities now have to open their transmission lines to competitors, which has spawned the buying and selling of power across regions. Florida utilities now sell to the Southeast, Wisconsin utilities to the East, and New England utilities to the Middle Atlantic.
"You have utilities that are running power from region to region, so you have a lot of traffic," said Patrice Hagmann, a spokeswoman at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group in Washington for shareholder-owned electric companies. "You may need a traffic cop to control things."
The Federal Government previously regulated transmission lines that crossed state boundaries. States have the power to control utilities in their borders, and many still do, while other states have freed the companies of controls in the hope that competition will bring less expensive electricity.
Here in Chicago, where a series of power failures inflamed a city and its outspoken Mayor this summer, the culprits were faulty transformers and wires.
"The outages revealed a number of weaknesses and shortcomings in our system," said David Helwig, the interim senior vice president of transmission and distribution at Commonwealth Edison. "Quite frankly, many of the problems can be traced to maintenance that wasn't done."
Chicago has suffered through power failures before, including a serious one in a heat wave in 1995 in which there were more than 400 heat-related deaths in a month. Although industry experts say that Commonwealth Edison, which is owned by Unicom Inc., has improved the operation of its five nuclear plants in recent years, its substations, cables and the distribution networks that serve the greater Chicago area have long been neglected.
For instance, Commonwealth Edison still uses an old plastic, the "bakelite" insulator, in its cables. "That stuff was starting to be replaced years and years ago," said Mr. Burns at the National Regulatory Research Institute. "Talking about bakelite is kind of like talking about having a rotary phone. There shouldn't be as much of that stuff out there anymore."
Concerned that outdated and inadequate plants could continue to short-circuit the city's power and eventually turn into a political liability, Mayor Daley insisted that Commonwealth Edison institute around-the-clock inspections of its equipment. In recent months, Commonwealth Edison has acknowledged major technical and public relations blunders.
"This level of service under these conditions is a disgrace to us," John Rowe, the chief executive, said at a news conference after the latest power failure. "It's a personal disgrace to me. I will not tolerate it, and you will not have to."
Commonwealth Edison has tried to make amends by holding public forums, offering cash refunds to some customers and promising swift changes at the top. Mr. Rowe fired two high-level executives and promised to spend $1.4 billion over the next three years to upgrade equipment.
Still, a few weeks ago, Chicago began courting a subsidiary of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation with the promise of donating land to help the utility build a power plant, opening the door to an alternative source of electricity.
In New York City, there are similar concerns about an aging power system and soaring demand. Indeed, the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has already filed suit against Consolidated Edison, charging the utility with "gross negligence" in the Washington Heights blackout.
But Con Edison officials say they are operating one of the most reliable utilities in the nation, yet one that is at times vulnerable to extreme weather and extreme demand.
"We had the underground equivalent of an earthquake with all the heat and humidity," said Mary McCartney, a spokeswoman. "If we didn't take the network off line it was basically going to destroy itself."
On the day the power failed, energy consumption hit a record 11,850 megawatts in the New York City region, Ms. McCartney said. The utility's capacity is 12,000 megawatts, with an 18 percent buffer, clearly straining the system and raising questions about whether Con Edison has enough power to meet demands and extreme weather conditions. The utility admits that this summer demand was 10 percent higher than it had projected.
Con Edison buys the bulk of its power from other utility companies, in places like Pennsylvania and Maryland. "Capacity is a major issue," Ms. McCartney said. "It's something every utility is looking at."
Other cities have been equally burdened this summer, but for differing reasons. In Louisiana, the big utility, the Entergy Corporation, said that unusually high demand for power in the four states it serves created a wide power failure; four or five power plants malfunctioned at just about the time the Tennessee Valley Authority decided to stop shipping power to the utility, because of heavy demand in other regions. Crippled by the events, Entergy decided to shut down power to hundreds of thousands of its customers.
"There was extraordinarily high demand and we just didn't have enough power to cover it," said Carol Clawson, a spokeswoman at Entergy, which is based in New Orleans. "One of the dilemmas utilities have is how do you prepare for this kind of thing: Do you go out and build extra power plants to prepare for a once-in-a-decade event? And do you charge customers for that? Do you build additional generation because you think one day in July it will be really, really hot?"
Responding to concerns about periodic power failures, Mr. Richardson, the Energy Secretary, announced an initiative last July to help prevent major power failures, including the creation of a team of experts to investigate blackouts, pushing for new standards to reduce energy consumption, and trying to determine whether there is a shortage of power plants and transmission sites.
"Consumers should not have to wonder whether the lights will go out when the thermometer hits 90 degrees," Mr. Richardson said. "While the causes of recent power outages are still being reviewed, the fact is that some systems are being stretched to the limit. Clearly, there is cause for concern."
Industry experts, however, point out that the nation's utilities are not in crisis mode; service is generally reliable. But power companies need to move swiftly if they are going to meet growing customer demands.
"Across the country, I think the quality of service has improved, but we've become so dependent on electricity we're less tolerant," said Douglas Fischer, an analyst who covers the utility industry at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. "One problem we do have, though, is a shortage of power."
After a heavy buildup of power plants and transmission lines in 1970's and 1980's, electric utilities were slow to invest in expensive power plants. Now, with deregulation and uncertainty about how competition and buying and selling power will work, many utilities are also reluctant to invest in the power plants and power lines that many people fight to keep out of their neighborhoods.
The most recent figures available show the nation's consumption of electric power rose to 3,367 billion kilowatt hours in 1998, up from 2,578 billion kilowatt hours in 1988.
Industry officials say the power plants now being built may not keep up with growing consumption. In 1990, there was a 22 percent cushion of extra power available for emergency use in the United States. That figure fell to 16 percent in 1997, and is expected to drop to 10 percent by 2007 if consumption continues to grow at the current pace, according to the Edison Electric Institute.
While the utilities say they are working aggressively to meet the challenges, Robert K. Johnson, the executive director of the Electric Consumers' Alliance in Indianapolis, said regulators needed to keep a watchful eye on the industry.
"My concern," Mr. Johnson said, "is that the outages, while they may individually be explainable in different ways, collectively could be symptoms of transitional problems in the industry that need to be addressed."

On-Line Radio Tries The All-Talk Format

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
An entrepreneur who made his name in rock radio almost 30 years ago is now trying his luck at Internet radio.
Bob Meyrowitz, 56, whose DIR Broadcasting in the early 1970's created the syndicated radio series "King Biscuit Flower Hour," plans to start a radio network on the Internet this week. Recognizing that, so far, so-called streaming, or continuous, audio is not always of the highest fidelity on the Net, Mr. Meyrowitz plans an all-talk network, which he calls Eyada.com. 
 Dave Herman, who was host of the morning show on the New York rock station WNEW-FM for 26 years, is Eyada.com's program director.
Initially, Eyada.com will offer one channel of programming about the entertainment industry, with 15 hours of programming each weekday and four hours each on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The lineup of hosts for the entertainment channel, which begins officially transmitting on Wednesday, includes Lionel, host of Court TV's "Snap Judgment"; Richard Johnson, editor of Page Six, the gossip page of The New York Post; George Rush and Joanna Molloy, The New York Daily News husband-and-wife gossip columnists, and Bob Berkowitz, the former host of Real Personal, a discontinued sex advice program on CNBC.
Next month, Eyada.com plans to introduce an all-talk channel for sports, and it expects to add channels on teen-agers, women and business by the end of 2000, Mr. Meyrowitz said.
He said he had raised just under $10 million from private investors and hoped to reach 20,000 listeners a day, ranging from age 20 to 40. The network intends to sell banner ads and audio commercials.
Lisa Allen, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., criticized Eyada.com's planned programming, which she said "is not uniquely suited to the new medium."
She also predicted listeners would ignore the advertising. "If there's one thing that's clear, it's that Internet users do not like ads and avoid them," Ms. Allen said. "There's no reason to think they'll listen to radio ads on line."
But Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications in New York, said that if the network could establish its brand, it might be able to create a niche for itself before the likes of Don Imus and Howard Stern hit cyberspace. "They're not on line yet, but I promise you they will be in a year," Mr. Mooradian said.

HEADLINE: Prayers Turn Political on the Future of Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Diana Gonzalez had not been to church in many years, so she was somewhat skeptical when she heard that St. Cecilia's Church in East Harlem was holding an ecumenical prayer service on a seemingly secular subject: the fate of Vieques, P.R., a small island that is home to a United States naval base, and that, for many Puerto Ricans, has long symbolized their colonial status.
"I wasn't sure what to expect," she said. "It is a political issue." 
 What she got was a religious service deeply laced with politics, not only from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is well known for interweaving the religious and the secular, but from the Archbishop of San Juan, Roberto Gonzalez Nieves.
"I found it amazing," she said of the Archbishop's use of religious teachings not only to make a case for the removal of the naval base, but to defend the granting of clemency to 14 Puerto Rican nationalists, 11 of whom were freed from prison Friday. "I didn't know he could do that."
But do that he did, before a church packed with raucous nationalists, who offered standing ovations.
The issue of Vieques has smarted in the Puerto Rican consciousness almost since the United States began using the island for naval exercises during World War II. But it has threatened to boil over since April, when one civilian was killed and four others were injured during a practice bombing run. Since then the base has been the site of almost continuous civil disobedience, although the authorities have made no arrests.
Nationalists say the military presence has harmed the 51-square-mile island's natural resources and its economy, and endangered its residents' health. The Navy says Vieques a small island seven miles off Puerto Rico, is the only place where it can stage realistic battle scenarios.
Yesterday's service, which also featured performances by the popular Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera and by Mr. Jackson's daughter Sandita, was designed to show solidarity for the activists, and to capitalize on the burst of Puerto Rican patriotism engendered by the release of the members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group. The group, the Armed Forces for National Liberation, known as the F.A.L.N., was responsible for 130 bombings in the 1970's and 1980's.
Mr. Jackson wasted no time in making his point: if the United States fought for Kosovo's right to self-determination, if it believes in East Timor's right to self-determination, why do the people of Puerto Rico not deserve the same chance?
"It is a sin for one individual to own another -- it's called slavery," he said to appreciative murmurs.
"It's a sin for one nation to own another -- it's called colonialism," he said, bringing down the house.
Mr. Jackson also said that while he supported the Clinton Administration's offer of clemency, he had questions about the way it was handled. The offer, he said, came with no advance word to the prisoners, their families or their lawyers. And, he said, it came on the day that he and the Archbishop had scheduled a visit to Vieques, and called it an "attempt to divert attention" from Vieques.
Later, he said he believed that the lack of preparation for the announcement caused the delay in the prisoners' decision to accept the conditions imposed on their clemency, and he said that, in turn, had caused Hillary Rodham Clinton's "confusion" on the issue. Mrs. Clinton had said that the clemency offer should be withdrawn because the prisoners took too long to renounce violence.
Mr. Jackson said Mrs. Clinton would make a "strong candidate" for Senate, but refrained from saying whether he would support her.
The Archbishop, who was a priest at Holy Cross Church in the Bronx in the 1970's and 1980's, called the military activities on Vieques "an offense against the principles for which the United States wishes to stand." He quoted sections of the Roman Catholic catechism to build a case that there is no defense -- including good intentions -- for harming the innocent, and that peace is impossible without justice.
"For these reasons we appeal to principles that surpass all social, political and economic factors," he said. He also earned a wild ovation by striking an overtly nationalist tone, saying in Spanish that all Puerto Ricans, whether in New York or on the island, are "a single family, a single nation." And he referred to the F.A.L.N. prisoners as "political prisoners," and said mercy must go alongside justice and peace.
Afterward, the Archbishop said he was not advocating any particular future for Puerto Rico, a self-governing United States commonwealth that has considered both statehood and independence, both of which were voted down in a recent referendum. Rather, he said, he wanted whatever option the island picked to "foster the national identity of the Puerto Rican people."

HEADLINE: North Korea Said to Agree to End Missile Tests

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
North Korea has tentatively agreed to end its testing of long-range ballistic missiles in exchange for a commitment from the United States and Japan to move forward with economic assistance for the Communist Government there, American officials said tonight.
The agreement, which was reached today in Berlin after five days of negotiations there by American and North Korean diplomats, appears to end the immediate threat that North Korea will test a new long-range missile this autumn. 
 American officials cautioned, however, that the agreement was dependent on what one described as "the always questionable sincerity of the North Koreans," and that North Korea could quickly reverse course and resume tests of its long-range missiles within weeks.
"They could be back in business with the missiles in a hurry," said one Clinton Administration official. "This is one positive step in what has proved to be a long, frustrating process."
The North Koreans have begun preparations for a new test of their latest long-range missile, which is believed to be capable of striking portions of Alaska and Hawaii. Washington officials have been monitoring activities at the North Korean launching site by satellite.
The Japanese have been particularly alarmed by the threat of a new test, because the last long-range missile tested by the Pyongyang Government flew directly over Japan.
The talks in Berlin were being held about the time that the Administration thought the North Koreans might test the new Taepodong 2 rocket. North Korea is marking the 50th anniversary of Communist rule this month, and some analysts had suggested that the missile test would be staged as part of the celebrations.
The United States, South Korea and Japan had shown an unusually high degree of diplomatic coordination in condemning North Korea and pledging to slow down food and oil assistance if the test was carried out. Today, while meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, during the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, President Clinton, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea committed to penalizing North Korea if it conducted the test.
Last month, Japan and the United States also agreed to conduct joint research on a missile-defense system that in theory could destroy ballistic missiles from North Korea.
In June, a United States envoy, former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, laid out proposals essentially offering to lift some trade sanctions and to begin a formal recognition of North Korea in return for a halt to its missile testing and an end to its export of missile technology to the Middle East and Pakistan.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sees U.S. Playing Support Role In East Timor

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Monday, Sept. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that American troops would have a "limited but important function" in the peacekeeping force that Indonesia is reluctantly permitting into East Timor, although Asian officials insist that the United States will inevitably be drawn into a central role if troops are to be inserted quickly enough to stop the killings.
Speaking to reporters at his hotel this morning, Mr. Clinton described an array of tasks for American forces, such as flying troops from several nations into East Timor and supplying them with intelligence reports and communications help. 
 "All of that would require some presence on the ground in East Timor," Mr. Clinton said. But he said that the United States did not anticipate providing ground troops. "The Australians are willing to take the lion's share of the role," he said.
Acknowledging that many of the forces that would be used in East Timor had not trained together as NATO forces did before going to Kosovo this year, Mr. Clinton added, "We might be asked to provide some command and control."
Since Friday, a small team of American military officials from the Pacific Command in Hawaii has been in Australia to develop a plan for moving the peacekeepers into place, perhaps beginning this week.
United States officials say they believe that the American participation can be held to about 600 troops, though Australian officials and Asian diplomats who have been briefed on the plans say they expect the figure to be much higher.
"The assets offered by the Americans are very pleasing to the Australian defense community," John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister, said here, where he has frequently been meeting Mr. Clinton on the sidelines of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
The back-room negotiations over the composition and timing of an East Timor peacekeeping force dominated much of the first day and a half of a summit meeting that is supposed to focus on restarting a series of trade and economic initiatives after the recovery from the Asian financial crisis.
But President Clinton was clearly far more engaged on a host of security issues. On Sunday, he held a three-way meeting with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, jointly committing to penalize North Korea if it conducts a long-threatened missile test and to offer it economic enticements to freeze such tests. Administration officials said that the North Koreans agreed to such a freeze during negotiations in Berlin on Sunday, but the agreement is tentative and does not settle long-term problems between North Korea and Japan and South Korea.
And while Mr. Clinton's security officials were jousting this morning with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, his economic team was engaged in an increasingly complex negotiation with the most populous nation -- China.
On Saturday, Mr. Clinton and President Jiang Zemin agreed that both countries had to plunge into an effort to get China into the World Trade Organization in the next three months. But negotiations on Sunday were fitful, although the Chinese had desperately wanted the deal in April when Mr. Clinton walked away.
This morning, as the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, re-entered meetings with her Chinese counterpart, it looked increasingly unlikely that the major obstacles could be resolved before Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang left New Zealand on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton also met for the first time with the new Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir V. Putin, on Sunday and in an unusually direct acknowledgment, told him that corruption could "eat the heart out of Russian society." Critics of the Administration's Russian policy say those warnings should have been delivered much earlier.
But East Timor has dominated much of the conversation among the leaders of 21 "economies" represented here -- the word is used to allow the participation of Taiwan and Hong Kong -- and Mr. Clinton was awakened at 1 A.M. today to be told that Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie, had finally agreed to allow in the peacekeeping force.
This morning, Mr. Clinton praised several nations that had pressured Jakarta to change its mind. He added, "It's important to get the details worked out and get the force in in a hurry."
Conspicuously absent from his list was America's closest ally in the Pacific, Japan, which is Indonesia's largest supplier of foreign aid. Tokyo had declined to join in threats to cut off aid and other economic ties if Indonesia failed to stop the violence or let in the peacekeepers.
He held open the possibility of lifting the threat of sanctions as soon as Mr. Habibie carried through on the commitments he made Sunday night.
"If that happens," he said, "we can resume our work with the people of Indonesia."
Pentagon officials and diplomats say they expect the force to total about 7,000 troops, though it could take weeks to reach that level. About 4,500 would probably come from Australia, with New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Sweden, France, Britain and Portugal all supplying far more modest numbers.
The United States would provide the aircraft and ships to transport armored vehicles and other equipment to East Timor, and Mr. Clinton suggested this morning that the process could start within days.
In Washington, congressional leaders expressed support as long as the commitment remained limited.
"Obviously what's been happening there is shocking and appalling," said Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader from Mississippi. Speaking on CBS's "Face the Nation," he endorsed American logistical help but said, "If it involved troops on the ground, I think then a lot more questions are going to be asked."

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: SPY KNOWN FOR 30 YEARS -- The Government said that for more than 30 years it had evidence of the espionage activities of Melita Norwood, the 87-year-old woman who admitted giving nuclear weapons research documents to the Soviet Union. Home Secretary Jack Straw said M.I.5 decided not to interview her out of fear of jeopardizing other investigations. It decided seven years ago never to prosecute her, he added. Two other people identified as agents in a book based on K.G.B. files were former Labor M.P.'s, Tom Driberg and Raymond Fletcher, both now dead. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: PROTESTANT PROTEST -- The ruling executive of Northern Ireland's main Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, unanimously condemned the report of an international commission to restructure the province's police service and said it would draw up alternative recommendations. But the 110-member body approved the continued participation of its leader, David Trimble, above, in the review of the deadlocked Northern Ireland peace pact under way in Belfast. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
GERMANY: SCHRODER UNBOWED -- Reeling from defeats in state and municipal elections, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder vowed to press ahead with an unpopular austerity program, involving budget cuts of $16 billion. After several costly months of wavering, he is trying to project the statesmanlike image of a leader prepared to take tough steps for Germany's future economic health. Roger Cohen (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
SRI LANKA: HIGH TOLL IN CLASHES -- In the fiercest fighting in months, 53 soldiers and more than 100 Tamil separatist rebels were killed in the northern Wanni region as the Government began an offensive to expand the territory in its control. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
PAKISTAN: TEST TREATY OPPOSITION -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told the newspaper Dawn that Pakistan will not sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty until the United States lifts all sanctions imposed after Pakistan tested nuclear devices in May 1998. The United States still restricts the sale of military equipment to Pakistan. Celia W. Dugger (NYT)
 
CHINA: 2 OFFICERS REPORTED EXECUTED -- China has court-martialed and executed a general and a colonel for selling state secrets to Taiwan for at least $1.6 million, military officials said. They said retired Maj. Gen. Liu Liankun, 58, was executed by lethal injection in Beijing in August during renewed tension between China and Taiwan. Col. Shao Zhengzhong, 56, was also executed, the officials said. (Reuters)
 
AFGHANISTAN: REPORT ON WOMEN -- The United Nations monitor for violence against women said after a visit to Afghanistan that the Department of the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which applies dozens of prohibitions to women, was "the most misogynist such entity in the world." However, Radhika Coomaraswamy of Sri Lanka saw some improvements, especially in the growth of private home schools and better access to health care. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: EXPULSION VOIDED -- A Supreme Court panel has overturned the February 1998 expulsion of Tom Hansen, an American accused of violating his tourist visa by serving as an observer at Government peace talks with Zapatista rebels. The high court found that his expulsion violated constitutional rights. More than 200 other foreigners have been expelled from Chiapas on similar grounds. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
ECUADOR: 12 FOREIGNERS ABDUCTED -- Eight foreign oil workers, including an American, and four European tourists have been kidnapped by more than 20 armed men in military uniforms near the northern border with Colombia. Ecuadorean Army officials said they suspect a left-wing Colombian guerrilla group may have been responsible, but added that they could not rule out right-wing paramilitary units from Colombia or common criminals. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
ARGENTINA: PROVINCIAL SUCCESS -- Despite running far behind in presidential polls, the governing Justicialist Party has won three of four provincial elections for governor. Victories in La Rioja, Misiones and San Luis were expected, as was an Alianza triumph in Chaco. The results confirm a trend in which the Justicialists will control most provinces no matter who wins the presidential vote next month. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
BELLAMY'S NEW TERM -- Carol Bellamy was appointed to a second five-year term as executive director of Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. Her first term ends in May. Secretary General Kofi Annan said Ms. Bellamy, a former New York City Council president and former director of the Peace Corps, had served "with distinction and devotion." Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: DEFENSE SITES BOMBED -- American warplanes bombed two Iraqi air defense sites in response to antiaircraft fire, the United States European Command in Germany said. The planes bombed an air-defense warning site south of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad, the military said, and bombed an antiaircraft artillery site northwest of Mosul. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: AMERICANS JAILED -- Citing evidence that three Americans had been tortured, a judge gave them unusually light sentences for possessing weapons of war and trying to smuggle guns aboard a plane. The three -- Gary Blanchard, 36, John Lamonte Dixon, 36, and Joseph Wendell Pettijohn, 35 -- were given the same concurrent sentences: six months for possessing weapons of war and 21 months for taking dangerous materials on a plane. They could have been sentenced to life. (AP)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Edges Ahead by 1.90; Technology Issues In Retreat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks ended a lackluster session with mixed results yesterday as investors stepped back from Friday's rally in technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average struggled to a slight gain, but most stocks ended lower as the dollar sank to a three-year low against the Japanese yen.
After shifting in a narrow range for much of the session, the Dow rose 1.90 points, to 11,030.33. 
 Broader stock gauges were lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.53, or 0.5 percent, to 1,344.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 42.29, or 1.5 percent, to 2,844.77.
Traders said investors, who sent the technology-dominated Nasdaq to a record of 2,887.06 on Friday, were ready to take profits yesterday.
"This is a time of constant rotation between sectors," said Robert Freedman, the chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. "We move to a new high, then spend another week or so consolidating before it's another group's turn."
Internet stocks had the steepest declines yesterday, as Yahoo lost 9 3/4, to 160 3/4, and Ebay fell 10 1/16, to 147 15/16.
America Online fell 6 3/16, to 90 1/8. Traders attributed the drop to an article in Barron's magazine in which a short seller -- an investor who bets that the price of a stock will fall -- said America Online's stock price could be cut in half because of price competition.
In a short sale, a trader sells borrowed shares on the expectation the price will fall before the stock has to be repurchased on the open market to replace the borrowed shares.
3Com rose 1 5/8, to 28 7/8, after saying it would spin off its Palm Computing unit, the maker of Palm electronic organizers.
Stocks were also pressured by the latest slip in the value of the dollar. Signs of economic growth in Japan have strengthened the yen, pushing it to more than three-year highs against the dollar.
A weaker dollar can hurt stocks in several ways. For one, it can entice foreign investors in United States stocks to keep their money in investments in their own country. It also makes imported goods more expensive.
Some analysts think higher prices of cars, electronics and other Japanese products could increase the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for a third time this year to keep inflation in check.
Among Dow components, J. P. Morgan was the biggest decliner, shedding 3 1/4, to 124 13/16.
Procter & Gamble fell 1 7/16, to 101 11/16, after announcing plans to form an Internet-based company to sell beauty products.
Other consumer products companies, however, held up well. DuPont rose 2 3/4, to 68 1/2, and Eastman Kodak gained 2 7/8, to 75 15/16.

Treasury Prices Fall
 By Bloomberg News
Bond prices fell yesterday on expectations that further losses in the dollar, already at a three-year low against the yen, will sap international demand for United States fixed-income securities.
"There's a perception problem" when the dollar falls against the yen, said Mike Faust, who manages $400 million in global bonds at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Francisco. The exchange rate is a "proxy for foreign demand" for Treasuries because Japan is the biggest foreign buyer of United States Government bonds.
The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 5/32, to 101 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.05 percent from 6.04 percent on Friday.
The dollar's decline against the yen the last three months has handed Japanese investors in Treasuries losses of 9 percent to 10 percent in yen terms, depending on the maturity of the security. United States investors would have made 1.2 percent to 1.8 percent over the same period.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.822	97.510	High Rate	4.66%	4.92%	Coupon Yield	4.79%	5.13%	Low Rate	4.50%	4.83%	Median Rate	4.64%	4.90%	Total applied for	$27,582,389	$28,329,904	Accepted	$10,165,239	$11,380,904	Noncompetitive	$1,135,237	$1,191,551	

Both issues are dated Sept. 16, 1999. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 16, 1999, and the six-month bills mature on March 16, 2000.

HEADLINE: Capitalizing on Asian Doldrums;
A G.E. Financial Unit Goes Rummaging for Bargains

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Six years ago, GE Capital's Japanese presence consisted pretty much of Taketo Yamakawa, a one-man show in a small office, scrambling to come up with opportunities in a stifled economy.
GE Capital, the biggest and most profitable unit of General Electric, one of America's biggest and most profitable corporations, had just bought a Japanese credit card company that it saw as its gateway to Asia -- and had put Mr. Yamakawa in charge. "I was struggling, trying to identify businesses and companies that GE could do," Mr. Yamakawa recalled. 
 Since then, GE Capital has done plenty. Barely in the time it has taken for Asia to begin to recover from its economic collapse, GE has gone on an acquisition binge that has solidified its position as a global powerhouse, left many of its competitors in the dust and bestowed a much-needed vote of corporate American confidence on the ailing but now improving region.
The last two years alone, it has made at least eight major investments in four Asian countries, expanding its assets to about $20 billion in the region. Acquisitions included two consumer-credit businesses, a life insurance company and a $5 billion leasing company in Japan, a consumer-credit business and a portfolio of car loans in Thailand and a life insurance unit in the Philippines. It also has its sights on a stake in a South Korean bank.
Though its General Electric parent has operated in Japan for more than a century, GE Capital traditionally had been weak in Asia, Japan included. So, company executives began sniffing around the region in the early 1990's with an eye to setting up corporate alliances or building companies from scratch.
Then the 1997 Asian financial meltdown and resulting recession turned the area into a vast bargain basement. Here was GE Capital's chance to buy up distressed companies and establish itself in the one part of the world where it lacked a strong presence.
"There's no question that financial turmoil has resulted in an environment that facilitates deal creation," Denis J. Nayden, president of GE Capital, said in a telephone interview from the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn. "Yes, we have moved into that opportunity."
To be sure, weaving those disparate businesses into the GE corporate net has not been easy. Throughout Asia, and particularly in Japan, culture clashes and resistance to foreign dominance have historically curbed the market for acquisitions, and some companies that have swooped in have crash-landed.
But GE Capital has had a lot of practice in business integration. Over the last 12 years, it has absorbed more than 300 companies, growing into the world's largest nonbank financial institution, with $300 billion in assets. In the process, it has mastered the art of identifying and acquiring underperforming companies and using its management expertise to turn them into moneymakers.
One of the first plums that GE Capital plucked in Japan in the wake of the economic crisis was the consumer-finance business of the Lake Corporation. Mr. Yamakawa, who today oversees GE Capital's consumer-finance operations in Japan, had long been impressed by Lake's lending business but believed its expansion into real estate and stocks was a big mistake.
As the company's financial problems worsened in late 1997, Mr. Yamakawa pounced. Though GE Capital would not say what it paid, it folded Lake's profitable operations -- its 2,800 people, its computer network, its buildings and its customers -- into a new company last year that it named the Lake Company, leaving the golf courses and other sagging properties in the original one.
Mr. Yamakawa then visited as many of Lake's 564 branches as he could, often making the rounds on weekends. He centralized some of the back-office operations and set up a call center, raising productivity and cutting costs. Most important, he brought in discipline -- in planning the business, budgeting for costs and charting out both short- and long-term strategies.
"Generally a Japanese company does not have discipline," Mr. Yamakawa said.
Now, the new Lake wants to become Japan's most efficient, most profitable consumer-finance company. Already, it is achieving double-digit growth, using giveaway umbrellas or lottery tickets to coax 1.5 million customers into transferring their accounts from the old Lake.
Even though Lake charges 27 percent on its unsecured consumer loans, compared with Japanese bank-deposit rates of around three-tenths of a percent, customers are flocking to its automated loan machines. What drives them is the ease of the transactions: if their applications are approved, the machines spew out the cash on the spot. Indeed, borrowers often pick up the cash in the morning and repay in the evening at another machine.
While GE Capital has accumulated an estimated $5 billion in assets elsewhere in Asia, Japan is the main arena of action. Its assets here total around $15 billion, and it has set a target of earning $500 million a year from its Japanese operations within two years, up from last year, though the company refuses to disclose figures. That growth would far outpace the time it took to reach a similar figure in Europe.
Another Japanese prize for GE Capital was a joint venture last year with Toho Mutual Life, an ailing insurer. Basically, GE cherry picked the best employees and most profitable operations and put them into a new company called GE Edison. It then sent in a team headed by one of its integration specialists, Masanori Miyajima, to coach Toho Mutual executives on the "GE way."
Mr. Miyajima introduced the GE practice of using graphs and charts in presentations and explained the principles of Six Sigma, a control management method that GE has embraced for achieving high quality and minimal defects in its products.
The integration team initiated studies of Edison's problems and ways to improve operations. It also helped draw up 90-day, one-year and 18-month plans for restructuring the business, setting the stage for its review process. (Typically, if an acquisition falls short of targets for an 18-month plan, GE concludes that something serious is wrong and reassesses the acquisition.)
By August, GE Capital was examining how to redesign the business practices at Edison's headquarters and at all 56 of its branches. The old system was unwieldy: a customer seeking a benefit payment at a branch office would fill out a form, the office would enter the claim in its computer and then send the form by mail to the head office, which would retype it into its computer.
Mr. Miyajima's group transferred the claims operation to a central location in the city of Yokohama, outside Tokyo. Now, branch offices relay all information to the new customer care center. As a result, said Rone Baldwin, the former president of GE Japan who now runs GE Edison, claims are paid more quickly, productivity has shot up 30 percent and overhead has gone down.
Mr. Miyajima also sought to instill the more informal GE culture at a company that had long been obsessed with protocol. He instituted casual-dress Fridays and instructed employees to dispense with honorifics like "director" and replace them with the simple "Mr."
While the Japanese seemed to adapt to the new openness, their American managers said they had remained vigilant. "I find that a larger proportion of people tend to think in hierarchical kinds of terms," Mr. Baldwin said. "People are sometimes more reluctant to speak up or be aggressive to senior people. I have to engage them more. I always worry more about what I'm not hearing than what I'm hearing."
Mr. Baldwin is trying to change other Japanese habits as well, like the practice of branch managers' greeting him at the train station when he comes to town. He tells them he would rather they stay in the office and work, and his campaign has apparently paid off. A regional manager in Osaka drew cheers from the other participants at a strategy meeting not long ago when he turned to him and said: "Baldwin-san, please understand if I don't escort you back to the train station. I'd rather use the time to work on my strategy plan."
It was a small but significant triumph in GE Capital's effort to instill a global GE culture wherever it goes. Daniel H. Mudd, president of GE Capital Japan, says that driving home its core concepts across its global empire is a key engine for the company's growth.
"Some companies have a very strong financial system that regulates and governs what they do, and some companies have a very strong marketing orientation: Coca-Cola, American Express," Mr. Mudd said. "My own view is that the way GE uses its levers is with culture, the business culture. It's not national culture. It's not an American culture, not an Anglo-Saxon culture.
"The challenge is taking that set of values and keeping their meaning the same, but adapting the interpretation to work in different countries," he added. "We want employees to intuitively share and understand a set of values and that GE culture, whether they're in Mexico, Japan, Spain or the United States."
Sometimes, of course, the GE way can seem downright bizarre to the American company's new Japanese employees. A few months ago, GE Capital held one of its signature let-your-hair-down workout sessions at Japan Leasing, which it acquired late last year for $5 billion. These discussions, aimed at breaking apart a business and drawing up new approaches that focus on the customer, have been a successful tool for integrating Asian businesses into the company, and in this case they led to fiery debate, with sheets of paper covered with captions and colored ink pasted up around the room.
Japanese rarely air their dirty laundry in public, so it was a bit intimidating for Japan Leasing's managers to be summoned to an open forum to discuss what was wrong and how to improve.
"The language of the workout is very new to Japan, and the discussion style is also new to Japanese," said Kohei Tanaka, president of the new Japan Leasing. "When we gave notice to people to please join the workout, people thought, 'What the heck is this thing?' "
Now employees regularly try to break apart the business to find new solutions, and these organized debating sessions are becoming a way of life at Japan Leasing. That is a departure from the old style.
"In Japan, we understand each others' intention, even without saying anything," Mr. Tanaka said. "All employees join the company at the same time in April and midcareer employees are not common. It's a homogeneous culture. The culture is to expect without saying anything."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Yen Hits3-Year High as Bank of Japan Ends Intervention

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Japanese yen resumed its more than two-month rally against the dollar yesterday, jumping 2.2 percent to a three-year high, and analysts said the rally should continue.
Yesterday's surge came after the Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Friday and staved off the rally for a day. The selling of yen for dollars worked for one day only because Japanese officials made clear then that they were not trying to change the direction of the yen. Instead, they were just trying to slow its rise. 
 "Further yen gains are a good bet in the near term," Karen Parker, director of currency research at Chase Manhattan Bank, said in a commentary for clients yesterday morning.
She pointed out that Masaru Hayami, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said that Japan could not move to reverse the direction of the yen without intervention support from the United States. And such support, based on recent comments from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, does not seem likely, she said.
In New York, the yen settled at 106.44 to the dollar, up from 108.81 on Friday. This was the strongest the yen has been since the spring of 1996.
In other currency trading, the dollar was down slightly against the single European currency, which settled at $1.0411, up from $1.0364 on Friday. Setbacks in local elections for Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany knocked the euro lower earlier in the day, but it rebounded. For the year, the euro is still down 10.8 percent.
The rally of the yen has been fueled by the apparent turnaround of the Japanese economy after the longest recession since World War II. As foreign investors have gained confidence about the nation's economic outlook, they have bet that the Japanese stock market would go up. And to buy Japanese stocks, foreign investors have to buy yen, which is pushing its value higher.
So far this year, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 29.4 percent in yen terms after a jump of 1.1 percent yesterday, to 17,909.29.
The changing view of the Japanese economy has been supported by surprising growth figures for the first two quarters of this year. It became harder to dismiss as an aberration the annual growth rate of 8.1 percent in the first quarter after the second-quarter annual growth rate came in at an unexpected nine-tenths of a percent.
But the rising yen also could pose a threat to the economic recovery. As the yen strengthens, it makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad. And these higher prices could cut into sales in this sector that is so important to the overall economy.
The Japanese authorities have worried about this threat, which is why they tried to change the direction of the yen with six big interventions in June and July. But they appear to have given up that strategy, possibly because it is difficult for any government to stand against the movement of its currency if investors around the world are pushing it in one direction.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Ready to Scrap Some North Korea Sanctions

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUCKLAND, New Zealand, Tuesday, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Rewarding North Korea for a tentative agreement to stop testing its new long-range missile, President Clinton said today that he was preparing to lift some of the trade sanctions that have barred commerce with the North for close to half a century.
The move is the first concrete step by Mr. Clinton to begin lifting economic sanctions that have been in place since the Korean War began in 1950. 
 But the gesture revives the question, raised by Congressional critics of the Administration's negotiations with North Korea, of whether the President is rewarding the hard-line Communist Government in Pyongyang for defusing a crisis that it created -- perhaps for negotiating advantage -- when American spy satellites detected that a missile launching appeared imminent.
The agreement on missile testing, disclosed on Sunday, is very limited, far from explicit and of unknown duration. In talks in Berlin with Charles Kartman, the State Department's chief negotiator with North Korea, the North Koreans agreed to suspend long-range missile testing while negotiations are under way on a more permanent ban.
But nothing binds the North to the agreement, other than the fear that whatever sanctions the United States lifts in coming weeks could be reimposed.
The text of a statement released in Berlin makes no clear mention of the missile test ban, saying only that both countries will "endeavor to preserve a positive atmosphere conducive to improved bilateral relations and to peace and security."
But Mr. Clinton, speaking to reporters here this morning before boarding a plane for Queenstown on New Zealand's South Island, said, "We understand and expect North Korea will refrain from testing long-range missiles of any kind while our discussions continue."
He called the tentative accord "an important initial step." In return, he said, he is looking at "easing sanctions" and moving toward a normalization of economic relations.
White House officials, working on the fringes of the Asian economic summit meeting that ended on Monday evening, portrayed the accord as a modest but important victory at a time of sudden instabilty throughout Asia.
"What we feared," one Administration official here said today, "was a new crisis in Korea at the exact moment that there's heightened tension between China and Taiwan and the insertion of peacekeeping troops in Indonesia. That would have been an ugly combination, and we may have ducked it."
Briefing reporters on Monday evening, Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, played down the scope of the sanctions to be lifted.
"Essentially North Korea would be in the same status as Syria," he said, meaning that the types and amount of commerce would still be strictly controlled. In theory the eased sanctions will allow some American companies to invest in North Korea -- though few American companies appear very eager to enter one of the world's last Stalinist nations, and one of the poorest.
State Department officials, speaking in Washington, said it would also be possible to transfer money to North Korea from family members in the United States. Most cash funneled into the country flows through Japan, which has a large Korean population centered in Osaka.
The lifting of the sanctions appears to be the first step in carrying out a strategy developed by former Defense Secretary William J. Perry, acting as a special envoy to North Korea for Mr. Clinton.
The report that Mr. Perry gave to Mr. Clinton has never been made public. But those familiar with it describe a proposal for a finely tuned series of moves to lift sanctions as North Korea begins to freeze its missile arsenal and end sales of missile technology to countries that Washington regards as rogue nations.
A 1994 accord froze activity at North Korea's biggest nuclear weapons plant, but it did not deal with the missiles that could carry small nuclear weapons. Mr. Berger suggested today that if the North Koreans made the moratorium on missile launchings permanent, a greater easing of sanctions could follow.
"If we're going to embark on a different course," he said, "a course which could conceivably lead to a long-term moratorium on a missile program, that suggests the possibility of a different kind of relationship with North Korea.
"Obviously, if that's the case, it's appropriate for us to take some steps which would ease some of the sanctions that we have in North Korea."
He added that "if they tested, obviously we would be going down a different path."
It is unclear how quickly a long-term ban on testing might be negotiated, but past experience with North Korea suggests that it could take years.
South Korea's President, Kim Dae Jung, also here for the economic conference, praised the North Korean commitment and characterized it as a victory for his own "sunshine policy," a series of modest economic openings to the South for North Korea. "We view this as a sign of sincerity in the North," Mr. Kim said.
Japan has been by far the most concerned about another missile test, especially after a previous test, in August 1998, crossed Japanese territory and created a political uproar. Japanese officials were distinctly more muted in their reaction today.
Japan has said it would consider returning to the kind of economic relationship the two countries had before the 1998 launching, but it has offered little else in the way of incentives.
The launching bolstered the position of conservatives in Japan who have long argued for a more robust military. The strong domestic reaction to the missile test last year also cleared the way for Japan to announce that it was joining an American-led project to develop a "theater missile defense" system.
One theory about the new North Korean missile, the Taepodong 2, is that it was invented as a negotiating chip, not as an offensive weapon. Many times in the last decade North Korea has created a crisis, then sought its reward -- usually food aid -- for defusing it.

U.S. Wondering if China Wants a Trade Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: QUEENSTOWN, New Zealand, Tuesday, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Two days after President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China rekindled their relationship and sent their negotiators off to strike one of the world's biggest trade deals, here's what they came up with: Confusion about whether China really wants a deal to enter the World Trade Organization this year and a vague agreement to meet in two or three weeks.
It was not exactly the display of urgent resolve that Mr. Clinton had hoped for when he asked Mr. Jiang to resume the talks immediately, perhaps thinking it was possible to close a deal while the two leaders were still here. And as the negotiators packed up and left New Zealand last night, Mr. Clinton's aides appeared mystified by China's strategy. 
 "No one is quite certain what this is all about," one of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides said, wondering aloud whether the Chinese were posturing, delaying, or had decided that a quickly declining economy at home made this a bad time for Mr. Jiang to allow fierce foreign competition into China's markets. Most theories, however, center on the how China may be seeking to parlay the accidental American bombing of their embassy in Belgrade on May 7 into some valuable trade concessions from the White House.
From the start, the negotiations over the conditions for China to enter the World Trade Organization have been about far more than trade. Its entry is one of the few areas where the United States and China can claim real progress in a relationship hurt by differences over Taiwan's future, charges of spying, and longstanding arguments over human rights.
Mr. Clinton argues that further integrating China into the world economy will force it to operate under global rules, and that if the deal is good enough he can demonstrate the economic benefits for American farmers and workers. Thus, Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Jiang in Auckland was carefully stage-managed to allow both sides to announce a resumption of relations after the embassy bombing.
Both Chinese and American officials described their meeting on Saturday as surprisingly free of rancor, and that China sought no further apologies for the embassy bombing that killed three people.
Two weeks before the meeting, Mr. Clinton sent a letter to Mr. Jiang urging that the two men use the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting here to resume negotiations. The message was reinforced by Senator Diane Feinstein, the California Democrat, who saw Mr. Jiang on a visit to China and told him that if China wanted to get Congressional approval of the deal, he had to act quickly.
"There's an assumption that if Congress can't get this passed before the Presidential election is in sight, it's pretty hopeless," Commerce Secretary William Daley said earlier this week. Next year Mr. Clinton's aides are unlikely to engage in a divisive argument over trade that could once again split the Democratic Party, and further widen a rift between Vice President Al Gore and American labor unions, which are opposed to the deal.
"The Chinese understand the calendar," Mr. Daley said.
They may understand it, but they do not appear driven by it. A round of preliminary negotiations in China last week, and then a second round here between China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, and American Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, never engaged in the substance of the issues dividing the two countries. Those range from American quotas on Chinese textiles, to the rights of foreign auto makers to enter China's markets, to the rules that ban the "dumping" of Chinese goods in the United States.
Even after Mr. Clinton implored Mr. Jiang at their Saturday meeting to start serious negotiations the next morning, the talks wandered in circles, participants say, drifting into differing understandings of what the two sides had already settled in April. In a private aside, Mr. Clinton raised the issue again with Mr. Jiang on Monday.
Mr. Clinton's efforts to implore the Chinese back to the table is a sharp reversal from April, when he walked away from a deal offered during an official visit to Washington by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. At the time he said it was insufficient, although American businesses said they were astounded at the breadth of concessions Mr. Zhu was willing to make at the time. When he returned to China Mr. Zhu was harshly criticized for giving away too much, particularly in telecommunications and agriculture. It is now unclear whether Mr. Zhu's concessions are still on the table, and many in the White House -- including Mr. Clinton himself, some officials say -- now regard the rejection of the deal in April as a mistake.
The head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, sidestepped questions about the talks, telling reporters that "we've decided there is little to be gained by negotiating in public." Other officials spent much of the day yesterday insisting that they never expected a deal would be signed here -- even though several top Administration officials had told reporters, just a few weeks ago, that the talks could be wrapped up in days.
The turn of events has put Mr. Sperling, Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Clinton in an extraordinarily difficult position. All week they appeared to be more eager for China to get into the World Trade Organization than the Chinese are. That is a reversal from April, when China was pressing for admission, and the United States appeared to be insisting on ever-greater concessions.
American officials insist that they will not lower their demands for market openings simply because of the bombing. "It's a strategy I would try as well," one top official involved in the negotiations said today, "but in the end it won't work. And if it keeps us from getting a deal through Congress, it could backfire."
Nonetheless some American officials concede that Mr. Clinton would probably take a deal that was only slightly better than what he walked away from in April. The question now is how long it will take to get both sides to that point.

Japanese Yen Rises 2.2% In a Rally Against the Dollar
The Japanese yen resumed its more than two-month rally against the dollar, jumping 2.2 percent to a three-year high. Analysts said the rally should continue. In New York, the yen settled at 106.44 to the dollar, up from 108.81.
The surge came after the Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Friday and staved off the rally for a day. But the selling of yen for dollars worked for only one day because Japanese officials made clear that they were not trying to change the direction of the yen, only slow its rise. Page C11.

HEADLINE: U.S.-to-Jakarta Messenger: Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
As the violence in East Timor worsened, the Americans relied on one person to deliver a tough message to the Indonesian Government, senior Administration officials said today.
The go-between was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, who dealt on the telephone with his counterpart, Gen. Wiranto, the head of the powerful Indonesian military forces. 
 While President Clinton condemned the Indonesian armed forces' refusal to stop the violence in East Timor, General Shelton spoke three times with General Wiranto, culminating on Friday with what senior officials called an "ugly message."
Using specific and emphatic language, General Shelton said the United States would block the International Monetary Fund from delivering the billions of dollars that Indonesia needs for additional recovery from the Asian economic crisis, senior Administration officials said.
In response, General Wiranto asked the United States to wait 24 hours while he visited East Timor to see whether his army was maintaining order, the American officials said. If he thought the army was lax, General Wiranto promised to ask for international peacekeepers.
Early Sunday morning General Wiranto phoned General Shelton with his report from East Timor, which was not good, and with the news that he was recommending that President B. J. Habibie ask immediately for the outside force.
The Administration decided late last week that it had to step up the pressure on Indonesia, officials said, to counteract a growing perception that the White House was dealing timidly with the crisis to preserve a relationship with Indonesia, a country of 200 million people that has rich natural resources.
"We weren't looking very valiant, and nobody liked that around here," an Administration official and. "Our spine got stiffened."
As Washington shifted from resisting sanctions to making a serious threat to the Indonesian economy, General Shelton relayed the increasingly urgent messages that the Indonesian army had to end the killings and destruction in East Timor. That message was underlined by Adm. Dennis C. Blair, commander in chief of the Pacific command, who traveled to Jakarta.
Now the Pentagon is beginning preparations to provide logistical support, about 150 American troops to work on communications, supplies and intelligence, for a multinational mission for East Timor, and the Administration is arguing that the channel to the Indonesian military speaks to the value of the years of training given to Indonesia's future military leaders in the United States and the millions of dollars in military aid for Indonesia.
"It was a big plus to have someone who could call the Indonesian military," a senior Administration official said. "They were the ones calling the shots. We had a unique asset, and I don't see how our military could have done it without their past history with these generals."
 General Shelton first met General Wiranto when the Indonesian visited Fort Bragg, N.C., in the early 90's. As the crisis deepened and it became clear that only General Wiranto could halt the massacres and destruction to the small territory, and not President Habibie, the Administration looked to the military to convey its messages.
"There's no question that General Wiranto could have turned off the violence much sooner," a senior military official said. "But he and the rest of the Government were waiting to see if their plan to get something less than full independence for East Timor would work."
At the request of the White House, General Shelton placed his first call to General Wiranto last Monday, and he received assurances that with the imposition of martial law in East Timor there would be peace in two days. But when militias and elements of the army continued terrorizing and murdering civilians, Admiral Blair went to Jakarta for a tense 30-minute interview with General Wiranto on Thursday. They allowed no aides in the meeting and spoke in English to avoid the need for interpreters.
Admiral Blair informed General Wiranto that the Administration was cutting off the remainder of American military relations with his country, according to Administration officials, and he left the country, canceling a speech that he was to deliver at a military academy in Bandung.
Two days later, after General Wiranto had traveled to East Timor with a team of diplomats from the United Nations Security Council, he called General Shelton with his decision to yield to international pressure and ask for security forces.
"That was the first credible sign that Indonesia would allow in peacekeepers," said a senior Administration official.

HEADLINE: Investment Manager Faces U.S. Charges Of Bilking Japanese

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
As a global investment manager, Martin A. Armstrong had little trouble selling himself to sophisticated clients overseas. On the strength of an apparently stellar performance record, an impressive Web site and his claims of running one of the world's largest economics advisory firms, he raised more than $3 billion from Japanese companies eager for American-style gains in their portfolios.
Now, those companies are facing giant losses and probably ruing the day they heard of Mr. Armstrong's investing techniques. 
 Mr. Armstrong, 49, chairman of Princeton Economics International Ltd. and its Hong Kong brokerage subsidiary Cresvale International Ltd., surrendered late yesterday to Federal authorities in Trenton and was charged with engaging in an enormous securities fraud that has resulted in more than $500 million in losses to investors.
According to a complaint unsealed yesterday by Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for Manhattan, Mr. Armstrong lied about returns he was generating in his customers' accounts and illegally pooled their money, essentially using funds raised from new investors to pay off older customers. The fraud appeared to be a desperate attempt to hide huge trading losses. Indeed, Mr. Armstrong owes some $1 billion to investors, in both principal and promised gains, prosecutors say. But only $46 million in assets remains in the accounts, they said.
The complaint said fraud occurred in accounts held by the Republic New York Securities Corporation, a subsidiary of the Republic New York Corporation, which also owns Republic National Bank of New York. As the case is sorted out, Republic's planned merger with HSBC of London has been delayed. The bank is conducting an internal investigation into the management of its futures division, operated out of Philadelphia, where the accounts of Princeton Economics clients were held. The shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger has been postponed until Oct. 12.
Karen Ng, a spokeswoman for HSBC in London, declined to comment on whether the new developments would affect the planned merger. A spokeswoman for Republic New York declined to comment. The bank was not charged with any wrongdoing and has suspended two top officials of the securities subsidiary.
The lawyer representing Mr. Armstrong, Marc Durant, a partner at Durant & Durant in Philadelphia, said his client vigorously disputed the accusations and maintained his innocence. "He definitely will fight this," Mr. Durant said. "He disputes how the fiduciary, which was Republic New York Securities, handled the funds and the accounts. He believes he's being made a scapegoat for honest, noncriminal trading losses." Although Mr. Armstrong acknowledges there were substantial losses in the accounts, he disputes prosecutors' figures of $500 million.
The arrest of Mr. Armstrong is the latest piece of a puzzle that began to emerge in May when the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's securities regulator, surprised management of Cresvale's Tokyo offices with an audit of its accounts. Cresvale, which also has offices in London, New York and Sydney, was acquired by Princeton Economics in 1995.
According to prosecutors, Cresvale raised $3 billion from investors on the strength of Mr. Armstrong's fictitious record as a money manager. An April 1998 announcement of a new hedge fund started by Mr. Armstrong, for example, put his firm's investment returns at more than 28 percent a year since 1992. Instead, prosecutors say, Mr. Armstrong lost hundreds of millions in risky currency and commodities trading.
To hide his losses, Mr. Armstrong paid old investors with the proceeds raised by newer clients, a venerable type of fraud known as a Ponzi scheme. It was named for Charles Ponzi, who swindled $15 million from 40,000 people after World War I. The people thought they were investing in postal reply coupons, but Ponzi actually pocketed most of the money, paying early investors with cash from new investors.
Mr. Armstrong of Maple Shade, N.J., was released on $5 million bond on his signature. He did not return a telephone call to his office seeking comment. A secretary at Princeton Economics in Princeton, N.J., said no one was at the office late yesterday afternoon to comment.
Prosecutors say that Cresvale sold what it called Princeton Notes, backed by Princeton Economics, to Japanese companies promising returns of at least 4 percent and the potential for much more. With low interest rates in Japan, the promised returns were attractive. No one outside of Japan, nor any individuals, are known to have invested with Cresvale.
As of late August, there were 113 accounts managed by Princeton Economics. Among the companies that had invested money with Princeton Economics were the Alps Electric Company, the Chudenko Electronics Company and the Gun Ei Chemical Industry Company. Bloomberg News reported yesterday that Alps Electric said it might lose as much as $185 million in the current fiscal year because of its investment with Princeton Economics. Shares of these companies and others that invested in Princeton Notes have fallen in Japanese trading in recent days.
Mr. Armstrong published journals and newsletters on financial subjects, giving him the patina of an intellectual. He was quoted in numerous publications, including The New York Times, on subjects ranging from projections on interest rates to the trading of foreign currencies and other commodities. He was a critic of the European monetary union, and commented on the silver market when Warren E. Buffett was buying silver last year.
In April 1998, he joined Magnum Global Investments to form a hedge fund offering institutions and wealthy investors access to what he called his market-forecasting expertise. A promotion for the hedge fund stated that Princeton Economics could forecast trends on markets more accurately than other managers because of its economic model, "which provides specific forecasting on more than 30,000 economic and financial statistics worldwide." The model predicted the 1987 stock market crash, the 1994 bond crash and the demise of the yen since mid-1995, according to the sales material.
But Mr. Armstrong had had run-ins with regulators before. In 1985, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against Mr. Armstrong and three consulting companies he ran for failing to register as commodity trading advisers and for not maintaining proper records. Two years later, the commission filed a second complaint charging that Mr. Armstrong's company, Economic Consultants of Princeton, misrepresented hypothetical performance results and omitted a required disclaimer in its advertisements.
When he filed to overturn the commission's findings in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Mr. Armstrong said he had begun working at a coin and stamp dealership at age 13. He was a millionaire at 15, according to court documents, and opened his own collectors' store when he was 21. In 1973 he began publishing commodity market predictions as a hobby. The appeals court upheld the commission's ruling; the Supreme Court declined to hear his case.
Mr. Armstrong's link to Republic Securities appears to be James Curley, a director of Cresvale, who was chairman of Republic Securities from March 1994 through June 1996. Since 1994, James Sweeney has been president of Republic Securities. On Sept. 1, Mr. Sweeney and William H. Rogers, president of the firm's futures division, were suspended by the bank pending the outcome of its investigation. The bank is cooperating with Federal authorities.
According to prosecutors, the futures division of Republic Securities was dominated by Mr. Armstrong's trading, accounting for 90 percent of its business. Princeton Economics may have opened accounts at Republic as early as 1995.
Prosecutors say that Mr. Armstrong conducted his fraud with the help of letters on Republic New York Securities stationery from Mr. Rogers; the letters inflated the values of customers' accounts. Authorities allege that when a customer wanted confirmation of his account's value, Mr. Armstrong would figure how much the client should have earned under its agreement with Princeton Economics, then request that Republic Securities issue a letter confirming that amount. Mr. Rogers would then provide Princeton Economics with that letter.
If the actual balance in the investor's account was less than the figure supplied by Princeton Economics, funds from other accounts were generally transferred to cover the shortfall, prosecutors said.
In addition to the criminal charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit yesterday against Mr. Armstrong and Princeton Economics alleging securities fraud. The judge in the case froze the assets of both Mr. Armstrong and Princeton Economics and appointed a receiver for the company. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a complaint alleging that Mr. Armstrong defrauded customers through material misrepresentations. Neither Mr. Armstrong nor his firm were registered as commodity trading advisers, as is required.
Ms. White said, in a statement: "This case should send the clear and concise message that those who commit securities fraud in the United States, even if they use offshore entities and victimize foreign investors, cannot escape responsibility for their actions."

HEADLINE: U.N. MOVING AHEAD TO ORGANIZE FORCE FOR EASTERN TIMOR

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Security Council members worked late tonight on a draft resolution to authorize the use of force in East Timor, and some members assembled troops, ships, advisers and aircraft in preparation to move quickly into the territory to end the violence there.
Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali A. Alatas, told Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Security Council today that his Government would welcome speedy deployment of a multinational force but had some questions about the nationalities of its commander and the troops. 
 The Indonesian President, P. J. Habibie, met today with a United Nations human rights official, who said the Indonesians agreed to the creation of an international commission to investigate possible atrocities in East Timor. Page A16.
 The Security Council was refining a draft from Britain that would mandate troops to control militias that have been terrorizing the East Timorese and driving them from their land. The draft, which the Council is expected to act on in a day or two, indicates that the commander would be an Australian, a decision strongly backed by the United States.
Although Mr. Alatas said Indonesia would place no conditions on the force, he said it would prefer soldiers from members of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Some of those nations, including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, have said they will take part. British Gurkha troops based in Brunei are also on call.
For many Indonesians, however, Australia is a provocative and politically explosive choice to lead the troops because it has been a strong supporter of East Timorese independence leaders in the past and the two countries had very rocky relations until relatively recently. Some Council members also have qualms about the choice, a diplomat said.
In Darwin, an Australian port 250 miles from East Timor, preparations for action already have begun, with the Australians apparently confident they will lead the force.
Australia has appointed a commander, Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, a Vietnam War veteran, and is assembling ships, helicopters and a high-speed catamaran capable of carrying more than 500 troops. France has sent four military officers to advise the Australians, and 10 American military experts are in Darwin to help draw up plans.
A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, said the United States is preparing to use cargo planes to transport troops and equipment, but had not selected ships or soldiers for duty.
The Council appears united on the need for a quick deployment to restore order in East Timor; on Tuesday in Dili, the United Nations closed its besieged compound there and, with Jakarta's permission, began evacuating 1,300 refugees hiding there to Australia.
After selecting a commander, the Council is unlikely to specify the number or nationalities of soldiers in the force, leaving those decisions to the countries contributing troops.
In Jakarta, nationalists are demanding that no Americans, New Zealanders or Portuguese take part. Portugal was the former colonial power in East Timor, and Americans, New Zealanders and other non-Asians are apparently viewed as prejudiced against Indonesia.
One diplomat suggested that Indonesia's long years under often harsh Dutch rule left a legacy of revulsion against European domination that explains the persistent racial subtext in the debate about peacekeepers.
Secretary General Annan told the Council today that Indonesian "sensitivities" had to be taken into account, diplomats said.
"We didn't come here to prevent any country from participating," Foreign Minister Alatas said, but he hinted broadly that the issue should be weighed. "It is up to the countries themselves to consider whether it is appropriate, whether their presence would or would not exacerbate the situation."
Mobs in Indonesia have been attacking Australian diplomatic and trade missions during the last week, including an attack today on the office of the representative of Western Australia in Surabaya. Mr. Alatas called the demonstrations responses to protests at Indonesian consulates and its Embassy in Australia, which he said cannot get basic supplies.
Despite the outside chance that mounting political pressures will cause President Habibie to balk, diplomats here were relieved to hear Mr. Alatas's message today and are more or less optimistic.
"I'm not sure if I'm optimistic or pessimistic," Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative to the United Nations, said in an interview after the Council meeting. But he said he saw no real opposition to quick action, and he marveled at the speed with which the situation had turned around.
"Forty-eight hours ago we were looking at the worst," he said. "Twenty-four hours ago we were trying to parse the meaning of Habibie. Now we're working on implementation. That's a pretty impressive record for the Security Council and for Kofi. So far, even if we got there too slowly, the last 48 hours have been a major step forward."
Portugal's envoy, Antonio Monteiro, said he welcomed Mr. Alatas's assurances that he would not set conditions. "We are very encouraged," he said.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative and one of five envoys sent to Indonesia last week to urge the Government to accept outside help in East Timor, said today on his return that he thought Government officials had underestimated the scale of the crisis. The week of violence by pro-Indonesian forces was set off by a vote for independence by the territory's population.
Mr. Alatas told reporters today that while he would like more discussion on the composition of the force, "what is important is that Indonesia would like to see this security cooperation, the sending of a force, as soon as possible."
He said an international peacekeeping force had been authorized under a May 5 agreement on the future of East Timor, but only in the third phase of the process, after the Indonesian Parliament had ratified the referendum results, probably in November, and the United Nations took over administration of East Timor until the new country's first elections. Until the parliamentary ratification, Indonesian troops were supposed to be responsible for law and order.
"Now, however, the situation is different," Mr. Alatas said.
Setting up a multinational force with Security Council backing rather than an full-dress United Nations peacekeeping operation is essential to the Clinton Administration because of Congressional restraints on any American role in the latter type operation and on payments for such operations. A Security Council force does not require Congressional notification and the bills for it go to the countries involved.
One unknown factor in the Indonesian political environment is the attitude of Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose party came in first in Indonesian parliamentary elections in June (but did not gain a majority). Ms. Megawati initially opposed allowing the East Timorese to vote on their future in a referendum.
Although she later seemed to soften that view, the Security Council mission that visited Indonesia last week said she again criticized President Habibie strongly for agreeing to sign the May 5 agreement with Portugal and the United Nations. She told the team that President Habibie's "legitimacy as leader of Indonesia was fading away."
Mr. Habibie, like Ms. Megawati, is a likely candidate for the presidency when a choice is made by indirect election through the parliament later this year. She could attract support in the armed forces and other strongly nationalist groups.
It is not inconceivable, some United Nations officials and diplomats say, that a strong nationalist tide could undo the East Timor agreement, or at least weaken it and allow a civil war to break out.
Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the rebel leader known as Xanana, told the Security Council mission last week that the conditions for an outbreak of fighting between his forces and the Indonesian Army already existed.

HEADLINE: India Can Make Room To Embrace the New

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Sept. 10 front-page article reports that the campaign for the Indian parliament by N. Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, one of India's largest and poorest states, raises doubts whether the attempts at modernization by a progressive politician like Mr. Naidu can coexist with the "mostly rural, illiterate" people he represents. 
 Similar doubts were raised when Norman Borlaug, a farm scientist and Nobel laureate, ushered in the "Green Revolution" in India in the late 1960's. However, tradition-bound farmers in India quickly adapted to the concepts of modern scientific farming advocated by Dr. Borlaug, raising grain production by many millions of tons.
Much of the credit for the increasing growth rate of India's gross domestic product goes to the "rural, illiterate" farmer. He knows how to do his job, and in time he will learn enough about the computer revolution and what it can do for him.

U.N. Readies Resolution On Peacekeepers for Timor
The United Nations Security Council worked late into the night on a draft resolution to authorize the use of force in East Timor while member countries were assembling troops, ships, advisers and aircraft in preparation to move quickly. A1 

Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that President B. J. Habibie of Indonesia had agreed to the creation of an international commission to investigate possible atrocities in East Timor. A16
 
Clinton Administration officials said that as the violence in East Timor worsened the United States relied on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, to deliver a tough message to the Indonesian Government. A16
 
Scores Die in Moscow Blast
Another major explosion demolished an apartment building, killing at least 95 people as they slept. While no group took responsibility for the blast, Russian authorities said that it was the work of Islamic militants who had taken their war in the Caucasus to Russia's capital. A1
 
Another Quake Hits Turkey
A severe tremor shook the region of Turkey where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago, this time killing at least seven people and injuring hundreds. An observatory put the magnitude of the quake at 5.8. A3
 
Trouble Brews in Kosovo
NATO's Supreme Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, said groups of Serbian paramilitaries were infiltrating back into Kosovo from Serbia, apparently bent on causing trouble three months after Serbian forces withdrew from the province. A3
 
U.S. Evidence Against Iraq
The United States, which is seeking to force a new weapons inspection program on Iraq and to convince governments to retain tough economic sanctions on the country, said that it had new evidence showing that President Saddam Hussein had spent money to build a sprawling amusement park instead of feeding hungry Iraqis. A8
 
Clinton Bargains With Korea
President Clinton said that he was preparing to lift some of the trade sanctions that have barred commerce with North Korea since the Korean War began in 1950, rewarding the country for a tentative agreement to stop testing its new long-range missile. A14
 
Mideast Negotiations Begin
Israeli and Palestinian authorities began what both sides said should be the final but most difficult round of their protracted negotiations, six years to the day after Yasir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin agreed on a blueprint for peace.

Internal F.B.I. documents disclosed by a Democratic lawmaker show that information about the use of combustible tear-gas canisters in Waco in 1993 has sat in the Justice Department's files for years and was even sent to Congress no later than 1995. The documents may alter the dynamics of the renewed outcry over the Branch Davidian siege. A1
 
A report released by the Texas Rangers will not definitively answer some questions about the Branch Davidian siege, but it makes plain the awkward role facing the Rangers as other investigations of the events get under way. A21
 
G.O.P. Alert to Buchanan Risk
Despite entreaties, top Republican officials seem all but resigned to the likelihood that Patrick J. Buchanan will bolt from the Republican Party and seek the Presidential nomination of the Reform Party, a move they fear could drain votes from the eventual Republican nominee. A1
 
Nervously Tracking a Storm
A hurricane that meteorologists said was four times the size of the infamous Andrew and potentially even more destructive pounded toward Florida, forcing at least a million people from their homes and leaving countless residents to hope that the massive storm would somehow pass their cities by.

HEADLINE: Mother of 3 Is Charged in Daughter's Death

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A 21-year-old Brooklyn woman was charged yesterday with killing one of her three small children, a bruised and battered 2-year-old girl who apparently had borne the brunt of her mother's secret abuse for a long time until Sunday night, when she fell unconscious after another beating and died, city officials said.
The mother, Venisha Clarke, of 600 Park Place, who has a record of petty theft but no record of child abuse, was charged with second-degree murder after an autopsy found that her daughter, Rickiana Campbell, had died of "child abuse syndrome," the cumulative effects of severe and repeated beatings. 
 Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for New York City's Chief Medical Examiner, said the autopsy showed that the child had suffered a skull fracture and other injuries, including broken bones and bruises, that had been inflicted over many weeks or months and were "in various stages of healing."
Neighbors and a sister of Ms. Clarke in a rundown, four-story walk-up on the border of Prospect Heights and Crown Heights were stunned over the child's death and the mother's arrest. They said Ms. Clarke seemed a devoted if frustrated mother, pregnant with a fourth child and apparently overwhelmed by the problems of single parenthood and poverty.
While neighbors had not detected signs of child abuse, several recalled that Rickiana had worn long, concealing dresses and long-sleeved shirts throughout the burning summer, while her brothers and the other children playing on the sidewalk had worn shorts and T-shirts. Others remembered that she had become increasingly quiet and withdrawn.
"We were shocked," a neighbor, Lisa Johnson, 28, said. "Nobody knew she was beating the child. We knew the little girl wore long dresses during the summer and long-sleeved shirts, but we just thought that was how she dressed."
Ms. Clarke's sister, Simone Thompson, who lives in the same building, said that after Rickiana died Sunday evening, the police showed her pictures of the child's battered body. "I never saw the bruises before," she said. "So when they showed me the pictures last night, it was shocking. My sister is a happy person and a good mother. I don't know what happened."
Ms. Clarke's two other children -- a boy nearly 4 years old and a 10-month-old boy -- bore no signs of physical abuse and were placed together in a foster home yesterday by the Administration for Children's Services, according to Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the city agency, which has a broad mandate to protect children from abuse and neglect in New York City.
Ms. Falk said that Ms. Clarke had never been reported as a child abuser, but had come to the agency's attention in early 1998, when she had to serve 38 days in jail at Rikers Island for shoplifting and asked a friend to care for the two children she then had -- her son and daughter -- in her absence.
The friend, however, was arrested for beating the children and was herself sent to Rikers Island. The children, who came under the jurisdiction of the city, were placed in foster care and were returned to Ms. Clarke after she completed a course in parenting skills in June 1998.
The boy, Ricardo, known as Bobby, was returned to Ms. Clarke in November 1998, and the daughter, Rickiana, was returned to her in February. The youngest boy, Paul, was born in November, according to Ms. Falk, who did not provide the names of the children, although neighbors of Ms. Clarke did.
"We had no indication that this woman ever abused her children," Ms. Falk said, "only that she had perhaps neglected them by leaving them with someone incapable for caring for them."
According to the city's most recent count, 36 abused or neglected children who had been identified in reports to the children's services agency died last year, up from 30 children in 1997 and 24 in 1996. The numbers, Ms. Falk said, include suicides and deaths attributed to accidents and illness, as well as homicide, and not all of those children were slain by persons known to the agency, which investigates 51,000 reported cases of child abuse or neglect annually.
Ms. Clarke, an unemployed welfare recipient who paid $750 a month for a two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a gloomy brick building, had a record of five convictions for shoplifting, and neighbors said she had tried to make ends meet by stealing clothing from shops and selling it on the street. Her children had different fathers, but none lived with her, the neighbors said.
Ms. Johnson recalled that Ms. Clarke had seemed to turn her life around after emerging from Rikers Island early last year. "After she came out of jail, she seemed to go straight," Ms. Johnson said. "She was always with the kids, always seemed to be very attentive."
It was unclear when the abuse of Rickiana began, although the long dresses and long sleeves had been worn all summer, the neighbors said. It was also unclear when the skull fracture was inflicted.
But about 3 P.M. on Sunday, the police said, Ms. Clarke called 911 to report that Rickiana had lapsed into unconsciousness. Valerie Fletcher, 48, a resident of the building whose grandchildren played with Ms. Clarke's children, recalled that the police and paramedics arrived almost simultaneously and went up.
She said the paramedics carried the little girl out and put her in an ambulance, while Ms. Clarke was taken out and put in a police car. "First I saw her with the police, and she seemed so calm," Ms. Fletcher said. "But then as they took her away, I could tell she was crying."
Rickiana was taken to Methodist Hospital, but never recovered consciousness. She was pronounced dead about 6 P.M. Confronted with pictures of her daughter's body, Ms. Clarke acknowledged, investigators said, that she had beaten the girl.
Why it had happened was anybody's guess.
"She had three kids and she was pregnant with another," Ms. Johnson said. "I think she was overwhelmed taking care of her kids, and with another on the way it may have been too much to handle. She didn't have a husband or a mother who could help her. It could send someone over the line."

HEADLINE: Going Beyond the 'Wow' Factor on Giant Screens

BYLINE: By PETER M. NICHOLS 

 BODY:
Shot with a 70-millimeter camera and chockablock with spectacular adventure and nature scenes, the giant-screen movie has become a hugely popular fixture at 300 specially equipped theaters worldwide, but it is experiencing an identity crisis.
Should the films be devoted only to outsize visual effects or should they also be built around story lines? 
 Can the entertainment values of the commercially shown giant films be retained in educational films shown in museums and other institutions?
These are among the issues being discussed this week at one of the more sedate movie conventions of the year, one held by the international Giant Screen Theater Association around Manhattan and at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, a major site for showing large-format movies. The convention, which ends today, has attracted 1,000 delegates, conservatively dressed, eminently civil and concerned about the future of a medium that has recently taken off commercially.
Movies like "Everest," which has earned $91 million, an unprecedented amount for a giant-screen film, have put a Hollywood spin on a field that has always enjoyed a rather documentarylike gentility.
"There's great growth in the commercial area and also in the institutional, though that's a bit slower," said Jim Marchbank, the association's president and chief executive of Science North, a science center in Sudbury, Ontario. "Many more films are being made for both segments, and more films will cross over."
Giant-screen movies, like those shown at the Sony Imax theater in Manhattan, have been around for about 30 years. Traditionally they have been designed for either commercial or institutional audiences, although the occasional film appeals to both. Each year about 20 films are released, all running 40 to 45 minutes for fast audience turnover.
The large screen, which can be six stories high, lends itself to spectacle, which in turn calls for dazzling clarity and stupendous sound. Many films have nature motifs: "Africa: The Serengeti," "The Living Sea," "Island of the Sharks." Others are about adventure and sports: "Everest," "Olympic Glory," "Extreme" (about extreme sports). But filmmakers are wondering if they should be delivering more narrative with the grand sights.
The conference has attracted producers, distributors and representatives of museums, science centers and theater chains. While they are a far cry from their hard-partying, rabidly self-promoting counterparts at standard festivals, their goals are similar. They have come to discuss and pitch projects, attend screenings of a dozen films, take part in workshops, and schmooze about the complications of making movies, sometimes in 3-D, for soaring vertical or domed screens in auditoriums so steeply pitched that viewers can get vertigo.
Producers of such movies earn much less from box office revenues than do conventional filmmakers. Institutions use the films as fund-raisers and keep much of the proceeds. And while directors are not working with stars like Tom Cruise, costs are high. "Prints are about $100,000 U.S. a minute," said Mr. Marchbank.
Being in the field with a 70-millimeter camera is not a relaxing experience. "I'm daunted by the difficulties," said Tim Liversedge, whose production company is close to the Okavango swamps in Maun, Botswana. He has made standard wildlife films for the BBC and National Geographic, and now, attracted by the growing audience for giant-screen movies, he is trying the 70-millimeter format. In keeping with the trend, he would like to stir some dramatic narrative into the action. "I want to tell the story of the region," he said.
One problem faced by filmmakers like Mr. Liversedge is the camera, which weighs almost 90 pounds and is not exactly geared for quick strikes in the bush. Also, there is only one camera, not three as there are on many wildlife shoots. A film cartridge lasts only three minutes, making it tricky to reload at a crucial moment. On top of this, the camera sounds like a small motor, thereby announcing itself to wary beasts. Finally, filming doesn't begin until eight seconds after the camera has been rolling, by which time the animal could be in the next game park.
Working with conventional equipment, Mr. Liversedge said, it takes years to complete a nature film, mainly because of uncooperative animals. He hesitated to guess how long it would take with a 70-millimeter camera.
Well, they took a camera up Mount Everest, didn't they?
"Everest doesn't move," Mr. Liversedge said.
Along with the nature films, there has been a recent influx of biographical and historical films with dramatic themes. Large-screen movies experience their identity crisis most when visual spectacle meets story line. As productions grow more ambitious, they run the risk of overstepping themselves. Dramatic scenarios often are not effective with audiences conditioned to seeing roller-coaster rides, bounding lions, 40-foot waves and crashing avalanches.
"The primary aspect has to be entertainment," said Greg MacGillivray of MacGillivray Freeman Films, which made "Everest" and other films. "The audience pays a lot of money for their tickets and for a short amount of time they want a unique entertainment they can't get elsewhere."
The entertainment factor is important to museums, as well. The institutions charge a healthy admission fee for giant-screen movies, deriving important revenue from them and raising money that often helps finance new films. "It's possible for films to have high educational and entertainment value," said Mr. Marchbank of Science North. "If people aren't having fun, they aren't learning."
In museums, a film must both entertain and educate. For example, Science North was the co-producer of "Gold Fever," which chronicles the Klondike gold rush and examines the cultural and economic significance of gold. A film like that is not likely to show in a commercial theater. But often the distinction is not so clear-cut. "Some of these films are neither fish nor foul. They don't fulfill either market," said Truett Latimer, president of the Houston Museum of Natural Science.
The Houston Museum produced "Alaska: The Spirit of the Wild," which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1998. Mr. Latimer is a keen appraiser of the emerging scene in giant movies. "You see the Hollywood types drawn by the grosses 'Everest' makes, not realizing what the economics are," he said. Or that lions don't like multiple takes.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
A company aims to make it easier for executives to work while flying around in corporate jets.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
ON occasions when retired chief executives and other corporate bigwigs run into one another, they seldom talk about how they miss the old grind at the office. But they can get downright teary when they talk about how much they miss that lovely airplane.
The corporate jet is the perk of perks for business travelers. If you've flown in one -- soaring at a turbulence-free 50,000 feet near the speed of sound, breathing abundant fresh air in a cabin as comfortable as a living room, able to leap from exit door to car without making that death march through some vast dingy airport -- you know why there are 8,000 corporate jets now under registry. Or why there is an industry backlog of several years for new orders for most top models. And other companies are creating a big new market by acquiring a supply of corporate jets and essentially dispatching them, like airborne rental limousines, to customers who buy shares in the venture. 
 A good many working stiffs, including those who fly first and business class but most especially the ones wedged into coach on those eight-hour flights, obviously resent the fact that the boss might travel in such luxury, without having to deal with passive-aggressive flight attendants, in a Gulfstream V that set the stockholders back about $40 million. But for the sake of argument, assume that flying the brass in a private jet makes economic sense to many companies whose executives' time means real money. Shouldn't the stockholders at least expect the boss to work at something more important that the games on his laptop while traveling in such comfort?
"No matter where you sit on a commercial plane, that trip from New York to Los Angeles uses up basically the whole day," said Dennis Ferguson, the president of a company called Airshow Inc. that is the major supplier of flight-information systems to corporate jets.
The most familiar of these systems is the in-flight map display, a video screen that shows topographical maps of the ground below superimposed with the airplane's present position, course, speed, altitude and estimated arrival time.
Though some executives say they can watch this gizmo for hours, mesmerized as it depicts them soaring over the earth, that's pretty old technology. At the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York recently, Mr. Ferguson and the company's vice president for business development, Patrick Flynn, were talking about new technology, including a system that allows the so-called information superhighway to start finding its way into the skies and keeping the tycoon actively on the job.
For years, corporate and other aircraft have had systems that can receive television signals from satellites, though the service usually works only when flying over land. But Airshow recently introduced a product, Network '99, that collects and transmits real-time, customized textual information, including news, financial and market data, as well as E-mail and other text messages, to specific aircraft from the company's headquarters in Tustin, Calif.
The system is still in its infancy because of current bandwidth limitations on the transmission to text. But that's changing, and in a few years, the corporate jet, and commercial planes as well, could be fully linked not only to on-ground data banks but to to the Internet, with companies like Airshow acting as information providers as well as distributors.
Getting this technology to fly means that Airshow has to keep track of where all those company planes are in the air at any given time. This raises issues of both logistics and security.
Mr. Ferguson says he has that covered. He used to run a company in Chicago that provided high-security limousine transportation for corporate clients.
"I see corporate travel as a security issue as well as an information issue," he said.
 
Not So Fast
There was a flurry of dissenting reader responses to an item in this space two weeks ago about the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Inspass system, which is designed to allow frequent business travelers at selected airports to bypass long immigration lines by scanning a card and their hand through a machine. The I.N.S. said that the system hadn't expanded as quickly as anticipated because international business travelers didn't seem to be aware of how easy it was to get and use the pass (the only requirement is two or more international business trips a year).
"Easy my foot!" one executive hooted. "Every time I've tried to use mine, the system has been down, and that means you go to the end of the immigration line. Then, seeing that you tried to use the pass, the immigration officer can get surly, because the pass represents a threat to his job. I let my pass expire because it wasn't worth the trouble."
Another caller said that the airport I.N.S. offices to apply for the cards were not open at convenient times -- "not even the hours they have posted," he said.
The I.N.S. did not return a phone call yesterday asking for comment on these complaints.

HEADLINE: Trading With China

 BODY:
Relations between the United States and China, which lurch from crisis to friendship to crisis, appear to be at least temporarily back on a positive footing. On Sunday President Clinton and Jiang Zemin, the Chinese President, gave a welcome nudge to negotiators to complete a broad agreement enabling China to enter the World Trade Organization, possibly before the organization's meeting in Seattle in November. It is not clear how quickly China wants to close a deal. But bringing China into the global trading community will yield big dividends, and the Administration should make a maximum effort to conclude an agreement.
Arrangements for Chinese entry into the W.T.O. were supposed to have been announced in April during the American visit of Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. But because of last-minute political pressure from Congress, where antipathy toward China runs high, the Administration backed away. Its failure of nerve embarrassed the Chinese and proved costly. Valuable negotiating time was lost because China stopped its talks with the United States in protest over the accidental bombing of its embassy in Belgrade in May. China may now be trying to use the bombing incident to squeeze more trade concessions from Washington. In addition, the recent disclosures about possible espionage and China's bellicose language directed at Taiwan have made it hard to get the talks started again. 
 Some parts of the American economy, including textiles, are bound to suffer from increased Chinese competition. On the positive side, American farmers, investment firms, telecommunications and other businesses will gain from greater market access in China. The whole world would benefit by China's agreeing to adhere to the openness, fair access and rules for the resolution of disputes embodied in the W.T.O.'s charter.
Whatever happens, the issues raised by trading with China are certain to have repercussions in American politics. Patrick Buchanan, the most vociferous advocate of protectionism in the Republican field, has vowed to make China a major issue if he bolts the party and runs as an independent on the Reform Party ticket. Many Republicans in Congress also want to punish China for its alleged espionage at American nuclear laboratories, its threats of military action against Taiwan and its crackdown on dissidents. On the Democratic side, many union leaders are pressing Congress to reject a trade agreement. The unions are also demanding that both Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley take a more skeptical view of China than President Clinton has.
There is ample reason to be wary of Chinese intentions. Bellicose statements from Chinese leaders on Taiwan have been troublesome, and their intolerance of dissent has been repugnant. The charges of espionage, though not yet proved, have alarmed many. China may also be reluctant to make last-minute concessions necessary to get a trade deal. But for Americans to reject a trade agreement that benefits everyone is misguided. Provided China meets all the conditions, a deal could actually improve the possibility of dialogue on other contentious issues.

The House International Relations and Senate Foreign Relations committees announced that they would hold separate, wide-ranging hearings later this month about American policy toward Russia. The House Banking Committee said hearings it had previously announced would begin on Sept. 21 to examine allegations of Russian corruption and money-laundering, possibly including the diversion of billions of dollars in international aid. 
 The Joint Economic Committee, a leading critic of the International Monetary Fund's lending practices, especially to Russia, announced that it would review the fund's plan to create a financial mechanism to derive income from gold it owns.
The volleys fired from Capitol Hill left no doubt that Republican leaders intend to use the economic turmoil and widening reports of corruption in Russia as a campaign issue against Democrats through the 2000 elections. "The Clinton Administration's Russia policy is the greatest U. S. foreign policy failure since Vietnam," declared Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader. "The stated purpose of the Clinton-Gore policy was to help Russia become a peaceful and productive free-market democracy. Instead, Russia has become a looted and bankrupt zone of nuclearized anarchy."
Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, accused the Administration of blocking a domestic tax cut bill at the same time United States aid to Russia was being "stolen by Russian thieves."
Mr. Armey, Mr. DeLay and other House Republicans spoke to reporters moments after the House approved a measure, 419 to 0, to punish foreign enterprises or institutions, especially from Russia, that provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran.
Congress has expressed growing alarm at Iran's drive to build long-range missiles that could hit American troops and allies, and frustration with Russia for failing to curb the export of missile know-how. Mr. Clinton, who vetoed a similar bill last year, has said the legislation could further strain relations with Russia.
Democrats counterattacked throughout the day, accusing Republicans who are trying to link Vice President Gore to the failure of economic reform in Russia of political opportunism.
"I'm sure there have been some mistakes made," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader. "But we've been trying to help Russia get through the extremely difficult transition from communism to capitalism. If the alternative is to stand to one side, do nothing and hope Russia figures it out on its own, then that is a mistake."
A spokesman for the National Security Council, David C. Leavy, defended the Administration's Russia policy, citing advances in individual liberties for Russians, nuclear arms reductions and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Central and Eastern Europe.
Frank Luntz, a leading pollster, criticized the congressional Republican strategy. He said the Russian banking scandal does not yet affect "Americans in their day-to-day lives." He added, "If Republicans are trying to draw a political connection now, it ain't there."
No evidence has surfaced so far of the laundering of siphoned aid provided by the United States or the I.M.F., but the Administration remains politically vulnerable on the issue. Administration officials are likely to be grilled on what they knew of a Justice Department inquiry into Russian corruption before the investigation became public, and what steps they took to pressure Moscow to combat corruption.
Russian and American investigators met today in Washington, largely to discuss the money-laundering accusations, a Justice Department official said.
In addition to the Russian scandal, critics of the I.M.F. got added ammunition today in the form of an independent report commissioned by the monetary fund on its efforts to analyze economic conditions around the world. Although it praised the quality of the fund's work in many areas, the report found that the I.M.F. had failed to anticipate the severity of the Asian financial crisis and did not foresee the degree to which problems in one country could spill over into others.
The fund published a response today defending its research but acknowledging that it could make improvements.

HEADLINE: Study Says Overweight Adults Push Up Cost of Health Care

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Spending on health care for the growing number of adults who are seriously overweight accounts for almost one-third of the national cost of treating 15 important diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and hypertension, the Lewin Group, a health care research and consulting group, said yesterday.
The study was commissioned by the American Obesity Association, which urges the Government and private employers to give more attention to problems of people who are overweight. 
 Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are the main medical risks for the obese, which describes one in five Americans. They are also vulnerable to getting arthritis, several types of cancer, kidney, gallbladder and liver disease, the Lewin study said. "The country has been in denial about the whole obesity issue," said Morgan Downey, executive director of the American Obesity Association. "In a full employment economy, the work force is getting heavier and heavier," he said, and "blood pressure, diabetes and stroke are quickly becoming problems for younger and younger people."
The growing costs of treating these conditions "are going to frustrate almost all the efforts to control health care costs," Mr. Downey said.
The Lewin study said the cost of all treatments for obese adults would be $238 billion in 1999, including $102 billion for the 15 diseases and $136 billion more based on their chances of getting other ailments.
The study did not include $33 billion in annual spending on weight-loss products or indirect costs attributed to overweight workers, such as lost productivity and absenteeism that earlier studies said exceeded $47 billion in 1995.
Government experts have defined obesity as a body mass index -- a weight-to-height relationship -- of 30 or higher: for example, 180 pounds at 5 feet 5 inches, 209 pounds at 5 feet 10 inches or 221 pounds at 6 feet.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Posted Gain Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales surged in August as people bought up cars and clothing, Government figures showed today, indicating optimism about an economy that is closing in on a record expansion.
Sales grew 1.2 percent last month, to $252.4 billion, Commerce Department figures showed. The increase was almost double what analysts had expected and the biggest jump in six months. It also followed a 1 percent increase in July that topped the initial estimate of a rise of 0.7 percent. 
 "People are feeling very confident about their job and income prospects, so they're continuing to spend," said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Apparel sales rose for the first time in three months as back-to-school sales lured buyers. Auto sales last month reached their highest level in almost 13 years, aided by manufacturer discounts.
The biggest sales increase occurred among durable goods, which include autos, appliances and furniture. The August rise of 1.8 percent came after a gain of 1.7 percent the month before. Sales of nondurable goods like groceries and gasoline rose 0.7 in August after a 0.5 percent increase in July.
Excluding automobiles, the retail sales increase was seven-tenths of a percent. Analysts had expected a seven-tenths of a percent increase in overall retail sales and a four-tenths of a percent gain in sales excluding autos.
A separate Commerce Department report showed that the United States trade deficit in goods, services and investments widened to a record $80.7 billion in the second quarter from $68.7 billion in the first quarter. The increase reflected Americans' growing appetite for imported goods.
The report also showed that purchases of United States stocks, bonds and real estate by international investors rose 171 percent in the second quarter, to $241 billion from $88.9 billion in the first quarter. Foreign direct investment increased 417 percent, to $118.6 billion in the second quarter from $22.9 billion in the first quarter.
The retail sales report will figure in deliberations over the need for a third increase in interest rates when Federal Reserve Board officials meet on Oct. 5. They have raised the overnight bank loan rate twice the last two months to keep inflation from accelerating.
"Certainly the strength in August retail sales increases the odds" for another rate increase, said Dana Saporta, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: CURRENCIES;
Japanese Again Intervene, But Fail to Brake Yen's Rise

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 14

 BODY:
The Japanese central bank sold yen today for the second time in less than a week in an effort to curb the currency's recent heady rise, but the intervention barely managed to nudge the yen off its three-year high against the dollar.
The Japanese authorities seemed more alarmed by the speed of the yen's appreciation -- nearly 5 percent in the last week -- than in the rise itself, even as economists began wondering aloud whether a stronger yen might stifle the little vitality that a long-moribund Japanese economy is starting to exhibit. 
 "I guess I have mixed feelings about it," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities Japan.
Those most likely to complain are the giant Japanese exporters, whose products become more expensive abroad when the yen gets stronger. But they have been remarkably silent on the matter.
In fact, the Honda Motor Company and the Toyota Motor Corporation both said this week that they hope to substantially increase their sales in Europe -- where the yen lately has risen even more steeply against the sagging euro -- suggesting that their strategic planning pays little heed to currency fluctuations.
Toshiba did push its earnings estimates down on Monday, but attributed that to falling semiconductor prices, shortages of components it uses in manufacturing personal computers and restructuring charges rather than to the yen's strength.
Toyoo Gyohten, a senior economic adviser to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, likes to note that a stronger yen also means that Japanese manufacturers pay lower prices for raw materials and components. And to the extent that a stronger yen means that corporations must work harder to eke out profits, it keeps the pressure on them to be more efficient.
The brighter-than-expected economic outlook here and elsewhere in Asia also contributes to Japanese companies' acceptance of a strong yen. "One reason you haven't heard much out of the large exporters is that they've been pleasantly surprised by domestic growth," said Matthew Poggi, an economist with Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
Mr. Poggi said that for each 10 percent the yen appreciates in a year, it knocks about three-quarters of a percentage point off economic growth over the next two years. "Demand from Asia and, to a lesser extent, from the U.S., has also been picking up, so while they may be losing out on the currency, they're making it up with more robust sales," he said.
To some extent, the yen's appreciation is nothing new to Japanese companies, which have lived through such strength before, particularly against the dollar. The average exchange rate in 1994 was 102 yen to the dollar, improving to an average of 94 in 1995 and weakening to an average of 109 in 1996. "It was strong but not disastrous," Mr. Bevacqua said.
The difference this time, however, is the reason for the yen's rise. The last time the yen strengthened, the United States had adopted a policy of benign neglect toward the dollar.
Now, the demand for yen is coming largely from foreign investors, who are betting that Japan's economic recovery will last. Their robust appetite for Japanese stocks has driven the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues to heights that no equity analyst imagined at the beginning of the year -- a close today of 17,777.22, up 37.8 percent in yen terms, year to date. Yet as the foreign investors push the yen's value higher, they threaten to cast a shadow over the profitability of the very companies whose shares they are buying.
The Nikkei's rise has strengthened the resolve of a new group of currency officials, led by Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister for international affairs. He replaced Eisuke Sakakibara, known as "Mr. Yen" for his ability to manipulate the currency markets with his statements.
"Sakakibara would draw a line in the sand and dare people to cross it," a currency specialist said. "Kuroda isn't going to do that."
So long as the Nikkei stock index remains above 16,000, the point at which weak banks would have to recognize unrealized losses on their equity portfolios, the authorities seem unwilling to act more forcefully to contain the strength of the yen -- which settled in New York today at 105.79 to the dollar, improved from 106.44 on Monday.
Mr. Kuroda has let it be known that he believes intervening unilaterally in the currency markets is futile, a view underscored by today's all-but-useless effort to rein in the yen and a similar move on Friday that also failed to curb its rise.

HEADLINE: Liability Fears Sink Republic New York's Share Price

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Fears about the Republic New York Corporation's liability in what prosecutors are now calling a huge fraud dragged down the company's stock for the third consecutive trading session yesterday.
Shares of Republic New York fell 1.6 percent, to close at $59, for a total decline of nearly 15 percent this month. Investors are apparently concerned that the fraud could derail or alter HSBC Holdings' planned acquisition of Republic for $72 a share. 
 Officials at HSBC declined to comment on the status of the deal and referred a reporter to the bank's statement on Sept. 1 announcing an internal investigation into trading losses generated by its customer, Martin A. Armstrong, chairman of Princeton Economics International Inc., which in turn controlled Cresvale International, a brokerage firm based in Hong Kong. At that time, HSBC said its offer to acquire Republic was proceeding but would be postponed until the investigation was concluded.
Republic's stock has fallen since then on investor concerns that the trading losses generated by Mr. Armstrong, estimated by prosecutors at more than $500 million, might cause HSBC to lower its bid.
Republic's securities unit, Republic New York Securities, held Mr. Armstrong's accounts in its Philadelphia office. The bank holding company has not been charged with wrongdoing in the case and is cooperating with prosecutors. But two top officials at the securities subsidiary have been suspended.
Mr. Armstrong, chairman of Princeton Economics, an investment advisory firm, surrendered to Federal authorities in Trenton on Monday on charges that he orchestrated a huge securities fraud that had bilked Japanese investors since 1997. Prosecutors say Mr. Armstrong lured $3 billion from Japanese companies into fixed-rate notes with promises of a return of at least 4 percent annually and that he lied to his clients about his returns and illegally pooled investor funds to hide trading losses. Furthermore, Mr. Armstrong never registered as an investment adviser or commodity trading advisor as required.
Of the roughly $1 billion the money manager still owes his clients in principal and promised interest, only $46 million has been located by prosecutors in Mr. Armstrong's trading accounts.
Marc Durant, the lawyer representing Mr. Armstrong, said that his client disputed the accusations and would fight the charges.
Mr. Armstrong's trading accounts were responsible for 90 percent of the futures business at Republic Securities, according to prosecutors. James Sweeney, president of Republic Securities, and William H. Rogers, president of the unit's futures division, have been suspended.
Securities lawyers say that if an employee is found to have been involved in the fraud, Republic could face a sizable financial liability. In the complaint against Mr. Armstrong unsealed Monday by Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for Manhattan, prosecutors say that Mr. Rogers supplied Mr. Armstrong with letters on company stationery that inflated customers' accounts.
According to the authorities, Mr. Armstrong would ask Mr. Rogers for such letters and would provide the asset value he wanted. Mr. Rogers would then provide Princeton Economics with the letter and the asset value dictated by Mr. Armstrong. If the amount in the account held at Republic New York Securities was less than the figure specified by Mr. Armstrong, funds were shifted from other clients' accounts to make up the shortfall, prosecutors say.
Exactly how Mr. Armstrong lost so much money remains unclear. But a major factor was probably the collapse in the price of the dollar against the Japanese yen in the past year or so. On Aug. 11, 1998, the dollar traded at 147.32 yen; yesterday it traded at 105.93.
In 1998, Mr. Armstrong had expressed great optimism about the strength of the dollar, forecasting that it would rise to 170 yen or higher by this year. Instead, the dollar has plunged, hurting Mr. Armstrong in two ways.
First, Mr. Armstrong was almost certainly making currency bets for his customers in keeping with his optimism on the dollar. Moreover, the strong yen made his promises of 4 percent returns, payable as they were in Japanese currency, much more costly, since he had to exchange far more dollars for the yen than he would have if the dollar had remained high.
The investigation into Mr. Armstrong's activities started in May in Tokyo when the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's securities regulator, conducted a surprise audit of Cresvale, which has offices in Tokyo. Cresvale convinced Japanese companies of Mr. Armstrong's trading prowess, attracting billions in funds.
Kiyotaka Sasaki, the Financial Supervisory Agency official in charge of inspections of foreign financial concerns operating in Japan, said Japanese officials would be closely watching the case against Mr. Armstrong in the United States to gauge its impact on Japanese investors, who face substantial losses.
Mr. Sasaki pointed to the close cooperation between Japanese and American officials as an example of how regulators can police global financial markets. Earlier this year, the Financial Supervisory Agency's work with British regulators helped it close a derivatives unit of Credit Suisse First Boston that sold products to help Japanese corporations defer losses.
"For us, such cooperation has turned out to be very useful and effective," he said.

HEADLINE: It's a Hybrid In Sport Utility Clothes;
A Car-Based Light Truck, It Obeys the Fuel Rules, and It Helps Make Money

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Scheduled to go on sale next spring, the Chrysler PT Cruiser is not quite a sport utility vehicle and not really a minivan.
It does not look like a conventional car, either, although it uses much the same underbody and even a few of the same parts as the Dodge Neon, which is definitely a car. 
 But officials at DaimlerChrysler A.G. have decided that as far as Federal regulations are concerned, their lightweight, fuel-sipping vehicle is a truck and not a car. "We certainly are intending to have this classified as a light truck," said Jan Zverina, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman.
DaimlerChrysler has chosen to call the Cruiser a truck because of breaks it can get under the complex system of separate Federal fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.
Counting the Cruiser as a light truck stands to improve the average fuel economy of the entire fleet of DaimlerChrysler's light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickups. The more Cruisers DaimlerChrysler sells, the more big, high-profit sport utilities and pickups it can sell while still meeting the gas mileage averages required by law.
After heavy lobbying by the auto industry, the Senate is expected on Wednesday to extend a four-year-old ban that prevents the Clinton Administration from studying or changing these two-decade-old fuel economy regulations. Meanwhile, auto makers are preparing to introduce as many as two dozen vehicles with car-based designs in the coming years and to ask that many of them to be certified as light trucks.
Two car-based sport utility vehicles, the Toyota RAV-4 and the Honda CR-V, have been on the market in limited numbers for two years and are categorized as light trucks. BMW A.G. will start selling its car-based sport utility vehicle, the X5, in December and has asked that it be certified as a light truck. Next spring, the Ford Motor Company will put on sale the Escape, a small sport utility vehicle that is based on the Ford Contour compact sedan. And the Cadillac, Buick, Pontiac, Saturn and Chevrolet divisions of the General Motors Corporation are all developing models that will combine car and light truck features, although G.M. has not said when they will go on sale.
Auto executives say that Americans want automobiles that combine the rugged appearance of a light truck with the handling and easy access of a car. The new models are not being created for fuel-economy reasons, said Lawrence D. Burns, G.M.'s vice president for planning, research and development. "That is not the driving force behind what we're doing here," he added.
Surveys show that with gasoline prices low, consumers care very little about fuel economy. Yet as buyers have switched from cars to light trucks, fuel economy has declined, increasing the nation's dependence on imported oil and increasing emissions of gases that many scientists have linked to global warming.
Each auto maker is required to produce a fleet of cars with an average gas mileage of at least 27.5 miles a gallon. But manufacturers are permitted to sell their fleets of light trucks with average fuel efficiencies of just 20.7 miles a gallon.
The rules that govern whether automobiles are classified as cars or light trucks have remained virtually unchanged since they were first written in 1976, and they are riddled with loopholes. Current and former regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal agency that administers the fuel-economy laws, say the agency has never challenged an auto maker's decision on whether to register an automobile as a car or as a light truck.
When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995 and began trying to curb what they called regulatory excesses, one of the first things they did was prohibit the Clinton Administration from spending any money even to study increases in fuel-economy standards or changes in the fuel-economy rules. The House has already voted this year to extend the prohibition for another year as part of the Federal budget; the Senate is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on a nonbinding resolution that would urge Senate budget negotiators to remove the provision during conferences with House leaders. That vote is expected to fail.
Environmentalists have been lobbying hard for passage of the Senate resolution, but the auto industry has fought back with full-page newspaper advertisements and radio spots in nine states and appears likely to prevail. The Administration has sat on the sidelines during the current debate.
Even some auto executives acknowledge the shortcomings of the current system. BMW, for example, has sold only cars until now, and its executives had been very critical of the breaks that are available for auto makers who sell vehicles that qualify as light trucks. But BMW changed that position when it developed the X5.
Victor Doolan, BMW's president for North American operations until he was hired by Ford a few weeks ago, said in an interview early this year that he had decided to submit the X5 to regulators as a truck primarily because of the preferential treatment afforded light trucks under fuel-economy rules. "That's the major reason: Why should we pay punitive penalties that Mercedes and Lexus do not" on their sport utility vehicles? he said. "It's the rules that are wrong, not the way we play the game."
Most crossover vehicles ride high off the ground and have all-wheel drive. Those two features qualify them as "off road" vehicles, which the fuel-economy rules classify as light trucks.
But few of these crossover vehicles are ever likely to be driven up a rocky mountain trail. "Every crossover vehicle is being called a sport utility even if they can't go up a wet driveway," said Jamie Jameson, the vice president for sales and marketing at DaimlerChrysler, which takes pride in the off-road capacities of its Jeeps.
The company does not make such claims for the PT Cruiser, which has front-wheel drive instead of all-wheel drive. The Cruiser is being classified as a light truck through an obscure provision of the fuel-economy rules often applied to minivans. The provision says that vehicles can be so classified if they have removable back seats and a flat load floor.
Barry Felrice, a top regulator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for two decades and now a top lobbyist in DaimlerChrysler's Washington office, said the provision was written in the 1970's to cover about 12,000 cargo vans a year. Without the provision, those vans might have been classified as cars. But since the 1970's, the auto industry has used the provision to classify the entire minivan market, or 1.2 million a vehicles a year, as light trucks.
The Cruiser is no gas-guzzler. It may even get high enough mileage to match the mandated average for cars. Indeed, Mr. Zverina, the DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said the vehicle's combined city and highway gas mileage might reach 30: the Environmental Protection Agency will issue an official figure when the vehicle goes on sale.
By adding the Cruiser to its light truck offerings, DaimlerChrysler will improve the overall average fuel economy for its fleet. This will allow the company to sell more large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which are the most profitable models, with margins of up to $15,000, but which also tend to have thirsty V8 engines.
The Cruiser "helps us because on the light truck side, there's very strong demand for V8's," Mr. Zverina said.
The average fuel economy of new light trucks appeared to improve slightly in the 1998 model year, the most recent data available. Auto makers acknowledge that this is largely because of anomalies in the rules.
Ford and DaimlerChrysler, for example, began equipping many of their minivans and pickups to run on either gasoline or ethanol to take advantage of Federal fuel-economy credits for dual-fuel vehicles -- even though fewer than 100 service stations in the country actually sell ethanol. G.M. redesigned its four-wheel-drive Suburbans to make them too large to be counted as light trucks; they ceased to be included in any gas mileage averages at all.
Regardless of whether they are classified as cars or light trucks, the new, car-based vehicles have a number of advantages. Dr. Ricardo Martinez, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says they might be safer than current sport utility vehicles because they will tend to be lower and less likely to roll over. The new vehicles are also less likely than sport utility vehicles to kill other motorists in crashes because they have lighter underbodies that are not as stiff.
The new automobiles get 20 to 30 miles a gallon, a level several miles a gallon less than the small and mid-size cars on which they are based, but far better gas mileage than most current sport utility vehicles. Over all, the effect of the new vehicles on the nation's fuel efficiency depends on what kind of vehicles they will replace. If they attract customers who might otherwise buy big sport utility vehicles, then the net effect would probably be to improve fuel efficiency slightly.
But most customers for crossover vehicles seem likely to switch from cars, hurting overall fuel efficiency. Except for a few, low-volume luxury models, like the BMW X5 and the Lexus RX 300, most new crossover vehicles will sell for less than $20,000 and be fairly small. Three-quarters of the sport utility vehicles now sold cost $26,000 and up, including all of the big gas guzzlers.
The success of the giant vehicles, despite their price tags, has put DaimlerChrysler, G.M. and Ford all perilously close to falling short of the light truck fuel-economy standard. For each tenth of a mile per gallon that an auto maker falls short of the standard, it must pay $5.50 for each vehicle sold. This can add up to tens of millions of dollars for a big auto maker.

HEADLINE: A Catholic Women's College Prays for a Miracle

BYLINE: By MARIALISA CALTA 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Sept. 13

 BODY:
Last year, when reports of financial instability surfaced at Trinity College of Vermont, a small Roman Catholic liberal arts institution and the state's only women's college, people in the academic community gathered occasionally to pray for the welfare of the college.
This year, the prayer meetings are held weekly. 
 "I guess we've upped the ante," said Sister Jacqueline Marie Kieslich, Trinity's newly appointed president. She began her job just a few weeks ago, knowing that her task was to close the college on June 30, 2000.
"We've been hoping for a miracle," said Donna Dalton, vice president for academic and student affairs. "A miracle would be very nice."
In July, Trinity's board announced that the 74-year-old college, founded and run by the Sisters of Mercy, could no longer support a $6 million debt -- due mostly to declining enrollment -- on a $13.2 million operating budget. At the end of the fiscal year, the trustees declared, Trinity would cease to exist as an independent institution for its 1,150 students.
American colleges are "incredibly hardy," in the words of Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on Education in Washington. Yet every year, two to three of the country's estimated 3,500 two- and four-year colleges fall victim to demographics or cultural trends.
"A school closing affects not only the students, faculty, staff and alumni, but the community as well," Mr. Hartle said. "Our diversity of choices is diminished. And the community loses an engine of economic and cultural vitality."
Next door to the comparatively more sprawling University of Vermont, Trinity College sits on 28 acres of well-trimmed paths, maple trees and neat, sensible brick buildings in a corner of Vermont's largest city. Students stroll the grounds sporting buttons with quotations from Gandhi ("An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"), John Lennon ("You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one") or the occasional "I am a sensuous woman." There seem to be fewer body piercings than at most higher education institutions.
The college, which opened in 1925 to educate what was then an underserved population -- Vermont women -- has long been a pioneer in education and community service, with a stated mission to "promote social justice."
In the 1970's, Trinity was among the first private colleges to open its doors to older nontraditional students. In the 1980's, it began a study program for single mothers. A campus-based child-care center for the community serves as a laboratory for education students. The college's education department, which has supplied the state with an estimated 10 percent of its teachers, sends its professors to Vermont elementary schools to teach graduate courses on site. And every year, through a program endowed by a former trustee, Trinity brings to the community speakers like Elie Wiesel, Kenzaburo Oe, Maya Angelou, Joyce Carol Oates and Alice Walker.
Students and faculty members are clearly reluctant to let these programs die. They are, they point out, part of the reason that U.S. News & World Report ranked Trinity in the top tier of Regional Liberal Arts Colleges for 1999.
"My overwhelming feeling is of sadness, because no other students will be able to experience what I have been able to experience here," said Mattie Pontecorvo, a sophomore from Woodstock, Vt. She described the Trinity experience as one of empowerment and support.
"When you are a student here, you feel like you can do anything," said Ms. Pontecorvo, who is president of her class, co-editor of the student newspaper, a member of the student senate, a resident assistant and is active in community service projects sponsored by the college. She said the atmosphere at Trinity, "where women support women," had helped her assume leadership roles. "I don't think I would have been doing all these things in my second year at a co-ed institution. I wouldn't have had the confidence."
Tosca Zern, a junior and biology major from Shelton, Conn., frowned over her computer during a physiology laboratory. She is worried, she said, about her chances of getting into medical school if the college closes. "What about recommendations?" she asked. "What about getting a degree from a place that will no longer exist? When I say I'm going home, I mean I'm coming here. This place is home to all of us."
Jessica Campbell, a sophomore from Portland, Me., whose smiling visage graces the Trinity catalogue, echoed the feelings of many when she said she had returned "determined to have the best year ever, no matter what happens," and added, "If Trinity closes, these two years would definitely have been worth it."
Such expressions of optimism, using the word "if," are "what we all need to be able to get up in the morning," said Sister Jacqueline.
Since the trustees' decision, administrators have been trying to find a sponsoring institution to adopt some of the programs and enable Trinity students to complete their degrees with as little disruption as possible. Sister Jacqueline said the college was "exploring new relationships" with other colleges, like merging, forming partnerships or collaborating. Many administrators hope talks with St. Michael's, a Catholic college in nearby Winooski, will prove fruitful.
But even the most optimistic Trinity booster seems to agree that, come June 30, the college will cease to exist in its current form.
"Even if we were to receive a windfall, we would have to re-evaluate our structure, concentrate on our strengths, and cull some of our weaker programs," said Sister Jacqueline. "We can't continue as we are."
While the number of graduate students has hovered at about 550, the number of traditional-age undergraduates at Trinity fell from 415 in 1989 to 263 this year, and the number of nontraditional undergraduates, who include older women and men, has dropped to 338 from 659 a decade ago. Pamela Jarvis, vice president for finance and administration, said the reasons for the decline were unclear but might include a turnover in the admissions department, an increase in choices for nontraditional students and the waning popularity of single-sex colleges.
Nationally, the number of women's colleges has decreased to 77 from 300 in 1960. While those colleges that have hung on are "quite competitive" and drawing increasing interest in recent years, said Jadwiga Sebrechts, president of the Women's College Coalition in Washington, an all-women's college must work especially hard to "tell its story" and attract students.
Ms. Jarvis said Trinity's financial problems were compounded by the fact that to remain competitive, the college could not reduce expenses, particularly in areas like technology, nor raise their charges (about $21,400 for tuition, room, board and fees). In the meantime, the relatively small endowment of $2 million has not substantially increased.
That would change, of course, if Peggy A. McCluskey, the president of the alumni board, gets her wish. Ms. McCluskey, a 1960 Trinity graduate, has been buying lottery tickets in the hope of winning money for her alma mater.
"It would be a miracle," she acknowledged. "But if any school deserves a miracle, it's Trinity."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Financial Shares Depress Dow; Technology Buoys Nasdaq

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, as fears of rising interest rates continued to deter investors.
Trading was dominated by a Government report on retail sales that showed consumers were much more active buyers last month than analysts had thought. 
 The report sent shivers through the bond market, where interest rates rose, and it further depressed prices of financial services stocks. Insurance shares, which are not helped when rates climb, were weakened further by worries that the advance of Hurricane Floyd suggested big damage claims in the making.
"A year ago these sales figures wouldn't have caused a ripple," said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies & Company. "But it is very difficult to invest more when there is so much uncertainty about the course of interest rates and the dollar."
Selling yesterday was most heavily concentrated among blue-chip stocks.
Led by J. P. Morgan, which fell 2 13/16, to 122, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 120 points, or 1.09 percent, closing at 10,910.33. General Electric, parent company of GE Capital, lost 1 13/16, to 116 3/4. And American Express dropped 7/8, to 139 3/8.
With financial and drug company shares weakened, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also lost ground, falling 7.84 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,336.29.
But worries about an overly vigorous economy and rising rates did not dampen demand for technology shares. The Nasdaq composite index gained 23.52 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,868.29, led by Qualcomm, which gained 17 1/8, to 170 1/2. Qualcomm, which makes cellular phones, said it would meet or exceed fourth-quarter profit estimates, reassuring investors, who had sent the company's shares down sharply on Monday after it pulled out of an investor conference.
Other technology stalwarts also rose, further lifting the Nasdaq average. Microsoft was up 1 3/16, to 95 1/16. Intel gained 1 7/16, to 85 13/16. And Cisco Systems rose 1 1/4, to 71 15/16.
The ferocity of Hurricane Floyd created some anxiety about insurers. But analysts said that by and large the industry was in far better shape to handle a disaster than in August 1992, when Hurricane Andrew ripped through South Florida.
Homeowner insurers, which potentially face the biggest claims, suffered yesterday. Allstate dropped 1 7/16, to 32 1/8. Hartford Financial lost 1 5/16, to 46 15/16. And the St. Paul Companies fell 1, to 31 5/8.
"The market's reaction was rational," said Alice Schroeder of Paine Webber. "We do expect that the storm will result in reduced earnings this quarter, but we just don't know by how much. However, it is a one-time event and will not affect next year."
Jay A. Cohen, a Merrill Lynch insurance analyst, said that "when Andrew hit, the level of equity capital for the industry was about $160 billion."
"Now," he said, "that figure is just over $340 billion. Floyd would have to have an absolutely enormous impact to have an effect on the industry as a whole."
Similarly, entertainment analysts said the Walt Disney Company's decision to close Disney World for the first time in 27 years should not have a tangible financial effect. The company plans to keep the park closed for the next two days. But the Disney World hotels, which are fully booked, remain open.
"I don't think it will be material to earnings," said Jill Krutick of Salomon Smith Barney, although she said her assessment could change if there were severe damage to the Orlando, Fla., property.
Investors did not seem much concerned: Disney shares, which have been under pressure for about a year, closed at 27 15/16, down 1/8.
And news that air carriers were canceling flights in and out of Miami did not dissuade buyers of airline stocks. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained 1/4, to 55 1/8. Delta Air Lines rose 1/2, to 50 5/8. And UAL, parent of United Airlines, was up 1 1/4, to 68 1/8.
"Weather hurts the airlines, whether it is a blizzard or a hurricane," said Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "But they are vulnerable to everything, from weather to a change in oil prices to a change in fares."
In the final analysis, said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, investors remained more concerned about a man-made threat, higher interest rates, than about a possible natural disaster. "Hurricanes come and go, and people generally look beyond them," Mr. Goldman said. "Rising interest rates hit you right between the eyes."

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Big Aid Package To Rally a Reeling Colombia

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
With Colombia's Government buckling under the pressure of guerrilla attacks, a thriving drug trade and the worst economy in decades, the Clinton Administration is putting together a major new effort to prop up the country's democracy that will include hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and military aid.
The aid package, which is expected to be completed soon, will have large amounts of new military equipment, including arms and helicopters, as well as more intelligence support and training for Colombia's army and police units, senior Administration and defense officials said. 
 The Administration is also planning new moves that officials hope will ease Colombia's economic crisis, strengthen the criminal justice system and help local governments in the country's large, sparsely populated interior.
But even before it has been completed, the plan is generating strong reservations among some within the Administration who fear that the United States is being drawn more deeply into a convoluted civil conflict that has left tens of thousands dead over nearly four decades. "It is going to be a very dangerous mess," said a senior official who has worked on Colombia. "And we are going to be in the middle of that mess."
Not since the Central American civil wars of the 1980's has the United States been so tempted to go to the aid of a Latin American ally threatened by an insurgency. Pushed by a small group of Republican leaders in Congress, the Administration is already giving Colombia $309 million this year, making it the fourth-largest recipient of American aid after Israel, Egypt and Jordan.
The Administration's new effort will mark a significant shift in American policy toward Colombia after nearly two decades in which it has focused almost entirely on combating the cocaine trade. While fighting drugs will remain a central goal, the United States is about to make a broader commitment to support Colombia's embattled Government than it has in years.
Administration officials said they had used months of wide-ranging discussions about the aid to reconsider American objectives and to press the Government of President Andres Pastrana to come up with a comprehensive strategy to address the country's problems. Mr. Pastrana is expected to outline that strategy next week in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly and in meetings with officials in Washington.
The Administration has not yet decided how large its aid package will be, but the officials said that in their internal discussions it ranged from $1 billion to $1.5 billion over the next three years.
They said the size of the package was not likely to be settled until the White House and Congress resolved their increasingly contentious fight over balancing the budget.
But the discussions have also been complicated by deep divisions within the Administration itself over how to get involved and how deeply.
Some more hawkish officials, led by the White House's drug policy adviser, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, are pressing for a large increase in aid to Colombia's armed forces. Citing "a drug-related emergency," General McCaffrey has called for at least $1 billion concentrated on the military and the police.
At the Pentagon, however, there are reservations about how deeply to get involved with Colombia, a country with two leftist guerrilla armies fighting the Government, right-wing paramilitary forces fighting the guerrillas, and civilians ever in the crossfire. The perils of a stronger American role came into clearer relief in July when a United States spy plane crashed during a counterdrug mission, killing five American soldiers and two Colombians.
Officials at the State Department and the National Security Council, in particular, have pressed to broaden Washington's agenda in Colombia while trying to limit American involvement in the war. The officials have played down the immediate threat to Mr. Pastrana's Government, arguing that a modest rise in military aid should be balanced by support for social-development projects, the economy and a negotiated settlement to the war.
Administration officials say they have made it clear to the Colombians that increased American support will come with pressure for changes, including greater efforts to clean up human-rights abuses by the military, and a new, probably tougher Government approach to the peace talks with the insurgents.
But while Administration officials say that they will not dictate policies to Mr. Pastrana, some Colombian officials involved in the aid negotiations already appear uncomfortable with the growing American role.
"We have a strategy," a senior Colombian official said curtly, suggesting that the Administration's elaborate search for a new approach was little more than packaging for a new financing pitch to Congress.
United States aid to Colombia fell sharply after the Bush Administration, which had targeted the Andean countries in an attempt to stem the flow of cocaine at its source. But American aid to the Colombian military and the police has risen steadily since 1996, and the Colombian Army has also bought new loads of American arms.
The new engagement of the Clinton Administration is partly a consequence of its close ties to Mr. Pastrana, who took office a year ago. In the previous four years Washington essentially boycotted the Government of his predecessor, Ernesto Samper, after evidence emerged that his political campaign had taken huge contributions from cocaine traffickers.
Despite their early hopes for Mr. Pastrana, however, United States officials generally describe his efforts to negotiate with the guerrillas as a failure that has left the insurgents stronger and more defiant. Nor do those officials hide their view that Colombia's multiple crises may be beyond Mr. Pastrana's ability to resolve.
Colombia's cocaine industry, which has long depended on coca leaf from Peru and Bolivia, is becoming more self-sufficient as it grows more of its own coca and a more potent strain of the plant is introduced, intelligence analysts say.
Last year, the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that Colombia could have produced about 165 metric tons of cocaine from its own crop, up from 65 tons in 1993 and 80 tons in 1995. This year, according to an internal Government document, analysts expect Colombian traffickers to produce as much as 250 tons.
The increase comes despite a jump of nearly 50 percent in American drug-eradication efforts last year, and it is concentrated largely in fields that are guarded or taxed by leftist guerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups, the document indicates. Many American officials believe that the guerrillas -- particularly those of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- have reaped a windfall from the coca boom that has turned them into a far more serious military threat.
In an attempt to build trust with the FARC, as the rebel group is known, Mr. Pastrana withdrew army troops from a large swath of the rebel-dominated countryside last November. The move drew open dissent from his officer corps, however, and the guerrillas have shown little sign of compromise since. In July, the talks were suspended after the insurgents refused to accept observers in the demilitarized zone, and the rebels began one of their biggest offensives in years.
"Pastrana seems to have bent all the way over in a Gumby-like way," an American military official said, "He's about used up what he's got to offer, and it is not working."
Administration officials are less critical of Mr. Pastrana's economic management, but his political standing has also been hurt by economic troubles that were long in the making: the worst recession in decades, a growing debt burden and an unemployment rate that has reached nearly 20 percent.
The worsening situation began to command the attention of the White House this summer, officials said, when an interagency meeting presided over by President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, turned from a discussion of Caribbean radar installations to the turmoil in Colombia. "This is a third-order issue that is going to become a first-order issue," two officials quoted Mr. Berger as saying.
Officials said Mr. Berger asked those present to consider what additional aid Colombia needed. The initial result, however, was a deluge of different and sometimes contradictory proposals.
On July 13, General McCaffrey struck preemptively, writing Cabinet members to warn of an "explosion of coca cultivation" in Colombia. His letter, which was quickly and widely leaked to the news media, outlined $1 billion in new spending, most of it for Colombia, including $360 million to help the army expand its reach in southern Colombia and $120 million to increase the interdiction of drug flights.
Officials at the Pentagon and the State Department drew up their own lists, and different priorities emerged. Law-enforcement officials argued for more support for Colombian police anti-drug operations and the country's judicial system. State Department officials pushed proposals ranging from trade benefits to temporary refuge for Colombian immigrants to the United States.
"You are getting policy by proposal rather than by planning," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. "Everybody seems to agree, 'Hey, let's send some money down there.' But I have heard relatively little discussion or debate about what the U.S. interests are."
White House and State Department officials said they had been struggling to define those interests more clearly in a series of meetings over the summer.
For the most part, the officials take pains to sound less alarmed than General McCaffrey and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have grown increasingly critical of President Clinton's policies. After visiting Bogota last month, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering, said he was "sobered but certainly not panicked" by Colombia's problems.
In fact, some military analysts believe that the Colombian Army has been doing better against the guerrillas in recent months. In addition, a secret assessment by American intelligence recently estimated that the rebels' profits from the drug trade ranged from perhaps $30 million to $100 million a year, far less than the amounts cited publicly by some officials, including General McCaffrey.
The Clinton Administration's more deliberate approach also owes much to battles being fought far from Colombia. Last fall, the Administration was caught off guard by an emergency spending plan drafted by Republicans in Congress that added $287 million in anti-drug and military aid to Colombia almost overnight. This year, officials said they were determined not to be outflanked again, although prominent conservatives in the House have drafted their own wish lists, including one by Representative Dan Burton of Indiana that calls for $930 million in new aid.
So the Administration has devised an early plan of its own. In an effort to inject energy into the peace talks, the United States will press both sides to heed the experience of countries like El Salvador and Nicaragua and accept international mediation.
And to shore up Colombia's economy, Administration officials said, they are backing talks with the International Monetary Fund for as much as $3 billion in financing, in addition to cash support from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Nevertheless, the bulk of American aid will go to military and antidrug operations. The officials said it would probably include a squadron of new helicopters for the Colombian Army, a package of excess equipment from the Pentagon and considerable training for Colombian soldiers and police officers.
American soldiers and advisers have already begun training a new anti-drug battalion of 950 soldiers and 200 police officers and the officials said the Administration would most likely approve the training of two more battalions.
"To deal with the drug problem," said a senior Administration official, "you have to deal with the guerrillas intimately involved in the drug problem."

Japan Sells Yen to Curb Sharp Rise Against Dollar
The Japanese central bank sold yen to curb the currency's recent heady rise, but the intervention barely managed to nudge the yen off its three-year high against the dollar. And in New York, the yen gained again, to 105.79 to the dollar from 106.44 on Monday.
The Japanese authorities seemed more alarmed by the speed of the yen's appreciation -- nearly 5 percent in the last week -- than in the rise itself, even as economists began wondering aloud whether a stronger yen might stifle the little vitality that a long-moribund Japanese economy is starting to exhibit. Page C3. 

Oracle Shares Fall on Profit Report
Shares of Oracle dropped sharply in after-hours trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings that met the consensus estimate of analysts but fell short of the so-called whisper number. After closing at $45.4375, shares fell as low as $41. C21.
 
AT&T to Cut Thousands of Jobs
As AT&T continues to cut costs amid its campaign of cable television acquisitions, thousands of employees in AT&T's core long-distance telephone operation could lose their jobs before the end of next year, executives close to the company said. Many of those employees could find jobs in other, faster-growing AT&T divisions that will continue to add jobs, but others could be laid off. Shares of AT&T fell 62.5 cents, to $44.50. C4.
 
Seagate Technology, the computer disk-drive maker, said that it would cut 8,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its workers. C3.
 
Investors See HSBC Deal in Danger
Fears about Republic New York's liability in what prosecutors are calling a huge fraud dragged down the company's stock 1.6 percent, to $59, for a decline of nearly 15 percent this month. Investors are concerned that the fraud could derail or alter HSBC Holdings' planned acquisition of Republic. C2.
 
Nasdaq Is Up, but Dow Declines

HEADLINE: A Higher Minimum Wage

 BODY:
With the economy strong and the unemployment rate at its lowest in more than 25 years, Democrats in Congress are right to push for an increase in the minimum wage. An increase now will boost income for the poorest workers without the danger of creating more unemployment. But Republicans resist the idea, even though the minimum wage, now $5.15 an hour, has declined in purchasing power over the past three decades.
Senator Edward Kennedy has drafted a bill to raise that wage by 50 cents this year and another 50 cents in 2000. The $1 increase would restore the actual buying power of the minimum wage to what it was in 1980, and would raise the pay of nearly 12 million Americans who now earn less than $6.15 an hour. Currently a minimum-wage employee working full time earns about $10,700 a year, which is roughly $3,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. A boost to $6.15 would increase annual pay by about $2,000 a year, an amount that can make a significant difference in reducing poverty. Nearly three-quarters of the workers who would benefit are adults, 60 percent are women, and nearly half work full time. 
 Opponents argue that an increase would result in lost jobs. But a modest hike is not likely to cause higher unemployment, even among low-skilled workers. Indeed, jobless rates fell after the 90-cent minimum-wage hike of 1996-97. The unemployment rate, 5.2 percent in 1996, dropped to 4.2 percent this year.
Senator Kennedy is expected to offer the minimum-wage bill as an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill when it comes to the Senate floor. Moderate House Republicans are also getting the message from voters that they want the wage increase, but they may be tempted to add tax cuts that might make an increase less painful for the business lobbies. The wage hike should be approved without such tax breaks. For millions of workers, a higher minimum wage means a better shot at self-sufficiency.

HEADLINE: Liberties;
Trust But Verify

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
After W. dropped his handkerchief in June, he sat on the porch by the ocean in Kennebunkport. I asked him if it was scary to run for President, when he knew so little about foreign affairs.
"There will be moments when situations, incidents will flare up," he replied. "It's important for the President to think globally." He said the crucial thing was how a chief executive dealt with Russia and China, and whether he knew which foreign-policy advisers to trust and which to "kiss off," as he put it. 
 "But," he added, picking a regional hot spot out of a hat, "if the East Timorians decide to revolt, I'm sure I'll have a statement."
He talked about the murderous state of the Indonesian territory with that W. touch of flipness and swagger we have come to know. He was so unfamiliar with the tensions there that he called the citizens East Timorians rather than East Timorese. His implicit point was that there was still plenty of time for lessons from his foreign-policy tutors, Poppy's crowd -- George Shultz, Condoleezza Rice and Dick Cheney.
But we're in a fast, mercurial universe. One minute we're scarcely paying attention to some roiling conflict on the other side of the world, and the next we're debating whether to send American troops over there, wherever there is, and whatever it is they're killing each other about.
Less than three months after talking about that Timor statement, the Texas Governor had to actually put it out. Or more likely, his tutors did.
W. sensed the irony of this. After visiting a Bedford, N.H., elementary school last week -- where he drolly told the kids, "Some people say that I proved that if you get a C average, you can end up being successful in life" -- he answered reporters' questions about his position on East Timor. Before and after he spoke the words "East Timorese," he paused pregnantly.
Then the candidate who had recently learned the correct term himself asked the press, with a sly smile, "Everybody knew that?"
It's a weird reversal of his father's '92 campaign. Bush Senior fumbled because he seemed too obsessed with foreign policy at a time when the economy was tanking. "In my life," W. told me dryly that day in Maine, "I never tried to rush the natural progression of growing up."
And that is the issue that gnaws. Has he grown up? Can we trust him? He wants us to believe that his gut instincts and moral framework can carry him over the lacunae in his knowledge of geopolitics. He wants us to believe that his transformation from rowdy late bloomer to mature statesman is complete and non-reversible.
"A lot of people around the world would find it rather frightening to envision a President of the United States, at the moment of probably America's greatest power in history, who seems completely uninformed on the state of the world," says Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University. "It's one thing to rely on the advice of aides because you have respect for their judgment. It's another to do it because you don't know enough to distinguish good advice from bad advice."
But Michael Beschloss, another historian, says that, post-cold-war, "we have a lot of local and regional threats that are probably indecipherable even to a Presidential candidate who has had a lot of history in foreign policy. So we might be better with a President who is a quick study, who chooses good people, and who knows how to use them."
He notes that Ronald Reagan had no foreign-affairs experience when he was elected, yet he had a lot to do with ending the cold war. (Although he did know what he thought of pinkos.)
And, Mr. Beschloss says, we might have avoided Vietnam if Lyndon Johnson had been as secure on foreign policy as he was on domestic policy. He might not have been so easily swayed by misguided Kennedy holdovers like Robert McNamara.
Bill Clinton did a lot of reading about the history of the Balkan conflict. But he still miscalculated the determination of Slobodan Milosevic when he developed the plan to bomb Serbia. And even if we did not worry about Mr. Clinton's grasp of the issues, we had to worry about whether there was any post-Monica "Wag the Dog" syndrome involved in his bombing decisions about Iraq and Sudan.
W.'s father greatly admired Henry Stimson, the diplomat and soldier, whose credo was: "The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him."
That's true -- occasionally.

HEADLINE: Stanford President to Resign in 2000 and Teach Law Full Time

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Gerhard Casper, the president of Stanford University, announced yesterday that he would resign at the end of August 2000, citing the perpetual need for fresh perspectives on campus and his desire to focus on teaching undergraduates.
Mr. Casper, 61, became president of Stanford in 1992, as it was recovering from disclosures that it had overcharged the Federal Government millions of dollars in indirect research costs and as the university was trying to rebuild after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
 Mr. Casper began several initiatives intended to improve education during students' first two years; led a merger of the hospitals at Stanford and the University of California at San Francisco; increased fund-raising to more than $300 million annually and started a $200 million endowment campaign to support graduate students.
"At a university, no time is ever an appropriate one to claim that tasks have been completed," Mr. Casper told a regularly scheduled meeting of deans and department heads on the Palo Alto, Calif., campus yesterday afternoon, according to the prepared text of his remarks. "All days of a university need to be first days. The work of the university is work that cannot be done unless it is continuously reconsidered."
Quoting from Ecclesiastes, "To every thing there is a season," Mr. Casper noted that he had spent two decades in top administrative posts, starting as dean of the law school at the University of Chicago and then provost there.
Of his seven years at Stanford, he said jokingly, "Ten years at least is the way it feels."
 Nestled in the heart of the booming Silicon Valley, Stanford has become among the hottest names in higher education during Mr. Casper's tenure, rivaling Ivy League institutions in competitiveness, prestige and fund-raising.
Faculty members were stunned by Mr. Casper's announcement, a week before classes are scheduled to begin at the 14,000-student campus, and praised their president for unifying the university and refocusing it on academics.
"His dedication to and love of teaching undergraduates permeated everything," said Lucy Shapiro, a professor of developmental biology at the Stanford Medical School. "He's almost unique in his desire to learn in depth how different schools work, how different disciplines work, and how to put a research university like Stanford squarely in the center of training the next generation."
Principal elements of Mr. Casper's legacy will be Stanford Introductory Studies, a series of seminars for first- and second-year students, and Sophomore College, a two-week program in which students take one intensive course before regular classes begin in the fall.
On the graduate level, he founded the fellowship program to support up to 300 science students free of sponsored research, and another initiative that brings graduate students from Asia for a yearlong seminar on politics and economics.
Mr. Casper, who also oversaw restoration of landmarks damaged in the earthquake and construction of a new science and engineering quadrangle, plans to take a sabbatical and then return to Stanford to teach constitutional law.
Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale University, who is a Stanford alumnus, said Mr. Casper "is a true scholar, a person of really wide learning and wide tastes."
"It's a great loss for Stanford, and a great loss for higher education," he said.

HEADLINE: Power Failures Are a Warning

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "After Summer's Power Failures, Concerns About Large Utilities" (front page, Sept. 13): 
 Over the past 30 years, electric utilities have been bullied by politicians, who demand low electric rates for their constituents, and by Wall Street, which cannot tolerate investments that do not reap vast rewards within two years. As a result, few new power plants of any kind have been built. Yet our growing economy and desire for more electrical gadgets, from cell phones to Web TV, continue to drive demand.
It is time to stop worrying about whether power costs another tenth of a cent per kilowatt and start putting a premium on reliability. That means expenditures on major power plants, not a handful of windmills and tiny dams on little streams, and a full-scale review of the adequacy of our national power distribution system to meet our growing needs.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Fall on Stronger-Than-Expected Retail Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
A report yesterday of stronger-than-expected retail sales last month helped send bond yields higher, stoking investors' fears of further rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The price of the 30-year Government bond fell 31/32, to 100 3/32, as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbed to 6.12 percent from 6.05 percent on Monday, the highest level in almost two weeks. 
 Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, called the numbers quite robust. "It appears that consumers have yet to show any inclination of spending less," she said. "Just what that means in terms of Fed policy is not quite clear. After all, we've seen strong consumption and a low inflation environment coexist for years."
But that is not to say that market participants are not concerned, especially since the Fed has already increased short-term interest rates twice this year.
Investor jitters generally make the market vulnerable to speculation and idle talk. Yesterday there was plenty of talk giving traders the excuses they needed to sell securities.
Bonds fell after a Government report showed that retail sales in August posted their biggest gain in six months, a strong 1.2 percent, or 0.7 percent excluding auto sales. Even though the numbers were broad-based, traders were a little reluctant to chase prices sharply lower ahead of today's closely watched inflation report, the August Consumer Price Index. Some economists expect a gain of 0.5 percent after a gain of 0.7 percent in July.
"We heard some talk that insurance companies were sellers of paper in anticipation of huge claims from Hurricane Floyd," Ms. Rupert said. "Also we hear that the Bank of Japan might be in the market buying sizable amounts of notes. There was good buying in the 10-year maturity, tied to the unwinding hedges surrounding Freddie Mac's $6 billion offering priced today."
Freddie Mac, the nation's second largest buyer of home mortgages behind Fannie Mae, priced its global sale of 10-year reference yesterday through underwriters led by Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch and Bear, Stearns.
The notes yielded 6.729 percent, or about 79.5 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield of a 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for many corporate borrowers, rose to 5.95 percent.
Renewed weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen also worsened negative market sentiment.
The Treasury auctioned $10 billion of 52-week bills yesterday with what analysts called decent results given the rate had increased to 5 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 52-week bill:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures
 
Price . . . 94.944
High Rate . . . 5.00%
Coupon Yield . . . 5.28%

Low Rate . . . 4.98%
Median Rate . . . 4.90%
Total applied for . . . $34,215,735

An article in Business Day yesterday about the daily performance of bond prices referred imprecisely to the three lead managers of a $6 billion offering by Freddie Mac. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is a lead manager with Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch. Bear, Stearns is a co-manager, not a lead manager.

HEADLINE: Campaign Finance Tactics

 BODY:
In one of its finest moments, the House of Representatives listened to its collective conscience Tuesday night and passed the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill. Representative Christopher Shays reflected both the historic importance of the vote and the tremendous challenge ahead with an apt comparison to the great civil rights debates of the 1960's. As they did a generation ago, proponents of progress will now have to force an obstructionist minority in the Senate to face vote after vote to expose their motives. It may, therefore, be the moment to consider tactical changes in the legislation if there is a possibility of winning more Republicans on the next vote.
The focus of attention now turns to John McCain -- Presidential candidate, Vietnam War hero and anti-establishment Senator from Arizona. With Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Mr. McCain has pushed for a ban on unregulated "soft money" to political parties since President Clinton's out-of-control 1996 re-election campaign. Unlike most Republicans, Mr. McCain was not content to deplore Mr. Clinton's excesses. The McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money to parties and extend Federal regulations to money raised by independent groups for campaign ads two months before an election. 
 Today Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold are planning to introduce a stripped-down version of that bill, eliminating the curbs on fund-raising for so-called "issue ads" by independent groups. In effect, they are calling the bluff of Trent Lott, the majority leader, and his fund-raiser in chief, Mitch McConnell, who have obsessively focused on the issue-ad curbs as a violation of free speech. This is a risky change. Banning unlimited money for political parties might lead to the money going to bogus groups for use in even more destructive campaigns. The Democrats and Republicans in the House who bravely stood by the issue-ad controls against relentless attacks by special interests will no doubt be upset over such a concession.
But with the issue-ad curbs out of the bill, there will at least be no excuse for other Republicans not to sign on to reform. However distrustful and upset they may be, Democrats should be prepared to go along. Reform, like any other large cause, is never something that gets achieved overnight. The battle to rid American politics of corruption has been fought since the late 19th century. Allowing independent groups to raise unlimited money for phony issue ads is far from ideal. But a ban on soft money for the parties would be a significant step in the long, grinding effort to drive corrupt money out of the process.
It is clear from the 252-to-177 vote in the House that a strong consensus in both parties favors reform. More than a quarter of the Republican Party's members in the House defied their leadership and supported the bill, sending a strong message to the Senate, where campaign reform is supported by all 45 Democrats and 7 Republicans. That adds up to 52 votes, a majority that can only be thwarted by the determination of Mr. Lott to engineer a filibuster to kill the bill. To get the McCain-Feingold bill passed, 60 votes are needed to cut off the filibuster.
Many of the Republican holdouts say they oppose campaign reform, especially the curbs on independent groups, as an infringement of free speech. But the ban on corporations contributing to candidates has been in effect since 1907. The ban on donations by unions was enacted in 1947, and the Watergate-era ceiling on contributions to candidates by individuals and political action groups has been in effect for 25 years. Extending these curbs to political parties is not a radical change.
Mr. McCain is also making a novel argument to these Republicans that campaign reform might even make tax cuts for the average citizen more achievable. The $792 billion tax cut bill passed this summer was loaded with so many favors for individual businesses, stuffed into the bill because of campaign donations, that hardly any money was left over for taxpayers of modest means.
If these Senators are not willing to listen to voters demanding reform, then they should listen to a growing chorus of business leaders who are also demanding a ban on soft money. The Committee for Economic Development began by enlisting executives from General Electric, Merck, Xerox and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Its ranks are growing with executives from Hasbro, Prudential, International Paper and State Farm Insurance. Businessmen use words like legalized bribery to describe the current fund-raising system.
Mr. McCain should direct his lobbying to Republicans with a record of some independence or those who have complained eloquently about being forced to become fund-raising automatons. Now is the time for Republicans like Richard Lugar of Indiana, William Roth of Delaware, John Warner of Virginia, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and George Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio to show some of the gumption their constituents have come to appreciate. As for Democrats unhappy about dropping the regulation of independent "issue ads," we understand the difficulty of dropping a vital measure long supported by this page. But it makes sense to win what is achievable now and then move on to greater battles to come.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Even a Mouse That Roars Can Sit on the Sidelines

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
BUILD a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. It stands to reason that the time-worn adage about innovation and capitalist reward would apply to better mice as well, at least of the computer variety.
By that measure, the vertical mouse, which resembles a gamer's joystick, ought to be poised for commercial success. Last week, The International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, a respected quarterly, published a study that said switching to the odd-looking mouse had reduced the pain suffered by computer users in their hands, arms and necks and also trimmed the number of workdays lost to sick leave. 
 Still, if the past is any guide, the Anir Vertical mouse, also known as Dr. Mouse, faces an uphill struggle, and its producer, Animax International of Norway, will not be minting a fortune anytime soon.
Industry history, economics and human nature resist an insurgent product unless it promises a huge improvement in price or performance or some other benefit. Economists call the forces favoring the incumbent product "lock-in" and describe the steep hurdle faced by an innovative newcomer as high "switching costs."
"Often, it's the brain that is the real lock-in -- people's habits are so difficult to change," said Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
The producers of ergonomic computer keyboards and mice have found it frustratingly difficult to make major inroads. As many as 20 percent of the nation's 150 million computer users, especially those working on their machines for four hours or more a day, are considered by experts to be at risk of suffering repetitive stress injuries. Most ergonomic products try to reduce the strain of computer work by putting the hands in a more natural position -- tilted with the thumbs raised somewhat instead of having the hands splayed flat, as they are when typing on a conventional keyboard or when manipulating a standard mouse.
The most successful ergonomic product by far has been the Microsoft Natural Keyboard, a wave-shaped, split keyboard that raises the thumbs and separates the hands. Indeed, Microsoft's hardware unit -- which produces mainly keyboards, mice and joysticks -- is a quiet success story within the software giant.
It is also a success story that contradicts the repeated claim of the company's critics that Microsoft owes its success to the inherent and unfair edge it enjoys because of its industry-standard Windows operating system. Microsoft has no natural advantage in hardware other than a well-known brand and deep pockets.
Yet Rick Thompson, vice president of the hardware unit, said the Natural Keyboard, introduced in 1994, did not take the market by storm, as he had hoped. Today, roughly 120 million PC's are shipped worldwide each year, nearly all of them with flat keyboards. The so-called aftermarket for replacement or enhanced keyboards is about 3 million, and one in five of those have an ergonomic design. In the ergonomic keyboard niche, Microsoft holds an estimated two-thirds of the market.
"You simply can't cause most people to change from the standard design even if your product is better," Mr. Thompson said.
Mr. Thompson's sense that the best product does not always win in the marketplace is contradicted, however, by two economists who have sided with Microsoft in its antitrust battle with the Government. Stanley J. Liebowitz, a professor of managerial economics at the University of Texas at Dallas, and Stephen E. Margolis, a professor of economics at North Carolina State University, argue in their new book, "Winners, Losers and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology" (Independent Institute) that the best products do come out on top. They say the importance of economic lock-in and switching costs are vastly exaggerated, and that Microsoft's dominates the PC software market thanks to hard work and superior business acumen.
Dr. Liebowitz and Dr. Margolis are known for their shrewd critique of a classic story about the success of a second-best product -- the Qwerty keyboard layout, which became the standard design in the 1880's when it was used in vocational schools to teach touch-typing. Later designs, notably the Dvorak keyboard, were said to allow faster typing, but they never caught on. But Dr. Liebowitz and Dr. Margolis concluded that August Dvorak had inflated his claims for his keyboard.
Yet Dr. Liebowitz and Dr. Margolis have a bit more trouble explaining away the leading modern example of what is often said to be a second-best winner, Microsoft's DOS and, later, Windows, which mimicked the look of Apple's Macintosh operating system, which was introduced in 1984. They dismiss the Mac's several-year lead over Windows, until recently, in ease of use as merely superior "elegance" -- not a real consideration, economically, they suggest.
Still, it remains to be seen whether an innovation like the vertical mouse can overcome the daunting challenges it faces.
The field study just reported seems encouraging. It was conducted by Dr. Arne Aaras, coordinator of health medical services in Norway for Alcatel, the European telecommunications company, and two assistants over six months. The study looked at 69 computer users; it measured pain by using questionnaires. Pain levels dropped 30 percent to 50 percent. Alcatel and the Norwegian Government financed the study.
Other ergonomic experts are impressed. Marvin Dainoff, director of the Center for Ergonomic Research at Miami University in Ohio, called the study powerful.
Yet the hurdles of habit and price are high. Researchers say that it takes a day or so to learn how to use the vertical mouse and that performance drops slightly.
And the Anir Vertical mouse costs $50. "Anything that knocks up the price of a system is very tough to sell," said Neal Taslitz, president of Humantouch Products.
Mouse experts at Microsoft have not ruled out a vertical design, but they are skeptical. "You have to take account of the social context in which a product will be used," said Edie Adams, ergonomics manager of the company's hardware unit. "A vertical mouse would take a lot of motivation on the buyer's part."

HEADLINE: What's Eating America? Weeds

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
NOBODY can remember the exact moment the giant cane, Arundo donax, went from being a nuisance to a state of emergency, but the day it lifted up a bridge in Norco, Calif., might do for starters. Sudden rains in 1993 had sent flood waters roaring down the Santa Ana river.
"The arundo breaks off like monstrous celery stalks that jam up against the bridge and work like a dam," said Paul Frandsen, the general manager for Riverside County parks, standing on the banks of the river early last spring. "As the water rose, it lifted the bridge right off its pylons." It did the same thing again last year. 
 The magnificent 30-foot plant has been used for everything from fencing by the Spanish conquerors to an ornamental grass. But over 20 years, it has muscled out the native cottonwoods and willows that once thrived along the banks of the Santa Ana. Slurping up nutrients pouring into the river from seven sewage treatment plants, arundo can grow seven inches a day, said Mr. Frandsen, who is battling 8,000 acres of it.
And while the state of California spends millions to remove arundo from the watershed, Greenlee Nursery, in Pomona, Calif., continues to sell it.
Arundo is one of about 300 exotic, or non-native plants invading natural habitats in the 49 continental states. And about half of them are escapees from the garden, said Janet Marinelli, a co-editor of "Invasive Plants: Weeds of the Global Garden" (Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1996).
Baby's breath, that pretty little white flower in bridal bouquets, is wreaking havoc in the dunes by Lake Michigan. "It has a 15-foot taproot, about as big around as your thigh," said Sherri Laier, an ecologist at the Point Betsie Preserve, in Michigan, run by the Nature Conservancy. The plant stabilizes the dunes, which is disastrous for species like the threatened Pitcher's thistle, which depends on shifting sand to reproduce.
Norway maples are out-competing the native sugar maples. Purple loosestrife is killing the native reeds and sedges in wetlands. Tall fescue, touted by the lawn industry as a drought-tolerant, disease-resistant grass, never goes dormant on the prairie. So farewell, native grasses.
"Invasive plants are causing about $123 billion a year in damage," said William Y. Brown, the science adviser to Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. Controlling them is now on the Presidential agenda. For centuries, plant hunters have freely traded plants, from lilacs and magnolias to tomatoes and figs, with virtually no regulations. But those golden days are numbered, as exotics from other countries have spread over about 100 million acres and are continuing to grow at a rate of 3 million acres a year (that's twice the size of Delaware).
HOW did such glorious, useful plants start eating America? Through our own doing, mostly, scientists say: acid rain, polluted water, heavy metals in the soil, nitrogen overloads, soil compaction, fragmentation by development are just a few of the human disturbances that can weaken a natural ecosystem, opening it up to disease -- and opportunistic weeds.
"Because of what people have done," Mr. Frandsen said, "we have created a monster."
Last year, the World Conservation Union cited exotic species as the second-biggest threat to biodiversity, next to habitat loss. And early this year, President Clinton issued an executive order charging the Agriculture, Commerce and Interior Departments with developing a plan for controlling invasive species and preventing the introduction and spread of new ones. At the same time, a bill is making its way through the Senate that would increase the Agriculture Department's authority to screen or even ban plants from commercial trade.
Such controls, after thousands of years of free exchange -- since that first gardener carried seeds to another campfire -- has the nursery industry worried about everything from seeds brought back from Siberia to promising ornamentals in their greenhouses right now. There are about a dozen plants on the Federal noxious weed list, but horticulturists say the regulations are poorly enforced. And though 18 state agriculture departments have drawn up invasive plant lists, compliance is voluntary. As countries like Australia, where exotic plants overrun more than half of its wildlands, set up strict requirements before a non-native plant can cross its borders, the Federal Government is considering a similar model.
But a plant that may be invasive in sunny California could be perfectly docile in the cold Northeast. "One of my biggest concerns about regulation is that it will be national, while invasive plant issues are usually regional," said Barry Yinger, a Pennsylvania nurseryman, who has made about 40 collecting trips to Japan. "Lantana is a horrible pest in Hawaii, but a great bedding plant in Pennsylvania. Yet, under national regulation it would be unavailable to everyone."
Mr. Yinger advocates regional boards, which could monitor exotics and serve as a local early warning system for invasives.
Craig Regelbrugge, a senior director at the American Nursery and Landscape Association, would like to see voluntary compliance, if only out of the sheer impossibility of regulating plants in a global economy, where orders fly across the Internet and gardeners are constantly crossing borders (with seeds and cuttings in their bags). "The last thing the nursery industry wants is an absolutely balkanized marketplace," he said, "where every little village has its own plant list and the marketplace becomes so fragmented you can't even keep up with it and do business."
Many growers feel that they -- and their plants -- are being scapegoated by a culture unable to face up to its own mess.
"These plants aren't big, evil villains that have invaded pristine nature," said John Greenlee, the Pomona nurseryman who insists on his right to sell arundo in California. "They are indicators of disturbance. The river has already been trashed and turned into a channel. Native plants have already been removed."
Mr. Frandsen, the arundo warrior, paints the same scenario, with the opposite conclusion "You can't reverse this," he said. "You can't ship the people out and take it back."
So you weed.
Seven years ago, Mr. Frandsen assembled a coalition of about 20 groups usually at war with one another -- from the Nature Conservancy to the herbicide maker Monsanto to firefighters and flood control officials -- to declare war on arundo. And all spring and summer, youth workers from the California Conservation Corps were wacking back the weed with almost military zeal.
But as soon as these teams turn their backs, the giant reed resprouts -- like something from "The Day of the Triffids." So they nuke it with herbicides.
"We can't ever stop doing it," said Mr. Frandsen, who is pushing for a state water bond issue that would funnel $20 million to control the cane. In 10 years, Team Arundo has brought 500 acres back to cottonwoods and willows, and the least-billed vireo, an endangered bird, has a place to nest again.
The Nature Conservancy fights the same battle on 14,000 preserves around the country. "If we are going to protect the diversity of native plants and animals, we have to do weed control or weed prevention," said Dr. John M. Randall, the group's invasive plant specialist. "We cannot simply fence these properties off and walk away."
Like many conservationists, he says it is important to focus the limited time and money available on saving the most diverse, rare habitats, and also on preventing the entry of new invasive species.
But new plants are the lifeblood of the horticultural world, say growers who fear that regulations will discourage new plant introductions and hurt the industry.
It's the very qualities of exotic plants -- the ability to thrive in the dry, salty conditions of a tree pit, for example -- that send plant hunters roaming the Siberian steppes.
"It is unfortunately true that the plants that are best adapted to our unnatural landscapes in cities and suburbs are often not native plants," said Mr. Yinger, who has a research nursery in central Pennsylvania. "Native plants did not evolve for our current disturbed landscapes, and it is romantic nonsense to claim that they are the answer to all our landscape problems."
In the long view of many biologists, no amount of weeding is going to keep a disturbed forest full of dogwoods and trillium.
"Conservationists are trying to preserve the remnants of what once was," said Dr. Peter Del Tredici, the director of living collections at the Harvard University Arnold Arboretum. "It's a form of creationism. It denies the existence of change, which is about evolution."
New Yorkers can see evolution taking place right in the 200-year-old forest at the New York Botanical Garden. The hemlocks are dying, the dogwoods and ashes are sick. The forest is struggling with acid rain, amd heavy metals from road runoff. The Bronx River is polluted.
Dr. Charles Peters, a forest ecologist at the garden, stood in a little grove of Aralia spinosa -- a thorny tree called devil's walking stick -- seeding itself in the sunny gaps created by fallen trees. "As the natives die," he said, "these highly invasive species come in, and say, 'Oh yeah, we can live here.' " He led the way along the banks of the polluted Bronx River, where Japanese knotweed has covered the eroded banks.
"Nature itself is fixing this," said Dr. Peters, trying to like the invaders. "These plants are photosynthesizing, they're taking water up, they're cleaning the air."
They're doing the job of the forest, in other words. "And once you start pulling out those Norway maples and knotweed," he said, "you'll have to do it forever."
So where does all this debate leave the poor gardener?
In a political state, that's where -- because simply putting an invasive plant in your garden might be hurting your local ecosystem. Or not, depending on your view.
Experts hope that people will educate themselves by reading information published by local botanic gardens and conservancies, or by attending conferences, like the one coming up at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pa., -- "Invasive Exotic Plants: Current Management Strategies" -- on Nov. 3 and 4 (215-247-5777, ext. 156). Gardeners can find out what plants are the top offenders in their states by calling local plant councils. The Invasive Plant Council of New York (518-273-9408, ext. 221), for example, lists Norway maple as the top offender. So plant a sugar maple, to give the native a leg up.
Watch the plants in your own garden, especially those lovely self-seeders, like Verbena bonaniensis, a tall, airy purple flower that comes back every year, then shows up in cracks in the sidewalk. Or across the street in your neighbor's yard. These are the sure signs of an invader.
"If you see it doing this in the garden, it's not a good species to distribute," said Dr. Sarah Reichard, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, who is developing a screening model for letting plants into the country.
And if a little Arundo donax should pop up in your garden, take a look in the mirror.
"We have to admit that part of being an American in the 21st century is disturbance and pollution," Dr. Del Tredici said. "And these are the plants that flourish in the company of people."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Economic Scene --Strong Currency, Weak Economy;
As the Yen Soars, Japan Has More at Stake Than Does U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
HOW'S this for the next big American disaster scenario? The dollar, which has been sliding relentlessly against the Japanese yen all summer and hit a 43-month low yesterday, continues to fall.
A lower dollar, by driving up the price of imports and threatening higher inflation, provokes the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates to try to deflect the threat. That spooks foreign investors, prompting them to pull their money out of American investments, letting the air out of inflated stock prices on Wall Street. Consumers, worried about their portfolios, pull back on spending and the economy falls into recession. 
 Sounds scary, right? But for all the popular fears raised by a falling currency, the direct threat to the United States economy is actually quite small.
On the other hand, the threat to Japan from a stronger currency -- by making its exports more expensive even as its economy teeters on the edge of deflation while barely crawling out of recession -- is far more grave. It should be reassuring that Japan has all the financial resources and monetary tools it needs to keep its economy growing and spare everyone else pain. But its central bankers remain frighteningly passive and unwilling to use them.
The yen began to soar early this summer after the recession-plagued Japanese economy suddenly showed signs of life. Sensing a turnaround in sunken stock and real estate prices, foreign investors bought yen, driving its value higher, so they could re-enter Japanese financial markets.
Adding to the dollar's woes is the overhang of a huge trade deficit that has reached, according to data released this week, a rate of more than $300 billion a year. The excessive outflow of dollars accompanying the trade deficit could eventually force the dollar down. That prospect may already be persuading foreign investors to lighten up their holdings of American assets. The dollar fell from about 120 yen in early summer to around 104 yesterday.
A drop in the dollar against the yen affects the pocketbooks of American consumers, who must hand over more dollars to buy Toyota minivans or Toshiba laptops. But the impact on the economy of the current slide against the yen is minimal because the dollar has not dropped against most other major currencies. Over the last several months, the dollar fell by an average of only about 2 percent against other currencies, according to Federal Reserve data. The impact is further diluted by the fact that imports account for less than 15 percent of national spending.
It might also be argued that a lower dollar can even do some good. Surely exporters think so. But there will probably be little long-term benefit from higher export sales. The Fed is currently on a campaign to slow the economy because it thinks spending is growing at an unsustainably high rate. If exports pick up, the Fed will no doubt clamp down a bit harder to offset any unwelcome stimulus.
But if a sliding dollar is little direct threat to the United States, the same is not true of the risk a swelling yen poses for Japan. Despite having a Government that is running a huge fiscal deficit of nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product and has pumped nearly $200 billion into commercial banks to get them lending money again, the Japanese economy grew at a paltry 1 percent annual rate between April and June.
"A further blow to export sales from a rising yen hardly helps," said Rudi Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But the real problem is that Japan suffers from insufficient domestic spending, causing deflation.
So what is to be done? The ultimate solution, many economists say, is to print money -- lots of money. The idea, says Professor Alan Meltzer of Carnegie Mellon University and an adviser to the Bank of Japan, is to print enough money to stop prices from falling any further. The extra yen will also dampen the rise in the yen.
But having brought lending rates down to near zero, the Japanese say that they have already pushed monetary policy as far as it can go. Mr. Meltzer vehemently disagrees.
"Even with interest rates near zero, monetary policy is not dead," he said. The Bank of Japan can, he explains, still use its infinite supply of yen to buy bonds, stocks and real estate. Buying dollars would push down the value of the yen, promoting exports. And buying assets would drive up the price of stocks and other forms of wealth, another good way to generate consumer spending. The upshot is that despite near-zero interest rates, Japan's monetary policy is still too tight.
Yet the Bank of Japan dithers. Indeed, over the weekend, a prominent monetary official stated that the bank would not throw a lot more yen into the economy even as it intervened in the currency market, at its Government's instruction.
The Bank of Japan is, in the parlance of economics, engaged in "sterilized" intervention. It is temporarily buying dollars and selling yen, hoping to stop the yen's rise. But at the same time, it is siphoning yen out of the domestic money market to keep the overall supply of yen pretty much unchanged.
"We have continually sterilized intervention," Masaru Hayami, the the governor of the Bank of Japan, said this week, "because we have provided ample funds to the market."
Most economists argue that sterilized intervention, because it keeps the relative supplies of yen and dollars constant, cannot change the relative value of the currencies.
Here's another reason to dismiss the importance of sterilized interventions. According to the most recent worldwide survey, taken in 1998, about $1.5 trillion of foreign currency trades took place every day, of which about $300 billion involve the yen. But the sterilized intervention by the Bank of Japan amounts to only a couple of billion dollars worth.
If the Japanese will not aggressively address the soaring value of the yen, will the Clinton Administration? Probably not, and for good reason.
The Federal Reserve has made clear that it would not alter its monetary policy solely to manage the value of foreign currencies. Few economists would disagree with that policy. But that leaves the Administration with only sterilized intervention itself, which will do no more good on this side of the Pacific Ocean than on Japan's side. Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury Secretary, constantly reminds investors, as did his predecessor, that the Clinton Administration favors a strong dollar. But he has limited tools to pursue that specific goal.
There is, however, little cause for despair. Limited tools do not mean no tools. Indeed, in the worst case, where speculative frenzy begins to drive the dollar to worrisome levels, Mr. Summers' use of well-timed sterilized interventions could be decisive in altering the mood of market participants.
Professor Alan S. Blinder of Princeton, and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, explains that the long-run value of the dollar versus the yen largely depends on economic fundamentals, like the relative growth rates, interest rates and prices in the two countries. For example, stronger growth in one country tends to attract capital from a country with weaker growth. And a rise in interest rates in the United States relative to rates in Japan would encourage investors to buy dollars to invest in United States financial markets, driving up the value of the dollar relative to the yen.
But day-to-day exchange rates are driven by investor expectations and speculators. The day-to-day rates can, says Mr. Blinder, depart from long-run fundamentals by wide margins and for prolonged periods.
There is, he says, Blinder's law of speculative markets. "Markets normally move in the right direction," he said, "but they exaggerate the magnitude by a factor of between 3 and 10." His point is that markets with speculators overreact and well-timed intervention by governments can move exchange rates closer to their proper levels, minimizing dislocation to exporters and importers.
Mr. Dornbusch agrees. Nothing about economic fundamentals justified pushing the yen to 80 to the dollar in 1995, he says, and nothing would justify pushing it much below its current level. If the rate drops lower than 100, he says, timely intervention by Mr. Summers and his counterparts in Tokyo could scare investors from pursuing their extreme expectations. The purpose of intervention is to make speculators bear the risk of betting wrong.
Chastened speculators might not be so quick to push the yen to 90 from 100 if they believe that the lower rate is not sustainable in the long run and that Tokyo and Washington are committed to keeping it from going that low in the short run.
So while the major onus for straightening out the dollar-yen exchange rate lies in Tokyo, the Clinton Administration is not defenseless in the wake of Japanese monetary authorities who resist doing what should come easy and cheap: turning on their printing press.

The Left's New Hope

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Facing ignominious defeat by Re publicans in New Hampshire a state whose primary he carried last time out -- Pat Buchanan is now out to wreak vengeance as a spoiler. He can taste the 13 million taxpayer dollars available to the Reform Party.
A liberal former Democratic governor, hands clasped, tells me fervently, "Thank God for Pat Buchanan -- he could elect Al Gore." 
 That's assuming the billionaire Ross Perot still owns the party he formed and can dictate its nomination. Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, Reform's electoral success, has pledged to complete his term and hopes to run in 2004. But Ross the Boss, badly beaten last time out, has a way to block Reform's reform and maintain his personal platform.
Buchanan, rejected by G.O.P. rank and file, is his warhorse. Never mind the libertarian, pro-choice instincts of most past Perot followers; by putting his anti-choice choice atop his ticket, and taking the Vice Presidential slot himself, Perot can legally add tens of millions of his own money to the taxpayer's $13 million and try to become a player again.
But my old Nixon-Agnew speech-writing colleague (I did "nattering nabobs"; Pat did "pusillanimous pussyfooters") has this strategic problem: his only success has been based on the politics of economic resentment. Blaming Asians and Mexicans for taking away jobs works in hard times, but loses all traction during full employment.
Because neither abortion absolutism nor class warfare will help him with what used to be called "Perot's people," the bolting Buchanan is giving new emphasis to his old fallback position: cultural resentment, especially of the dire influence of Jewish Americans, with anti-Castro Cuban Americans tossed in.
His selling of sellout became apparent when David Broder asked him on "Meet the Press" about assertions in his campaign book that "after World War II, Jewish influence over foreign policy became almost an obsession with American leaders." And "the Israeli lobby is the most powerful of ethnic lobbies."
Buchanan, advocate of "Arab East Jerusalem" as the Palestinian capital, plunged in deeper: "If Pat Buchanan becomes President of the United States," he said, "the foreign policy of this country and the Middle East policy of this country will be made in the Oval Office by the President of the United States alone." Implicit: And not by those rich, pushy Jews who put Israel's interest ahead of America's. He drove that dual-loyalty canard home with "I know the power of the Israeli lobby and the other lobbies, but we need a foreign policy that puts our own country first."
Was this calculated to whip up resentment at Jews' political participation, even at the cost of stimulating anti-Semitism? Of course; he knows exactly what he's doing. To pose as fair, he also imputes policy disloyalty to Americans with ties to Cuba, Greece, Armenia and a dozen other places, and is careful to say "Israeli lobby" rather than "Jewish lobby." But you know what he means.
The roots go deep. I went up against Pat on aid to Israel in Nixon's '68 campaign on the issue of the sale of Phantom jets to Israel. Buchanan argued it would get us no Jewish votes; although Nixon agreed that Jewish Americans would oppose him overwhelmingly, he urged the sale of the jets anyway because he thought the Israel of Golda Meir was a strategic U.S. asset with admirable moxie. In went a line promising a "a qualitative edge," bipartisan policy to this day.
During the Persian Gulf war, Buchanan's bile spilled out. His "amen corner" crack displayed not just his isolationism, and his deliberate leaving out of a Jewish name in a litany of expected ethnic casualties led William F. Buckley, inventor of Goldwater conservatism, to conclude regretfully that Buchanan's barbs could well be taken as anti-Semitic. When I agreed in this space, my White House comrade in arms ended our friendship.
So now Democrats root for the nativist Buchanan to get the Reform nomination just as Republicans root for the liberal Warren Beatty. Neither major party would allow those would-be spoilers to be part of the Presidential TV debates; the Reform Party would be doomed to represent the resentful fringes of left or right. You don't have to be Jewish to know that's not in America's interest.

Prices on Treasuries Rebound As Fears of Rate Increase Ease

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rebounded somewhat yesterday from the previous day's losses after tame consumer price data eased investors' fears that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates again when its monetary policy committee meets on Oct. 5.
By late in the day, the 30-year bellwether Treasury bond was up 8/32, to a price of 100 11/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.10 percent from 6.12 percent on Tuesday. Traders said early sharp gains were erased when the dollar dropped against the yen and the euro, sapping foreign investors' demand for Treasuries. 
 A weakening dollar makes foreign investors cautious about owning American securities because they could lose money converting from dollars into their own currencies.
Yesterday, the core rate of the August Consumer Price Index showed a lower-than-forecast gain of a tenth of apercent from July, while the overall C.P.I. rose three-tenths of a percent in August, after a similar rise in July. Ballooning energy prices fueled the increases in both months.
The inflation data are producing mixed signals, according to some economists, as the overall C.P.I. is slowly, but steadily, inching upward, the core rate, which excludes food and energy, continues to creep downward.
"Without question, the overall strength of the economy, particularly the recent statistics for consumer spending coupled with the slowing trend in the C.P.I., must be causing some dismay for the pre-emptive minded Fed committee," Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said referring to the Federal Open Market Committee. "At the same time," he added, "relatively benign wage pressures and favorable core inflation trends certainly provide the Fed with latitude to maintain its current policy stance."
In addition, Mr. Fine said, "the usually prescient Treasury bond market does not seem to be signaling an imminent Fed tightening, although upcoming economic data releases between now and Oct. 5 that could influence the F.O.M.C. decision process make this a fluid situation."
He added, "All things considered, another round of tightening seems likely before the year is out, with the timing of the movement yet to be determined. Indeed, history shows that those who ignore energy prices and their impact on overall inflation do so at their own risk."
Elsewhere, strong gains were posted by corporate bonds, agencies and other products that are priced off government bond yields.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Goes to Clinton; G.O.P. Moves On

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress paid their last respects today to their cherished $792 billion tax-cutting bill, then sent it to the White House for a certain veto by President Clinton.
At successive campaign-style events on Capitol Hill, Republicans said sending a portion of excess Government revenues back to taxpayers was only fair, and Democrats said the plan would require deep cuts in essential Government services while risking the country's economic health. 
 "I want you to know this is dead on arrival at the White House," said Vice President Al Gore.
The initial round in the battle over how to apportion the projected Federal budget surplus will thus go to Mr. Clinton, who says the money the Republican majority in Congress wants to use for its tax cut over the next 10 years should be split among spending programs, debt reduction and a much smaller tax cut. Mr. Clinton, who is scheduled to return to Washington early Thursday from a trip to New Zealand, is expected to veto the tax bill within days if not hours of arriving home.
Republicans remain a bit bewildered as to why their tax cut, the largest to pass Congress since 1981, generated relatively little public enthusiasm. But they have decided to cut their losses and move away from the tax-cut fight to what they consider firmer ground, their effort to hold the line on Government spending.
In doing so, the Republicans are trying to leave open the long-range question of what to do with the $3 trillion surplus expected to accumulate over the next decade, hoping they can work that out with a Republican President in a year and a half. Instead, they are now focusing on passing the spending bills needed to run the Government in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and saying they are not interested in negotiating a compromise with the White House that would trade a smaller tax cut over the long run for additional spending on Democratic priorities next year.
Passing the spending bills is a prosaic task, and the focus on doing so illustrates how the Republicans have scaled back their agenda in the face of Mr. Clinton's opposition since they gained control of Congress in the 1994 elections.
Still, it is a job that Republicans believe will resonate politically because it will revolve around the sensitive issue of dipping into next year's projected surplus of $161 billion, especially the $147 billion portion generated by excess Social Security revenues.
Although they are still a long way from making their numbers add up, Republicans say they can finance the Government's operations next year without dipping into Social Security. To do so, Republicans will have to resort to an array of budget gimmicks and use the $14 billion surplus expected to be generated next year by general tax revenues.
Still, they are basically daring Mr. Clinton to prove he can do any better, asserting that for the White House to make good on its promises to spend more on education, health, the environment and other areas would require one of two politically unacceptable steps: raising taxes or raiding Social Security.
Both parties for decades have routinely spent payroll tax revenues earmarked to pay future Social Security benefits, simply issuing Government I.O.U.'s to Social Security in return. But with the budget surplus swelling, Republicans and Democrats alike have pledged to keep their hands off the Social Security money, in effect designating that it be used to reduce the national debt.
"We say right now that we will not allow this President to spend the Social Security trust fund dollars," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
Administration officials said they could make their budget add up without touching Social Security, though through steps like an increase in tobacco taxes that Republicans say they will never accept. White House officials are primarily interested in luring or pressuring Republicans to come to the negotiating table to take up not just next year's spending bills, but also a broader agenda of issues including Social Security, Medicare, the national debt and tax cuts.
"Obviously we are going to reject this partisan, fictional budget," Mr. Gore told the Democrats' rally on Capitol Hill. "But in the aftermath of its rejection, we want them to come back and work out a reasonable solution so that we can avoid the kind of train wreck that they have headed us toward."
White House officials said the best forum for compromise might prove to be the Senate Finance Committee, which is developing legislation to deal with Medicare's financial problems and to add a prescription drug benefit to the program. The committee is one of the few in Congress over the last few years to have a record of bipartisanship.
"If the Senate Finance Committee were to undertake Medicare in a serious way," said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, "one thing could lead to another in ways that make it too soon to rule out having a broader, more comprehensive set of outcomes."
There is also talk among Republicans of trying to use a routine tax bill that is likely to come up for consideration in the next few months as a vehicle to resuscitate some of the more popular provisions of the much larger bill Mr. Clinton is about to veto, like a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty that hurts many two-income couples. The routine bill would extend expiring tax provisions like a research tax credit for business.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was not yet sure whether there was any chance of getting a substantial tax cut signed into law this year.
But like other Republicans, many of whom feel they have come out second best in budget negotiations with Mr. Clinton over the last few years, Mr. Archer said he was suspicious that the White House would insist on gutting the ideological core of the Republican tax plan to get a deal by emphasizing income redistribution over tax relief.
"What I'm concerned about is that if the White House gets into a negotiating mode with us," Mr. Archer said in an interview, "they will want to give tax relief to people who don't pay any taxes. That runs against what we're trying to do, which is giving a refund to the people who are overpaying what the Government needs."
Mr. Archer said Republicans should be proud of having passed a big tax bill, and of "stemming the tide of the aggressive left."
But some Republicans said they were nervous about assuming that reaching a standoff with Mr. Clinton on taxes and spending amounts to an accomplishment that voters will reward in next year's Congressional elections, in which control of the House will be up for grabs.
There is a similar debate under way among Democrats in Congress and within the White House, with opinion divided about the relative merits of sticking to a defensive strategy of blocking Republican initiatives and of seeking progress through compromise.
Both parties are also gauging the risks that the fiscal standoff could escalate into a conflict that leads to a shutdown of parts of the Federal Government, as happened during a similar showdown in 1995 and 1996.

HEADLINE: HURRICANE FLOYD: THE ISLANDS;
Bahamians, Pummeled by the Hurricane, Assess the Damage

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: NASSAU, Bahamas, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Despite extensive damage to houses and land on some of the islands east of here, Bahamian officials said today that they were cautiously optimistic that they survived a pummeling from Hurricane Floyd with only one reported fatality.
Less than 24 hours after the hurricane lashed some of the islands with 140-mile-an-hour winds, officials were hampered in their damage assessments by downed phone lines, blackouts, flooded runways and insufficient aircraft. 
 Based on phone and radio reports received by disaster relief officials, the worst hit islands were Abaco, Eleuthera, Cat and San Salvador. There were reports of roofs being ripped off many homes, extensive flooding, toppled utility poles and thousands of uprooted trees.
The only confirmed death was on Grand Bahama, where a man driving along a flooded road was swept into the ocean and drowned, Godwin Blyden, the national disaster coordinator, said.
Aerial reconnaissance showed extensive damage on Little Abaco, where Mr. Blyden said several people had been reported missing.
A United States Coast Guard plane flying over Sandy Point on Little Abaco observed large swaths of land covered with fallen trees whose thin, brown limbs had been stripped bare of leaves. Almost every house visible from the air had been damaged, from complete collapse of walls that folded in on themselves, to roofs that were sent flying across the road leaving behind concrete skeletons exposed to the sky.
Though the winds were less severe on Nassau's New Providence Island, blasts of up to 90 m.p.h. sent trees crashing to the ground, and heavy rains inundated some roads. By late afternoon today, most of the roads were passable, although trees and pools of water limited passage to one lane.
"We were quite fortunate the damage was not more substantial than it is," said Mr. Blyden, who has had to rely on sporadic phone and radio contact with the most affected islands. "It's difficult to say with any degree of precision where the most serious damage occurred. We have several reports of substantial damage, and I don't want to minimize their losses."
Efforts to reach the affected areas today were delayed by a lack of phone or radio service to the islands. Although power and phones have been restored to about 50 percent of capacity in Nassau, service remains down on the other islands.
"Because there was no communication we were not certain if runways were open," Mr. Blyden said.
The United States Coast Guard dispatched several helicopters to transport Bahamian and American officials to assess the damage on the outlying islands. The Coast Guard also sent several small jet planes to conduct aerial reconnaissance. A team from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, from the United States Agency for International Development, also arrived here today to assist the Bahamian authorities.
Lee Martinez, the public affairs officer at the American Embassy, said some of the Coast Guard planes dispatched today had to first check out reports of people needing assistance before they could do a more general survey of the territory.
"They didn't find any people in distress or critically injured," Ms. Martinez said.
In one instance, a Coast Guard jet flying over Freeport circled the skies as the crew tried to find the source of a distress signal that buzzed repeatedly. It turned out to be from an airplane part near the airport.
Mr. Blyden said that there was substantial land erosion on Eleuthera, leaving several houses teetering on their foundations. He added that docks were seriously damaged and that wind and flooding had damaged several farms. On San Salvador, he said, there was extensive flooding and a lot of roof damage.
Although there were still signs of damage in Nassau, the airport as well as government offices planned to resume normal operations on Thursday. The weather was hot and sunny.
"It's absolutely perfect now," Mr. Blyden said. "The sea is calm. You would not believe a hurricane went by yesterday."

HEADLINE: Inflation Is Missing Despite Four Years of Boom

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The boom that has given such a strong lift to the American economy is four years old this quarter, but the much anticipated rise in the inflation rate, which so often mars prosperous times, has failed once again to make an appearance.
The Consumer Price Index rose in August by just three-tenths of a percent, the Labor Department reported yesterday. A spike in gasoline prices accounted for most of the increase. Prices held pretty steady otherwise, as they have month after month. Excluding food and energy, which tend to spike up in price and then fall back, the so-called core inflation rate rose only 0.1 percent in August and 1.9 percent over the last year -- the lowest yearlong rate in months. 
 "There is nothing that appears to be going up in price on a consistent basis," said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, who helps to calculate the monthly C.P.I.
By the standards of the last 25 years, mild inflation after so many years of strong growth is an anomaly. Stock traders and investors, uncertain how to interpret the low August number, responded to the C.P.I. report by driving up the Dow Jones industrial average by more than 80 points in early trading, then letting it fall by 108.91 points, to close at 10,801.42.
The early run-up in stock prices suggested that Wall Street initially interpreted the mild inflation number as reducing the odds that the Federal Reserve's policy makers would raise interest rates at their Oct. 5 meeting. Higher rates tend to drive investors out of stocks. And then later in the day, the initial interpretation seemed to be reversed -- perhaps because of Tuesday's report that retail sales had jumped in August. People are still buying with abandon, which is potentially inflationary.
"You are talking a big rise in consumer spending this year," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. "The Fed has to slow that down."
The mild C.P.I. report is the last major economic statistic to be released before the October Fed meeting. And with each month of subdued inflation, despite the robust economy and the heavy consumer spending, the Fed's top officials appear to be coming to the conclusion that the economy has changed. The new view: Stronger economic growth is possible without rising inflation.
"There is a general consensus within the Fed, between the hawks and the doves, that you have this new higher speed limit on economic growth," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street firm.
More than many people on Wall Street, the Fed's top officials appear to be demonstrating a willingness to tolerate an economy that grows at an annual rate of 3 percent, or even a bit more. That is still not as much as the actual growth over the last four years, far and away the strongest of the current expansion. The growth since late 1995 has averaged 3.76 percent annually. But the 3 percent is considerably above the 2 percent to 2.25 percent that the Fed in the mid-1990's considered the upper limit on growth before inflation would inevitably accelerate.
In those days, the Fed responded with higher rates to slow growth, often acting "pre-emptively" before inflation actually accelerated. Now the response is less aggressive. A quarter point increase in short-term rates at the last Fed meeting, on Aug. 24, came with the statement that the risk of rising inflation should henceforth "markedly diminish."
"The Fed is sort of playing it by ear," said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Federal Reserve officials appear to increasingly accept the view that the supply of goods and services, in this country and the rest of the world, exceeds the demand and will most likely continue to do so for months to come, eliminating inflationary shortages. Then, too, a lower unemployment rate is possible without provoking inflationary wage demands. And the productivity growth rate -- measuring the rising output of a worker for each hour on the job -- has gone to a higher level, if not permanently then for the time being.
"An unanticipated increase in the rate of growth of productivity is an example of a favorable supply shock, temporarily lowering inflation," Lawrence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said in a recent speech.
Measurement changes also play a role. Even with energy and food included, the C.P.I. has risen by only 2.3 percent for the 12-month period ending with August. But changes in the way the C.P.I. is calculated, to improve accuracy, have reduced the C.P.I. by four-tenths of a percentage point a year since 1995. If the old practices were still used, the 12-month average would be 2.7 percent, not 2.3 percent.
Still, other than price spikes for gasoline and for citrus fruit, the August report was notably weak. Prices for new cars and trucks fell. So did apparel prices, computer prices and airline fares, thanks to discounting. Health care costs have plateaued since last summer at an annual increase of 3.4 percent, less than forecasters had expected.
Despite rising home prices, shelter costs were up 0.2 percent in August and only 2.2 percent the last 12 months. And while gasoline prices rose 5.6 percent in August and citrus prices by 4.8 percent, both seem likely to increase by smaller amounts in September, according to various estimates. Tobacco prices, however, which had fallen by 1.3 percent in August, are expected to spike upward this month as a result of price increases announced by the cigarette companies.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
A Maker of Deals Tiptoes Out of City Hall

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
THE announcement last month that Thomas L. McMahon was resigning as director of the City Council Finance Division did not exactly qualify as press-stopping news.
Mr. McMahon's role, after all, was to work behind the scenes at City Hall, translating the headache-inducing details of the city's $35 billion budget for the 51 Council members and trying to persuade the Giuliani administration to take their spending priorities seriously. Most days, he holed up in a dingy building across from City Hall, conducting meetings, drafting policies and poring over spreadsheets. 
 If this sounds like a form of municipal abuse, that would be news to Mr. McMahon. Numbers, issues, frustration and diplomacy were simply part of growing up on Staten Island as one of seven children. His father was an insurance underwriter, his mother a waitress. Being one among many taught him that "we have to look out for each other and do our part," he said.
That still doesn't explain how he managed to tiptoe through the political minefield that separates the Mayor's office from the Council chamber. And as a professional deal maker, Mr. McMahon is too discreet to say. But it would be an oversight to let him slip off to his new job -- as lobbyist in chief for the New York City Partnership -- without taking stock of the McMahon decade in City Hall.
While he toiled in relative obscurity, Mr. McMahon was instrumental, by all accounts, in making the Council a credible counterweight to the Mayor in the budget process. As one of the few people who actually understood the budget, he wielded considerable influence over city spending, leading the Council's annual fight against mayoral plans to spend too little, cut too much or attempt a fiscal gimmick. As the most forthcoming person at the negotiating table, he was a boon to City Hall reporters seeking updates.
And as a laid-back fellow who seemed incapable of throwing a tantrum or holding a grudge, Mr. McMahon, 44, was one of a handful of people in City Hall admired by just about everyone. "He's always been honest, intelligent, straightforward, no hidden agendas," said Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota, who has wrangled with Mr. McMahon over budgets since 1995. "Tom has been a worthy adversary."
Mr. McMahon came to work for the City Council in 1989, just after the United States Supreme Court ruled that New York's powerful Board of Estimate was unconstitutional and ordered the city to create a new form of government. The Council gained vast new powers after the ruling, not least in budgetary matters.
Mr. McMahon had been working as an aide to Mayor Edward I. Koch, but when the Council leadership offered him the job of deputy finance director, he snapped it up. "This was an opportunity to help create a truly independent and thoughtful legislative body," he said in his new office, near Battery Park.
With Marc V. Shaw, then the Council's finance director, Mr. McMahon hired a staff of economists and accountants who could provide the Council with a detailed budget analysis for the first time. But it took a few years to learn how to press their agenda with the tough talkers who ran the Mayor's budget office. "In the beginning they would say to us, 'Boys, don't you have a ball game to go to?' " Mr. McMahon said.
BY 1994, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani came into office and proposed sweeping spending cuts, Mr. McMahon had become the Council's chief budget man, and his mettle was ready for testing. The Council sued a mayor for the first time in its history, asking a judge to force Mr. Giuliani to accept its version of spending cuts. The judge refused to rule, saying the two sides should work together, but Mr. McMahon was proud nonetheless.
In 1998, when Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who was running for governor, opposed Mr. Giuliani's plan to use tax dollars to build a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan, the administration broke off budget negotiations. For the first time, the Council passed its own budget.
That was a huge risk, Mr. Vallone said. "It was all in his hands, and there would have been nothing more embarrassing than for the Mayor's office to say, 'Look, you can't do it.' But Tom came out of it with flying colors."
Did Mr. McMahon start out wanting to be in the crossfire? Not exactly. He says he stumbled into his first government job at 20, when he skipped calculus class at the State University of New York at New Paltz one day and accompanied a friend to a meeting in Albany. The friend introduced him to Assemblyman Michael L. Pesce of Brooklyn, who offered Mr. McMahon an internship.
Mr. McMahon says that he is leaving the Council only because he is eager to take on a new challenge. But others say that he was also frustrated when Mr. Vallone tapped another aide, Bruce R. Bender, to be his chief of staff last winter.
As senior vice president for government affairs at the New York City Partnership, Mr. McMahon will promote the agenda of the city's business community at City Hall and in Albany and Washington. He will earn more than his $129,500 City Hall salary, he said, and perhaps spend more time at home in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, with his wife, Linda Gibbs, a deputy commissioner at the Administration for Children's Services, and their children, Ryann, 6, and Leo, 3.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Red hot pace of Internet stock trading cools off, pulling high flying on-line brokers back to earth.

BYLINE: By Joseph Kahn 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH some stock market pundits are still worried about irrational exuberance, Bill Hatcher, a retiree who trades stocks and options on line, worries more about misplaced melancholia.
"The sensation-mongers out there have scared everyone to death," says Mr. Hatcher, referring to the Zeitgeist of the on-line chat rooms he constantly monitors. "Whether it's Y2K, or inflation, you just don't see as many happy people out there trading now." 
 It may just be the laws of gravity. But the outlook of individual investors has been taking a dive. And that is bad news for on-line brokerage firms, which have seen trading volumes ebb recently. If the trend holds, investors are on course to trade fewer shares on line this quarter than they did in the previous three months, making it the first such sustained decline in Internet trading volume for the nascent on-line brokerage industry.
Summer is rarely a record-breaking time for stock trading. But trading volume -- on which on-line brokers depend mightily for revenues -- slumped more than just about anyone expected in July and August. September, at least so far, has not offered much relief.
A few of the indicators: Charles Schwab, the largest on-line brokerage firm, reported yesterday that average daily revenue from trades by its customers dropped 14 percent from July to August, a figure some analysts viewed as a leading indicator for the industry. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that trading in a sample basket of high-flying Internet stocks was off 2 percent for the second quarter. And two brokerage analysts downgraded earnings estimates yesterday for the Knight/Trimark Group, the biggest market maker for shares traded on Nasdaq, including many big Internet stocks.
Scott Appleby, an on-line brokerage industry analyst for BancBoston Robertson Stephens, reduced his estimates for Knight's earnings per share for the July-September quarter to 31 cents from 36 cents, or 14 percent. That is the second time in a month he has lowered his profit targets for Knight, whose revenues have skyrocketed in tandem with heavy trading in Internet stocks and individual investors' migration to on-line brokerage houses. In early August, he revised estimates for Knight downward from 40 cents. Shares of Knight fell $1 yesterday, or 3 percent, to $30.625.
"It's an industrywide issue," Mr. Appleby said. "We expected a seasonal trough in the summer. But the volume has been unexpectedly poor."
Few believe that America's love affair with on-line trading has faded. On the contrary, most analysts say that Internet brokerages have just begun to tap a huge pool of savings still stored in banks and in accounts with full-service brokers. Americans have 70 million brokerage accounts, but only 10 percent of them permit on-line trading. And as more people move their assets on line, taking a more active role in their investment decisions, trading volume tends to rise substantially.
Moreover, the decline in trading in the third quarter comes after a nine-month growth frenzy in which Internet broker transactions doubled in size. By the end of June, they accounted for one in six stock trades made in America. That pace was not viewed as sustainable.
Still, even a temporary trading slump could be hazardous to the on-line brokerage industry's health. Schwab, for example, derives almost half its total earnings from trading commissions, and most of its trades are now conducted on line. For smaller brokers -- there are three score of them competing for Internet investors now -- the dependence on trading commissions is far greater.
All have seen sharp drops in their share prices. Schwab shares have fallen by half since April and closed yesterday at $36.4375, up 6.25 cents. E*Trade has tumbled 63 percent in the same period, closing yesterday at $23.5625, down 46.875 cents.
What's more, many of the leading Internet brokers are geared for growth, not for a grinding battle for market share. E*Trade and Ameritrade, two of the best-known on-line brokers, are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to promote themselves, sacrificing earnings today for rapid growth tomorrow. Ameritrade said yesterday that it planned to spend $200 million over the next year on advertising, about as much as Mazda spent advertising cars and trucks last year.
"E*Trade and Ameritrade depend on commission much more than Schwab," said L. Russell Keene, a brokerage analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola & Thornton. He has a relatively bearish "hold" recommendation on both stocks.
Most of the Internet brokerage firms will report third-quarter earnings in early October.
Mr. Keene said he saw the first and second quarters of this year as exceptional. Internet investors, Internet stocks and Internet brokerage firms found themselves then in a virtuous circle. Investors opened new brokerage accounts and seized on high-flying Internet stocks, including the brokerage firms themselves, sending share prices skyward.
"That really fueled an anomaly in trade volumes," Mr. Keene said. "If you ignore the first and second quarter and look at the trend, what we see this year is less worrying." He said stock trading volumes were still up over year-earlier periods, even though the increase was less robust than it was in the recent past: Third quarter commissions grew 40 percent in 1997 over 1996, 30 percent in 1998 over 1997 and seem likely to grow 20 percent in 1999 over 1998, he said.
Other measures of on-line investment activity are also slowing, but not as much as trading commissions. Customers at Schwab, which reports certain operating statistics more regularly than most of its rivals, added $8 billion to the company's assets under supervision in August, allowing the firm to keep pace with expectations. Schwab also reported that it had 6.3 million customer accounts in August, up from 6.2 million in July and not far off analysts' predictions..
E*Trade and Ameritrade seemed to have slowed more, Mr. Keene said. He expects that Ameritrade will add about 50,000 new accounts for the quarter, down 50 percent from account growth in the second quarter. E*Trade, Mr. Keene estimates, will add about 200,000 accounts, well off its stellar performance in the second quarter, when 332,000 customers opened new accounts at that firm.
"There are other indicators of a slowdown in the quarter," he said. "But it is by no means a terminal slowdown. The long-term trend is still healthy." But the summer swoon may give a clue as to how fickle retail investors are. They have fired the rise of Internet brokerage firms and then given them the shivers.
"Just like we were seeing people act like cheerleaders for companies before, now you often see people just fan the fires of negativity," said Joe Andras, an electrical engineer in Laguna Beach, Calif., who manages his own stock portfolio and trades on line. "It can be frustrating, but it shows you that you have to look long term."

HEADLINE: White House Used Auditors Against a Bill

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The White House enlisted the help earlier this year of Federal regulators who were auditing banks to find bank executives who would join the Clinton Administration in opposing Republican financial legislation.
The episode, which involved 36 Federal examiners -- who are supposed to work independently of partisan considerations -- and an unknown number of banks, was described today in a Senate report and confirmed by Clinton Administration officials. 
 The report was prepared by the staff of the Senate Banking Committee at the direction of its chairman, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. Mr. Gramm has sponsored legislation, adopted by the Senate in May, that overhauls the nation's financial services industry.
The measure, which the White House has said President Clinton would veto if the full Congress approves it, would take regulatory authority away from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a unit of the Treasury, and vest it instead with the Federal Reserve. It would also relax key elements of a 22-year-old law, the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages lending to minorities, farmers, poor neighborhoods and others historically denied access to credit.
Internal E-mail messages and memorandums by officials included in the report show that regulators at the Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises 2,400 nationally chartered banks, attended a White House political strategy session last Dec. 14 concerning the legislation. Soon after the meeting, White House aides sent E-mail to top Washington officials in the Comptroller's office to assign specific areas of research. The officials then instructed bank examiners in field offices to seek testimonials from bankers about the Community Reinvestment Act.
More than a dozen banks were contacted by the examiners; one soon complained to the staff of the Senate Banking Committee that the solicitations for positive comments were inappropriate, particularly coming in the middle of routine bank examinations. The bank said the requests put them in a difficult position: whether the adoption of a public position over the legislation might be a factor in their regulatory evaluations. The report did not identify which bank registered the complaint.
After committee aides confronted the Comptroller's Office about the episode, regulators in Washington reversed their instructions to the examiners and rewrote the agency's policies and procedures manual to require that all agency employees have "no communications with national banks that could be perceived as suggesting that the examination process is in any way influenced by political issues or considerations."
Robert M. Garsson Jr., the top spokesman at the Comptroller's office, said the agency had "made a mistake, but one that was made for the best of intentions."
"It was not appropriate," Mr. Garsson said. "The basic principle is that the examination process just must be kept free from politics."
While the report said that the Comptroller's office had, with the assistance of examiners, compiled a list of 18 "pro-C.R.A." bankers from 11 institutions, Mr. Garsson said that the examiners ultimately did not find any executives to speak on behalf of the Community Reinvestment Act.
Patrick Dorton, the White House spokesman for the National Economic Council, said the episode was the result of "an interagency policy discussion on the functioning of the C.R.A."
"There was no intent or instruction for any inappropriate contacts to be made," he said. "However, we recognize that greater care must be taken to prevent even the possibility of such an impression."
But Mr. Gramm said the incident had demonstrated "an incredible misuse of power."
"It shows once again that the Clinton Administration corrupts everything," Mr. Gramm said today. "They're like a sewer leak in the main water line. They pollute and corrupt everything by making everything political."
The episode marks the second known instance in recent years in which banking regulators at the Comptroller's office were drawn into a political controversy. Three years ago, Federal banking regulators acknowledged that they should not have attended a coffee klatch held at the White House with some of the nation's most prominent bankers during the 1996 campaign.
Arranged by the Democratic National Committee, that meeting was attended by President Clinton, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Secretary and the top fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. That meeting was one of several heavily criticized by Republicans and campaign finance reform advocates, who said that the Democratic Party improperly traded access for campaign donations.
At the center of the latest controversy is the Community Reinvestment Act, which Mr. Gramm has criticized as unduly burdensome on banks, though some civil rights groups have said that by forcing institutions to lend to the under-served, the act has served as a cornerstone of ending discrimination in the economy.
The use of the examiners occurred a few weeks after the White House made a recess appointment of John D. Hawke Jr. to serve as Comptroller after the Senate had refused to act on his nomination. Mr. Hawke's recess appointment expires later this year, though he has been nominated to serve through the end of the Administration. His nomination has been delayed in large part because of the banking committee's investigation into the use of the examiners to find executives who favor the Community Reinvestment Act.
Mr. Gramm and Senate aides said that there was little evidence to indicate Mr. Hawke was involved in the political use of the examiners and that he acted promptly to stop the practice as soon as he learned of it. Mr. Gramm said that Mr. Hawke would most likely be approved for confirmation by the Senate banking committee later this month, though Senate aides also noted that when he served as Treasury Undersecretary, Mr. Hawke had attended the 1996 White House coffee meeting with the Democratic fund-raisers, bankers and regulators.
The internal communications at the Comptroller's office show that some officials were sensitive to the use of bank examiners to further a political fight. In one E-mail, for instance, a top official balked about attending political strategy sessions, and in another, an agency lawyer wrote to another official that "we need to be careful to not be perceived to be in cahoots with WH political strategizing."
During the third week in December, after a meeting at the White House, an official at the White House's National Economic Council sent E-mail to 22 top officials at the Treasury, the Comptroller's office and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans. Under the heading "C.R.A. success stories," the E-mail said the comptroller's office would be taking the lead and should "identify list of bankers willing to make statements in support of C.R.A."
On Jan. 13, officials at the Comptroller's office instructed national bank examiners "for a short list of bankers that would most likely say positive things" about the act.
Two days later, on Jan. 15, in response to a question about the request, Chris Lewis, a senior adviser to the Comptroller, wrote an E-mail to Dave Hammaker, a Deputy Comptroller for Compliance Operations, suggesting that the request for the examiners was being pressed by the Treasury Department
"I am, personally, not wholly comfortable with the request," Mr. Lewis wrote. "But the Comptroller would like us to be responsive to the Department request (within measure)."
Then on Jan. 29, executives from a large bank that the report did not identify contacted the Senate Banking committee to complain that while the bank was undergoing an examination, examiners had sought names of bank officers that the agency could cite publicly as supporters of the Community Reinvestment Act. After being contacted by the staff of the committee, the agency said the project was "undoubtedly inappropriate," according to the report.
On Feb. 5, the Comptroller issued a memorandum saying that "contacts we may have with a national bank through the examination process concerning legislative or political issues might be misperceived as implying that the bank should take a particular position on such issues.
"Accordingly," the memorandum continued, "it is imperative that no communications be made with the banks we supervise that could be perceived as suggesting that the examination process is in any way colored by political considerations."

HEADLINE: Senate Keeps Ban on Fuel Standards Study

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Senate rejected an attempt today to lift a five-year ban on Government studies into whether fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks should be raised.
The 55 to 40 vote to maintain the freeze was a victory for the auto industry, which insists that the imposition of tougher fuel standards, particularly on sport utility vehicles, would result in cars that are less safe, have higher costs and provide fewer consumer choices. 
 In 1975, Congress set the corporate average fuel economy standard, or CAFE as it is known, at 27.5 miles a gallon on new passenger cars and 20.7 for light trucks. A manufacturer's average fuel economy for autos is the average fuel economy for all its cars, from the smallest subcompact to full-size sedan.
But while average gas mileage for new cars nearly doubled from 1975 to 1989, to 27.5 miles a gallon, it has since declined because of the boom in sales of sport utility vehicles, which like minivans must meet only the lower standards of light trucks.
Demands for laws to deal with this change, however, have been blocked since 1995 by the House. The Senate had gone along with the House language until this year, when Senators Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, offered a resolution to put the Senate on record as opposing the House provision.
Groups such as the Sierra Club and the Union of Concerned Scientists say an increase in standards could help the environment and that auto makers have the technology to improve efficiency without sacrificing safety or performance.

HEADLINE: Frederick P. Rose, 2d-Generation Builder And a Major Philanthropist, Is Dead at 75

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Frederick P. Rose, a highly successful builder who poured his energy into two dozen major apartment projects and an equal number of institutions that adorn the New York skyline, from Lincoln Center to Rockefeller University and the Children's Aid Society, died Tuesday night. He was 75.
He died at his home in Rye, N.Y., after a brief illness, his family said. 
 A second-generation member of a New York real estate dynasty, Mr. Rose could be found until earlier this year supervising construction of a 50-story apartment house, the Belvedere, at 29th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues.
It was the latest project for Rose Associates, which owns or manages 12,000 apartments in New York and four million square feet of commercial space.
At the same time, and with equal enthusiasm, he was overseeing construction of the $150 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History, the giant sphere that houses the new Hayden Planetarium. Mr. Rose not only wrote a $20 million check for the planetarium but also was the project leader for the trustees.
"He was a builder in every sense of the word, not just of buildings, but of institutions," said Ellen Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History.
Over the years, Mr. Rose also donated $5 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, $15 million to the New York Public Library and $18 million to Lincoln Center; in all, he gave away more than $95 million.
A forceful man with a reputation for keeping his word, Mr. Rose could breeze into a meeting, as he did earlier this year with his longtime friend and partner, Charles Benenson, and within minutes size up the situation and agree to a $24 million real estate deal for land on 44th Street, near Third Avenue, for a 51-story apartment house.
Mr. Rose was still building tall buildings while his nephew, Joseph B. Rose, current chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, labored to change the zoning laws to bar oversized towers in Manhattan.
Although the Rose family's buildings were known more for efficiency than architectural detail, Mr. Rose was most proud of building two towers that won awards for design: the Bankers Trust Building at 280 Park Avenue, near 48th Street, and a 40-story apartment house at 45 East 89th Street.
His interests ranged widely.
Mr. Rose always carried a stack of foreign currency and American dollar bills, which he would fold into intricate origami figures of birds, cows and walruses and present to his delighted friends.
At the end of a stuffy board meeting at Lincoln Center, Mr. Rose would often stroll over to a piano and play a few songs for the amusement of the other directors. He played golf up to four times a week and, last year, hired a national chess champion to sharpen his skills.
Mr. Benenson, who had been a partner in many of Mr. Rose's real estate deals since the early 1960's, said he called his friend two months ago, suggesting that they raise $100,000 from each of 10 people for the refugees in Kosovo.
The next day, Mr. Benenson recalled, the developer called back and said, "O.K., we'll do it through the American Jewish Committee, because we want to show the world that Jewish people are helping Muslims."
"Two or three days later," Mr. Benenson concluded, "we had $1.4 million. "
An engineer by training, Mr. Rose wrote in a 1994 journal commemorating the 50th anniversary of his graduation from Yale University that the central focus of his life had been his family. He wrote that he had been on the boards of 35 organizations, from Con Edison to Yale University. He took pride in being a builder.
Finally, he wrote: "I don't read trash, watch TV or have an interest in spectator sports. This leaves time for active participation in things I enjoy: music, chess, tennis, golf, travel, skiing and friendship."
Mr. Rose's insistence on providing advice and hiring consultants for projects to which he had contributed sometimes rankled other developers, but institutions and their directors embraced him.
Until recently, Mr. Rose was chairman of the real estate company started by his father, Samuel B. Rose, and his uncle, David Rose, in the Bronx around the time he was born, in 1923. The two brothers built small apartment houses in the Bronx before moving into Manhattan a decade later. Samuel had three sons, Daniel, Elihu and Frederick, all of whom joined the company after World War II. Frederick's son, Adam, is now president of Rose Associates.
Mr. Rose married his teen-age sweetheart, Sandra Priest of Rye, in the early 1940's. She survives him, along with a daughter, Deborah Rose; two sons, Jonathan F. P. Rose and Adam R. Rose, both of New York; two brothers, Daniel and Elihu, and three grandchildren, Ariel, Rachael and Sarah.
Mr. Rose served in the construction battalions of the Navy Seabees during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant before he returned to New York and Rose Associates. He took charge of design and construction, while Daniel did the planning and finances and Elihu took over management of the family's apartment houses.
Mr. Rose built more than 2,000 units of middle-income housing under the state's Mitchell-Lama program, as well as the family's first office tower, at 280 Park Avenue.
But unlike some developers who showed up in the gossip columns during the 1980's and 1990's, Mr. Rose and his family avoided publicity. He usually contributed money to charities anonymously, and word of the donations rarely leaked out until years later.
"He built good-quality housing and he was devoted to community service," said Robert I. Shapiro, a real estate broker who knew Mr. Rose.
A longtime opponent of rent control, Mr. Rose converted more than 3,000 apartments in Manhattan during the early 1990's to condominiums and co-ops. Many people in the industry thought it was a risky move, given the recession.
But unlike many landlords at the time who were struggling with enormous loans, the Rose family had buildings that were largely free of debt, and the conversion went off without a hitch.
"He secretly believed he was the finest construction superintendent in the city," said his brother Daniel, who is now chairman of Rose Associates. "He liked to kick the bricks."
Mr. Rose applied the same energy, enthusiasm and discipline to his philanthropic work as his professional work, his brother said. When Mr. Rose, along with his wife, gave $15 million to Lincoln Center, he also helped engineer the construction of the Rose Building, a 31-story tower that houses rehearsal space and dormitories for the Juilliard School of Music and offices for the School of American Ballet and the New York Philharmonic.
"He had a mercurial mind and it was fun trying to keep up with him," said Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center. "He was a man of the world in every sense of the word. I'm really going to miss him."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
League Presidents Out As Baseball Centralizes

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 15

 BODY:
From Morgan Bulkeley in 1876 to Leonard Coleman in 1999, from Ban Johnson in 1901 to Gene Budig in 1999, the National and American Leagues have had presidents who operated offices separate and apart from one another. No longer.
Major league club owners voted unanimously today to abandon the traditional arrangement and consolidate all operating functions in the commissioner's office. 
 "This is an historic moment that many have felt was long overdue," said Commissioner Bud Selig, who spearheaded the move to consolidate such matters as umpiring, scheduling and discipline. At the same time, Selig stressed that the leagues would remain separate and competitive on the field.
The move, which apparently generated little or no opposition among owners but drew a negative vote in the executive council from Coleman, was the primary piece of business the owners conducted, but also among the least controversial.
The owners, meeting near the Hall of Fame at the Otesaga Hotel, declined to approve the sale of the Oakland Athletics and the Kansas City Royals, causing concern about the future of both franchises. They took no vote on the sale of the Montreal Expos, who asked for a delay, but they approved the $67 million transfer of the controlling ownership shares of the Cincinnati Reds from the controversial Marge Schott to Carl Lindner, a billionaire Cincinnati businessman (Chiquita bananas), who has been a limited partner.
In announcing the act of centralization, Selig said that Budig has been offered the role of senior vice president for educational and government affairs in baseball and confirmed that Coleman was resigning as the National League president after the season. But, Selig added, Coleman will serve as senior adviser to the commissioner and president of Major League Baseball charities.
"I did not want to serve in a ceremonial post or be a figurehead," Coleman said. Earning a $650,000 salary in his sixth year as National League president, Coleman, who is black, has been the most outspoken advocate within baseball for the hiring of members of minority groups in decision-making positions.
At least two of the functions that have heretofore been handled by the league presidents will have to be negotiated with baseball's players and umpires unions. Placing the umpires under the supervision of the commissioner's office is expected to be an issue in the upcoming negotiations for a new labor agreement to replace the current one, which expires Dec. 31. The umpires' lawyer, Richie Phillips, maintains that the move constitutes a change in terms and working conditions. Centralization was one of the issues that triggered the recent dispute that led to the loss of jobs for 22 umpires.
The players' labor representatives have said a change in meting out disciplinary measures for players must also be negotiated. "This is all about eliminating redundancy and being more efficient in the league office," Jerry Colangelo, managing partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, said. "Baseball's unique with two leagues. I know there's tradition involved, but I don't think this takes anything away from it."
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations in the commissioner's office, is expected to oversee much of the consolidation. He will most likely have umpiring supervisors working under him, and baseball will very likely name someone to be the official who determines discipline for on-field personnel, as other leagues have.
Selig, at a news conference following the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, ticked off ways in which the leagues will remain separate and retain their identities: the All-Star Game, the World Series, league records, the debate among fans over which league is better. The American League's designated hitter will not be affected by today's change.
Baseball, Selig said, "has had to re-evaluate how it operates its business off the field." Separate functions, he added, have "become an encumbrance that inhibits sound and timely decisions."
"We're getting ready for the 21st century," Selig said.
Some of his constituent teams, however, may go limping into the next century. Miles Prentice, a New York lawyer, heads a group of 42 investors who have agreed to buy the Royals for $75 million, but the owners voted, 29-1 today, with the Royals being the one, to ask the Royals to consider other alternatives.
The owners voted by 28-2 (the Athletics and the Chicago Cubs cast the no votes) to take no action on the $122.4 million sale of the Athletics until a Selig task force completes its study of baseball economics.

HEADLINE: Bank and Developer Seek to Buy Site for 42d Street Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A Canadian bank and a developer are in negotiations to buy a highly coveted development site for a new 35-story skyscraper at one of the most desirable corporate addresses in the city, Madison Avenue and 42d Street.
Although no deal has been signed and there are several other potential buyers circling the parcel, the Brookfield Properties Corporation and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the prime contenders for the property, according to rival bidders and real estate executives. An agreement could be struck by the end of the month between Brookfield and the current owner, Credit Suisse First Boston, they say. 
 It is a bittersweet moment for Harry B. Macklowe, a developer with sharp elbows who put together the parcel two years ago for a skyscraper of his own that would mark his comeback to the top ranks of the real estate industry. But as part of a settlement with his lender, Mr. Macklowe was finally forced to walk away from the building this week.
The largest bank in Canada, C.I.B.C. has crisscrossed the city in search of a prestigious location for headquarters since it lost a deal last year to move to 7 World Trade Center. Two large but nearly vacant office towers and several smaller buildings would be demolished to make way for the new 1.1 million-square-foot skyscraper, near Grand Central Terminal on the west side of Madison Avenue, between 41st and 42d Streets.
"It's a wonderful site," said Scott Resnick, whose company, Jack Resnick & Sons, like Jerry I. Speyer, Stephen M. Ross, Boston Properties and Blackstone Real Estate Advisers, has tried to acquire the property. "I wouldn't say it's a fait accompli," he added, "but Brookfield and C.I.B.C. have emerged as the front-runner. That's why we've backed off a bit."
According to city officials, John E. Zuccotti, a former city official and a real estate executive who oversees Brookfield's New York operations, and the bank have already talked to the city about a tax break.
First Boston has no intention of declaring a victor before a deal is done or another more lucrative offer lands on the negotiating table. "At any given moment, there have been a number of front-runners," said William V. Adamski, co-head of the real estate investment banking group at First Boston. "We'll do what makes sense for our institution."
If a deal is consummated, it would be a sweet victory for Mr. Zuccotti, Richard B. Clark and others at Brookfield. They were part of Olympia & York, New York's largest commercial landlord until the recession put the company into bankruptcy court. Mr. Zuccotti and Mr. Clark have been eager to resume building ever since Brookfield took over the remnants of Olympia & York.
For Mr. Macklowe, 62, the settlement with his lender, First Boston, over $250 million in loans was something of a defeat. He gave up his interest in the development but got control of two other buildings and up to $9.5 million in fees from First Boston for acquiring air rights for the Madison Avenue project.
"We took a very dispassionate economic view of the situation," Mr. Adamski said. "Harry ended up losing a property where he wanted to build a major skyscraper. What was relevant to me was what maximized the proceeds for our institution."
An aggressive developer, Mr. Macklowe became infamous in 1985 when one of his contractors razed two of single-room-occupancy hotels on 44th Street only days ahead of a city-imposed ban on demolition. One of his executives eventually pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and an irate Mayor Edward I. Koch returned Mr. Macklowe's $10,000 campaign contribution.
Mr. Macklowe disputes any notion that he is in financial straits. "I've built three buildings," he said. "I'm back in the development game."
Mr. Macklowe was referring to three different apartment houses, including one under construction at 28th Street and the Avenue of the Americas. But in a city of skyscrapers, it is the people who build the commercial towers that spike the New York skyline who are considered to be the industry elite. And no one in the industry expects Mr. Macklowe to build an office tower.
"Residential projects tend to be less economically and physically glamorous and less scary," said Thomas Falus, president of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial broker. "Commercial buildings tend to be big and splashy. The dimensions are different in every sense."
First Boston and the other investment banks that fueled the current real estate boom have taken a tougher stance with troubled developers than the commercial banks and pension funds did during the recession in the early 1990's. Lenders took months and even years to work out problems with builders who had defaulted on their loans. By contrast, First Boston moved quickly to resolve its dispute with Mr. Macklowe.
"They're prepared to do whatever it takes to maintain the greatest level of control over the assets in which they've invested," said Scott Latham, a managing director at CB Richard Ellis.
Mr. Macklowe might have been able to salvage his comeback bid on Madison Avenue had he been able to land a tenant for the building. But the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and other companies were unwilling to strike a deal with the developer.

HEADLINE: Creator of Tetris Looks for New Ways to Dazzle and Beguile

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
IF ever there was a common touchstone of cyberculture, it is the engaging little computer game known as Tetris. This first truly cross-platform, cross-generational, across-the-sexes digital diversion is, some 15 years after its birth, still drawing players to all manner of computers -- from desktops to electronic organizers -- to play it.
And 15 years later, people in the gaming industry are still drawn to the creator of Tetris, 44-year-old Alexey Pajitnov. That suits him fine. Making games, playing them and discussing how much fun they are to make and play have been a large part of his life since he was a clever boy growing up in his native Moscow. 
 There was very little to do for entertainment, he recalls, in what was then the Soviet Union. So he occupied himself mostly by solving complex mathematical puzzles on paper. He soon graduated to solving three-dimensional puzzles like Rubik's Cubes. "I loved them all," Mr. Pajitnov said in a heavy Russian accent that makes him sound more like a cosmonaut than an American-based game designer.
But his creation of Tetris in the mid-1980's has made Mr. Pajitnov, a man with a boyishly round face framed with a full beard, a celebrity in game circles and somewhat beyond. In Japan, the birthplace of the Sony Gameboy, the handheld game device that helped to sell more than 30 million copies of Tetris, Mr. Pajitnov is hounded by autograph seekers. In professional game conferences around the world he is often regarded as a living legend, a sort of stocky Jedi master of computer code and game play.
"He created what I still think is the single most addictive game ever made," said Cliff Bleszinski, the lead game designer for Epic, a computer game company based in North Carolina.
Mr. Pajitnov is hoping to strike gold again with a new game on CD-ROM called Pandora's Box. The game, which is being released this month by Microsoft, is a collection of 10 visually dazzling puzzle types with more than 350 individual variations. The puzzles are connected in a plot line that carries the player around the world restoring order wrecked by seven tricksters released from Pandora's box. The game is rooted, Mr. Pajitnov says, in his time-tested theme: players' instinctive urge to replace chaos with order.
"The way he thinks about the customer, and how they approach the game, and what they are going to get out of it, he almost seems like a psychologist," said Ed Fries, general manager of the Microsoft game group. "He's in your head and he is thinking about what he is going to do to make this game compelling to you."
Mr. Pajitnov's approach to computer games is certainly not accidental. By the time he was 14, Mr. Pajitnov, whose mother was a journalist and whose father was a philosopher, writer and political dissident, had fallen into the mind-whirling embrace of advanced mathematics and strategy games. The former he studied hard; the latter he explored gleefully. He earned a master's of science degree in applied mathematics from the Moscow Institute of Aviation and did postgraduate work at the Academy of Science Computer Center in Moscow. All the while he continued to play games, even designing some to test the computers at the center, where he also worked as a programmer in speech recognition, artificial intelligence and computer-assisted design.
In the midst of his heady research, Mr. Pajitnov decided that he was more interested in "bringing the computer to people, directly," as he put it. At first, he said, he tried to find ways of using the computer to help unlock psychological processes. Nothing really came to fruition, but he gained an extraordinary understanding of the psyche, he said, a kind of engineer's insight into human behavior. "That kind of helped," he said, in deciding what he would do next.
In about two weeks in 1984 he wrote the primary computer code that would become Tetris. He recalled that he could have written it more quickly, but he found the game so compelling, even in its embryonic stages, that he kept playing rough versions, telling himself that he was "testing it." After many refinements, the game finally made it to the West in 1988 by way of a Hungarian programming consortium.
The following year the game earned four Excellence in Software Awards, the computer game equivalent to the Oscars, from the Software Publishers Association. Since then, the game has sold some 50 million copies in many variations.
"Tetris is one of the few games that has transcended the casual gamer and the hard-core gamer," Mr. Bleszinski said. It is widely believed that even the occupants of the Russian space station Mir passed some of their idle hours circling high above Earth playing Tetris.
When asked about being recognized as the creator of one of the world's most popular computer games, Mr. Pajitnov paused and spoke slowly. "The first time it is agreeable, but the hundredth time?" His voice trailed off as he shook his head.
Tetris is very unusual in that it is widely played by women, a distinction in a computer game universe that is often mapped by the tastes and habits of male players. "There is just something about it that is so appealing," said Linda Helin, the general manager of XS New York, a game arcade and cybercafe in Times Square. "I still play it."
Mr. Pajitnov said he is not surprised. "Tetris is very nonviolent," he said. "Women don't feel bad that this is some kind of stupid male activity. And Tetris is a kind of game which helps you order the world. You fight against chaos. I'm not sure it is very politically correct, but that's what women prefer to do."
Mr. Pajitnov was still living in the Soviet Union when he developed the game and so was unable to cash in on the wild success of Tetris. Under Communism, he explained, he was prohibited from personally profiting from his work. The rights to his game were given up to the State for 10 years. Only recently, years after he emigrated to the United States in 1991, have the rights to the game reverted to him. "I'm getting some royalties," he said beneath his breath, conceding that the game's economic life is all but over. "I'm losing my humor sense about it."
He'd much rather talk about games than the fortune that got away. "I am always thinking about how he will be puzzled," Mr. Pajitnov said of a potential player, "how he will be intrigued, how he will figure it out and how to fool him." Central to his method of creating computer-based puzzles is to try to create those that will interest and hold his attention. Then he "simplifies, simplifies, simplifies, simplifies until it is understandable." His reason for this, he said, is simple: "It's a lot of frustration when you are just confused on how to operate the puzzle."
After running his own company in the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and working for others in the United States, Mr. Pajitnov created a string of relatively successful games like El-Fish, Welltris and Hatris. In 1996 he joined Microsoft as its first game designer.
Today he is one of 10 game designers nestled in offices on one of Microsoft's campuses just outside Seattle. His second-floor office is comfortable, he said, overlooking the Microsoft cafeteria building.
"Whatever skills I have I use," Mr. Pajitnov, who is married and the father of two sons, said of his work for Microsoft. Dismissing his star status, he shrugged and said, "I'm a working person."
And now he is making the media rounds around the country to talk about his latest project, Pandora's Box.
"Our main goal it to give you a good time, a relaxing time," he said as he mouse- clicked his way through one of the new game's puzzles that requires players to restore the famous form of Rodin's "Thinker" from globs of 3-D pieces.
"Myself, I love this kind of puzzle," he said with an impish grin. "It is kind of meditative stuff."

HEADLINE: Little Theaters Are Suddenly In Demand Yet in Peril

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
For 12 years the 74-year-old Biltmore Theater has stood dark and lifeless, blackened by fire damage, crumbling with neglect.
Now with Times Square suddenly prime real estate and theaters in increasingly great demand, people are fighting over the 948-seat house, at 261 West 47th Street. 
 The battle, between a real estate developer, who says he wants to restore and book the theater, and the Nederlander Organization, which says it may try to more than double the house's size so that it can accommodate musicals, has cast a light on some of Broadway's most beautiful and neglected jewel boxes: the small, two-balcony theaters, mostly on the less popular east side of Broadway, that have fallen into disuse.
Theater operators, who had considered these properties obsolete money losers, and real estate interests are now vying over at least three of the theaters, suggesting that a recent trickle of serious, straight drama on Broadway could lead to a busier future for houses like the Biltmore, Belasco, Cort and Lyceum. Yet the strengthening real estate market in Manhattan could threaten the theaters as never before.
There is new interest in the Lyceum Theater on West 45th Street, which has been dark 70 percent of the time over the last 12 years, according to a report by Richard Frankel, one of several Broadway producers interested in putting a tourist attraction in the theater.
Pointing to a number of successful plays in smaller theaters, including last season's "Blue Room" at the Cort on West 48th Street, Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said, "All of this bodes well for the future." He once campaigned unsuccessfully against designating the theaters as city landmarks, arguing that theater owners should receive tax breaks or other compensation for the burden of operating under landmark status.
Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said: "Do we have a new paradigm? I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. This season if you had a telephone booth you could book it if it had a fire exit."
Indeed, Broadway theaters are booked to capacity.
The battle over the Biltmore involves all the issues that are likely to shape the theaters' future.
Joseph Moinian, a real estate developer, said he wanted to restore the Biltmore and build a 43-story residential hotel next to it. He is suing the Nederlanders, the prominent theater owners, arguing that the organization improperly terminated his contract to purchase the property because real estate values had tripled since 1997, when he arranged to buy the property for $14.4 million. Owners believe that the Biltmore can fetch a higher price, he argued.
The Nederlanders have moved to dismiss Mr. Moinian's complaint on the ground that he failed to show up for the real estate closing last April, thereby defaulting on the deal. The theater owners are considering transforming the Biltmore into an 1,800-seat theater as they shop it to other prospective buyers.
The Biltmore's interior became a city landmark in 1987, as did the interiors of five other Broadway theaters, meaning that any changes made for a production, like taking out rows of seats to expand the stage, must be reversed after the show closes.
"One of the options they're considering is rehabilitation of the interior and exterior in compliance with landmark regulations," said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Nederlanders, in reference to the Biltmore. "They will either sell it or rent it or retain it. They're looking at all three options."
On Monday, Judge Herman Cahn of State Supreme Court in Manhattan heard arguments in the case.
The prospects for the Biltmore are sharply different than they were in the 1980's, when all of Broadway's theater owners fought landmark designation for theaters that they did not see as economically viable. These small theaters are difficult to book because many people do not want to sit in a second balcony and producers need a certain seating capacity to earn a return on their investment.
Larger theaters like the Gershwin, the Majestic and the Marquis each have about 1,600 seats and only one balcony. And some theaters, like the Helen Hayes, rarely use their second balconies.
Can theater owners be blamed for wanting to update these small houses or get rid of them? "Most of these buildings are approaching 100 years old, and you can't just recreate them easily," Mr. Bernstein said. "By the same token you can't remodel them easily.
"So it's really hard for theater owners to grapple with the problem. There is no other business I can think of where the owners of the factories are still operating with the same plant as they were 100 years ago."
In the early 1990's theater owners struggled to fill seats because of the economic downturn, and some sought to unload their properties. In 1991, for example, the Nederlanders sold the Mark Hellinger theater to the Times Square Church. About three years later, the Shubert Organization agreed to install a community court in the Longacre Theater for three years.
The Biltmore is not the only house of its size that is suddenly coveted. Two blocks down, a fight is raging over the fate of the foundering Lyceum on 45th Street. Several producers want to open an hourlong show geared toward tourists, "The Spirit of Broadway," which would run several times a day. But Mr. Schoenfeld contends that the production is not a legitimate theatrical attraction and does not belong in the Lyceum.
Although he called the Lyceum a money-losing liability when he sold the Lyceum's air rights to Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company, Mr. Schoenfeld nevertheless said: "We're not interested in doing anything other than preserving these theaters for the presentation of legitimate theatrical attractions."
Another developer holds a similar option at the Belasco, a Shubert theater.
Despite the recent demand for Broadway houses of almost any size, many people in the theater district say the Biltmore-sized theaters do not have much of a long-term future.
Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the two-balcony Walter Kerr Theater, said he believed that the demand would change with the economy. "The future of the two-balcony playhouse is still extremely grim right now," Mr. Landesman said. "There's a theater shortage and booking backlog, but it's not going to last. We've been through these cycles before."
As a result, Mr. Landesman said, he does not consider the Walter Kerr newly valuable property. "If I can get a good price, I would take it," he said "It's tough to book."
The Biltmore, home of "Barefoot in the Park," "Hair" and "My Sister Eileen," was built in 1925. Designed by Herbert J. Krapp and developed by Irwin Chanin, the neo-classical theater needs extensive repairs.
Mr. Moinian said he originally intended to turn the Biltmore into a lobby for the adjacent high rise he planned to build on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 47th Street and 48th Street, which he would call the Biltmore. But because of the theater's landmark interior, Mr. Moinian said the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission informed him that such plans would be impossible.
Mr. Moinian said he proceeded with plans to restore the theater. Unable to locate the original blueprints, Mr. Moinian hired an architectural firm, Issac & Stern, that recreated the plans from scratch. He then hired the architectural firm Li Saltzman, which specializes in restoration. The plans were submitted to the Landmarks Commission.
Terri Rosen Deutsch, the chief of staff for the landmarks commission, said, "When we heard about the litigation, it was decided we would wait to hear the outcome on ownership before any permits were issued."

HEADLINE: The Renegade As Rejuvenator

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is a history professor at Columbia and the author, most recently, of "Liberalism and Its Discontents."

 BODY:
Fourteen months before the 2000 election, the Presidential race is running in full gear and sinking from utter torpor. The two front-runners are conducting campaigns so cautious and so vacuous that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another. Nor have their principal challengers defined themselves clearly.
But suddenly, a somewhat shopworn face emerges to roil the waters: Pat Buchanan, apparently set on running for President as the Reform Party candidate. Now both George W. Bush and Al Gore must deal with a challenger determined to dredge up all the economic and cultural issues they have tried to submerge. 
 Third-party candidacies are a recurrent feature of American political life, but they take on a special importance in years when the main parties fail to address matters that large numbers of voters care about.
In 1968 George Wallace, the segregationist Governor of Alabama, exploited anger about social disorder and won 13 percent of the voters, who felt that Richard Nixon and Hubert Humphrey did not address their concerns.
In 1992 Ross Perot seized on the budget deficit and unhappiness with the economy and ended up with 19 percent of the vote.
Third-party candidates seldom have a chance of winning. People vote for them to make a point -- to force the political world to acknowledge the existence of a passionate belief or a searing discontent. Often, in doing so, they scare the mainstream into taking notice of them and trying to embrace (or co-opt) their grievances. In 1968, would Nixon have moved so determinedly to embrace "law and order" and his "Southern strategy," reaching out to disenchanted Democrats, if Wallace had not been breathing down his neck? In 1992, would Mr. Clinton have turned away from his proposal for a middle-class tax cut if Mr. Perot had not so effectively hectored him on the deficit?
Mr. Buchanan is a classic third-party figure -- too ideologically divisive and demagogic ever to win an election, but able to arouse voter passions similar to his own.
Like the agrarian populists of the 1890's, Mr. Buchanan is not afraid to attack the rich and, as he puts it, the "trans-national corporations whose only loyalty is to the bottom line."
Such language sounds tinny to those in the political mainstream, never more so than during the extraordinary boom of the last few years. But Mr. Buchanan is alert, as almost no other politician is, to the enormous and growing inequality that lies beneath the present abundance. If his past is any guide, he will try to exploit it in an election year in which talk of injustice has been otherwise banished to the sidelines.
But like so many populists of a century ago, Mr. Buchanan has not stuck to economic arguments alone. He fuses his class antagonisms with cultural and social grievances. He rails against abortion, homosexuality, illegitimacy, immigration, sexual license, moral decay and godlessness. Some commentators, including conservatives, have accused him of xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
A committed Roman Catholic, he is happy to make common cause with those evangelical Protestants at war against the excesses of modern culture. Such issues have far less wide-ranging appeal than the economic ones he flogged in the 1996 Republican primaries, but they do have a passionate constituency. That is why the Bush campaign, which had hoped to hold onto the party's social conservatives even while studiously ignoring them, finds Mr. Buchanan's impending defection so alarming.
What effect can Mr. Buchanan hope to have in an election year in which voters seem prematurely tired of the major candidates? Both Republicans and Democrats could lose votes to Mr. Buchanan.
But barring an unusually close election, Mr. Buchanan will probably not win enough votes to sway the election toward one party or the other. Instead, he may well pressure Republicans and Democrats to depart from their cautious, carefully scripted centrism and take a stand. Whatever one thinks of Mr. Buchanan, that may not be such a bad thing.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japanese Regulators Get a 2d 'Scalp' Under Their Belts

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 16

 BODY:
It was a signature that caught the eye of an investigator sifting through documents in the Tokyo office of Cresvale International, the Hong Kong-based brokerage firm that sold what were apparently fraudulent investments to a wide range of Japanese corporate investors.
Why, he wondered, was the head of futures trading at Republic New York Securities, a unit of the Republic New York Corporation, signing a routine letter from the back office confirming the status of a client's account? "It didn't make sense," said Kiyotaka Sasaki, who is in charge of inspections of international financial institutions at the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog. "It showed a lack of controls." 
 That question ultimately led to the arrest in the United States on Monday of Martin A. Armstrong, a show-boating investment manager who was well known among Japanese corporate investors for his persuasive sales pitches.
Mr. Armstrong, 49, has been accused by United States prosecutors of defrauding Japanese investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. Two Republic New York Securities officials, William H. Rogers, the futures trading head, and James Sweeney, the unit's chief executive, have been suspended.
Through his lawyer, Mr. Armstrong has denied any wrongdoing.
But the sleuthing that uncovered the purported fraud is likely to help burnish the reputation of Japan's fledgling financial regulators, who began operations a little more than a year ago and have struggled under severe financial and personnel constraints, considering the size and complexity of the markets and institutions they must police.
"We've had some concern about morale here," Mr. Sasaki said. "We have few resources and lots of challenges."
Mr. Armstrong's arrest is the second "scalp" the inspection department has collected this summer, coming roughly two months after regulators revoked the license of Credit Suisse First Boston's derivatives unit and imposed sanctions on the Swiss firm's other operations here for their role in helping Japanese corporations and financial institutions mask their huge losses.
Indeed, what many have assumed was dumb luck on the part of the investigators from the Financial Supervisory Agency was at least in part a matter of weaving together bits of information gleaned in previous forays into the operations of other financial institutions.
The investigators used information they uncovered during their audit of Credit Suisse First Boston and decided to take a look at Cresvale. They suspected that the brokerage firm, which was owned by Mr. Armstrong's Princeton Economics International Ltd., had sold similar financial instruments.
What they found were a group of notes, known collectively as the Princeton notes, issued by an offshore investment company based in the Turks and Caicos Islands that did not fall under the purview of any financial regulator. The proceeds from the sale of those notes and the interest they generated were supposedly held in segregated accounts at Republic New York Securities, but the Japanese regulators suspected that accounts were in fact commingled to mask losses.
Their suspicions no doubt were a result of the environment in which most of them grew up: the old, vague, opaque regulatory system administered by bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance who were particularly sensitive to the strict maintenance of "firewalls" and boundaries between financial businesses.
Indeed, the companies that were purportedly defrauded by Mr. Armstrong largely seemed to be in the dark until last week, when newspapers here began reporting that the agency had contacted United States regulators with questions about Princeton that ultimately led to Mr. Armstrong's arrest.
Junsei Atarashi, a spokesman for the Yakult Honsha Company, which stands to lose several billion yen from its investment in Princeton notes, said Yakult scrambling to collect information in May, after news broke of the investigation into Cresvale. "The people in charge of investments here bought these notes because they earned a good interest rate," he said. "We never imagined they were going to become trash."
The Amada Company and two of its affiliates could lose a total of 13 billion yen, or $125 million at current exchange rates. "We received an explanation at the time we bought these notes that the principal was secured and the accounts were separately maintained by Republic," said Koshichi Kikuchi, Amada's head of accounting. "Now we are finding out that the accounts were not separately maintained and the principal was not secured, so I can't avoid saying that we were cheated."
It was the 10 percent return that Amada had made on a previous investment in Princeton notes that enticed it into buying another set of notes this spring, Mr. Kikuchi said. Mr. Kikuchi and other company officials denied that notes were purchased to hide losses, but regulators suspect otherwise and the Japanese Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a separate investigation into corporations that have purchased Princeton notes.
Far from feeling sorry for the investors, many Japanese regard them as foolish, and in fact, Mr. Armstrong apparently did not try to sell Princeton notes to investors in any other country. "This shows a weakness in risk management on the part of Japanese investors," one regulator said.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.
 
AALY TRIO AND KEN VANDERMARK, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Vandermark, the Chicago saxophonist who recently was awarded a MacArthur award, hooks up semi-regularly with a trio of Swedes including the saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, and they make an energized semi-free jazz that's interestingly classical: it harks back lovingly to the 1970's. But it also has a bite and urgency to it. They play tomorrow at 10 P.M.; admission is $10 (Ben Ratliff). 

DOT ALLISON, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. On her album "Afterglow" Dot Allison juxtaposes eerie, languorous electronics, bleary borderline dance music and quietly torchy pop songs; this is a chance to hear if her delicacy can survive outside the recording studio. Tomorrow night at 9, in a lineup of songwriters that also includes Joe Arthur (at 8), Rebecca Gates of the Spinanes (at 10) and Eszter Balint (at 11). Admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).
BASEMENT JAXX, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. Club music like house and drum-and-bass -- even the best of it -- generally doesn't adhere to the form of an album; focusing on repetitive beats for half an hour on the headphones becomes boring at home. So the rich pleasures of "Remedy," the new album by this English house-music duo of producers, come as a surprise. There's a huge amount going on in the music, some good singers, and various samples and electronic gurgles battle it out for dominance. Tonight at 1 A.M.; tickets are $25 (Ratliff).
BETTIE SERVEERT; GAY DAD; FOO FIGHTERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Only the most diligent or well-connected fans will squeeze into this early-evening club gig by the Foo Fighters, the tartly smart power-punk band led by the former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Hype followers will show up later, to assess Gay Dad, a quietly glamorous (and possibly overrated) new English band. And die-hard fans of earnest underground rock will stick around for the formerly hyped, now just beloved Dutch group, Bettie Serveert. Foo Fighters play tonight at 7:45, Gay Dad at 10 and Bettie Serveert at 11. Admission is $15 for Foo Fighters and $10 for Bettie Serveert (Ann Powers).
BIS; SUKPATCH; TITAN. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Bis is a Scottish pop trio that pretends to be a gang of superheroes, and the ruse got that much more plausible when the group composed the title song for the Cartoon Network's "Power Puff Girls." Fans see maturity but still plenty of fun on the band's new "Social Dancing." Titan and Sukpatch, Bis's mates on the supercool label Grand Royal, share the bill. Tomorrow night at 9. Tickets are $12. Tomorrow night at 11:30, following Sukpatch (at 9) and Titan (at 10); admission is $12 (Powers).
* THE BOTTLE ROCKETS; SALLY TIMMS, KELLY HOGAN AND JON LANGFORD; PERNICE BROTHERS; KEVN KINNEY, Mercury Lounge 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The high point of this evening should be the friendly duel between two modern-day sweethearts of the rodeo: Sally Timms, who has earned much adoration over the years in the Mekons, and who just released an album that may be her best work yet, and Kelly Hogan, who established her own slavish following when in the Rockateens and the Jody Grind. The gals are neighbors in Chicago now and will share the stage with a rather more manly sweetheart, Jon Langford of the Waco Brothers (and of course the Mekons). All-American roots rockers the Bottle Rockets and the Pernice Brothers, as well as the former Drivin' and Cryin' frontman Kevn Kinney, round out the night. (Fans of Ms. Hogan, Ms. Timms, and Mr. Langford can also relax with them tomorrow night at Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, 212-420-8392, when they play the annual Bloodshot Records picnic, which starts at 2 P.M.) Tonight at 8. Tickets are $15 (Powers).
BILLY BRAGG; FREEDY JOHNSTON, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. The personal and the political both matter to Billy Bragg, an English songwriter with a gruffly endearing voice and and leftist ideals that don't preclude a sense of humor; he sings self-deprecating love songs and pro-labor arguments, and he recently put music behind some rediscovered Woody Guthrie lyrics. Freedy Johnston's finely turned folk-rock songs have carefully balanced melodies that he sings in a winsome tenor. But for all their classic symmetry, they're the confessions of some some desperate, unsavory and unbalanced characters. Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets are $25 and $30 (Pareles).
* DMC/TECHNICS WORLD DJ CHAMPIONSHIPS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Midtown, (212) 564-4882. The world championships of this annual contest haven't been held in New York before, and it was invented in the city, after all. Last year the regional semifinals turned out to be a great hip-hop event, a chance to see the hunger and craft in hip hop. Tonight 20 individual semifinalists, performing mind-boggling tricks of agility with two turntables and a stack of records will be narrowed down to five; six turntable teams from around the world compete, and there will be intermission performances by the Rock Steady Crew and the Legendary Cold Crush Brothers. Tomorrow night DJ Craze from Brooklyn, who won the world championships in Paris last year, will defend his title; guest appearances by the X-ecutioners and others will keep the crowd occupied while the judges deliberate. Doors open at 7 tonight, and at 8 tomorrow night; tickets are $30 to $40 each night (Ratliff).
* JOHNNY DOWD, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. In his cracked Texas twang Johnny Down sings about murder and passion and sin; his band plays a version of honky-tonk that's been dragged through a swamp and encrusted with electronics. Today at 4:30 P.M.; admission is $7 (Pareles).
* TOM FREUND, Living Room, 84 Stanton Street, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235. It would be easy to overlook a show like this during such a busy weekend, but the locally based, low-key singer-songwriter Tom Freund deserves a spot on the club-hopper's dance card. His thoughtful stories offer sweet respite from the groove-chasing whirl. Tonight at 11; admission is free (Powers).
* TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Flanagan, a master mainstream pianist who flowered rather late in life after serving as Ella Fitzgerald's accompanist, has a deep well of be-bop numbers, theater songs and tunes by jazz composers like Billy Strayhorn and Thad Jones. And with his trio's arrangements, he makes them over so fully that they're practically rewritten. This is the first week of a two-week stint at the Vanguard. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30, tonight through Sunday night; admission is $20 and $15 on Sunday (Ratliff).
* JUAN GABRIEL, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741. One of Mexico's most flamboyant and crowd-pleasing singers, Mr. Gabriel works with slick pop bands, mariachi groups and brass bands, sometimes all in the same marathon concert. Naturally, he belts love songs, but he also ponders whether Mexican culture can survive in a world of free trade. Tonight at 8. Tickets are $40 to $75 (Pareles).
BENNY GREEN TRIO, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Green is a young classicist, and one of the better ones playing jazz piano; he plays funky and hard, and breathes not only be-bop but Oscar Peterson's virtuosic effusions as well. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight; Sunday night at 7 and 9. Cover charge is $20, $15 on Sunday and for the midnight show tomorrow; $10 minimum (Ratliff).
* GUNGA DIN; FIREWATER; BOTANICA, CBGB, 315 Bowery at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. The romantically moody punk rockers of the Lower East Side are growing up to be excellent full-fledged bohemians, making rich, florid rock-and-roll that makes one want to wear velvet and drink absinthe. Three-star ensembles of this scene's blue period share the bill tonight. Stay up late for Botanica, the enjoyably indulgent auteur project of this crowd's ambassador to Los Angeles, Paul Wallfisch. Tonight the Gunga Din plays at 11, Firewater at midnight, and Botanica nurses the insomniacs at 1:30 A.M. Tickets are $10 (Powers).
JIM HALL AND DAVE HOLLAND, Iridium, 48 West 63d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. The versatile guitarist Mr. Hall has been flourishing in recent years: making a string of heavily arranged albums for large ensembles, currently recording an unusual record with Andrew Hill and Greg Osby, and appearing in exploratory situations like this one, with the sympathetic and rhythmically encouraging Dave Holland, the bassist. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; with midnight sets tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 and $10 minimum (Ratliff).
BUTCH HANCOCK; TISH HINOJOSA, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue, at 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 683-6500. Two scions of the singer-songwriter community of Austin, Tex., share this bill. Mr. Hancock, who played Summerstage this year with his longtime buddies Joe Ely and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, is the more subtle flavor in that crowd's hot musical sauce. Ms. Hinojosa is a multitalented Chicana performer whose songs traverse the border with ease. Tonight about 10; no admission or cover charge (Powers).
HELLACOPTERS, CBGB, 315 Bowery, East Village, (212) 982-4052. This Swedish rock quartet makes you think of artisans in remote economies who make beautiful, functional things: an excellent wooden bowl, or a chair, or a loaf of bread. The Hellacopters make perfect hard rock, early 70's Detroit style, devoid of any greater significance. They look like mechanics and play as if in a hurry to make the next gig in another town. They're conscious of what makes a rhythm section powerful, and they know their job is to stun, not to try patience. With Murder City Devils, Zen Guerillas and others. Music starts at 8:30 tomorrow night; the Hellacopters perform at 12:30. Tickets are $12 (Ratliff).
JEFFERSON STARSHIP; DAVE MASON BAND, Carnegie Hall, (212) (247-7800). The Jefferson Starship traded the Jefferson Airplane's psychedelic volatility for a long string of pop hits in the 1970's and 80's. It now includes three original Jefferson Airplane members: Marty Balin, Paul Kantner and Jack Casady, who could start feuding again at any moment. The Dave Mason Band is guaranteed to play "Feelin' Alright." Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets are $35 to $75 (Pareles).
* USTAD VILAYAT KHAN, SHUJAAT KHAN AND SABIR KHAN, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Ustad Vilayat Khan, a sitar player who is one of the greatest living improvisers in North Indian music, has invented a technique of bending a note after it has been plucked, tracing a sonic after-image like a curving jet trail. He is performing with his son Shujaat Khan, a sitarist who is already a mature improviser in his own right, and with Sabir Khan (no relation) on tabla. Tonight at 8 P.M.; tickets are $25 to $50 (Pareles).
L7, Life, 158 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 420-1999. The empresses of down-and-dirty punk metal have a new album out, called "Slapp Happy," and they're still burning up stages coast to coast. These Los Angeles-based pioneers are living proof that women can spend their lives chasing their passion for rock-and-roll. Tomorrow night at 10. Tickets are $15 (Powers).
MAN OR ASTRO-MAN?, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Surf guitar meets science fiction in Man or Astro-Man?, which laces its rowdy instrumentals with B-movie snippets about the future. Tonight at midnight, preceded by Delta 72 at 11 and the Swingin' Neckbreakers at 10; admission is $12 (Pareles).
* PAT MARTINO; JOYOUS LAKE/JOHN SCOFIELD QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A young jazz guitarist's dream bill. Pat Martino is an heir to Wes Montgomery's warm, bluesy guitar style, but he says what he wants to say with an unflappable, pianistic fluency; his note-bendings are almost surreally poised. He shares a double bill with John Scofield, who's a bit more raucous and funky and among the most influential guitarists in the last 20 years. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; cover charge is $30, with a $5 minimum (Ratliff).
MOMUS; KAHIMI KARIE; LOUIS PHILIPPE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. There's an international cabal of songwriters who love the 1960's pop that hovered outside rock: lounge combos, soundtracks, bossa nova, Burt Bacharach and Martin Denny and Brian Wilson. Three sometime collaborators appear on this bill. Momus is a word-loving, mildly misanthropic character who sets his proudly clever ruminations to slightly haywire synthesizer tracks. He also writes for Kahimi Karie, who shyly whispers her songs onstage. Louis Philippe, born in France and living in England (where he works as a BBC sports announcer), applies his sweetly wistful voice to songs full of twisted harmonies and lovelorn yearning. Tonight, Louis Philippe at 11:15, Kahimi Karie at midnight and Momus at 12:45 A.M. Admission is $20 (Pareles).
MORTIIS, Downtime, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 253-1046. In approaching Mortiis you have to think about the arc of civilization a little bit. Here we have a former member of the Norwegian death-metal band Emperor in his solo project, and he appears as an animal spirit with an elongated prosthetic nose, bat wings, and pointy ear extensions. This is his "mellow" endeavor, reverberant dungeon-and-druid music made by electronic keyboards and acoustic guitar; a singer named Sarah Jezebel Deva sings wordlessly on top. It's as unashamedly grim and dramatic as underground metal gets, and it's totally serious. What more do you want from the end of the millennium? His set begins tomorrow night at 1 A.M.; tickets are $10 (Ratliff).
WOLFGANG MUTHSPIEL TRIO, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. Mr. Muthspiel, a guitarist who has played with Paul Motian's electric be-bop quintet, has a lot of ideas about what jazz can sound like: he's recorded solo pieces on acoustic guitar, with samplers, in duets with percussion, with regular jazz trios and quartets. Tomorrow night he plays guitar, violin and electronically created loops with two excellent musicians, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Tom Rainey. Music starts at 9; admission is $8; $5 drink minimum (Ratliff).
* MARIANNE NOWOTTNY, Knitting Factory Old Office, 74 Leonard Street between Church Street and Broadway, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The 16-year-old Marianne Nowottny is far removed from kiddie-pop. With her electric keyboard set to sound like bells or violins or a music box, she sings waywardly ethereal songs, full of dreamlike journeys and mysterious rendezvous, opening up a private sphere. Tonight at 8:30; admission is $10 (Pareles).
JOHN POPPER; MARCY PLAYGROUND; ROBBEN FORD; LYNCH MOB; DRAIN S.T.H., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. If it's variety you seek, this is the bill for you. Part of the Album Network Rockfest, a radio industry publication event, it features heavy metal veterans the Lynch Mob and Scandinavian warrior goddesses Drain S.T.H., the blues guitar veteran Robben Ford, the whimsical modern rockers Marcy Playground, and John Popper, the soulful big band behind the harmonica in Blues Traveler. Draw the connections between these disparate acts, or don't bother -- just rock, bop, and boogie. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $22.50 (Powers).
* PRETTY THINGS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406 and Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Like the Rolling Stones if they'd never reached stadiums, the Pretty Things started out as a band of rowdy, hard-driving, blues-loving English musicians in the 1960's; they also came up with pre-psychedelic garage-rock nuggets ("L.S.D.," which they claimed was about pounds, shillings and pence) and what was likely the first rock opera, "S.F. Sorrow." Reunited in the 90's, they sound as hard-bitten as they did three decades ago. Tonight at 10 at Maxwell's; tickets are $20. Sunday night at 9 at the Bowery Ballroom; tickets are $16 (Pareles).
PROMISE RING; JETS TO BRAZIL; JOAN OF ARC, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street two blocks south of Canal, TriBeCa, (212) 966-4225. "Emocore" is the underground antidote to the macho angst of best-selling rock bands like Limp Bizkit. These bands also feature young men pouring out their hearts, but they value melody and respect women's feelings. Best is the buoyant, spacey Joan of Arc. Doors open tonight at 7. Tickets are $12 (Powers).
PUSH STARS, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. The Push Stars, from Boston, search for romance in concise, guardedly optimistic folk-rock songs. With the Watchmen and Jeff Black opening, tonight at 7:30 and 10:30. Admission is $15 (Pareles).
RACHEL'S; DAMON AND NAOMI, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street between Broadway and Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Two ensembles devoted to generating lush atmospheres share the stage with alternating sets. Damon and Naomi, partners in life and music, were once the rhythm section in Galaxie 500, the cult band that turned underground rock into mood music, and they've been pursuing nuanced reveries ever since. Rachel's is a contemporary classical group that includes players trained at Juilliard and in the rock-club trenches, and skates the distance between chamber music, avant-garde jazz and experimental guitar. Tomorrow night at 8. Tickets are $12 (Powers).
* RAHZEL, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, SoHo (212) 243-4940. The human beat-box from the Roots puts his flamboyant rhythms at center stage. Tonight at 11:30; admission is $18. (Pareles)
* TOSHI REAGON AND BIG LOVELY, Joe's Pub in the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8777. "Righteous" is not a word to be used lightly, but Toshi Reagon deserves to claim it. This singer-songwriter, long a star of her politically progressive, culturally savvy world, makes funky, folk-inflected music that stirs the heart and the hips. Her concerts are thrilling secular revival meetings that bring together fans of all races and creeds. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $15 (Powers).
"ROCKIN' IN RHYTHM: THE SMALL-BAND MUSIC OF DUKE ELLINGTON." Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5599. Ellington's legacy brings to mind the sight of 14 musicians onstage, but many of his sidemen broke off from the orchestra to record small-group version of his tunes. Music director for this Jazz at Lincoln Center event is the trumpeter Nicholas Payton; vocalist Dianne Reeves and Joe Lovano are special guests, with members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Shows are tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 (Ratliff).
* CARL HANCOCK RUX, Joe's Pub in the Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8777. "The revolution is in our collard greens, baby," says the poet and cosmic soul man Carl Hancock Rux at the beginning of his Sony 550 Records debut, "Rux Revue."The excitement Mr. Rux generates when he catches a groove and rides it like a preacher on a bender belies his dismissal of incendiary rhetoric. But Mr. Rux is a sensible, 1990's-style funk prophet. He knows, as he also says, that the only revolution is our evolution. Tomorrow night at 11; tickets are $15 (Powers).
* RONNIE SPECTOR; BRATMOBILE, Thread Waxing Space, 476 Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets, SoHo, (212) 966-9520. Two generations of powerful women get together for some fun on this bill. Ronnie Spector made her legend in the dreamy Ronettes, but her tough side always shone, too, and so it make sense that she now records for the punk label Kill Rock Stars. Bratmobile was a major influence on rebellious young feminists in the mid-1990's, and now the group has reunited to win some more girls' hearts. Tonight at 11. Tickets are $10 (Powers).
STYLES OF BEYOND, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Street, TriBeCa, (212) 966-4225. The hip hop innovators in Styles of Beyond share a bill with many other forward-looking, sample-happy acts, all on either Jungle Sky or Om Records. Dropping some of the best beats will be Cassien and Soul Slinger. But come down any time to cut up the dance floor in cutting-edge fashion. Tomorrow night at 10. Admission is $15 (Powers).
MIKE VIOLA AND THE CANDY BUTCHERS; SALTINE, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. Fans of starry-eyed power pop will crowd this club to hear the latest loveliness from the local songwriter Mike Viola and the new band featuring Ken Stringfellow, formerly of the Posies (and most recently seen honing his keyboard chops on tour with R.E.M.). Tomorrow night at 10. Admission is $10 (Powers).

HEADLINE: Factory Production Rose More in August

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Production at factories, mines and utilities exceeded expectations in August, paced by surging demand for automobiles and trucks, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Output rose three-tenths of 1 percent for a seventh consecutive monthly increase, the Fed said. While that was less than the gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in July, it surpassed the consensus forecast of economists for no change for the month. 
 "This is evidence of a broad-based recovery in manufacturing," said William Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "It extends not only to exporters, but to domestic producers."
Automotive production rose 8.1 percent in August, the biggest increase in a year, as manufacturers bet that low unemployment and rising incomes would keep demand high. The Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation, DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Toyota Motor Corporation all posted higher August sales as the industry recorded its best month since 1986.
Production of computers and electrical equipment also rose in August, the Fed said.
Another Government report underscored the expectation that the economic expansion, now in its ninth year, is cruising toward a record in January. First-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell 4,000 to 288,000 last week. Analysts interpreted that as a sign employment gains are continuing.

HEADLINE: Rubin Is Planning to Return to Wall Street

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary, said today that he planned to return to Wall Street, though he has not decided where he will work.
Mr. Rubin, who is 60, said in a phone interview that he was likely to rejoin the financial world "in some fashion and in some serious way." 
 "I don't know with whom I'll be doing it," he said, "or how I'll be doing it."
Since leaving the Treasury Department on July 2, Mr. Rubin has been considering job offers, he said. He was co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs before joining the Clinton Administration in 1993 as chairman of the National Economic Council. He became Treasury Secretary in 1995.
Mr. Rubin said he would spend some time in community service as chairman of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a community development support organization.
The group raises money to support nonprofit community organizations that work to revitalize distressed urban and rural areas. Mr. Rubin will succeed John P. Mascotte, president and chief executive of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Missouri, as the chairman of Local Inititives.

HEADLINE: Stockman Forming Own Buyout Concern

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan Administration, is resigning as senior managing director and partner of the Blackstone Group to form a buyout concern focused on industries based in the Midwest.
Mr. Stockman's company, which will be known as Heartland Industrial Partners, intends to raise as much as $2 billion to buy companies. Mr. Stockman said he would work closely with Blackstone, the private merchant bank where he has worked for 12 years. Blackstone will invest in Heartland. 
 Mr. Stockman, 52, a former Michigan Congressman, said Heartland would enable him to return to his roots as an entrepreneur.
"This sector of the U.S. economy, once disparaged as the 'rust belt,' is today one of the developed world's most efficient manufacturing centers," he said. "Traditional manufacturing businesses are undervalued, and the industrial sector remains under-penetrated by private equity funds. These factors provide a context for significant opportunity for buyout and buildup investors with the right vision and the right strategy."
The new company will have offices in New York and the Midwest.

HEADLINE: James R. West, 84, Diplomat Married to Mary McCarthy

 BODY:
James R. West, a career diplomat and the husband of the writer Mary McCarthy for nearly 30 years, died on Monday at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. He was 84 and lived in Castine, Me.
Dashing and worldly with a superlative wit, Mr. West immediately captured Ms. McCarthy's attention when they met in Warsaw in January of 1960. He was a cultural attache with the Foreign Service; she and Saul Bellow were on a lecture tour sponsored by the State Department at the recommendation of the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who introduced the couple. 
 Ms. McCarthy said of Mr. West that he was the first real man she had met. A fan of her writing, Mr. West already esteemed Ms. McCarthy's intellect before being further swept away by her charms. Though they were both married at the time -- she to Bowden Broadwater, her third husband; he to Margaret Jacobson, his second wife and the mother of his three children -- he is said to have remarked after their first dance that he would marry her. Divorces followed on both sides.
"He has a kind of exquisite tenderness, toward things as well as persons," Ms. McCarthy wrote of her new acquaintance to a friend, the philosopher Hannah Arendt. "The ordinary Poles . . . all love him."
Mr. West was born in Maine and attended Bowdoin College. After briefly trying his hand at writing, he joined the Air Force in World War II. Shortly after the war, he began his career in the Foreign Service and became director of personnel for the Marshall Plan in Paris. After moving back to the United States in 1955, Mr. West was posted in Warsaw as Cultural Attache.
In 1961, following his marriage to Ms. McCarthy, and to be close to his children, he joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group that promotes worldwide economic growth, as the director of information. He held the post until his retirement in 1979.
By all accounts, their life in Paris offered a brilliant marriage of the diplomatic and the literary, as intellectuals, artists, government officials and various friends passed through their salon on the rue de Rennes for nearly 20 years.
Following Mr. West's retirement in 1979, he and Ms. McCarthy divided their time between Paris and Castine and, later, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., where Ms. McCarthy taught at Bard College. In Castine they lived in the 1805 Daniel Johnston house, where they recreated the life Ms. McCarthy once had with her parents, who died when she was 6. It was a sort of romantic idyll centered on a handsome and winning couple whose days were enlivened by memorable gatherings of family and friends including the poet Robert Lowell and the critic Elizabeth Hardwick.
After Ms. McCarthy's death in 1989, Mr. West moved permanently to Castine. In 1990, he married Barbara Byrnes, whom he had met during college. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Daniel of Los Angeles, Alison of New York and Jonathan of Lodz, Poland, and by four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: United States Sets a Record for Living Beyond Its Means

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THERE are few things more enjoyable than spending more than you earn. Especially if you are convinced you can keep doing so indefinitely.
The United States is now in that position. As a nation, it is outspending its income by more than ever before. 
 That fact does not prove that the party is about to end. Many of the trends that have enabled Americans to spend so much remain in place. But the recent weakness of the dollar against the Japanese yen may be the first sign that this party's liquor supply is running low.
The measure of such overspending is known as the current account deficit -- the broadest measure of what we pay to foreigners for goods, services and other miscellaneous things, less what we collect from them. It's been big for some time, but now it is ballooning out of control.
This week the Commerce Department reported the deficit reached $80.7 billion in the last quarter, or nearly a billion dollars a day. That was up 18 percent from the previous quarter -- which itself had been a record.
The proper way to look at such figures is relative to the size of the economy. There, too, it's a record, equaling 3.63 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice what it was a couple of years ago. The previous peak, set in the final three months of 1986, was 3.53 percent.
The growing deficit has not been a problem so far because the rest of the world has been happy to take all those dollars we pay for things and invest them in dollar-denominated assets. They give us cars and barrels of oil, and we give them pieces of paper called securities. The United States was attractive because it had been growing while Japan was in a prolonged recession, Europe was plagued by low growth and high unemployment, and much of the developing world was in crisis.
Now, however, things are starting to change for the better overseas. Japan is growing, albeit in a stuttering manner, and attracting investment. The yen has risen sharply against the dollar, as the Japanese central bank has intervened only half-heartedly. The recovery in most of developing Asia is well under way. Europe is also looking healthier, although the German Government's weakness and indecision have hurt the euro.
In other words, alternatives to investing in the United States are starting to look more attractive. The resulting downward pressure on the dollar probably is not going to be too intense for a while. The Japanese are likely to do a better job of holding the yen down, and speculators who have lately been betting against the dollar will move on to other markets. But at some point the huge current account deficit will begin to seem important to investors and currency traders. Then the dollar will really begin to slide. "The trade deficit can get bigger and bigger, and no one will care -- until they do," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company.
Then the United States Government will face difficult choices. Protectionist pressures will grow in Washington, and the Federal Reserve will be forced to raise interest rates -- already higher than in Europe or Japan -- to attract investment. But those higher rates could depress inflated stock prices and cause foreigners to flee America rather than invest more. The higher interest rates rose, the more pressure the dollar would face.
You may remember that that is exactly what happened to Mexico in 1994, when the world suddenly stopped sending the capital needed to finance a growing current account deficit. In the aftermath of that, the United States has lectured that countries must live within their means. Physician, heal thyself.

HEADLINE: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE;
Turning Old School Into Apartments

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Work is nearing completion on a $10.5 million conversion of the turn-of-the-century St. Agnes elementary school in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn into a 90-unit middle-income rental apartment building.
When completed next month, the Italian-Renaissance-style former school at 421 Degraw Street will have studio to three-bedroom units to be rented to people with annual incomes of $30,000 to $100,000. Monthly rents for the apartments, with 450 to 1,200 square feet, will be $800 to $1,750. The developer and area brokers said those rents were 20 percent lower, on average, than rents for apartments at the eastern edge of this reviving neighborhood. 
 The project, called the School House in Carroll Gardens, will have a parking lot for 50 cars. The building is between Hoyt and Bond Streets, not far from the area's low-income housing developments and the recently restored Gowanus Canal. Since leasing began in May, contracts have been signed or are pending on 50 of the apartments, and applications are in various stages of review for the rest, said Getz Obstfeld, a principal of Community Developers Inc., of New Rochelle, N.Y., which is developing the project in partnership with the Cheever Development Corporation, based in Brooklyn.
The School House project is part of the city's New Housing Opportunities Program, intended to spur the production of middle-income apartments by providing developers with construction and/or permanent financing as well as a public subsidy in the form of a second loan at an interest rate of 1 percent for up to $30,000 per unit. In exchange, the developer must build or renovate rental buildings or limited-equity cooperatives for income-eligible tenants. Depending on family size, the tenant's annual income may not exceed seven or eight times the monthly rents for the apartments, or 250 percent of the median New York City income, or $133,500, whichever is less.
The School House project received a $7.7 million construction loan, which will be converted to a permanent one, from the New York City Housing Development Corporation, which raises the financing for the program from the sale of tax-exempt bonds. The corporation, using its own reserves, also provided a $1.7 million second loan, or $19,000 per unit. The rest of the financing came from the partners' own funds.
Since the corporation started issuing financing 16 months ago, $113 million has been given to 15 projects with a total of 1,061 residences. Five of the projects are complete and the rest are to be completed over the next eight months, among them, the conversions of an old knitting factory at 79 Clifton Place in Clinton Hill to 40 rentals and of a former armory at 167 Clermont Avenue in Fort Greene to 110 rental apartments. An additional $150 million to $175 million is expected to be given over the next year to produce 1,200 to 1,500 more middle-income residences, according to the housing corporation.
Russell A. Harding, the housing corporation's president, said that with projects like the School House in Carroll Gardens, "the result is more affordable housing for the city's resurgent middle class and the preservation of a piece of a community's history."
The former school, across the street from St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church, has been vacant since 1987, and over the years, there were unsuccessful attempts to salvage it. Under a 1996 plan, the church, working with two local nonprofit groups -- the Carroll Gardens Association and the Gowanus Canal Development Corporation -- tried to recycle the old school into low-income rentals for the elderly, but the groups and the church were unable to obtain financing, and the project was abandoned a year later.
Mr. Obstfeld said that last year, after he and his partners, who had been involved with the nonprofit groups in plans to convert the school to housing for the elderly, secured financing from the city, they switched to the current project and bought the old school for $1.1 million. "Three years ago," he added, "this area of Carroll Gardens could not support this project as market-rate housing, and while it may today, the goal, then as now, was to provide housing that people in the community could afford."
The Rev. John Delendick, the former pastor of St. Agnes, who is on the real estate committee of the Diocese of Brooklyn, which reviews the sale of church-owned properties, agreed with that assessment. "This was one of the best offers," he said, "and we took it because the project will save a local landmark, benefit the community and help the church keep parishioners and draw new ones."
The developers have exercised their option under the city's middle-income housing program to give preference to income-eligible applicants from the community for up to 30 percent of the apartments.
Father Delendick, who is now the pastor of nearby St. Michael's Church, said the money from the sale has been invested by the diocese, creating funds to help the financially strapped St. Agnes parish "pay some of its bills."
Mr. Obstfeld said that in converting the old school, its exterior, which features classical limestone and terra-cotta details, has been refurbished in keeping with its original design, and that interior features like marble wainscoting, mosaic tile flooring and wrought iron railings, were saved, whenever possible. To create the apartments, the partners, following a design by Grasso & Menziuso Architects of Manhattan, reshaped the building's high-ceilinged four floors into seven floors.
The result is that the units have 8.5-foot to 18-foot-high ceilings and unusual layouts. Some are on two floors, while others have lofts or terraces, Mr. Obstfeld said, adding that most also offer views of Manhattan or the rest of Brooklyn. In addition to the parking spaces, which cost $125 a month, amenities include a laundry room and a 24-hour doorman. Initial occupancy is to begin next month.

Reform Party 101

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Gov. Jesse Ventura has come up with the exciting idea of recruiting Donald Trump to run as the Reform Party Presidential candidate. This is the sort of creative coupling that could come only from a chief executive who moonlights as a professional wrestler. Who better for the balanced-budget party than a man whose fundamental business philosophy has always been that if you borrow enough, the banks can't afford to foreclose on you?
The Reform Party's search for a Presidential candidate has left many people puzzled, wondering how any organization's leadership could apparently regard Mr. Trump, Patrick Buchanan, Lowell Weicker and Ross Perot as equally suitable standard-bearers. I have been looking into this matter and I am prepared to answer questions. 
 Who is eligible to become the Reform Party candidate for President of the United States?
According to party leaders, any American citizen who agrees with the Reform platform and is prepared to spend the money necessary to get on the ballot. All it takes is several million dollars and a dream.
What's in the Reform Party platform?
A whole lot of stuff, actually, down to abolishing the Appalachian Regional Commission. But the three biggest points seem to be government reform, trade protectionism and balanced budgets. The platform specifically says the party opposes tax cuts until the national debt is paid down.
Does Pat Buchanan oppose tax cuts until the national debt is paid down?
According to his spokesman, Mr. Buchanan's only problem with the Republicans' proposed $792 billion tax cut is that it is not large enough.
What does the Reform leadership say about that?
The chairman, Russell Verney, says he "can envision Pat Buchanan with a straight face saying he supports the party platform."
Does Jesse Ventura, the only Reform Party member ever to actually get elected to anything, support Pat Buchanan?
Mr. Ventura, who calls Pat Buchanan a "retread," has been floating the names of Mr. Trump and former Governor Weicker of Connecticut.
Is Lowell Weicker a protectionist?
Mr. Weicker says, "Hell, no."
Does Donald Trump support the Reform Party platform?
Mr. Trump could probably work it into his current political ideology, which seems firm only in regard to the virtues of tax incentives for real estate development and the evils of alimony.
What is the current makeup of the Reform Party membership?
The Reform Party members seem united mainly on the goal of opening up the political process until it is finally yawning so wide that they can step into elective office themselves.
What ever happened to Ross Perot?
When last seen, Mr. Perot was still promising to assemble a panel of first-class experts to come up with a new plan to look under the national hood and retool the governmental engine, as soon as he gets the crazy aunt out of the attic.
What are the chances that Mr. Perot will change his mind and run for President again himself?
Very slim, since Mr. Perot dislikes the limelight and never swerves unexpectedly from one course to another on the basis of an inexplicable, lunatic whim.
Will the Reform Party survive into the next millennium?
The 16th-century prophet Nostradamus had a great deal to say about this topic in a passage translated from Latin only minutes ago:
The money-mantled minion leaps into the abyss,
Then rises up.
His second, shouting, leans upon the rope.
The seer is unusually forthright here. The rope-leaner is obviously Governor Ventura in his wrestling persona, whose promotion of Mr. Trump will bear fruit in the year 2000. The first stanza depicts the luxury-apartment and casino developer accepting the Presidential nomination, in a ceremony followed by a final cataclysm and the Rapture. A slightly different interpretation argues that the text foresees President Clinton's recent trip to New Zealand, during which the economic adviser Gene Sperling was photographed bungee-jumping off a 150-foot bridge.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Partying In China

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Riding with the waves, Fortune magazine in New York has come up with a terrific, with-it, win-win idea.
For Oct. 1 the Chinese Communist Politburo has organized a national celebration of the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic following the military triumph of Mao Zedong. Everybody knows where office and factory workers will stand, precisely what slogans to shout, and which Chinese with a dissident political or religious record the police will take off the streets during the celebration. 
 But every big party needs celebrities. Not very many would have shown up on their own just for the Communist Party's victory banquets. So Fortune invited the kind of celebrities the Politburo loves most -- top foreign business executives from America and other countries to go to Shanghai Sept. 27 to 29 for an economic forum and then to Beijing, where their private planes are guaranteed red-runway treatment. Only multinational business, please, and only chairmen, presidents and C.E.O.'s.
The enticement was knowing they would get the chance to meet Chinese who interest them most, those who approve business contracts.
Fortune said President Jiang Zemin had "graciously" agreed to give the keynote speech in Shanghai. You learn to talk real humble if you do business with the Chinese Communists.
More than 200 C.E.O.'s have signed up already; a real A-list. About a dozen of the world's communication chiefs whose employees are supposed to report on China are listed -- including Time Warner, Fortune's owner, CNN and NBC.
Top folk from American industry, finance and commerce will be there, from Boeing to Calvin Klein. The Boeing man will be Philip M. Condit, chairman, forever a historical footnote for saying that his attitude toward human rights violations in China was the same as his attitude toward them in America -- after all, people have been beaten and shot in the U.S. civil rights struggle, haven't they?
I think that for any member of the press to organize a party for a government dictatorship is damaging to the publication and the rest of us.
But the basic problem is what goes on in the minds of the Condits: The pretense of American business, and the legislators its money helps elect, that it cannot see the obligation of American corporations to use their economic power to help the viciously oppressed; the sardonic stand that American faults can be equated with Beijing's use of terror as the instrument of government; the philosophy that money comes uber alles, even uber Americans' principles, and what their own religions teach.
So, of course, uber God.
Everything having to do with business and profits and how to get more of both is on the Shanghai agenda -- everything except the human rights of the Chinese who are buying our products and providing our cheap labor.
Human Rights Watch in China is not questioning, as I am, the very idea of businessmen getting together to worship the money idol in China. But it pleads with business people to read the accounts of the independent-minded Chinese sentenced to labor camps and how they were tortured, sometimes forced to exist in their own feces. And then please -- stand up in China, and use the safety of foreign passports to dare to speak up.
People often ask me -- Don't you get a feeling of defeat, writing so much about human rights in China and other dictatorships, all the while knowing that leaders of America, particularly the President and the business community, grovel to the Chinese?
Often. But then I think of the former Chinese prisoner Harry Wu, who secretly went back to the labor camps to track the fate of those still there. And I think of Representative Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who has not weakened on Chinese human rights for a moment. She represents San Francisco, so I asked her what she would say this time. She thinks about it and then sends me this message:
"The spectacle of the U.S. C.E.O.'s kowtowing to the Chinese Communist leaders is grotesque but not new. This time, however, when the C.E.O.'s stand in Tiananmen Square with the Beijing regime to 'celebrate' 50 years of killing and repression, they will have blood on the soles of their shoes."

AT&T and British Telecom To Link Wireless Operations
AT&T and British Telecommunications said they would expand their global communications alliance by linking their wireless telephone operations around the world.
AT&T and British Telecom are already trying to create a $10 billion joint venture to serve the international communications needs of multinational corporations. While the new wireless alliance would not technically be part of that venture, its formation underscores the growing importance of wireless as part of the comprehensive package of services that carriers are trying to build.

A Price for Everything, Even Testaverde's Heel

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
When Vinny Testaverde collapsed to the Giants Stadium turf with a season-ending torn Achilles' tendon last Sunday, did the Jets' potential sale price plunge?
If the Jets were a publicly traded stock, Testaverde's injury would have sent shares reeling, just as if a company's earnings had come in below projections or the sales of a ballyhooed product had gone into the tank. 
 Potential buyers seeking to acquire the Jets started to assemble last month with the expectation that the team might play in the Super Bowl. Such anticipation had to figure into the price one of the suitors would pay. Now, with Testaverde out and Rick Mirer in, the anticipation is considerably muted.
"These are emotional buys and factors like that can't be ruled out," John Moag, the managing director of the sports industry group at the investment banking firm Legg Mason, said of the impact of Testaverde's injury. "How a team is playing has a psychological effect."
Are the Jets now worth $10 million less than they were before 2 P.M. last Sunday? Or did the value drop by $25 million? Or $50 million?
Will the loss of each game lop $5 million from the price? Will each of Rick Mirer's interceptions cause a $750,000 drop? Will Wayne Chrebet's return from injury be worth $2.5 million more? Will each first down be worth $10,000?
The estimated 26 suitors who have signed confidentiality agreements to examine the Hess estate's sale prospectus know, however, that winning isn't the only consideration. The Washington Redskins' 6-10 record last year did not scare Daniel Snyder away from from buying them for $800 million, a price largely determined by the cash horde coming from the team's two-year-old stadium.
"I don't see the Testaverde situation affecting the value, but you can say for sure that if the Jets are out of the playoffs early -- say they're 1-7 or 2-6 -- it takes some glamour off the team," said Michael Ozanian of Forbes magazine, which values the Jets at $363 million in its current issue, slightly more than half the Dallas Cowboys' value of $663 million.
Marc Ganis, the president of Sportscorp Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm, added: "Being without Testaverde shouldn't make a difference. We're not talking about Peyton Manning or Tim Couch, quarterbacks in their early 20's, but a guy who's in his 30's and at the tail end of his career."
Of greater concern for the value of the Jets, Ganis and Ozanian insisted, is the coaching future of Bill Parcells. If he leaves after a disappointing 1999 season, it would be like Lee Iacocca leaving Chrysler in the 1980's before the company's recovery was completed. "I see Parcells staying on as coach as being worth $10 million or $20 million," Ganis said.
If the Jets sell for $500 million or more, it will be because of the hope of getting a new stadium when the team's Giants Stadium lease expires in 2008.
Among the Jets' suitors are Cablevision's Charles Dolan; the Devils' owner, John McMullen; the builders Sam Grossman and Samuel LeFrak; the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder; the Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon, and the tandem of developer Steve Ross and developer/financier Bill Mack. For whomever wins the bidding, the biggest challenge might be negotiating an expensive and difficult buyout with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to get a new stadium and sweetheart lease in place by 2003 or 2004.
With the Nets and the Devils planning arenas away from the Meadowlands, the authority wouldn't want to make it easy for another team to leave, especially one that had never squawked about its lease when Leon Hess was alive.
 
Pay-Per-View Take
 TVKO hopes that a blitz of advertising will push pay-per-view purchases for tomorrow night's $49.95 Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad welterweight fight over the million mark. No nonheavyweight bout has attracted more than the 800,000 for De La Hoya-Pernell Whitaker in April 1997.
"We're not predicting one million buys, but we may do it," said Lou DiBella, a senior vice president of TVKO, a division of HBO Sports.
The fight's nine national sponsors, including GTE, Western Union, Anheuser-Busch, Golden Ram and Excite.com are spending a combined $7 million on commercials and providing TVKO with $1 million in cash. Three sponsors -- McDonald's, Puma and Met-Rx -- are also in De La Hoya's endorsement portfolio.
"We've never seen a fight with so much sponsorship -- it's more than we got for Holyfield-Foreman in 1991," said Mark Taffet, a TVKO senior vice president. "Economically this is a heavyweight fight. They're getting as much as Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis will be paid for their rematch."
TVKO is looking ahead to a De La Hoya-Trinidad rematch -- neither man is likely to get more money by fighting any other foe -- and DiBella projected the inaugural matchup into "one of the great trilogies in boxing history."
First, let's get one fight finished -- with a legitimate decision rendered by three competent judges -- before we think of three of them.
 
Airwaves
There hasn't been a better episode of a TV comedy this year than an "Arliss" -- replayed this week -- with a boozing, loud, yet sympathetic Marge Schott-like character played perfectly by Kathleen Freeman. . . . Spectacular ratings for the United States Open tennis semifinals and finals powered CBS to a 3.5 Nielsen rating for the tournament, up 52 percent from last year.

Rebuffing an Early Selloff, Dow Still Falls 63.96 Points Traders Leave Early to Beat Hurricane

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stock prices pulled out of an early sinking spell yesterday to close with modest losses for two of the major gauges, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eked out a slender gain.
Among the forces buffeting the market were warnings of corporate profit shortfalls, a rebound by the dollar from a 44-month low against the yen, a stronger-than-expected report on industrial output last month, a rise in a barometer of Philadelphia-area manufacturing and the approach of Friday's triple-witching session when options and futures contracts expire. 
 Many traders heeded official advice to leave early to beat the full effects of Hurricane Floyd, in some cases covering short positions -- that is, buying securities to repay borrowed securities they have already sold -- and that helped fuel the comeback that began about mid-day.
"It seems that traders closed out positions they'd normally close out tomorrow," said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard A. Rosenblatt & Company.
The New York Stock Exchange kept normal hours and said it would do so again today.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one stage was down nearly 175 points, finished with a loss of 63.96 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. At 10,737.46, the Dow is 5.2 percent off its Aug. 25 peak but is still 17 percent higher for the year.
The Nasdaq market fell 7.45 points, or a quarter of 1 percent, to close at 2,806.72. The S.& P. 500 edged up 0.51 of a point, to 1,318.48.
Interest rates eased, apparently reflecting diminished concern about the dollar.
Hewlett-Packard fell 4 9/16 to 103 15/16 to account for more than a third of the decline in the blue-chip Dow, where 21 stocks fell and only 8t gained.
The session's most active issue was Quintiles Transnational, a North Carolina company that is the biggest conductor of clinical trials for drug makers. Quintiles skidded 14 3/4 a share, to 20, after it said profits would be shy of expectations this year and next. Almost 39.5 million shares changed hands.
FDX, parent of Federal Express, and Eastman Chemical also warned of lower profits; FDX fell 5 7/16 a share, to 38 1/4, while Eastman lost 2 3/8, to 43 15/16. Xerox, which shuffled its sales force again, slumped 4 5/16, to 42 3/4.
American Home Products gained 3 1/2, to 46 3/4, on word that it may be near settling injury claims by users of its diet drugs.
Even though the Nasdaq set a closing high in September, the Dow industrials in August and the S.& P. 500 in July, the general market has lagged well behind. According to an analysis by Alfred Goldman of A. G. Edwards, 51 percent of S.& P. companies closed Tuesday 20 percent or more below their 52-week highs prior to mid-May.
Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, called the market "overvalued," but said it still offered values in basic materials, energy and some cyclical stocks. "We think a global recovery is under way," she said, predicting that the Federal Reserve would avoid raising short-term interest rates at its Oct. 5 policy meeting.
Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 2,063 to 916 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 220 making new lows and only 18 new highs.
Stocks fell overseas, the biggest losses being 2.7 percent in Tokyo, 1.5 percent in Germany and 1.5 percent in Sao Paulo.

Treasuries Edge Up

Bond prices moved slightly higher yesterday in a session cut short by the approach of Hurricane Floyd.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/32, to 100 2 3/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.07 percent from 6.10 percent on Wednesday.
With heavy rains from the hurricane threatening to disrupt travel in and around New York, the Bond Market Association, an industry trade group, decided yesterday morning to close the session at 1 P.M.
The Treasury bond market benefited from the end of a selling spree by insurance companies, which were raising money in case Hurricane Floyd led to extensive insurance claims along the Atlantic Coast.
A slight strengthening by the dollar against the Japanese yen also contributed to the bond market's gains.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Rises, in Seeming Conflict With Job Creation

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
New York City's economy is booming, companies are creating new jobs at a record pace -- but the unemployment rate is 6.9 percent, significantly higher than it was just six months ago, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor.
The seeming paradox of rising employment and rising unemployment may indeed reflect what is going on in New York City's labor market, economists say. But it probably says more about the peculiarities of the economic statistics that politicians and businessmen rely on, but that economists concede are often flawed and easily manipulated. 
 Just changing the time period can change the whole employment picture. If the city's current unemployment rate is compared with its rate a year ago, 7.8 percent, today's rate looks good. If it is compared with March's 6.4 percent, it looks bad. The rate in July was 7 percent.
Unemployment data "are worthless, month-to-month, or virtually worthless," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Regional Financial Associates. And New York City's numbers, he said, are even more volatile than those of other cities or states.
That is because the unemployment figures are based on a monthly survey of fewer than 1,500 households in the city. Their responses are fed into a complicated econometric model created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington. That Government agency, which runs the survey along with the Census Bureau, says that it makes every effort to talk to households that are representative of the city's population as a whole.
But that is difficult in a city with a highly diverse population. New York has more immigrants, more rich people and more poor people than almost any other place in the United States.
A lower percentage of the population is in the labor force -- working or looking for a job -- than in most other parts of the country, although the percentage has been rising. And people who are paid in cash may be reluctant to tell the Government that they are, indeed, employed.
The survey sometimes produces surprising results, as it did back in March, when the percentage of people who said they were looking for work but could not find a job dropped from 8.2 percent to 6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even after this information was fed through the bureau's computer program, it showed a drop of 1.2 percentage points, which is, as economists like to say, statistically significant.
"I didn't understand it, and I don't understand it to this day," said Vincent S. DeSantis, state economist for the New York State Department of Labor. That steep drop early in the spring is what makes the current rate look relatively high.
Like many other economists, Mr. DeSantis says he prefers to emphasize the job-creation numbers, which are based on a survey of employers and which can eventually be updated, using tax records, to reflect almost every employer in the city.
By those lights, New York City's economy looks fabulous. In the last 12 months, employers have added a net 78,200 new jobs, an increase of 2.2 percent.
Government employment has been shrinking, but the private sector has increased its work force by 2.7 percent, far higher than the 1.9 percent increase for all of New York State, said Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki.
But these figures, too, may not tell the whole story. Not all jobs in the city are held by city residents. About a quarter of new jobs, on average, go to commuters, said James Parrott, an economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute; on Wall Street, that figure rises to about 40 percent.
And while the number of jobs in the city has been rising, the number of city residents who say they have jobs has been growing far more slowly -- by just 1 percent in the last 12 months, according to the figures released yesterday.
Such figures are naturally of concern to city officials, whose goal is to have their citizens gainfully employed and paying taxes. But Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, cautions against reading too much into them.
And he should know. Two years ago, Mr. Bram wrote a paper trying to explain why, in mid-1997 as now, payrolls seemed to be growing so much faster than the number of people who said they had jobs. He found that after Government revisions to the data were taken into account, the trend was reversed.
Mr. Bram has since concluded that while the unemployment level is probably right, especially if several months are averaged together, the other information in the unemployment survey is unreliable. "Now," he said, "I just look at the data and chuckle."

HEADLINE: New Airline Gets Waivers For Flights to Upstate Cities

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
A new airline promising low-cost fares to upstate New York received a Federal waiver today permitting it to fly out of Kennedy International Airport, moving it a step closer to takeoff in 2000.
Jetblue Airways was awarded 75 daily slots for takeoffs and landings at Kennedy, which is one of only a handful of airports subject to a high density rule restricting the number of arrivals and departures. With the waiver, Jetblue will use Kennedy as a base and fly to 30 cities during the next three years. 
 The airline has promised to fly to Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester within its first 18 months in business with fares about 65 percent lower than current fares.
Upstate New York has been plagued with air fares that rank among the highest in the country, and critics say the high rates have crippled the region's economy. A ticket between Rochester and Albany, a distance of 200 miles, costs about $500, for instance.
The introduction of Jetblue is expected to remedy that by adding a low-fare carrier to a market with little competition. Supporters are hoping Jetblue will do for upstate New York what Southwest Airlines did for air fares in that region of the country.
"I feel like a proud uncle," Senator Charles E. Schumer said at a news conference today announcing the deal. Mr. Schumer had made lowering air fares in upstate New York one of his campaign promises last year.
"Jetblue will offer jet service on a regular basis at reasonable fares, and people will no longer be treated with the arrogance of a monopoly," Mr. Schumer said.
Jetblue's one-way rates from Kennedy to upstate New York cities are likely to be $39 to $99, said David Neelman, the airline's chief executive.
Jetblue will begin operation next year, and will serve 12 cities with 10 Airbus A-320's by the end of the first year. It plans a fleet of 82 jets.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the decision to grant the high number of exemptions was part of the Clinton Administration's effort to encourage "vigorous but fair competition" in the aviation industry.
Jetblue also needs Federal Aviation Administration certification, and will begin that process after it receives its first jet in December. It expects to start service in February, and has pledged that Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse will be among the first cities served.
United States Representative Louise M. Slaughter, whose Rochester district is home to Fortune 500 companies like Xerox and Kodak but has the fourth highest air fares in the nation, said she would be fighting hard to see that Rochester is the first upstate destination.
"We will start incantations, burning candles, whatever we can do to make Rochester your first stop," Ms. Slaughter, a Democrat, said today.
Mr. Neelman said service to Albany was also being considered, but no decision had been reached.
Also pending in the House of Representatives is legislation sponsored by Representative John Sweeney, Republican of Rensselaer County, that would remove slot restrictions at Kennedy and the country's three other slot-controlled airports thatwould, in theory, spur more competition. Some people oppose the legislation because it would create additional airplane noise near Kennedy.
The House and Senate are set to seek an agreement on the legislation in conference this fall.
In addition to upstate New York, Jetblue is considering offering service to major destinations like Washington, Atlanta and Houston, as well as smaller markets like Charleston, W.Va., and Grand Rapids, Mich.

HEADLINE: DaimlerChrysler And Auto Union In Tentative Deal;
One U.A.W. Local Official Calls Deal 'a Great Package'

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Sept. 16

 BODY:
Paving the way for contracts covering the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers, the United Automobile Workers union and DaimlerChrysler A.G. this morning reached tentative agreement on a four-year pact calling for a $1,350 signing bonus and pay increases of 3 percent a year on top of adjustments for inflation.
If workers ratify the deal later this month, as expected, they will also get heftier pension benefits and additional job security, even as the company is allowed to continue downsizing through attrition, according to local union officials. Under the current contract, auto workers have earned between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, depending on the amount of overtime they work and the level of corporate profits. 
 The four-year agreement is unusual because no auto labor contracts have lasted longer than three years since the 1950's. Had the new contract run for three years, it would have expired just as the union president was to retire, possibly amid contentious elections to choose his successor. This contract would provide raises of 3 percent for the first three years, plus a lump-sum payment in the fourth year of 3 percent of annual wages, according to union and company officials.
The raises come in addition to the inflation adjustments that have been a mainstay of the union's contracts with auto makers since 1948. In the current contract, that adjustment amounted to 90 percent of increases in the Consumer Price Index. So far this year, inflation is running at a 2.6 percent annual rate, which would trigger a 2.3 percent increase for auto workers. Workers would also get a share of corporate profits, as they have in past years.
The new agreement includes language prohibiting spinoffs of auto companies' parts units, local union officials said, and that could cause headaches for the Ford Motor Company, which plans to sell its Visteon auto parts unit, a move that would affect 23,500 union members.
U.A.W. national officials and company executives refused to disclose the details of the deal today, saying they wanted to first inform workers nationwide. Bargainers reached the deal after 48 hours of round-the-clock talks. "We have a lead company agreement," Frank Joyce, a union spokesman, announced about 8 A.M.. David Barnas, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, declined to discuss the terms of the deal.
Because the union typically reaches a deal with one of the Big Three auto makers, then insists the others accept similar terms, the DaimlerChrysler pact is expected to lay out a pattern for the General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor to follow in their contracts, which are being negotiated.
"The companies early on realized that with car sales at record levels and profits at record levels, they couldn't plead poverty," said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. "It is a generous contract."
Some local labor officials agreed. "We're pretty certain that it will be a pretty good deal for us," said Roger Brown, president of Local 550 in Indianapolis.
"It is a great package," said H. Scott Stanton, vice president of a Local 624 in Syracuse.
The language in the DaimlerChrysler contract covering spinoffs is a big concern for Ford, which is in the process of selling off Visteon, just as G.M. spun off its Delphi parts unit to investors earlier this year. Relations between Ford and the union, which for a decade have been the best in the industry, soured this year because of the company's plans to sell Visteon. That is one reason Ford is expected to be the last company to reach a deal on a new contract.
Ford executives said they did not know whether the agreement reached with DaimlerChrysler would make it more difficult for the company to divest the auto parts business. "We need to see the contract language before we can draw any conclusions," said Ed Miller, a Ford spokesman.
The deal reached today may result in similar pay raises for nonunion auto workers. Toyota Motor, Honda Motor, Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors have in the past matched the Big Three's hourly pay rates.
And because of the auto industry's sheer size, the deal also has significance for many American workers, said labor experts, who noted the strength of the wage gains.
"It sends a strong message that if the economy is so good, workers should be sharing it a bit more," said Harley S. Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "The high wages and the job security provisions promise a more motivated work force and a better relation with the union."
Mr. Shaiken, industry analysts and economists cautioned that their comments were based on an incomplete knowledge of the contract's contents.
Some economists said that the pay raises and heftier pension benefits might signal a trade with the union. The U.A.W. has been pressing the companies to replace retiring workers, but this contract allows faster downsizing by allowing the company to replace just one worker for every two who retire, according to local union officials. The current contracts require the companies to preserve 95 percent of existing jobs.
Nearly half the U.A.W. workers at the Big Three auto companies are eligible to retire within the next five years, the union says.
"For the nation's auto workers, it is a windfall," said Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago. "This is like the big buyouts that we've seen in the Fortune 500 for the past 20 years for white-collar workers."
The contract will allow the companies to build more cars with fewer workers, she said. "The U.A.W. got lucky that the auto makers are doing well enough to offer an olive branch of wage increases, but I'd be surprised if they stop the downsizing."
Wall Street is counting on continued downsizing. "The Street is right now presuming that G.M. will continue to ride the attrition wave," said Stephen Girsky, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The matter is most important for G.M. because it has been cutting its labor force while DaimlerChrysler's American factories have been hiring, and Ford's employment levels have been slowly falling since 1996.
Mr. Girsky called the deal "one of the richest contracts ever." He calculated that at 3 percent, three years of wage increases would cost G.M. another $2.26 billion in those years, or between $1.10 and $1.15 a share, assuming volume and productivity stayed the same. The lump-sum payment would cost G.M. approximately $375 million. Costs would be lower for Ford and DaimlerChrysler, perhaps 30 to 35 cents a share, Mr. Girsky estimated, because they have fewer workers. These numbers do not include adjustments for inflation.
The 1996 contract, which was extended on Tuesday, featured a $2,000 lump-sum payment in the first year and 3 percent raises in the next two years in addition to cost-of-living adjustments.
One sticking point in negotiations with DaimlerChrysler was a dispute over union organizing drives at a Mercedes sport utility factory in Vance, Ala., and at four factories building Freightliner trucks and components in North Carolina, South Carolina and Ontario, Canada.
The five nonunion factories were owned by Daimler before it bought Chrysler. The union received some reassurances that the company would stay neutral in the bargaining process, but details were unavailable today.
Around 8 A.M., the union president, Stephen P. Yokich, looking tired, gathered with his negotiators in DaimlerChrysler's parking lot here, and called them "a great team."
Asked whether they had popped champagne corks to celebrate reaching an agreement, Mr. Yokich shook his head. "Champagne? No. Some of us drank beer, some drank tea and some drank Diet Coke," Mr. Yokich said, as an empty Miller Beer can clattered to the concrete of the parking lot, having been dropped by one of his colleagues. One by one, members of his bargaining team gave him bear hugs and clapped him on the back, then got in their cars and drove away.
Mr. Yokich refused to characterize the talks, which seemed at several points over the last 20 hours to be nearly concluded. But he pooh-poohed the idea that the agreement had been close to final several times, but had been derailed by last-minute sticking points. "Close only counts in horseshoes, hand grenades and bocci balls," Mr. Yokich said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Given Bill for Raise For Congress And President

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Congress today passed and sent to President Clinton a spending bill that will increase its members' salaries, as well as those of Federal workers and the next President.
The measure contains a $4,600 raise for members of Congress, increasing their annual incomes to $141,300 a year, a 3.4 percent raise. The sum is about twice the average lawyer's income and roughly five times what the average American wage earner makes. 
 Mr. Clinton is expected to sign the measure, which would increase Congressional salaries in January. It would be the third increase Congress has given itself in seven years. Lawmakers voted themselves a raise in January 1998 and in January 1993.
Though conservative lawmakers have opposed raises, Federal law grants members of Congress an annual salary increase unless the members vote to block it, which they chose to do from 1994 until 1998.
Government workers would receive pay increases next year averaging 4.8 percent, which would be their biggest increase in pay in 18 years. The bill would also double the salary paid the President to $400,000 in January 2001, when Mr. Clinton's successor will be sworn in. That would be the first pay increase for a President in 32 years.
If the $200,000 salary paid back then to President Richard M. Nixon had been adjusted for inflation, it would now be nearly $900,000. That salary would be about average for a chief executive of one of the nation's 200 largest corporations.
The salaries of Federal judges are usually linked of those paid to lawmakers. But a House-Senate conference will have to add an increase if judges are to keep pace with Congress next year.
Also today, the Senate voted 95 to 0 for a $49.5 billion transportation bill that increases spending for roads, mass transit and airports. The House has passed a $50.7 billion measure, and the two bills must now be reconciled in a House-Senate conference.
The spending bill Congress completed and sent to Mr. Clinton today, a measure financing the Treasury Department and several smaller agencies, is only the third of 13 annual spending bills Congress has completed this year. A fourth, financing the District of Columbia, was finished late Thursday.
Hope is evaporating for Congress's finishing on time its only required task: spending the Government's money. Eight working days remain for Congress until the 2000 fiscal year begins on Oct. 1. "There are lots of obstacles ahead," said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee.
The obstacles include the Republican leadership, which has been unable to agree on a strategy to pass this year's spending bills.
Spending caps imposed by Congress have left the bills about $30 billion shy of what many members think will be needed to finance favorite programs, win passage and send the bills to the President.
Republican leaders are considering measures like charging billions of dollars in emergency agriculture aid that would be spent in the fiscal year 2000 against the previous year's books and delaying billions of dollars in Medicaid payments due to the states in September 2000, thus charging them against the fiscal year 2001.
In both cases, no money would be saved, but the spending would not be counted in the coming fiscal year.
If the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 without spending bills signed into law, the Government must operate on stop-gap bills called continuing resolutions. That is a fragile architecture, and if it breaks down in political disarray, a repeat of the Government shutdown of 1995 is possible.
The biggest and most complicated spending bills are in limbo. The measure financing labor, health and human services has been drained of billions of dollars to finance other spending bills, and it has not even been written, much less debated. Congressional aides said it was increasingly likely that the measure would never be completed but instead rolled into an omnibus spending bill that could be passed in October or November.

Red Tape vs. Green Cash: Making an Economy Thrive

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
John Stossel comes out tomorrow night fervently in favor of capitalism American style. Abetted by conservative theorists, he argues in "Is America No. 1?" that it's freedom that makes countries rich and government red tape that keeps them poor.
For his prime examples, he contrasts the vibrant economy of Hong Kong with sluggish India, where he finds himself beset by beggars every time he leaves his Calcutta hotel. The key to Hong Kong's prosperity, says Milton Friedman, the Nobel-winning economist, is leaving business alone. Enterprising businessmen in the former British colony report that unhampered by regulations, they are allowed to go forth and make money. 
 To prove his point, Mr. Stossel tells us he started his own business selling Frisbees and yo-yos. Well, he half proved it. It turned out to be easy for him to go into business, but hard for him to sell any Frisbees.
In India by contrast, it took Kentucky Fried Chicken months of political debate before it could get permission to peddle its fowl. Aspiring Indian entrepreneurs get lost in a regulatory rigmarole supposedly concocted for the public benefit. As Mr. Friedman puts the situation, "There is nothing that does so much harm as good intentions." Dinesh D'Souza of the American Enterprise Institute says that the Indian people owe their "vacant look" to poverty induced by Government interference.
If this line of argument seems a bit simple and doctrinaire, Mr. Stossel has no apologies. Turning homeward, he says that freedom is at the root of America's success story, too (even though the United States is overregulated compared with Hong Kong and nobody is lining up for the Stossel Frisbee). He draws his evidence from immigrants who were held back in France or Germany or Sweden or Jamaica and made fortunes as soon as they were on these liberated shores. "America today is just a great place to be," one prosperous immigrant announces.
Although the program, at Channel 7 at 9 P.M., overdoes the cheerleading, it does serve as a corrective to more customary television whining. Mr. Stossel grants that America may have its drawbacks -- pollution, racism, poverty, decadence -- but he finds that its record is good even where things seem bad. On a visit to the South Bronx, he discovers that people lining up for handouts have apartments with color television sets, microwave ovens and all the usual amenities. They aren't in line because they have been going without food, he asserts: "They come because the food is free."
Mr. D'Souza sums up by citing "one objective measure" for judging whether countries work well: "Do people want to come there?" To which Mr. Stossel cries amen: "And by that measure, America wins hands down." Having selected his evidence and his experts, our guide declares victory.

HEADLINE: Students Seek Some Reality Amid the Math Of Economics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
On my first day as a graduate student in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the professor introduced the discipline by intoning, "All of economics is a subset of the theory of separating hyperplanes." (You don't want to know what that mathematical term means.)
I started to giggle. But then I looked around. Everyone else was scribbling notes. So I wiped the smirk off my face and muttered, only to myself, that I had thought economics was about the plight of people living in sub-Saharan Africa or the impact of technological change on living standards. Apparently I thought wrong -- and wondered whether I had made a terrible career choice. 
 Decades later, I find economics graduate students asking themselves the same question: where is the economic substance in graduate economics programs? I recently joined several dozen first- and second-year students at a conference in Airlie, Va., that was convened to help them find their way toward applied economics -- analyzing problems that real people face. During the weeklong conference, organized by the Social Science Research Council and paid for by the John D. and Catherine T. McArthur Foundation, eminent scholars presented lectures on applied topics ranging from the plight of low-income mothers under the 1996 welfare law to the long-term determinants of innovation.
To noneconomists, these lectures would no doubt appear heavily theoretical, laced with mathematical and statistical derivations. But at least since the writings of Paul Samuelson, Nobel laureate from M.I.T., in the 1940's, economists have used large doses of mathematics to create insight and clarity.
The difference at Airlie was that the object of the lectures was to improve understanding of the relationships among people rather than among mathematical symbols. After the lectures students met in small groups to pose follow-up questions and design research strategies. The idea was to motivate them to do applied work and give them a head start in developing an applied focus for their Ph.D. theses.
David Weiman, the former director of the council's program and now at the Russell Sage Foundation, hopes that the summer conference and research grants that the council provides can offset what he sees as a lamentable tendency among young graduate students. Too often, he says, they allow mathematical technique to dictate the questions they ask rather than first seizing a pressing social question from which the choice of appropriate technique would then follow. Graduate programs, he says, "emphasize teaching students how to prove theorems, misleading them into thinking that economics is a deductive exercise, the mere application of mathematical logic."
Prof. Alan Blinder of Princeton University considers it damning to some of the country's most prestigious graduate programs that their students need to flock to summer camp to find an outlet for their interest in applied work. Mr. Blinder, a former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and a driving force behind the council's efforts to promote applied economics, said in a recent interview that too much of what young scholars write these days is "theoretical drivel, mathematically elegant but not about anything real." He attributes the problem in part to the first year of training, or what he calls mathematics boot camp, during which students are handed a steady diet of theory but not taught to connect it to the real world. They soon forget the issues that attracted them to economics.
Mr. Blinder makes an important distinction. He remains scrupulously agnostic over whether graduate training is overly theoretical. "That's a tough issue." But he is unwavering when he criticizes the training as "increasingly aloof and self-referential."
Indeed, the students at Airlie seemed surprisingly unfamiliar with many current economic issues. Chatting at lunch with a half-dozen of so of the graduate students, one of the guest lecturers referred to the earned-income tax credit as the E.I.T.C., the country's most successful anti-poverty program next to Social Security. "What's that," one student asked. Nor could many of the students distinguish Medicare from Medicaid or demonstrate familiarity with simple facts about the American economy. They had studied the theory of financial markets, but not its connection to the crisis sweeping through Asia.
Many of these students admitted that they do not read newspapers. Nor do many see much of a connection between knowledge of economic reality or Government policies and their chosen course of study.
Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution lectured the group about the economic factors that determine when people decide to retire. I joined a half-dozen students in their follow-up session. The students were asked what interesting questions Mr. Burtless's lecture provoked. After a slightly awkward silence, one student launched into the speculation that the group could develop a "two-sector general equilibrium model" that could be tweaked in this or that direction. When the students were asked again to pose questions, not design models, the conversation drifted once more toward mathematical modeling.
So has graduate economics training run off the rails? There is another side. Economics professors and graduates from the very schools -- Michigan, M.I.T, Columbia, Stanford, Wisconsin, Harvard, Colorado, University of Pennsylvania, New York University -- that supplied students for the conference do a great deal of excellent applied work. Compared with 20 or even 10 years ago, there has been an explosion in the number of academics who are consultants to think tanks for policy analysis, corporations and Government agencies.
Franklin Fisher of M.I.T. is the Justice Department's chief economist in the Microsoft antitrust trial; his colleague, Richard Schmalensee, is Microsoft's chief economist. Harvard's Lawrence H. Summers is Secretary of the Treasury; Stanford's Joseph Stiglitz is senior vice president of the World Bank; M.I.T.'s Stanley Fischer is deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Harvard's Lawrence F. Katz and Princeton's Alan Krueger designed labor-force policies for the Clinton Administration. Harvard's David Ellwood designed President Clinton's original welfare proposal.
Research economists at the influential think tanks and nonprofit research organizations, like the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute, were trained at many of the same graduate programs feeding students to the council's summer conference. The National Bureau of Economic Research, led by Prof. Martin Feldstein of Harvard, turns out hundreds of papers each year on applied topics by some of the nation's best academic economists.
Claudia Goldin, an economic historian at Harvard and a prolific author of reports for the bureau, says that "applied economics is perfectly healthy and fine, at least at the better graduate programs." Her point is that students at the major Ph.D. programs do not have to look very far to find faculty heavily involved in applied research to serve as role models and advisers. But Ms. Goldin does echo part of Mr. Blinder's anxiety that the first year of courses can be relentlessly abstract, creating at least a temporary barrier to those who started out thinking they want something applied.
Then perhaps economics has stumbled onto an unwittingly workable life-cycle for many academics. During the first couple of years of training, professors pile on a formidable amount of abstract theory at the only time that students can study uninterrupted at the feet of their masters. But, Mr. Blinder observes, as professors age, they turn increasingly to applied subjects. Though graduate programs make it hard for students to follow applied interests early on, many eventually find their way.
Even so, problems remain. Many of the students at Airlie complained that their Ph.D. programs provided few clues on how to do applied research and even less encouragement. That, Mr. Blinder says, may contribute to a gnawing anxiety, pinpointed in 1991 by a commission appointed by the American Economic Association, that Ph.D. programs are not attracting their share of the brightest undergraduates. The increasingly sterile nature of early courses may be driving many undergraduates to other disciplines. Mr. Weiman's and Mr. Blinder's goal is to shorten the time it takes graduate students to tackle the applied problems that captivated them as undergraduates.
Neither Mr. Blinder nor Mr. Weiman are calling for wholesale change in graduate training. Economics is heavily mathematical and usefully so. The most ambitious Ph.D. programs are teaching students how to make theoretical breakthroughs. No one wants theorists like Paul Samuelson to be teaching welfare policy rather than the mathematics of a hanging string. But early training may have evolved to a dysfunctional extreme. Prof. Lawrence J. White of the Stern School of Business at New York University observes, "It's ironic that economists, who make their living telling everyone else what's efficient, can't figure out whether their own educational process is efficient."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
U.S. Firm Has Control of Korea First Bank

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After 10 months of tortuous off-again, on-again negotiations, the Government of South Korea signed a binding agreement tonight to sell a controlling stake in Korea First Bank to Newbridge Capital Ltd., a United States-based investment firm.
The sale marks the first time that foreigners have attained control of a South Korean bank. 
 Newbridge, backed by the investors Richard C. Blum and David Bonderman, has agreed to pay 500 billion won, or about $417 million, for a 51 percent stake and total management control of Korea First, one of South Korea's oldest and biggest banks.
Korea First is one of two banks nationalized after a $58 billion bailout of the South Korean economy by the International Monetary Fund in 1998.
The Government will take on all nonperforming loans and add to the bank's reserves should its existing reserves fail to meet new accounting standards. It has also agreed to take on loans that go bad over the next few years.
"This was a phenomenal opportunity to buy a terrific franchise in a great economy, all of which says it should work out very well," said Dan Carroll, a managing director at Newbridge.
The deal is further evidence that South Korea intends to carry through with the sweeping changes in its economic landscape that President Kim Dae Jung promised in the aftermath of the country's financial crisis, albeit not without some fits and starts.
After the Government's decision in July to force a wrenching overhaul at Daewoo Group, one of South Korea's biggest, most troubled and most recalcitrant business conglomerates, the sale of Korea First looks like another step toward integrating South Korea into the global marketplace.
"This is a testament to President Kim's commitment to reform the financial sector, in fact, a showcase for it," said Hyun Hong Choo, a lawyer and former politician.
The deal, which is binding but still requires further negotiation and documentation, has encountered numerous delays. Signed in the waning hours of last New Year's Eve to meet a pledge made to the I.M.F., the transaction was to have been completed by March 31, then by the end of April, then by the end of May, after which the Government stopped setting targets.
One reason for the delay was the lack of negotiators representing the Government. Lee Jun Hai, the chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, basically conducted all the negotiations himself in addition to handling his many other duties as head of South Korea's financial watchdog.
The deal was also delayed by bureaucratic stalling, political wrangling and South Korea's strong economic recovery.
But the near-collapse of Daewoo and the questions it raised about the effectiveness of economic reforms in South Korea appear to have shaken the Government's confidence. When a deal to sell Seoul Bank, the other nationalized bank, to HSBC Holdings fell through last month, it put pressure on the commission to complete the deal with Newbridge or face international criticism for its failure to let foreign capital and expertise help revitalize the banking system.
In addition, keeping the bank on life support was proving costly. The Government poured $3.5 billion of taxpayer money into Korea First during the negotiations.
Newbridge becomes the fourth international investor in the Korean financial system and the biggest. Commerz Bank A.G. of Germany owns 30.4 percent of the Korea Exchange Bank, and Goldman, Sachs & Company has a 17 percent stake in Kookmin Bank, a major retail bank. ING Groep N.V., the sprawling Dutch financial services company, has a 10 percent stake in the Housing and Commercial Bank.

HEADLINE: Greenspan on Year 2000

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that a risk of bottlenecks in the economy might result from fear of Year 2000 computer problems, but that major catastrophes were unlikely. At a gathering of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, he called the chance of big disruptions to critical business infrastructure "negligible." He said the major challenge for policy makers was calming the worries of business and households. Inventory building by businesses could add to economic growth and inflation risks while a widespread technical breakdown and public panic might undermine the economy.

HEADLINE: Ford Facing Unrest in U.S. And Canada

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 17

 BODY:
After enjoying the best labor relations in the auto industry for a generation, the Ford Motor Company is likely to face a strike next week in Canada and heavy pressure in the United States from the United Automobile Workers union.
Auto labor leaders on both sides of the border have been emboldened by the rich contract that the U.A.W. tentatively reached on Thursday with DaimlerChrysler A.G. The four-year contract revived a practice from the union's glory days of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's by calling for annual wage increases of 3 percent in addition to cost-of-living adjustments that almost match the rate of inflation. 
 Under the leadership of an aggressive new chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser, Ford is trying to cut costs. It is also trying to spin off its giant parts division, Visteon Automotive Systems, to match the General Motors Corporation's spinoff in May of its auto parts unit.
But the U.A.W. is resisting the Visteon sale, and the Canadian Auto Workers union contends that Ford's record profits should produce substantial increases in wages. That raises the possibility that Ford might face the same kind of one-two punch that hurt G.M. in 1996, when the Canadian workers staged a three-week strike and the United States union followed with four-day walkouts at G.M.'s most profitable factories. Though a strike against Ford in the United States is far from certain, the new, hard-line leadership of the U.A.W.'s Ford division could yet force a showdown, union officials said.
Ford made its initial bargaining offer to the Canadian union today on wages and other financial issues, and it provoked a furious reaction from Basil Hargrove, the union president. Mr. Hargrove called the offer too low even to negotiate and repeated his union's threat to go on strike when the current three-year contract expires at 11:59 P.M. on Tuesday. "Given where we are today," he added, "I think the odds are one in a thousand we can have a settlement by Tuesday."
The Canadian union almost always calls a strike against the first company with which it holds labor talks, and this year it is Ford's turn to go first. Canadian labor laws prevent the union from staging strikes while a contract is in force, whereas the U.A.W. can call factory-level strikes at any time simply by saying that there are health or safety violations.
Canadian union leaders were particularly unhappy today with the terms of Ford's initial offer, copies of which they made public and were confirmed by the company. The offer called for a wage increase of 1 percent in each of the three years of the contract in addition to annual cost-of-living increases, plus a $500 bonus in the first year of the contract.
Prepared before the DaimlerChrysler settlement on Thursday, the offer looked stingy by comparison. The DaimlerChrysler contract included a $1,350 bonus in the first year as well as four 3 percent wage increases, according to people familiar with the agreement. They denied initial reports that the contract only called for a lump sum payment of 3 percent in the fourth year, saying that a last-minute change during the negotiations had resulted in wage increases in all four years.
By comparison, the contract over the last three years called for a $2,000 bonus in the first year with no wage increase other than the cost-of-living adjustment, followed by 3 percent wage increases and the cost-of-living adjustment in the second and third years. Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said the DaimlerChrysler contract was a little better than the previous contract but would not affect inflation in the United States because few private-sector workers are unionized these days.
The DaimlerChrysler contract is subject to a vote by workers next week, and is expected to win ratification easily.
The U.A.W. did not win all of its battles in the DaimlerChrysler negotiations. The company agreed to stay neutral in the union's struggle to organize workers at the Mercedes sport utility vehicle factory in Vance, Ala. But the company insisted that workers hold a secret ballot to decide whether to unionize, rather than allow the U.A.W. to gather the signatures of half of the workers, which would have been an easier task, people familiar with the labor contract said.
The U.A.W. traditionally takes the wages and benefits provisions of a national contract like DaimlerChrysler's and insists that the other unionized auto makers accept the same terms. Some union officials said on Thursday that the DaimlerChrysler contract also had a provision prohibiting the spin-off of business units. If the U.A.W. was to demand that Ford accept a provision barring the spin-off of Visteon, a nasty battle could ensue.
It was unclear today what the provision said. Provisions barring spinoffs at other auto makers in the past have been in side letters of agreement, not in the actual labor contracts, and have not been applied across the entire industry.
The U.A.W. has been holding intensive talks with G.M. all this week, while leaving Ford for last. Mr. Hargrove said this was not part of a strategy to use Canadian workers to soften up Ford with a strike because his union does not represent any Visteon workers and so will not negotiate a contract affecting them.
A Canadian strike would shut down Ford's production of Windstar minivans, the Ford Crown Victoria and the Mercury Grand Marquis full-sized sedans and one of Ford's pickup truck factories. It also could eventually stop production of engine parts for most of Ford's factories in the United States.
In the United States, Ford faces an emotional struggle by workers at its Visteon division, most of whom have worked for Ford Motor and the Ford family all their lives and some of whom are third- and even fourth-generation Ford workers. Roughly 1,000 Visteon workers and their family members joined Detroit's Labor Day parade this year, wearing black shirts and waving signs calling for Ford not to spin off or sell the unit.
William Clay Ford Jr., a great-grandson of Henry Ford and now the nonexecutive chairman of the company, once ran what is now Visteon's car heaters and air conditioners unit. He even had an office at the factory in Plymouth, Mich., that produces these parts and that has become the focal point for resistance to a spin-off.
Roger D. Caldwell, the president of the U.A.W. local unit at the factory, said spinning off the Visteon factories would betray the traditions of the Ford family and the company. "The whole background and culture is that this has been a family company, and proud of it," he said today.
But if Ford does not spin off Visteon, it could put itself at a lasting competitive disadvantage. Though auto makers pay all assembly and parts workers high, equal wages, independent auto parts companies, even those that are unionized, pay much less. Chrysler sold most of its auto parts factories in the early 1980's, and now G.M. has disposed of its parts business, although the business has agreed to continue paying G.M.-level wages at first.
One possible settlement would be for Visteon to become independent but agree to continue paying the same wages and benefits as Ford. The Internet site for Mr. Caldwell's local union says such a plan might prevent a national strike. But Mr. Caldwell said he would not be satisfied with anything less than Visteon's remaining part of Ford.

HEADLINE: New-Home Starts Rise, Despite Higher Mortgages

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments rose four-tenths of a percent in August, leaving analysts marveling at the continued strength in housing despite rising mortgage rates.
The Commerce Department reported today that construction climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.68 million units last month, led by another big rise in apartment building. 
 Many analysts had been expecting a 2 percent decline in housing starts because of the higher mortgage rates. Rates on 30-year fixed mortgages hit a high of 8.15 percent in mid-August, their highest point in more than two years. Rates have since eased to 7.82 percent, according to this week's Freddie Mac survey, still above the 6.79 percent at the start of the year.
Many economists, noting that the slowdown they have been forecasting for some months has yet to occur, said they were revising their housing forecasts upward.
"It would be foolish to characterize the housing market as anything but still going flat out," said David Orr, chief economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said that the rising lending rates had failed to dampen demand because the overall economy was performing better than expected, with unemployment in August at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent.
"Incomes and employment have at least as much effect on housing as mortgage rates, and they are doing better than expected," he said.
Still, analysts detected some hints that rising mortgage rates were beginning to dampen demand a bit. Construction starts on single-family homes fell in August by 1.3 percent.

HEADLINE: DEATH IN A CHURCH: THE KILLER;
A Troubled Man Went Free, As Long as None Were Hurt

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Anybody who had been around Larry Ashbrook could tell that the man had problems.
Neighbors say he would lie flat on the roof of his house, hiding behind a chimney, as if he were conducting surveillance. He sent rambling letters to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, telling of strange encounters with the Central Intelligence Agency. And he was described as a paranoid schizophrenic by his brother, Aaron Ashbrook, in a call to the Wise County Sheriff's Department in July. 
 But the life of this emotionally troubled loner, who opened fire in the Wedgwood Baptist Church here on Wednesday, killing seven people before killing himself, demonstrates how little can be done in such a case before something terrible happens.
"It's kind of tricky because we can't force people to have treatment," said Shelley Buttgen, a spokeswoman for the Mental Health-Mental Retardation agency in Tarrant County. "When someone is acting strange, you can't just run right out and throw them in a hospital."
Capt. Harold Denney of the Wise County Sheriff's Department said a deputy was sent to the home of Aaron Ashbrook, who lives in Wise County, north of Fort Worth, after the call about Larry Ashbrook's mental condition.
"His brother called and said their father had just died, and he was worried he was going to come to the house and cause trouble," Captain Denney said. "So a deputy went out, stayed about an hour, and the guy never showed up. So the deputy went off duty. And that was the end of it."
Captain Denney said his department did not take any further action because no law had been broken.
"There's not a whole lot you can do," he said. "Unless the guy's done something, you let it go."
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, where Mr. Ashbrook sent two long, bizarre letters this summer, did not alert the authorities because Mr. Ashbrook had not made any threats. It did not publish the letters, and Mr. Ashbrook subsequently came to the newspaper's office to ask why they had not been published but he did not act hostile, officials at the paper said.
"We get letters all the time that don't make any sense," said Bob Ray Sanders, a vice president and associate editor of The Star-Telegram. "You think he's a little off, but what do you do?"
In his letters, Mr. Ashbrook wrote of "being targeted by some investigative group," and told of going to the Fort Worth office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. "An agent, I will not list his name here, invited me to sit in his office and he would hear what I had to say," Mr. Ashbrook wrote. "The problem, though, is that he listened for about one minute, then stood up and told me that I would be contacted."
Marjorie Poche, a special agent for the F.B.I. in Dallas, said that there was no record of Mr. Ashbrook's visit but that it would not likely have been logged anyway. She said many emotionally disturbed people visit the bureau's offices.
"They bring in pages and pages of writings, with words scrawled up and down the sides of the paper," she said. "It's so common, much more common than most people realize."
"You listen, apologize, and send them on their way," she continued. "Who would you call? The local hospital? For us to do anything, they would have to show they are a danger."
Social service agencies in Texas, especially those dealing with people who are mentally ill, struggle to reconcile their vast workloads with their lean budgets.
In Tarrant County alone, the mental health agency saw more than 13,000 people with emotional or psychological disturbances last year, Ms. Buttgen said.
Texas spends less on mental health services, per person, than any other state, said Bernard Weinstein, a professor at the University of North Texas in Denton.
"Part of the Texas ethos is that government is not going to solve your problems," said Mr. Weinstein, an economics professor who has written about the state's low level of spending on social services. "But holes have opened in the safety net."
Professor Weinstein said a lack of mental health services could be especially troublesome in a state where guns were so plentiful. Texas has 80 million guns, he said, four times the state's population.
While there is no record of Mr. Ashbrook's being seen at public mental health centers, it is possible that he had been counseled in private practice. A search of his home turned up no medications for mental illness.
Mr. Ashbrook's sister, Elizabeth Gentry, is a marriage and family counselor living in Austin, Tex., but it is not clear whether she talked to her brother about his troubles. The family could not be reached for comment.
Neighbors of Mr. Ashbrook related a litany of his bizarre behavior. Some teen-agers said he was known as "Crazy Larry."
Mabel Arfman, a 74-year-old retired secretary, said Mr. Ashbrook "seemed to be out of step with everybody." She would watch him circle the block in his father's car, and worry about him.
She wished there was a way to help, but did not know how. "As long as he didn't hurt anybody, we ignored it," she said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Falls to 2.1% in Connecticut, Lowest in Nation

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in Connecticut has fallen to 2.1 percent, the lowest level in the nation and the lowest for the state in more than 20 years, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
"Basically, anyone that wants to find work is finding a job," said Salvatore DiPillo, labor statistics supervisor for the Connecticut Department of Labor. 
 Nationally, the jobless rate, which measures the percentage of the labor force that is actively looking for work, remained at 4.2 percent in August; in New York State, the rate is 5.1 percent.
When Connecticut's unemployment rate fell sharply in July, to 2.6 percent from 3.4 percent, economists suggested that it might be a fluke. The unemployment rate calculations are based on a survey of fewer than 600 households.
But now that there has been a second month with a steep decline, economy-watchers are starting to say that the figures may reflect the real world.
"It's hard to believe it could be 2.1 percent, because that's a World War II number, when everybody was in a full-court press," said William McEachern, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. But, he added, "a low unemployment number is consistent with everything we have seen in the economy."
Employers in the state, having difficulty finding enough employees, are trying new strategies to find workers. While the number of jobs in the state has been growing, Connecticut's labor force has been shrinking, according to data released yesterday.
"Companies are no longer waiting for openings to occur before they look for people," said Wendy Alfus Rothman, managing partner of Advantage Human Resourcing in Stamford. In addition to recruiting almost continuously, she said, employers are also talking to a wider variety of people, including older workers, those who have been out of the work force for a while and those who want to work from home.
On Wednesday, a state-sponsored job fair in Hartford attracted a record 120 would-be employers, said John Tirinzonie, who runs the job fairs for the State Department of Labor. More than 1,300 job seekers showed up -- but a survey of them suggest that at least half already had jobs.
In fact, the state is willing to help find jobs for out-of-state workers because employers are so needy.
Later this month, it will sponsor a job fair in Danbury that is cosponsored by the Chamber of Commerce in nearby Brewster, N.Y., Mr. Tirinzonie said. "Danbury has the bigger companies and the jobs, while New York tends to have the work force," he said.
Though the rock-bottom unemployment rate in Connecticut has revived fears that inflation will reignite, so far there is little evidence of sharp rises in either workers' wages or consumer prices.
Nor does the low unemployment rate seem to be discouraging companies from staying in -- or moving to -- Connecticut, local officials said.
In the year ended in June, 29 companies moved to Stamford, where the unemployment rate is 1.2 percent, said Joseph McGee, vice president of Sacia, which is the business council of southwest Connecticut. That number is not significantly below the recent average of 30 to 35 new corporate arrivals a year, Mr. McGee said, although he said the recent newcomers have been somewhat smaller than in the past.
But in the long run, such a low unemployment rate can eliminate a state from consideration when a company is thinking of moving or expanding.
"Among all the factors that a company uses to determine an area's suitability, the availability of a plentiful work force is at the top of the list," said Rob DeRocker, senior vice president of Development Counselors International, a consulting concern. "Nothing else is even close."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Covered Cost of Ads Backing It in Antitrust Suit

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Newspaper advertisements that a California institute presented as independent views supporting the Microsoft Corporation's position in its antitrust trial were actually paid for by Microsoft, the institute said today.
The full-page newspaper ads, published in The New York Times and The Washington Post by the Independent Institute last June, were in the form of a letter signed by 240 academic experts. They prompted news stories and courtroom discussion during the trial. 
 The academics were not told that Microsoft was paying for the ads, and at least one now says he would not have signed if he had known the source of the financing.
Greg Shaw, a public relations manager for Microsoft, tonight confirmed that the company had paid for the ads. "We thought this was an important, substantive letter, and we were interested in contributing to making it visible," he said. "In our view, the letter speaks for itself."
During the yearlong public relations war that has been fought in parallel with the antitrust trial, a dozen or more institutes and lobbying organizations have weighed in with advertisements, reports, news conferences or books that offer strong opinions on one side of the case or the other.
Many of the organizations have acknowledged that they were financed by Microsoft, or by its rivals. But the Independent Institute made an extraordinary effort to portray itself as beholden to no one. The institute, based in Oakland, Calif., has written papers and offered opinions on a broad range of political, social, business and foreign policy issues over the 14 years of its existence. Throughout the trial, it has often taken Microsoft's side.
According to its literature, the institute "adheres to the highest standards of independent scholarly inquiry." Its president, David Theroux, describes himself as a scrupulously disinterested academic and adds: "We are not doing contract work. We're independent. Our intention is to do work that holds up to any type of scrutiny."
But internal institute documents show that Microsoft has secretly served as the institute's largest outside financial benefactor in the last year. The documents were provided by a Microsoft adversary associated with the computer industry who refused to be further identified.
Microsoft has mounted an elaborate public relations campaign as part of its trial strategy, to influence public opinion and, perhaps, the trial judge. Much of it is open and above board, but today's admission by the institute suggests that an important part is intended to be secret.
On June 2, the day the antitrust trial resumed for its final month of testimony after a three-month break, the institute ran full-page ads in The New York Times and The Washington Post signed by 240 academics who were said to support the view that antitrust prosecution was harmful to consumers -- a key argument Microsoft was making in court. Complemented by a heavily promoted news conference in Washington, the effort received enough attention that David Boies, the Government's lead lawyer in the antitrust suit, referred to it in court on June 3.
Last month, the institute published a book titled "Winners, Losers and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology." The book argued that Microsoft had succeeded in dominating the software industry principally because it makes superior products -- another often-voiced theme of Microsoft's trial defense. The company's economic witness at the trial, Richard J. Schmalensee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, cited the book as a source for an important assertion in his direct testimony.
Mr. Theroux has long acknowledged that Microsoft is a dues-paying member of his group, a point that is usually made in news articles about the institute. But he has insisted all along that Microsoft is "just one of 2,000 members" and as such pays a membership fee of roughly $10,000 a year -- an inconsequential part of the organization's overall budget that gives the company no special standing. All Microsoft gets for that, he said, is "free copies of our publications, discounted tickets to our events."
He has also maintained that Microsoft had nothing to do with the newspaper advertisements. The ads, he said in the interview, "were paid for out of our general funds."
His letter to economists soliciting participation made no mention of Microsoft.
But, in fact, among the institute's internal documents is a bill Mr. Theroux sent to John A. C. Kelly of Microsoft for the full costs of the ads, plus his travel expenses from San Francisco to Washington for the news conference, totaling $153,868.67. Included was a $5,966 bill for airline tickets for himself and a colleague. Unfortunately, he wrote Mr. Kelly, "the airlines were heavily booked" and "we had to fly first class to D.C. and business class on the return."
Asked this evening about that bill, Mr. Theroux acknowledged that Microsoft had paid for the ad but said it made no difference. "The academic process we use is independent of sources of revenue."
At least one academic who signed the ad disagreed.
"He should have told us," Simon Hakim, an economist at Temple University, said today when told of the financing. "I would not have participated if I had known. It's not right to use people as a vehicle for special interests."
On the other hand, Stan J. Liebowitz, a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Dallas who was one of the authors of the "Winners, Losers and Microsoft" book, said that he, too, had been unaware of the Microsoft payments, but added, "it doesn't matter to me."
Also among the institute's internal documents was an accounting of 337 contributions the institute received for the fiscal year that ended June 30. Mr. Theroux said those donations accounted for 60 percent or 70 percent of the institute's overall budget.
The accounting sheets show that Microsoft contributed significantly more than $10,000 last year -- $203,217, in all, the most from any outside individual or organization and about 20 percent of the total outside contributions for the period. (Not counted in that tally was $304,725 that Mr. Theroux contributed to his own foundation.)

HEADLINE: Plan to Strengthen Colombia Nudges U.S. for $3.5 Billion

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Responding to concern in the United States about surging drug production and guerrilla activity here, the Colombian Government today unveiled a plan for "peace, prosperity and strengthening the state" that calls for $3.5 billion in assistance from the United States and other allies during the next three years.
Aides to President Andres Pastrana, who is scheduled to leave on Saturday for a visit to the United States, said he intended to discuss the proposal with President Clinton when the two meet in New York City early next week. 
 They said that later in Washington he also planned to lobby Congress on behalf of the plan, which includes diplomatic initiatives and trade liberalization measures as well as requests for a dramatic increase in American aid.
In a meeting this afternoon with a group of foreign reporters, Jaime Ruiz, Mr. Pastrana's closest aide and an architect of the proposal, said that "a bit more than half" of the money budgeted is intended for "strengthening and restructuring of the army" or combatting drug trafficking. Colombia's two main left-wing guerrilla groups have been fighting the Government for decades, and in recent years have taxed drug traffickers to obtain money to buy weapons.
Speaking to the nation of 40 million people tonight in a 15-minute televised address, Mr. Pastrana said that "narcotics trafficking is the main enemy of peace" and that his plan would strengthen the democracy by helping to "defeat the pernicious financing of armed groups."
In another reference to the drug trade, always Washington's principal concern here, he added that "only by fortifying the legal economy can we defeat the illegal economy."
Colombia is earmarked to get $289 million in American aid in the fiscal year about to end. But in July, following a guerrilla offensive that forced Mr. Pastrana to impose a limited curfew in one third of Colombia, Minister of Defense Luis Fernando Ramirez visited Washington with a request for an additional $500 million in military assistance.
Since then, two American delegations, one led by Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Mr. Clinton's drug czar, and the other from the State Department, have visited Colombia to assess a situation that Washington believes is deteriorating. American officials were said to have strongly urged Mr. Pastrana to be more aggressive in meeting the combined guerrilla and drug trafficking challenge.
"Colombia has paid a price that is truly disproportionate" in the global struggle against narcotics trafficking, he said, and therefore has the right to "demand that the rest of the world recognize that effort" and show solidarity.
While maintaining that "we have always had a strategy," Mr. Ruiz said the revamped program that has been drawn up envisions spending $7.5 billion during the next three years. He said Colombia had about $4 billion of that amount already budgeted and expected to receive $750 million soon from international lending agencies for social programs, but will need foreign help if the program is to be fully effective.
"We are not asking for money," Mr. Ruiz said, adding that no one in Washington has suggested that he ask for any specific amount. "We are not saying, 'Give us this or this or that.' We are saying, 'Here is our strategy, and this is how much money we are short.' "
Since taking office in August 1998, Mr. Pastrana has been accused by some in the United States, especially Republican members of Congress, of having a commitment to peace talks with the guerrillas at any cost, rather than a comprehensive strategy. But Mr. Ruiz made an effort to stress that Mr. Pastrana is prepared to step up military action against the rebels if talks with the principal group prove unsuccessful, as many here and in Washington have predicted.
"A country cannot bet everything on a peace process," he said. "We're going with the peace process because we believe in it. But that is not the only thing we are doing." The revised plan, he added, "functions with or without a peace process" because "it is a general strategy of strengthening the state."
Mr. Ruiz also cautioned that the revised strategy, though ambitious, would not in itself be sufficient to end the longstanding military conflict or wipe out the drug trade. "With this I am not going to resolve the problem," he said. "But it can make a difference at a crucial moment."

HEADLINE: TRADE SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA ARE EASED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton today ordered a broad easing of economic sanctions against North Korea in what officials said was the first step in a long-term plan to induce the North to abandon its missile and nuclear programs.
The announcement -- the most extensive relaxation of sanctions against the North since the Korean War -- came four days after North Korea agreed to a temporary halt in its tests of long-range missiles. 
 A senior North Korean official is expected in Washington soon to begin talks on a comprehensive accord that would also end North Korea's missile exports to Pakistan and the Middle East.
But even Administration officials question whether the North Korean military, on whom President Kim Jong Il depends to exercise power in the Stalinist state, will go beyond the freeze on long-range tests and dismantle the dozen or so medium-range Nodong missiles they have deployed.
Under the terms of the announcement today, North Korea will be able to purchase consumer goods from the United States -- if it can get the hard currency. And it will be able to transport cargo and passengers back and forth from the United States. Until now, all such shipments have been banned.
Individuals in the United States will also be allowed to transfer funds to North Koreans.
The North already enjoys many such privileges with Japan, home to a large community of ethnic Koreans with some loyalties to the North. Japan has threatened to cut off their flow of cash and goods if North Korea tests the long-range missile.
American companies will be able to invest in North Korea's drastically underdeveloped raw materials industries, including agriculture, petroleum and timber. But in a country where there are no laws protecting investors and no protection against nationalization, it is far from clear that any American businesses will take the enormous risks involved.
"Making sure that there are concrete results for the North Koreans is a big issue, and it is one we are only now beginning to explore," William S. Perry, a former Secretary of Defense who developed the strategy as President Clinton's special envoy on North Korean affairs, said in an interview at the State Department.
Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called the decision to relax sanctions "a road that holds out the possibility of long-term stability and even eventual reconciliation on the Korean peninsula."
But, she added, "it is not a one-way street" and "if circumstances require that we go down a different road altogether, we will do so to defend our interests."
Today's order relaxes a total embargo on trade imposed in 1950. Since then some prohibitions have been relaxed, to permit academic, sports and cultural exchanges and the delivery of American food to relieve starvation in the North.
None of the actions announced today require Congressional approval, although the next step -- lifting sanctions imposed by legislation -- would require approve.
While some Republicans, like Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, supported the move today, the chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, said, "We are once again entering a cycle of extortion with North Korea."
Echoing the words of a recent Republican fundraising appeal written by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Mr. Gilman called North Korea "one of the most significant threats to American national security in the world today."
Mr. Perry said he was braced for the criticism that the Administration was paying off the North Koreans. But he argued that the alternative -- strengthening American forces along the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South Korea -- would be far more expensive.
He pointed to the 1994 accord that froze North Korea's production of plutonium, in return for $40 million a year in fuel oil from the United States and construction of two power plants financed by South Korea and Japan.
"It was a good buy," he said. "If you look at the potential cost of the deterrence action we were looking at in 1994," he said, when the two countries came the closest to armed confrontation since the Korean War ended in 1953, "the bill would have run to the tens of billions of dollars."
In relaxing the sanctions, Mr. Clinton calculated that he had little at risk, his aides said. The restrictions can be reimposed at the stroke of a pen if North Korea tests one of its new missiles over Japan, a launching that seemed imminent a few weeks ago. And before today's announcement goes into effect, the Commerce and Treasury Departments must issue regulations, a process that could be slowed -- or stopped -- if North Korea threatens a launching or similar action.
Soon after he began his review of North Korea policy last year, Mr. Perry, who was Defense Secretary during the 1994 crisis over the North's nuclear capability, concluded that freezing the missile program had to be Washington's top priority.
American intelligence has already concluded that the North probably possesses a small quantity of weapons-grade plutonium, enough "for perhaps the manufacture of one or two nuclear weapons," Mr. Perry said, which might be fitted into the nose cone of one of its missiles. The newest of those missiles could reach Alaska or the western United States.
But putting together the whole package -- designing a workable weapon, making it small enough to launch, then guiding the missile to a target -- is considered a task beyond the North's ability without help.
There has been speculation that the North has sought that help from Pakistan, trading missile parts for nuclear expertise. But intelligence officials say that so far, there is no evidence of such deals.
Despite the easing of sanctions, many restrictions remain on dealings with the North. The country is still classified as a terrorist state, meaning American companies cannot ship goods with a military as well as a civilian purpose, including advanced personal computers, without special approval.
The United States will still oppose loans to the North from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, or from American financial institutions. North Korean assets in the United States will remain blocked by the Trading With the Enemy Act.
Under Mr. Perry's plan, worked out over a period of months with the White House and presented to the North Koreans several months ago in a mission to Pyongyang, many of these restrictions are on the table for negotiation.
But in return, the North would have to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international accord that limits the range of missiles a country can deploy and that would mean dismantling some of the North's current missile fleet. The North Korean military is dead set against that, American officials say.
"We have a hard time believing that we represent a threat to the North," Mr. Perry said today. "But they clearly see us as a military threat to them."
He said a top North Korean military officer had told him during his mission to North Korea, "We're not going to be another Yugoslavia."
Mr. Perry interpreted this to mean that the North would not allow itself to be bombed by the United States without an ability to strike back.
On Sunday President Clinton outlined the relaxations announced today to President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan. Both agreed to the plan, American officials said, though a top Japanese military official departed from the official line several days ago to say he doubted that the North Koreans had agreed to suspend their missile testing, even temporarily. His remarks were later disavowed by the Japanese Government.

SEARLE VENTURE IN MOSCOW

BYLINE: By Neela Banerjee 

 BODY:
A $30 million manufacturing center was opened by the Searle Pharmaceutical unit of Monsanto in suburban Moscow, part of a joint venture with Biopreparat, a Russian concern. The plant will initially make low-cost generic drugs rather than the more expensive brand-name medicines developed by Searle. Searle received a $6 million grant from the United States Agency for International Development to build the plant.

HEADLINE: Albany Tightens Standards For Teachers and Training

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
New York State set new higher standards for teachers yesterday that will for the first time require all teachers in middle schools and high schools to have completed college majors in the subjects they propose to teach.
The new rules, adopted by the Board of Regents yesterday, also set up procedures to penalize teaching schools where students routinely fail the state's licensing examination for teachers, which is itself being made more rigorous. 
 The new standards are among the toughest in the nation, state officials said, and are part of a national movement in education to improve schools by setting ever-higher standards. Already New York has introduced new reading and math tests in fourth and eighth grades and has set rules requiring high school students to pass Regents exams in five subject areas for graduation.
"This is a major piece in a structure to raise all children to high standards," Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner, said yesterday. "The heart of the matter is teaching."
Mr. Mills said the new standards were aimed at addressing the growing concern that many teachers are trained in educational methods but lack a strong grounding in the subject -- whether math or American history -- that they are supposed to teach in the classroom.
Studies show that large numbers of teachers across the country lack either college majors or minors in the subjects they teach, especially in science and math, and that the problem is most severe in inner-city schools serving poor black and Hispanic children.
Beginning in the current school year, at least 80 percent of the students who graduate from New York State teaching programs must pass the state licensing exam for teachers or that teaching school can be put on probation for three years and then shut down.
If the 80 percent rule were in effect today, state officials said, at least two dozen of New York's 113 teacher education programs could lose their accreditation, including several at the City University of New York. The teaching exams are also being stiffened so that teachers will have to answer about 20 percent more questions correctly, state officials said.
The standards will not be retroactively applied to the current teaching force. Most will affect prospective teachers entering college next fall. But state officials said standards would have a major impact in the years ahead as half of the state's teaching force becomes eligible for retirement within the next decade.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York City teachers' union, said she supported the requirements that teachers have stronger training in the subjects they teach.
But she said she feared that raising the standards would disproportionately affect black and Hispanic students enrolled in teaching programs that have historically not prepared their graduates to pass the state exams.
More and more states are tackling low achievement scores among students by focusing on the training of teachers. Texas has adopted a rule that 70 percent of a training program's graduating teachers must pass the state exam or the program can lose accreditation -- a somewhat lower standard than the one passed by New York State yesterday.
Educators said that studies have found that the scores of students on standardized tests improve in direct relation to the amount of training teachers have in the subjects they teach, especially math and science.
"This is a huge national issue because in state after state we're asking teachers to teach to higher standards, but in the core content areas they don't have the preparation to do that," said Stanley S. Litow, a vice president at the IBM Corporation in Armonk, N.Y., and a former deputy chancellor of New York City schools.
A study by the Education Trust Inc., an education research group based in Washington, found that large numbers of public school teachers across the country do not have undergraduate majors or minors in their fields, including 25 percent of English teachers, 17.4 percent of social studies teachers, 39.5 percent of science teachers and 34 percent of math teachers.
Lewis H. Spence, the New York City school system's Deputy Chancellor for Operations, said that while raising the bar is "terrific" in theory, the city is already having trouble recruiting enough qualified teachers and the new standards could make that even more difficult.
It is possible, he said, that college students who now choose education as a career will simply choose other fields, or will choose elementary teaching, where the standards are lower, instead of high school or middle school.
"The question is, will the pool of people respond or will it simply close out," Mr. Spence said. He urged the state to increase the amount of reciprocity between teaching licenses in New York and those in other states.
Under the new rule, high school and middle school teachers will have at least 36 credits -- the minimum required for a major -- in the subject they are teaching, state officials said. Under the current requirements, they only need a concentration in that subject, typically 24 credits, sometimes less, state officials said.
Elementary school teachers will now need to have 30 credits in the liberal arts, including some courses in a foreign language, math, science and history. Although they can still major in education, it is no longer enough. "It will no longer be acceptable to have a smattering of courses in a number of different fields," Mr. Mills said. "They will have to be deeply educated as well as broadly educated."
All teacher education programs will have to be accredited by a national accrediting body. Currently, only a handful -- state officials estimated four or five -- of those in New York State meet that credential.
As part of their training, teachers will be required to student-teach in urban, rural and suburban settings, to make sure that they understand the needs of students from various economic, racial and social backgrounds, Mr. Mills said.
"We want to make certain that we have a stream of teachers who are not only willing to teach in cities and rural communities but able to," he said.
All teachers will be required to have training in teaching children with disabilities, regardless of whether they have degrees in special education. And students who plan to teach special education will have to have an undergraduate major in the arts and sciences.
Teachers who earn a masters degree may still earn it in education; but if they do, they must take at least 12 additional credits in an academic subject area.
Mr. Mills said the plan to close down teaching programs that did not meet state standards was modeled on a similar program at the kindergarten-to-12th-grade-level, called Schools Under Registration Review, in which the state may close schools that fail to meet goals including standardized test scores.
In 1997-98, 6 out of the 10 teaching programs at the City University of New York failed to meet the 80 percent rule adopted by the Regents yesterday, according to state statistics.
The failure rate was highest in programs that serve large numbers of minority students. At Medgar Evers College, only 47 percent of the teacher candidates passed the liberal arts and sciences test, while 49 percent passed at City College and 58 percent at York College.

HEADLINE: An F-22's Worth of Education

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Jack Shanahan argues (Op-Ed, Sept. 17) that the money for the F-22 fighter would be better spent investing in the country's schools, thereby producing a stronger recruit pool. The logic is good, but the math is off. 
 Mr. Shanahan claims that canceling the F-22 and a new submarine and reducing the nuclear arsenal to 1,000 warheads would save $23 billion a year, but the savings would total less than $10 billion a year. Moreover, that would be needed to finance more mundane defense equipment, since today's military hardware is wearing out fast after a decade of low Pentagon procurement budgets. Today's defense budget need not go up -- and Mr. Shanahan is right to criticize Pentagon officials for weapons modernization plans that would require it to do so. But the budget is already $100 billion a year less in inflation-adjusted terms than in the 1980's and probably should not go down any more, either.
