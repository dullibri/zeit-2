HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORTS: MANHATTAN UP CLOSE -- RELATIONS;
Not for the Faint of Head

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
Forget the summer potboilers. This month Ruth Gitlin, Silda Wall Spitzer, Lilly Stern and the others in their circle will be reading Proust -- "Swann's Way," to be precise, an intimidating work where madeleines, the small, shell-shaped cakes, play a central role. The three are members of a book group founded more than a decade ago by a half-dozen professional women who wanted to "plug the holes" in their otherwise impressive educations, according to Ms. Spitzer, a lawyer.
And though this month's book is perhaps more, well, Proustian than typical August reading, it fits a group that has sampled authors as diverse and challenging as Camus, Mark Twain and Henry James. "We've read Nobel Prize winners and Booker Prize winners," said Ms. Stern, a lawyer. "And Russian, French and English authors," Ms. Spitzer added. Indeed, over the years they have read just about every kind of fiction. 
 "We were formal and rigid in the beginning," said Ms. Gitlin, a money manager. They borrowed a book list from an N.Y.U. graduate course and spent a year or so deconstructing modern prose fiction. "We'd set an agenda and follow it," she said.
But time and experience have brought change. Perhaps half the members have departed, replaced by others. Where once none were parents, they now count some 15 children among them. And lighter fiction is allowed occasionally, said Suzanne Telsey, another lawyer and a new member.
"We even read things things from the best seller list," said Heidi Spitzer, a self-described "lawyer and aspiring herbalist" and Silda Wall Spitzer's sister-in-law.
Their meetings now draw 7 to 10 and are every six to eight weeks, with the hostess choosing a book, preparing biographical notes and providing dinner. Sometimes the meal even has a theme, like the fried chicken and chablis provided by Kate Crowley, a lawyer, for the discussion of "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil." Every book is picked apart, as it were, sometimes with great vigor. "These are highly opinionated women," said Lisa Kaess, an economist. "I was scared the first time I came in."
Adds Silda Spitzer, describing the group's often heated discussions, "The more animosity, the better."
Ms. Crowley, who chose "Swann's Way," fears it will not win universal acclaim from members."It's like a sword of Damocles hanging over my head," she said. "But people never get personal, even if they disagree," said Ann Mackay-Smith, a writer.
"Well, not so far," Ms. Crowley replied. BERNARD STAMLER

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT: THE SUMMER SWOON -- THE STRATEGISTS;
3 Game Plans for an Altered Playing Field

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
IS this time different?
As stunning as this week's stock decline was, the answer to the question remains what it has always been: Nothing has changed -- unless, of course, it has. 
 Three strategists, interviewed after the Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 300 points on Tuesday, shared their views.
 
A Dearth of Good News
If the sky truly is falling, don't tell Robert Froehlich, 45, chief investment strategist for the mutual fund group of Scudder Kemper Investments, that he failed to give you the heads-up.
The tremor on Tuesday, he said, was more than just the ordinary dip-and-rebound script that has played out so routinely over the last several years. "I think there's a confluence of some pretty unique events causing this downdraft," he said.
First, Mr. Froehlich said, simultaneous crises of confidence threaten the governments of the world's two biggest economies -- the United States and Japan -- giving investors already skittish over earnings, for example, one more reason to rush the exits.
But don't downturns always lure bargain hunters? It may have seemed that way for the last 10 years, Mr. Froehlich said, but one ingredient is now missing. "The buying opportunity usually comes after you have an economic release the market can rally around," he said. "Now, there is no economic release to rally around."
The importance of having some good economic news to cling to, he continued, helps explain why European markets have outperformed lately (though they did tumble on Wednesday, in sympathy with the Dow's slide). "Europe is doing better than most because they have a great rallying point, the creation of a common currency," he said.
Mr. Froehlich advises a defensive posture but feels that consumer confidence should remain strong. He recommends the drug, food and homebuilding sectors, plus financial stocks that will benefit from low interest rates.
 
Interest Rates to the Rescue
Sam Stovall, 43, sector strategist at Standard & Poor's, thinks investors will look back on this period as the crisis that almost happened.
He acknowledges that the trouble spots are significant. If the Dow were just "bouncy," Mr. Stovall said, it would have turned north at 8,600, where it has rebounded in the past. Instead, it crashed right through that psychologically important level. Previous corrections of 5 to 10 percent since 1990 have involved mainly small- and mid-cap stocks, leaving blue chips aloft, Mr. Stovall said. Now, by contrast, "we are hearing companies that were Wall Street darlings caution analysts that forward earnings could be difficult."
In the past, he continued, it was just the fundamental analysts, those focusing on corporate financials, who were worried about excessive price-to-earnings ratios, low dividend yields and the like. Now, technical analysts are looking at ominous signals like the increasing number of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that are hitting new 52-week lows.
Despite that, Mr. Stovall said, the market has a guardian angel: low interest rates. "I think in order for this market to really tank," he said, "the Fed has to raise interest rates."
It won't raise them, he said, because the Asian crisis will hurt United States corporate profits enough to slow the economy.
With low rates providing a cushion for stocks, Mr. Stovall said, there is no reason to change his picks. "I still favor the consumer cyclicals, health care and selected technology issues," he said. "But if investors are nervous and want to look to those sectors that have held up best in market pullbacks, I would look to the consumer staples -- food, beverage, tobacco and household products -- as well as utilities."
 
Smoke, Mirrors and Indexes
To Chuck Clough, 56, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, the perception that we were in a bull market before last week's fall was illusory.
Though it may come as a surprise to people, a market selloff has been under way for months, Mr. Clough observed.
"The average stock has been declining for the better part of the year," he said. "The average stock on the American Exchange and the Nasdaq over-the-counter market has been declining for two years.
"The Dow Jones industrial average is only up about 4 percent from where it was last July," he said, adding that investors have been focusing for the last year on 15 to 20 stocks that have powered the S.& P. 500-stock index and created the perception that the market was stronger than it was.
The fall on Tuesday was merely "the culmination of something that's been going on for a long time," Mr. Clough said.
"I don't know how long you can run up 15 stocks and not the other 97 percent," he continued. "We might be in a position now where the market trades sideways, in a range, for a long time."
The problem, Mr. Clough said, is overinvestment -- the Asian crisis being only the most severe symptom.
Investment will slow as some of the easy capital sloshing around the world dries up, Mr. Clough predicted, but that is not as bad as it sounds. "The positive is, if that's true, inflation is going to be astoundingly low as we go into 1999," he said. "You could be looking at 4 percent bond yields over the next year or two, and that's good for financial stocks."
In addition to financial stocks, Mr. Clough would like to see his firm's clients holding a handful of very high-quality companies, because he thinks the rest of the market will tread water for the foreseeable future. And don't skimp on bonds, he said, because this is no time to be holding an unbalanced portfolio.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORTS: GREENPOINT;
Where Films Are Noir and Parking Is Dire

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
It's a director's dream, with decayed warehouses, rotting piers and a gritty, film-noir feel. But this is no back lot in Burbank. It's Greenpoint's waterfront, and it has become popular with production companies, upsetting some neighbors.
Last week, three productions were going on simultaneously along 12 blocks of West Street, a crumbling stretch of road near the East River, just across from the gleaming towers of midtown Manhattan. 
 At the southern end, LL Cool J and Keith Murray were shooting a music video in the abandoned Greenpoint Terminal. A block away, on the corner of Greenpoint Avenue, the independent film "Kill by Inches" has been shooting for two weeks, its lighting equipment scattered on the sidewalk. And on blocks just north of there, on Java and India Streets, a crew shooting a Miramax feature called "The Yards" took over a rooftoop and several street locations.
Paul Zawisha, an artist who has a studio on West Street, said the filming has created problems with parking. Last week, he said, "there was no parking on both sides for 12 blocks."
Walter Martin, another artist with a studio nearby, noted that filming of the Hollywood picture "Sleepers" two years ago was particularly disruptive. "Our beef is with the city," Mr. Martin said. "It gets a lot of revenue filming here, but the community, which is poor, gets nothing in return."
But a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, Julianne Cho, said the film industry is a vital player in New York's economy, conferring citywide benefits like $237 million in taxes last year and freelance work for 78,000 New Yorkers, "many of whom live in Greenpoint," she said.
Ms. Cho said her office had received "a few complaints" about "The Yards." Some were resolved, but some were "manufactured," she said, adding that the production company "provided window blacking to residents affected by lights."
Still, Greenpoint has become so desirable as a location for movie and video shoots that in January the neighborhood was placed on the city's so-called "hot spot" list of areas where filming is generally prohibited. But West Street has since been removed from the no-film zone because it is a largely industrial area, Ms. Cho said.
Lys Hopper, the production manager for "The Yards," said she was well aware of local sensitivity. "We put up signs telling people to call us about problems," she said. "And Miramax will donate money to help a local group buy a graffiti washer." She added, "I walk the fence between the company's needs and what's good for the neighborhood. That's my job."

Last week residents were angered by the filming of three productions on tour sites on or near West Street.
 
1. An independent film, "Kill by Inches," shot at 100 West Street.
2. Music video, "Keith Murray With LL Cool J," shot at Greenpoint Terminal by Wildlife Pictures.
3 and 4. Scenes from a Miramax movie, "The Yards," starring James Caan, Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn and Mark Waldman, shot at two locations.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
The Sky Is Becoming the Only Limit for Credit Card Users

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
CARL THOMSEN, a financial consultant in suburban Washington, actively uses two credit cards, sometimes piling substantial business expenses onto them. No matter how much he spends, though, his Visa and Mastercard issuers keep automatically raising his authorized credit limits, which now run well into five figures each.
The idea, of course, is to tempt people like Mr. Thomsen -- a customer with a good payment record -- to borrow ever-higher amounts at interest rates that often approach 20 percent. But for some consumers, it also means a chance to get into ever-bigger financial trouble. 
 Do not count Mr. Thomsen, 55, among the less-disciplined consumers; he usually pays off his card balances in full at the end of each month and has never asked for more borrowing power. Indeed, he said, "I've never bumped up against a credit limit."
In watching those limits grow, however, Mr. Thomsen has plenty of company these days. Banks and other credit-card issuers are raising their limits far faster than consumers are borrowing -- even as lenders report record proportions of delinquencies and charge-offs.
"Despite protestations that they're trying to get rid of the worst excesses, the marketing of card credit is continuing largely as usual, with little letup," said Warren Heller, research director for Veribanc Inc., a company in Wakefield, Mass., which rates banks and savings institutions. "One of the time-tested rules of business is that your existing customers are your best prospects."
In the two years ended in March, unused credit limits for all bank-issued cards in the United States soared 50.3 percent, to $1.78 trillion, according to Veribanc -- more than twice the growth in card charges.
This pushed consumers' potential spending power to a record 4.2 times their current indebtedness, up from 3.4 just two years ago. When the data were first collected in 1990, the multiple was a little more than 2.
Other figures, compiled by the American Bankers Association, also point to fast-expanding credit. The most common credit limit for a standard card sponsored by a large bank, the association said, climbed for the second consecutive year in 1997, to $3,500. That is 40 percent higher than the typical limit of $2,500 in 1993. And some "premium" cards -- which are not all that difficult to get -- are being advertised with limits of $50,000 and even $100,000.
The average account balance on standard credit cards issued by large banks is $1,987, the association found, up from $1,479 in 1993. For gold cards, it is $2,497, up from $2,334.
The Consumer Federation of America sponsored a report on the subject last month to bolster its opposition to a bill making it harder for people to declare bankruptcy -- a bill that lenders are pushing for Congress to pass. The organization attributes soaring bankruptcies largely to "irresponsible" promotion of credit cards and considers the banking industry hypocritical in seeking legislation that they say would make it easier to collect debts from consumers whom bankers themselves had lured over the financial brink.
The industry, increasingly dominated by a shrinking number of major banks, often responds to such accusations by saying that soaring credit lines are a statistical illusion or a reflection of banks' improving ability to differentiate between the most lucrative customers and potential deadbeats.
Lawrence Chimerine, consulting economist for Mastercard International, estimated that 75 percent to 80 percent of the increase in total credit lines reflected the issuance of new cards -- for which no reliable count exists -- rather than expanded capacity for existing card holders.
By itself, MBNA, the second-biggest card issuer after Citibank, added 11.4 million customers last year on top of a 9.3 million gain in 1996. But some in the industry say that to hasten that growth, MBNA engages in mass expansion of credit lines.
Peter Frank, a spokesman for MBNA, disputed this, saying that the company's lines have grown an average of just 8 percent in the last two years.
At First Chicago NBD, which issues the First Card, potential new card holders are offered lower lines of credit than they were two years ago, said Ralph R. Mueller, senior credit officer for First Card.
First Chicago attributes the growth of credit limits to the issuance of more gold and platinum cards, which have higher limits. It also notes that many card holders now have more cards to use; according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the credit card industry, the average is now slightly more than four cards per card holder, compared with slightly more than three in 1993.
Mainly, though, the industry attributes the expansion of credit limits to refined methods of judging their new customers' ability to pay. Banks have become "much more adept in distinguishing the most profitable customers, those most likely to use their cards and repay their balances," said Robert Stock, senior vice president for credit products at Visa USA.
 ASSUMING that issuers have reduced their exposure to new credit-card charge-offs, what risks can expanded credit limits pose for consumers? An obvious one is that a generally responsible borrower could leap into expensive debt because of an emergency -- a serious health problem, for example, or the loss of a job.
But specialists say high credit lines pose some risks even if they are not used. Access to other credit, like a mortgage, can be impaired if an applicant has too many cards with too much borrowing potential. Lenders are wary that a consumer or spouse could suddenly tap several credit sources so heavily that not all could be repaid.
"This is taken into consideration," said Charlotte Newton, vice president for consumer affairs at Mastercard. "Whether or not you use it, it's still there."

Consumers have more than doubled the amount of debt they carry on their bank-issued credit cards since 1992. But the amount of credit that banks have extended has more than tripled. (Source: Veribanc Inc.)

HEADLINE: The World: Fidel Without Fear;
An Old Star Loses His Punch Lines

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada

 BODY:
THE high point of Fidel Castro's state visit to this 133-square-mile "Spice Isle" last week was the speech he delivered at Tanteen, a cricket field flanked by a simple grandstand and a stack of cargo containers. As a couple of thousand people listened patiently and the occasional dog ambled across the grounds, the Cuban leader lectured Grenadians for an hour and a half on the history of slavery in the West Indies and assorted other topics. 
 Since coming to power nearly 40 years ago, Mr. Castro has used all the world as his stage, but he seems to be playing smaller houses these days. Leslie Pierre, editor of the leading newspaper in this country of 100,000 people, the weekly Grenadian Voice, intended it as a compliment when he called the Cuban president "a Caribbean man." Yet that designation also implies that Mr. Castro and his message matter little these days outside a region that itself seems increasingly on the fringe of world events.
 
The Melody Lingers
Treated in recent years as a dotty old uncle in most capitals, even those of Latin America where his calls for revolution once resonated, Mr. Castro found himself saluted here by Prime Minister Keith Mitchell as an historical figure "who can only be compared in the 20th Century to Nelson Mandela." He was also serenaded with a rousing version of the "Internationale."
But the atmosphere was festive rather than threatening. Without the Soviet Union to back it up, the Communist anthem has lost its ability to frighten the capitalist world. So, too, Mr. Castro.
A decade and a half ago, the Reagan Administration's fear of Mr. Castro and his seemingly unlimited ability to make mischief generated a bonanza of aid and attention for the newly independent English-speaking states in the Caribbean. Even as the other islands were being promised preferential trade benefits as part of a regional Caribbean Basin Initiative, some 6,000 American troops invaded Grenada in October 1983 to expel Cuban forces, and Washington followed that up with a promise to bring Grenada into the circle of preferred treatment.
The 1990's, in contrast, have seen the Clinton Administration close down its regional aid office, downgrade the embassy here to a mission and slash aid, grants and scholarships. While Cuba, itself economically prostrate, cannot make up for that gap, Mr. Mitchell and his regional colleagues have seized on Cuba's own need for friends in hopes of creating a countervailing weight to Washington's indifference.
Whether such a strategy will work is another matter. "In a post-cold war world, this region unfortunately is no longer relevant" to the great powers, one diplomat in the region said. Caribbean leaders may see Mr. Castro as a useful card to play to get Washington's attention, "but I'm not sure even that is true," the diplomat added. "Cuba wants to be headmaster of the Caribbean family, but since it is a Soviet proxy no longer, the United States really doesn't worry about it."
During the heyday of Cuba's alliance with Grenada, Mr. Castro aimed high, agreeing to build an airport that could be used to bring in tourists -- and to refuel Cuban planes ferrying troops to and from Africa. This time around, what he was offering seemed modest, even innocuous, reflecting straitened circumstances in both countries: a new wing on a hospital here and 22 additional scholarships for Grenadians to study at Cuban universities.
For Cuba, the principal benefit of such aid efforts today is not that they advance a geopolitical strategy. Rather, it is that they provide employment for Cuban doctors, engineers and teachers who would otherwise be idle at home or seeking jobs as hotel doormen or taxi drivers.
Perhaps the most telling moment of Mr. Castro's visit, however, came when Grenada's Education Minister, Lawrence Joseph, acknowledged during a meeting that one thing is always certain when local students get scholarships to Cuba. Unlike those who enroll in Britain, Canada or the United States, they always return home just as soon as their studies are done.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
A Model Career Path For a Self-Starter

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN 

 BODY:
CESAR PACHECO 3D of the South Bronx recalls vividly the day that Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered -- June 12, 1994. He nearly lost his life the same evening, after being shot point-blank in the chest during a botched robbery outside his apartment in the Castle Hill section.
Instead of watching the New York Knicks in a playoff game that night, as he had planned, Mr. Pacheco spent nearly nine hours on the operating table at Jacobi Hospital, while his fiancee waited anxiously. 
 For a time it was touch-and-go, as the Jacobi surgical team repaired his perforated lung, diaphragm and liver. "You owe us one," a surgeon later told Mr. Pacheco, then 23.
A near-death experience, Mr. Pacheco says, focuses the mind wonderfully. During his slow recovery, while contemplating the hundred or so stitches that held together the tapestry of his body, he decided that it was time to get his act together, too.
He had graduated from an alternative high school in the South Bronx and held a string of low-paying odd jobs. That wouldn't do, not with a family to support. Mr. Pacheco wanted a career. But in what?
"Trucking was the obvious choice," he now says, though when he decided to become an operator of 18-wheelers, he didn't own a car, much less know how to drive a truck. Still, having been raised near the Hunt's Point Market in the Bronx, Mr. Pacheco grew up watching the big rigs maneuver in and out of the industrial neighborhood.
Once back on his feet, he applied for a learner's permit and persuaded a friend to provide some informal lessons in driving a truck.
The next stop was Model Training Center on 14th Street in Manhattan. No fly-by-night diploma mill, the vocational school has been in business for 50 years. After six weeks of instruction, Mr. Pacheco had a commercial driver's license; now, he was certified to drive everything from ambulettes, city buses and garbage trucks to flatbeds and triple tractor-trailers.
Just three weeks later, he was hired by MS Carriers of Memphis, at $1,000 a week plus overtime, benefits and bonuses. In other words, good money, particularly for someone who until then had never earned more than $350 a week.
As a career self-starter, Mr. Pacheco is in many ways representative of a new mode of working in America. Employees and entrepreneurs find happy niches for themselves by following their instincts -- and expect to reinvent themselves several more times before retirement.
Even today's college graduates often tumble into careers very different from the ones they have just finished training for. And many workers are eagerly jumping into jobs that did not exist even a year or two ago -- corporate Web site managers, for example.
Mr. Pacheco drove tractor-trailers professionally for just two years before he had his second epiphany. It was at the funeral of a 36-year-old friend who had a heart attack during a basketball game. The friend had two young children, and his death made Mr. Pacheco realize that he wanted to spend more time with his family -- he had two children, too.
"I loved driving across the country, because it allowed me to see that there was more out there than what was in front of me in the South Bronx," Mr. Pacheco said. "But I think it's more important for kids in a ghetto atmosphere to have a full-time father around."
The week after his friend's funeral, Mr. Pacheco, then 26, was back at the Model Training School, this time offering his services as a driving instructor.
 IT has turned out to be a satisfying career switch. Part of the payoff, he said, comes from helping others gain access to a better standard of living. Salaries for truck drivers range from $35,000 to $100,000 and they can come with good benefits -- especially jobs covered by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Neither a high school diploma nor proficient English is required.
"I teach immigrants who were making $5 an hour as dishwashers and even a lot of college graduates who are sick of making eight bucks an hour in an office," he said.
Last weekend found Mr. Pacheco busy training a 47-year-old man, a meat packer who has been with the Pathmark grocery chain for two decades, to drive a rig.
"Some people have trouble understanding that just because a guy didn't go to Harvard Business School doesn't mean that he doesn't have dreams," he said, identifying strongly with his student.
Nor do you need an M.B.A. to see how things fit together in the economy. From the cab of his big rig, Mr. Pacheco became his own securities analyst. While he had never heard of Peter Lynch, the legendary portfolio manager for Fidelity Investments, he approached the market as if he had memorized a page out of Mr. Lynch's playbook: Invest in what you know.
"Trucking gives you an excellent idea of what's happening in different businesses through watching the flow of traffic," he explained. In July 1995, for example, he noticed that an extraordinary amount of goods was being delivered to the loading docks of Sears, Roebuck stores across the country, and he figured that meant an extraordinary amount of merchandise was being carried out the front door by customers, as well. His observation was keen: Sears stock, which had been languishing in the low $30's, started to move; by the next March it had climbed more than 20 points.
Still, when Mr. Pacheco was ready to invest for the long term, he selected MCI Communications and Sun Microsystems -- stocks that he hopes will help pay for the education of his two boys, now 10 and 3. His plan, for now at least, is to set himself up in the trucking business when his boys are a little older. For about $25,000 you can buy a secondhand rig and go into business for yourself, Mr. Pacheco explained. He would also like to buy a home in Westchester County.
It might not be the first thing to come to mind, but there are a lot of dreams to be realized by driving trucks. Currently, there are about 80,000 unfilled driving jobs in the industry, Traffic World magazine has reported. And given the surge in ordering goods by catalogue and from the Internet, it is no surprise that the Government says trucking is the nation's eighth-fastest-growing occupation.
"You can walk out this door after a $365, 10-day course, and another $175 for the road test, and get a job tomorrow," said Bob Kousoulos, a longtime instructor at Model Training Center. "You'll make back the cost of the class in a week."
Nowadays, after a year and a half on the job, Mr. Pacheco is regarded by the school's owners as one of their top instructors. He makes about $42,000 a year teaching others how to handle big rigs.
And what about the bonus he used to collect as a driver? "Seeing my family every day is my big bonus," he said.

In Florida's Fires, A Test for a New Insurance Policy

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

DATELINE: PALM COAST, Fla.

 BODY:
THE wildfires that swept through the piney woods here this summer provided a test, of sorts, of a new kind of home insurance that is being introduced gradually across the country.
Instead of paying whatever it takes to replace a destroyed home, as had been the case for years, the leading insurers are now selling policies that limit most payments to 120 percent of the insured amount. 
 And that has posed a powerful question: Would the scaled-back coverage be enough for people to start over? Would there be huge gaps between the cost of a new house and the insurance payment?
The answer, based on evidence accumulating here, is that the lesser coverage seems to suffice. Both the insurers and Florida regulators say there have been no complaints and, in nearly a dozen interviews, people who lost their homes had nothing but praise for their companies.
"We couldn't ask for better treatment," said Aida Meltzer, an Allstate customer who lost her three-bedroom home here in central Florida, near the Atlantic coast.
Many fire victims have collected more than they expected, and those who have come up short say they have only themselves to blame because they consciously underinsured their homes, taking what they thought was a reasonable gamble that disaster was unlikely.
The key to making the restricted policies work, consumer advocates and insurers say, is in accurately calculating the cost of rebuilding a home and then adjusting each year for inflation and improvements.
"This approach requires much more vigilance," said J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. But handled correctly, he said, it seems fair to both customers and insurers.
While State Farm and Allstate, the two biggest home insurers, limit their payments to 120 percent in most states, Allstate has a ceiling of 150 percent in California and 125 percent in New York, Arkansas and North Carolina. Industry experts say the higher limits may attract more customers, but that with careful evaluations, the 120 percent margin should work anywhere.
The industry's new approach, which requires regulatory approval state by state, has yet to be tested in the aftermath of a big hurricane or earthquake, when laws of supply and demand -- as well as profiteering -- can push rebuilding costs off the charts. In the Florida fires, the number of homes lost was not enormous, and prices for building materials seem to have changed little.
Insurers also say they do not foresee problems in areas where real estate values are skyrocketing, because coverage is based on the cost of rebuilding rather than on a house's market value. A big part of a house's sale price often reflects the value of the land on which it was built. But homeowner's insurance covers the house, not the site.
Insurance companies introduced unlimited policies in the early 1980's as a way to increase sales. They soon became the industry standard, so no insurer had an edge -- just a lot more liability.
Hurricane Andrew cost the industry $16 billion in 1992, and State Farm took the first step toward retrenchment the next spring, refusing to sell unlimited policies in Florida.
Instead, it instituted the 120 percent provision. Judith K. Mintel, a lawyer for State Farm, says the intent is to insure accurately the cost of replacing a house. State Farm allows for a 10 percent margin of error in its estimate system, she said, and throws in another 10 percent for good measure.
 SATISFIED that the concept was workable, the company began putting it into effect nationally in 1996, as state regulators approved it. And the competition has followed. The policies, which cost about the same as their predecessors, are now being sold in more than 30 states. Allstate is selling them in New York and New Jersey, but State Farm is still awaiting regulatory approval in those states; both companies await approval in Connecticut.
The companies say that they sent notices to customers about the changes and that they instructed agents to spread the word, but details of the coverage apparently were lost on many people. Fire victims here said they did not realize -- until claims adjusters told them -- that they could get up to 20 percent more than what their policies specified. For that matter, they also couldn't recall a time when they had unlimited coverage; they believed that if they were insured for $100,000, they could expect $100,000 -- no more, no less.
They were also happy to learn that they would receive several thousand dollars, in most cases, to remove the remains of their homes and for new landscaping.
By spreading money around immediately, the insurers won many friends in Palm Coast, which has a population of about 30,000, scattered over hundreds of acres of thick woods a few miles from the beach. Within hours of the fires in July, the insurers were handing out thousands of dollars for living expenses; within a few days, many people had received checks for the face value of their policies.
When Rhon Dixon, the owner of a window-blind and kitchen-cabinet company, drove up to the knee-high mound of ash that had been his two-story, three-bedroom frame house, he found a State Farm claims adjuster sitting in his driveway.
"He said, 'Do you need some living expenses?' " Mr. Dixon recalled. "I said, 'Probably.' And he said, 'What do you need, $5,000, $10,000?' I said $10,000 would be fine. Then, about three minutes later, he said: 'You're going to need a deposit for where you're living. Why don't I just give you $15,000?' And I said, 'That's even better.' "
Mr. Dixon, 42, said he had never expected to use his insurance, had guessed at what might be enough coverage and didn't aim high. He never read his policy and doesn't recall hearing about the 20 percent cushion or other beneficial provisions.
"You think your property is worth a lot, but when you talk with the tax people and the insurance company, you try to claim it's not worth anything," he said. "Until something like this happens, it just seems like you just keep paying, and never get anything back."
 NOW Mr. Dixon has been talking with contractors about rebuilding. Their calculations show his coverage was low. His policy was for $108,900; rebuilding will cost about $150,000. "It's my fault," he said. "I didn't have it insured for enough."
The gap, though, is not going to be as wide as he first thought. State Farm has already given him $21,700 more -- the 20 percent -- plus $1,300 for things like replacing his driveway, sidewalk and a patio. And he expects State Farm to supply an additional $5,000 to bulldoze and cart away his ruins and about $5,400 more for new landscaping. Changes in building codes have increased some building costs, and State Farm routinely pays a percentage of those expenses.
A more litigious person might argue that Mr. Dixon's State Farm agent should have made an effort to see that the insured value of the house was closer to the mark. Executives at State Farm headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., said that their policy is for agents, armed with the latest costs of building materials and a computer, to estimate as precisely as possible how much it will take to replace each house they insure. Mr. Dixon said the only estimate he knew of came out of his head.
James I. Jones, 62, who got out of his house just as his trees were catching fire, was also underinsured. He thought his agent's estimate of $100,000 of coverage was low, but didn't argue: he did not want to pay higher premiums. Now that concrete block walls are all that remain of his three-bedroom home, he also blames himself, not State Farm. Mr. Jones says two contractors have estimated the cost of replacing his home at $135,000.
Many of the Florida fire victims said their biggest insurance mistake was underestimating the value of their furniture, clothes and the other contents of their homes. An Allstate homeowner's policy automatically provides the equivalent of half the face value for the home's contents; on a $100,000 policy, the contents are covered for an additional $50,000. State Farm's automatic allocation is 75 percent.
Aida and David Meltzer, retirees from Baltimore, were among those whose insurance coverage worked out just right. They did not cut corners and fastidiously updated their coverage. When they added a room to their beige-and-brown ranch house in mid-May, Mrs. Meltzer increased their Allstate coverage by $10,000, to about $80,000.
After the fire, the Meltzers found it would cost about $85,000 to rebuild, well within the 20 percent margin. And they have decided to add a few frills out of their own pockets. "I'm very well satisfied with the insurance company and all the people we've had to deal with," Mr. Meltzer said.

How to Bypass Sanctions and Do Business

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONCE again, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is thumbing his nose at the world community. Last week, he said he is through cooperating with international weapons inspectors and wants the crippling economic sanctions on his country lifted.
The Security Council berated Iraq for its intransigence, and demanded that Baghdad change its decision. The Clinton Administration has vowed to block any easing of the sanctions the United Nations imposed in 1991 after the Persian Gulf war until Baghdad accounts for all of its nuclear, chemical, biological and missile programs. 
 But these days sanctions aren't very popular in Washington.
 
An Ineffective Tool
 Largely in response to complaints from farm groups and business organizations, Congress and the White House have concluded that most sanctions, especially unilateral ones, are an ineffective tool in foreign policy. And in the highly competitive global market, Washington's sanctions in particular actually hurt American companies.
"No one wants to support the Hitlers of the world, but if you're the only country imposing sanctions, they have no effect," said Tom Mick, chief executive of the Washington Wheat Commission, a trade group in Spokane that has urged the Administration to end sanctions against Iran, a former top customer of Pacific Northwest wheat.
But critics of sanctions are less likely to acknowledge that most existing penalties are riddled with exemptions, waivers and legal loopholes. Exemptions are designed to permit humanitarian aid and give Presidents some diplomatic wiggle room. Farmers have been adept at using them to keep a commercial toehold, and sometimes much more, in even the most reviled rogue nations.
Congress often puts profits ahead of principle when the business interests are big enough. Just a few weeks after it angrily condemned India and Pakistan for conducting nuclear tests in May, Congress enacted sanctions but exempted food exports, removing the biggest sting the penalties could inflict. Why? Wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest howled because Pakistan was their biggest customer, and the sanctions would have barred them from bidding on a $37 million wheat order from that country.
The same legislation that waived food exports also included a little-noticed provision that exempted fertilizer from the sanctions. That's because India is the second-largest importer of American phosphate fertilizer, mostly from Florida, which exports $1.7 billion in fertilizer.
"Fertilizer is just as important as food and medicine," said Kathleen Mathers of The Fertilizer Institute, a trade group.
Iran may still be virtually closed to American companies, but Midwestern wheat farmers from Kansas to Texas are benefiting from a year-old United Nations' program that allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to buy food and medicine for humanitarian purposes. In the program's first year, Iraq bought 817,000 metric tons -- about $114 million worth -- of hard red winter wheat, which placed that country eighth among foreign buyers of American wheat. At a time when wheat prices are at 10-year low, and orders from Asia have plummeted because of the economic crisis there, the new business from Baghdad is welcome news in Topeka and Austin.
Of course, American businesses prefer to avoid sanctions altogether. Last year, as the Administration was weighing whether to impose a ban on new American investment in Myanmar because of its human rights abuses, the Unocal Corporation signed a deal with that Government to expand a $1.2 billion joint venture with the French oil company, Total, to develop gas fields off the coast.
Unocal denied that there was any rush to sign the deal ahead of impending sanctions. "It was coincidental," said Barry Lane, a company spokesman.
In other pariah states like Cuba and North Korea, American farmers and businesses are donating food or agricultural products outright with the Administration's blessing, hoping to position themselves to compete with international rivals when embargoes are finally lifted.
The U.S. Grains Council, the export development arm of the American corn, barley and sorghum industries, donated 4,000 pounds of mixed feed grain last spring to a Cuban aid organization.
Kansas wheat farmers and the wheat industry's export development arm donated 22,000 pounds of flour to Cuba in February with an eye on the day a new regime rules in Havana. "Cuba could be a pretty significant market," said Lisa Jager, a spokesman for U.S. Wheat Associates, the export arm.
 
Opening Doors
 In May 1997, Washington State and Mercy Corps International, a relief organization in Portland, Ore., donated 500 apple trees to North Korea. "We've been trying to figure out ways to open the door there," said Ralph Munro, Washington's secretary of state, who helped organize the donation.
But commercial dealings with cash-poor rogue nations are still risky. Last year, North Korea abruptly abandoned a plan to barter zinc for 20,000 tons of American wheat.
North Korea's snub came as the ship-bound wheat was only days from delivery, and left the American company, Cargill, Inc., a Minneapolis-based commodities dealer, in the lurch. "We sold the grain on the market at a significant loss," said Bonnie Raquet, a Cargill spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Goodbye, Mr. Price. Hello, Higher Fees.

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IT was, to say the least, a case of odd timing: Last Monday, after Franklin Resources announced that Michael F. Price was surrendering his chief executive title and stock-picking duties at its Mutual Series fund unit, the company increased the front-end loads for small investors in the six Mutual Series funds.
The load, or initial sales charge, was raised from 4.5 percent to 5.75 percent for those with less than $50,000 invested. So not only are investors left without the skills of Mr. Price, the vaunted value investor, but many will have to pay more for the privilege of buying shares. 
 Moreover, the higher charges go against an industry trend. Front-end loads have dropped over the last 10 years, according to Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm in Boston. While 8.5 percent loads were once common, a 4 to 5 percent sales load is more the norm today.
A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., described Franklin's move as unusual. Franklin, he said, may be hoping that the increased sales load will "get more brokers who are looking for a higher-loaded fund to sell." Sales charges are used to compensate brokers and other fund sellers; raising them can serve as a powerful sales incentive.
Mr. Lipper said the increased loads could be an effort to lift Franklin's own stock price, but a spokeswoman for Franklin, Holly Gibson, said the increased sales load had been in the works for several months.
There is little doubt, however, that the mutual fund giant's stock could use some extra juice right now.
Shares of Franklin Resources have fallen 27.6 percent, from a high of $57.3125 on April 13 to $41.50 on Friday. That compares with a falloff of 7.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's Financials Index over the same period. But why the weakness in Franklin stock to begin with? One reason may be that the company missed its second-quarter earnings estimate of 54 cents a share by 2 cents on June 23.
But a more serious influence is likely to be the Asian economic crisis. Some investors may be looking at Franklin's international and emerging-markets exposure through its Templeton funds group, which is focused on foreign stocks. Templeton funds account for 46 percent of Franklin's assets.
"Long term, having Templeton is a great asset," said Henry H. McVey, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "But short term, it won't bring in as much cash as a complex which is domestically focused."
Richard K. Strauss, a brokerage and asset management analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said the market had overreacted to Franklin's exposure to Asia -- less than 5 percent of the company's total assets. "I think it will rebound when the market recognizes how limited Franklin's exposure is to Asia and as overall market conditions begin to pick up."
A host of smaller issues may also be contributing to the stock's weakness, according to Mr. McVey. He said Franklin's decision to consolidate transfer agencies had contributed to higher costs, as had rapid account growth and year-2000 compliance issues. Another factor, he said, was the introduction of the European Monetary Union, which requires a major revamping of Franklin's computers.
Greg Johnson, president of Franklin-Templeton Distributors, a subsidiary of Franklin Resources, said the loads were raised to consolidate pricing policies after the company's acquisitions of the Templeton and Mutual Series funds. Templeton already charges a 5.75 percent load; Franklin's other funds, which had charged 4.5 percent, increased their loads along with those of the Mutual Series.
So why didn't Franklin lower the loads on the Templeton funds instead?
"The representatives who sell our funds seem to favor the schedule used by Templeton, not the schedule used by the Franklin funds," Mr. Johnson said.
The higher charges apply only to people with less than $50,000 invested at the funds. Investors with $50,000 to $99,999 will keep paying 4.5 percent and those with $100,000 to $249,999 will pay 3.5 percent, down from 3.75 percent. The charges decline to zero for those with $1 million or more.
The new sales charges apply only to the company's class I shares.

HEADLINE: A New Spell for Alphabet City;
Gentrification Led to the Unrest at Tompkins Square 10 Years Ago. Did the Protesters Win That Battle but Lose the War?

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
WHICH riot?"
At first glance, Freddie Weber looks like the kind of young man who might know a thing or two about the bloody clash between the police and protesters that wracked Tompkins Square Park a decade ago last week. Hair meticulously unkempt, a nail piercing his nose, Mr. Weber, 19, a self-described radical, punk-music aficionado and sophomore at the University of Connecticut, held a can of Colt 45 as he leaned against a building on Avenue A near St. Marks Place last Saturday morning. 
 "You mean the one against the Vietnam War?"
Well, not exactly.
For those old enough to remember, the uprising -- which left some 40 civilians and 13 officers injured, led to 121 official complaints of police brutality and consumed much of the East Village -- was provoked by a different kind of conflict, one that continues today, though with far less fury. Opposition to a 1 A.M. curfew in Tompkins Square Park was the spark that ignited the disturbance. But the tinder had been laid by long-simmering frustration over gentrification: the process of neighborhood change and escalating rents since glamorized by the Broadway musical "Rent."
What began as a demonstration against the curfew turned into a night of bloodshed after bottles were tossed at riot police, who responded with "appalling behavior," according to a Police Department report that attributed the misconduct to inexperienced officers and poor supervision. The six hours of violence on the night of Aug. 6-7, much of it recorded by amateur video makers and repeatedly broadcast on television, showed the officers, some of whom had removed their badges, beating and kicking demonstrators and bystanders.
In the end, a handful of high-ranking commanders on duty that night were reprimanded, transferred or forced into early retirement, but not one of the 14 officers tried on brutality charges was convicted. Though the Police Department has never called the disturbance a riot, it is rarely called anything else by many East Villagers, who see it as a definining moment in contemporary local history.
If the squatters, skinheads and anarchists who helped encourage the 1988 uprising and other episodes of unrest had hoped to halt gentrification, they have, by most accounts, been sorely disappointed. The disturbances seemed to cool development in the neighborhood for a time, but the stock market crash and recession in the late 1980's and early 90's probably had more to do with it.
These days, however, gentrification is alive and well in the East Village, thanks to plummeting crime, the waning crack epidemic and the city's robust economy. Avenue B, once a no-man's-land of drug dealers and shuttered storefronts, is lined with a smattering of new restaurants, bars and boutiques. Luxury rentals are moving briskly on Avenue B and Second Street, and even once-anarchic and drug-addled Avenue C feels tame.
A renovated Tompkins Square Park, which used to teem with encampments of homeless people, is now closed -- and calm -- after midnight, and Alphabet City squatters say they feel increasingly threatened by City Hall. "Gentrification has definitely returned to the East Village," said Edward I. Koch, who was Mayor at the time of the disturbance. "And like Martha Stewart says, 'It's a good thing.' "
But if gentrification is back, the street activism it inspired seems to have dissipated. Veterans of the "Battle of Tompkins Square," as locals call it, say they no longer know how to stop the changes, and some acknowledge that their movement has simply run out of steam. "In many ways, it feels like we've lost the war," said Jerry Wade, 49, a squatter and housing advocate known as Jerry the Peddler, who organizes a commemorative concert in the park each August. "Sometimes people just get tired of fighting."
 
'The Most Creative Years Are Behind Us'
The neighborhood's feisty spirit, which was established by 19th-century female suffragists and 20th-century socialists, isn't the only thing that has faded over the last decade. Local activists, artists and even business owners agree that the East Village's essence as a bastion of American counterculture and an incubator of unconventional politics has been inexorably chipped away.
"It might sound funny coming from someone like me, but the East Village has been cleaned up to the point that it's losing its rough and colorful edge," said Bob Perl, a real estate broker whose 10th Street offices face Tompkins Square Park. "The most creative years are behind us, and that's a real pity."
Ever since the 1850's, when German and Irish immigrants fleeing upheaval arrived, the sprawl of tenements east of Third Avenue has housed successive waves of immigrants. Jews escaping anti-Semitism, Ukrainians fleeing Communism and Puerto Ricans seeking economic opportunity replaced the Germans and the Irish. In the 1950's and 60's, it was beatniks and hippies who came in search of cheap housing and free love. In the 70's, many children of the immigrants left for the suburbs and arson claimed buildings that were abandoned by their landlords. Into the breach came the real estate investors, attracted in the early 80's by the area's deflated prices, who began renovating dilapidated buildings.
Since then, escalating rents have gradually forced the next generation of struggling poets, artists and assorted malcontents to settle elsewhere. The result, many say, is that the neighborhood's unique vitality and its tradition of artistic iconoclasm is steadily being sapped.
For Mark Russell, executive director of Performance Space 122, that means many performers no longer live within walking distance of the red-brick schoolhouse that was converted in the late 70's and is now one of the neighborhood's better-known cultural institutions. "People used to roll out of bed to come to rehearsals," he said. "Now we can't do as many late shows because folks have to get back to Brooklyn."
For Chris Flash, the editor of The Shadow, an anarchist newspaper, it means a shrinking pool of neighborhood bile and thinner crowds at rallies protesting things like the eviction of squatters and the destruction of community gardens. "The East Village has always been a school for activists," he said. "But gentrification is scattering people all over the city, keeping them from coalescing spontaneously."
 
Harsh View of Newcomers: Party Animals With Money
Longtime residents complain that more often than not, the newcomers who can afford $1,000-a-month studios are young, work-obsessed and uninterested in civic affairs or political activism. Even those who championed more development in the neighborhood have been disappointed at the results. "We didn't expect to get so many transients and so few families," said Krystyna Piorkowska, 48, a member of Community Board 3 and one of the first who called for a curfew in Tompkins Square Park. "The problem is that these people move here because they see the neighborhood as a place to party, and when they grow up, they'll move elsewhere."
But in the meantime they have also contributed to a dramatic change in the neighborhood's retail landscape. At least half of all businesses in the East Village have opened since Tompkins Square Park erupted, according to local brokers, and commercial rents on streets like St. Marks Place and Avenue A, once the most combustible parts of the neighborhood, are getting closer to those in nearby Greenwich Village, although there is still a disparity. Mr. Perl, the head of Tower Brokerage, said that average rents on Avenue A range from $35 to $60 a square foot, compared with $50 to $100 a square foot on Seventh Avenue South.
The East Village vacancy rate is a tight 3 percent, down from 20 percent a decade ago, said Christine Dyke, project director of Businesses in the East Village Association, a merchants group.
"For many years we just couldn't get anyone to open shop down here," she said. "Now our biggest problem is the high rate of turnover. Some spaces have had four businesses in two years, and that's not a good thing." She and other business owners attribute the problem to steep rents, small storefronts and the fact that the area is still not a destination spot for many shoppers.
The most frequent complaint heard from merchants and residents is that a disproportionate number of new businesses are bars and restaurants aimed at outsiders. Of the 45 establishments that serve alcohol along Avenue A, which runs from 14th Street to Houston Street, 37 have opened in the last few years, Ms. Piorkowska said. On weekend nights, the avenue is mobbed with carousing bar hoppers from uptown Manhattan and the other boroughs.
"Unfortunately we've become an alcoholic Disneyland, a sort of East Village theme park," said Ms. Piorkowska, whose organization, Save Avenue A Society, has been trying to stem the proliferation of bars.
If half the area's merchants are recent arrivals, Linda Heidinger qualifies as an old-timer. In 1981 her restaurant, Pharmacy, became one of the first new businesses to open across from the park. Four years later she opened a boutique, Alphabets, a few storefronts away. "Back then, people were afraid of the East Village and you couldn't even get a cab on Avenue A," Ms. Heidinger, 50, said. An atmosphere of chaos pervaded the neighborhood, heightened, she said, by the haze of smoke that drifted over Avenue A from cooking fires in the park. "I can't tell you how many times I had to yank junkies out of my store or throw out people who were shooting up in my bathroom," she said.
Things got worse in the mid-1980's, she said, as skirmishes over gentrification intensified and the park grew dense with cardboard shanties and plastic tents. One day, a group of youths smashed the window at Alphabets and ran off with a pile of T-shirts. "I knew who did it," Ms. Heidinger said, "because I saw a bunch of skinheads wearing my shirts in the park. They had only stolen one kind of shirt -- the ones with 666 printed on them."
 
'Still Young and Creative, But Now They Have Jobs'
But Ms. Heidinger persisted and prospered as the social strife ebbed after the homeless were evicted from the park in 1991. In 1996, she opened a housewares store, Lancelotti, on Avenue A and Fifth Street, followed by two more branches of Alphabets in other parts of Manhattan. Business, she says, has never been better. Like many merchants, Ms. Heidinger, who has lived in the East Village for 20 years, does not think gentrification has been bad for the neighborhood. "I'm just glad I no longer have to pull drunken guys out of my vestibule every night," she said.
Another pioneer who welcomes the transformation is Kathy Kirkpatrick, who opened Life, a cafe, on Avenue B and 10th Street in 1982. In those days, she said, Avenue B was an open-air drug bazaar, lined with burned-out buildings and garbage-strewn lots. Having barely survived the decade, she says she is relieved that the renaissance, as she calls it, has finally arrived. Besides local patrons, many of whom plop down with laptops and cell phones, a growing number of tourists show up, as well as people who have seen "Rent," which mentions Life three times.
Ms. Kirkpatrick recently renovated her restaurant and upgraded her menu to appeal to a changing clientele. These days she is as likely to serve martinis and frozen margaritas as veggie burgers and chamomile tea. "Our customers are still young and creative," she said, "but now they have jobs."
Few neighborhoods have as rich a concentration of cultural venues as the East Village. Some of those places have become household names, like the music club CBGB, the experimental theater company La Mama E.T.C., and the rough-and-tumble performance space ABC No Rio. None of them, however, are money-makers and all of them depend on cheap rents to survive. ABC No Rio, which has helped get the careers of many artists -- including the painter Kiki Smith and the singer Michele Shocked -- off the ground, nearly lost its Rivington Street building last year when the city tried to turn it into housing. "We really shouldn't be here," said Steven Englander, ABC No Rio's administrative coordinator. "We just fought hard and got lucky."
Another neighborhood institution, Charas/El Bohio, a Hispanic cultural center, hasn't fared as well. Late last month, the city auctioned its home, a turn-of-the-century public school on Ninth Street and Avenue B, to an undisclosed bidder for $3.15 million. Armando Perez, the group's chairman, says the city's decision to sell its building was an act of vengeance by the Mayor and his ally, Antonio Pagan, the Commissioner of Employment, who used to represent the area in the City Council. Mr. Perez, who is active in local politics, was a frequent critic of Mr. Pagan, who long maintained that Charas did not serve the community. "The truth is," Mr. Pagan said on Friday, "Charas is simply a cash cow for Armando Perez and his cohorts. To call it a community center is a farce. Nothing ever happens there."
Neighborhood residents, however, view the sale as further proof of the East Village's cultural decline. Dozens of theater and dance companies rely on the organization's inexpensive space, as does a bike repair workshop for troubled youths and a group that offers English classes to newly arrived immigrants. After it was abandoned by the city in the 1970's, Charas began renovating the five-story building with the help of donated labor and money from local fund-raising events. Mr. Perez estimates that over the last 19 years, his group has invested the equivalent of $2 million to bring the building back to life. "When we got here, the place had been so badly vandalized that even the doors were gone," he said. "Now it's a centerpiece of the community."
On a recent Friday afternoon the building was humming with activity as a half-dozen artists quietly worked across the hall from theater troupes that were loudly rehearsing in former classrooms. In the ground-floor auditorium, the Synesthetic Theater Company was gearing up for a performance. "We simply couldn't exist without this kind of space," said Mark Greenfield, 35, who was directing a scene from "Henry IV" for the Henry Street Settlement Playhouse. He said that the room he was using, which rents for $10 an hour, is often booked weeks in advance and that the only comparable space, a studio on West 48th Street, offers smaller rooms at $15 an hour. "Losing this place wouldn't just hurt the Lower East Side, but the entire city," he said.
In a studio across the hall, Tracy Zungola, 35, wearing a pair of paint-splattered shorts, was furious at the prospect of searching for new space. Over the last few years, she said, rising rents had driven her out of two nearby studios. "It just doesn't stop," said Ms. Zungola, who pays $257 a month for her space, which is lined with canvases featuring cartoonish images of meat or furniture covered by lacerated flesh. "I can't bear getting kicked out of another space."
 
'That's the Nature Of Growing Up'
Chris Flash of the Shadow has fond memories of the days when protesters and the police clashed frequently in and around Tompkins Square Park. "Back then I think we were able to keep gentrification at bay by maintaining a perceived climate of instability," said Mr. Flash, sitting in the basement offices of his quarterly publication. To keep developers apprehensive, he said, he and his friends would build trash fires in the street, break what he described as "yuppie storefronts," and paint the slogan "Mug a Yuppie" alongside automatic teller machines.
But such brazen tactics have lost favor in recent years, he said, as a sense of futility has set in among activists who have mellowed with age. "It's hard to keep that intensity and that level of anger going forever," said Mr. Flash, who is 40.
A decade ago the civil liberties lawyer Ron Kuby helped to represent some of those who were beaten by the police during the Tompkins Square disturbance. He also filed a lawsuit against the city on behalf of homeless park residents who wanted to burn refuse in garbage cans. Now Mr. Kuby, 42, is the father of a toddler who plays in Tompkins Square Park, and he says he would not tolerate smoke wafting into the playground these days. "Things that were once viewed as the energetic flourishing of experimental multiculturalism now just appear to be potentially criminal and possibly dangerous," he said with a tinge of sarcasm. "I guess that's the nature of growing up."
If Mr. Kuby mourns the disappearance of the neighborhood's radical ferment, he also enjoys the newfound civility and safety in the streets. He also occasionally indulges, somewhat guiltily, he said, in some of the area's new stores, like the Moondog ice cream parlor on Avenue A. "I don't mind that some of the bodegas whose windows were filled with old bottles of Lysol and Spic and Span but sold drugs under the counter are gone," he said. "That's O.K., I guess, as long as a few of them are left."
Still, the neighborhood's pugnacious spirit is far from moribund. During last month's auction of Charas and a half-dozen community gardens, East Village residents staged an unusual protest by releasing thousands of live crickets inside One Police Plaza. Pandemonium ensued and four people were arrested on misdemeanor charges, but in the end, the auction went ahead. "We didn't win that one, but I think we proved that the final curtain has yet to come down," said Fran Luck, a housing advocate whose retrospective exhibition on the uprising, "Ten Years of Protest on the Lower East Side," is on view at ABC No Rio.
If squatters and anarchists see yuppies as a threat to the East Village's survival, then Thomas Miller, on the face of it, would appear to be the enemy.
Two weeks ago Mr. Miller, 25, moved into a $1,400-a-month apartment on Avenue C and Ninth Street, just opposite the squat that is home to Jerry the Peddler and a few doors east of Charas. Every morning when he leaves, dressed in a suit and tie, for his job as a mutual fund analyst, Mr. Miller said, he endures a gantlet of disapproving stares. "I feel an animosity on the street that I don't think I deserve," he said last week, sitting on the floor of his unfurnished apartment surrounded by boxes he has yet to unpack.
His entry-level job at Oppenheimer & Company, he says, pays him just enough to cover his rent and living expenses. He is still desperately looking for a roommate to share his two-bedroom apartment. "I work in a corporate environment, but I don't make a corporate salary," said Mr. Miller, a soft-spoken Minnesota native who graduated from the University of Notre Dame two years ago.
During his first year in New York, Mr. Miller worked as a volunteer teacher at a school in the neighborhood as part of a program that also provided him with housing. When his stint ended, he spent three anxious months looking for an apartment in the city. Nothing he saw, he said, fit his budget. Finally he paid $2,200 to a broker, who found his current apartment, which is above a bar whose patrons occasionally keep him awake at night.
A theater buff who wants to study acting one day, Mr. Miller says he was drawn to the East Village by its culture, its color and its abundant night life. "I hate the stuffiness of the Upper East Side," he said. But as much as he likes his new neighborhood, he is disappointed by the hostility he feels on the street. "Maybe I'm part of the problem, or at least some people think that way," he said, "but I have a right to live here, too."

Photo/Chart: "HISTORY: The Times of Tompkins Square Park"
For more than 150 years, Tompkins Square Park, the oldest park on the Lower East Side, has served as a place of respite and dissent. Some major moments in park history:
1834 City condemns and buys land known today as Tompkins Square Park, much of which had belonged to John Jacob Astor. Most nearby residents are lower-middle-class immigrants, including many Irish shipbuilders.
1874 7,000 people "agitating for work relief" are involved in a riot with the police on Jan. 13.
1877 Gathering of railway workers supporting the nation's first railroad strike.
1888 Temperance Fountain is erected.
1894 One of the nation's first playgrounds built in park.
1897 Christodora House opens as a settlement house on east side of park. Today it is a luxury co-op.
1906 Monument to General Slocum steamship fire is erected. Most of the more than 1,000 passengers who died aboard the Slocum in the East River were German immigrants who lived near the park.
1930's Recreational amenities like handball courts and swing sets are added, and many pathways are paved.
1961 Neighborhood opposition scuttles Parks Department plan for a softball diamond.
1966 Bandshell is completed.
1966-69 Neighborhood and park become a haven for hippie movement, with frequent concerts and rallies at bandshell.
Aug. 6, 1988 Rioting involving hundreds of people and police officers erupts over Parks Department's imposition of a curfew.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
With Stocks Slumping, Currency Trading Soars

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE refrain on foreign exchange trading desks these days is: "Volatility is being very good to me."
Most currency traders don't miss what was for them the dull, trendless and not very profitable trading that dominated the mid-1990's. It has given way to big daily movements and strong trends in many currencies, especially those at the heart of the Asian financial crisis. 
 The forces that are causing the volatility have helped to unsettle other financial markets, and the atmosphere of higher risk played a role in Wall Street's big drop in the last few weeks. But trends are favorable for the international bankers, traders and investors who make part of their living from movements in currencies, whether up or down.
"It is a nice time to be a foreign exchange dealer," said Robert White, the treasurer of Standard Chartered Bank. "That volatility provides opportunities for risk-taking and brings in customer business" as investors and financial managers try to hedge against adverse moves or buy currencies to help them enter or exit fast-moving investments around the world.
Craig A. Puffenberger, the head of global foreign exchange options at Credit Suisse First Boston, put it another way: "The volatility gives us opportunities to find things to buy cheaply and to sell them expensively."
But what is good for money traders and banks, of course, is not necessarily good for everyone. The increased volatility and sharp strengthening of the dollar against many currencies have caused some problems.
For American companies, a stronger dollar makes their products more expensive and less competitive abroad. It makes imports cheaper and more competitive in this country. Big-name companies like Coca-Cola, Dow Corning, Union Carbide and 3M all said the strong dollar had contributed to the weakness in their latest financial results.
Currency volatility increases the uncertainty for companies doing business abroad and for investors who put their money to work in overseas markets. This uncertainty raises their costs as they hedge to protect themselves against unexpected plunges or increases in a currency's value.
Exchange-rate doubts also can reach into the pocketbooks of the average tourist, abruptly raising or lowering costs for hotels and plane tickets from one day to the next.
 THE reasons for the revived volatility are many, including the collapse of economies in Asia, the inability of Japan to overcome its economic malaise and the threat of a financial crisis in Russia that could spread elsewhere.
Jeremy Fand, the senior foreign exchange strategist at BankBoston, thinks the market has taken its eye off the economic fundamentals that moved currencies in the past, like differences between interest rates and inflation rates around the world.
Instead, the market is moved by themes -- the presumed inadequacies of the new Japanese Government, for example. "The market attaches much more significance to these themes," he said, adding that traders could fixate on one as quickly as they could forget another.
The gyrations in Asian and emerging-markets currencies have helped offset the loss of profit opportunities in Europe, where volatility has evaporated ahead of the Jan. 1, 1999 introduction of Europe's single currency, the euro.
From its high to its low this year, the dollar has moved just 5.5 percent against the German mark. In contrast, the Japanese yen has had three big moves -- 3.8 percent, 4.5 percent and 6.9 percent -- against the dollar in just the last eight weeks.
 SOME beneficiaries of currency volatility have been the big banks that are the major players in the foreign exchange market, with its activity of $1.4 trillion a day.
At Chase Manhattan Bank, for example, revenue from foreign exchange trading jumped 70 percent in the first quarter of this year and 58 percent in the second quarter. Foreign exchange revenue at Citibank rose 17 percent in the first quarter and 50 percent in the second quarter.
While these returns are not a major source of revenue, they have contributed to the strong performance of these banks' stocks this year. Chase is up 26.4 percent for the year, and Citicorp, the parent of Citibank, is up 19.8 percent.
Currencies may or may not stay volatile. A rebound in Asia or a turnaround in the financial outlook for Russia could make them more stable.
But banks that trade currencies have been lifted for now, at least, out of the doldrums of a few years ago. Back then, low volatility, the broadening use of electronic trading and concerns about the arrival of the single currency in Europe led to layoffs and closures of trading desks -- as well as a decline in revenue from currency trading.
Donald H. Layton, vice chairman of global markets-international at Chase Manhattan, said the higher revenue was coming from three sources: proprietary trading, in which the bank bets its own money on the direction of currencies; higher volumes of trading from customers, which these days are predominantly money managers, hedge funds and others moving money around the the world; and the bigger spreads, or differences between the buying and selling prices of currencies that come with higher volatility. The larger spreads add to the revenue and profits from trading.
Mr. Layton acknowledged that trading in more volatile markets "means there is more risk." But he said the banks could handle that partly because more of their foreign exchange revenue comes from customer dealings than from proprietary trading.
One indication of this, he said, is the inconsequential fallout from the surprising intervention on June 17 by the United States and Japan to support the yen, which moved 4.7 percent higher in one day.
"The intervention for the market was a major event, but it was not a major profit- and-loss event to the banks," he said.
Charles Peabody, the bank analyst at Mitchell Securities, is more concerned about bank reliance on currency volatility.
In a recent report to clients, Mr. Peabody said the rise in volatility was one reason that bank activities like underwriting, mergers and acquisitions, trading, and handling of international capital flows have done so well.
"A reversal of a strong U.S. dollar and low long-term interest rates should prove disruptive to market-sensitive sources of revenues, the mainstay of the current double-digit earnings-per-share growth in the banking industry," he wrote.

HEADLINE: The World: Taking Stock;
Forget Which Came First. What Comes Next?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
EARLY two years ago, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan made a few cautionary comments about the economy and uttered an ominous warning about "irrational exuberance" among stock market investors. Investors were jolted upright for a few days, then shrugged, and stock prices soared even higher in the months afterward.
Last month, Mr. Greenspan gave a surprisingly upbeat report on the economy and suggested that stock prices did not appear out of line with the current good times. Almost immediately, investors grew wary, and stock prices beat a retreat that quickened considerably last week. 
 Which, among rational souls, raises perplexing questions. Does the stock market's performance have anything to do with the outlook for the economy? Can the economy be helped or hindered by the performance of the stock market? And, above all, which comes first: a strong economy or a bull market? Recession or crash?
The mystifying nature of that chicken-or-egg quandary is no longer solely a topic in ivory towers. Down in the barnyard, the groundlings know that they are expected to play a big part in determining the future of the stock market.
And last week, on cue, individual investors reacted to the market's swoon with predictable bleatings about buying opportunities and impending rebounds.
 
Bouncing Back
"Individual investors believe they have learned that the market, like Joe Palooka, always bounces back," said Ira Kaminow, an economist and president of Capital Insights Group, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm. One day the market will not bounce back, however, and a sustained decline will lead to a drop in consumer spending, now a key source of fuel for the economy.
"I think it would take a fairly substantial and persistent decline, one lasting six to nine months, for their enthusiasm and optimism to begin to wane," Mr. Kaminow said.
When the downturn comes, the effect might be more pronounced than it was during the boom.
"On the way up, the stock market's gains did not boost spending as much as people had expected," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, based in Columbus, Ohio. "For every $1 of capital gains, we've seen consumer spending rise by about 3 cents."
But if the black ink on investors' mutual fund account statements starts turning to red, he said, "for every $1 in losses we'll see a decline in consumption of 4 to 4.5 cents."
Clearly, the performance of the stock market influences whether individuals spend money, and thus affects the nation's economy. The savings rate has fallen to historic lows in recent months not because people believe that they do not need to put away a few dollars for retirement. Rather, they have grown to believe they can put away some loose change, then wait for the ever-rising stock market to turn that into dollars.
With the rest of their money -- some of which they would otherwise be saving -- individuals feel free to buy new cars, take more exotic vacations, finish paneling the basement or likewise spend on frills that they would have ignored.
That spending creates demand for goods, causing factories to hire workers to assemble automobiles, staff hotels and churn out linoleum. Sales of their products and services create greater profits for those companies; higher earnings help to boost the companies' stock prices, resulting in greater returns for Mr. and Ms. Spendthrift's mutual funds. The virtuous circle starts anew.
The rising tide, moreover, lifts even the heaviest boats. The gains that average Americans reap from their investments result in more tax dollars for Federal and state coffers. Budget surpluses, in turn, lead to calls for lower taxes and even greater optimism among individual investors. But the stock market can also work against the economy, quickly turning the virtuous circle into a vicious cycle.
The trigger can be anything -- Asian tremors, the unraveling of a merger, a border skirmish. Often, traders sell first, leaving the questions for later.
When capital gains turn into capital losses, government revenues dry up, as does spending by consumers, as does hiring by companies.
Alan Greenspan recently pointed out that the Japanese had a similar experience. Revenues were pouring into the Government during the bubble economy, then when things turned bad, the deluge turned into a drought.
"In that respect," Mr. Kaminow said, "the Japanese might be seven to nine years ahead of where we are."
In the United States over just the last three and a half years, sharp gains in the stock market have produced substantial profits for most people in their mutual funds. Those profits have been maintained even as many individual stocks have suffered big declines.
In each year since the beginning of 1995, investors have poured a record amount of money into mutual funds that invest in American stocks, and the total in the first six months of 1998 is ahead of last year's pace.
Weighting those $600 billion of investments by the stock-market levels at which they were made shows that Americans have aggregate profits of 45 percent over that three-and-a-half year span. Clearly, it would take a much sharper decline than last week's to get their attention.
"I don't think the current stock market decline is enough to drag consumption growth down to recessionary levels," said Mr. Chan said on Thursday. "Before we get there, we'll need to see employment growth slowing down."
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the United States economy added jobs in July at the slowest pace in more than two years. Weakness in the manufacturing sector could easily be traced to the General Motors strike, but service companies, like those in the financial industry, also slowed. The stock market responded by moving higher.
A market downturn could give a sharp and sudden jolt to employment, however.
The boom in the securities market has spawned rapid growth not only in the financial services industry but also in the innumerable pilot fish that swim alongside -- more mutual fund salesclerks, more real estate agents selling apartments to bonus-toting brokers, more deliverymen bringing sandwiches to late-night dealmakers.
"If the equity market doesn't continue to do very well, the first areas you'll see it is in the Northeast," particularly New York City, Mr. Chan said. "The market has driven real estate prices in New York. The luxury sectors will start to slow. And at some point it will spill over into Main Street."
So, what is the likelihood that the current weakness will morph into a brutish downturn anytime soon? "It's a non-trivial probability," said Mr. Kaminow. "But less than 50-50. I'm more optimistic than pessimistic, but compared to a year ago, I can see the dangers more easily."
As for Alan Greenspan, he is undoubtedly happy that investors are heeding his words, said Mr. Chan. "The entire Federal Reserve is probably dancing in the street after seeing that some of the air was let out of the market."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Buying the Backbones of the Wireless Age

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
GIVEN the money poured into the shares of glossy new cyberspace ventures lately, it is easy to overlook companies that are exploiting more down-to-earth technologies.
Consider the companies that build or own transmission towers for the rapidly expanding wireless communications business. 
 Yes, they may lack the new-kid-in-town sizzle of an Internet software concern. But besides building or owning wireless transmission towers, these companies often perform valuable maintenance services for phone, cellular, paging and data transmission companies. Investors have taken note.
In June, the largest tower company, American Tower, went public at $21 a share. Even in the face of the market's big drop last week, the company's class A stock closed at $23 on Friday after having traded as high as $28 on July 23.
Two other tower companies, Crown Castle International and Pinnacle Tower, are expected to go public soon. At the end of July, Crown nearly doubled the size of its offering; if it goes through at its expected price of $18 a share, the offering would be one of the largest of the year, with a market value of $1.76 billion.
It is not difficult to see how antennae towers are showing up on investors' radar.
Falling prices for wireless communications are attracting vast numbers of consumers, which means that the wireless companies are expanding their networks for sending and receiving data.
The wireless industry has also turned far more competitive, and wireless carriers have started improving their efficiency by either selling their networks -- and then leasing them back -- or establishing joint ventures with companies that will manage them.
The advent of digital television is also benefiting the antenna-tower industry, by increasing demand for new towers to accommodate new digital transmission equipment.
Victor Miller, a broadcasting analyst at Bear, Stearns, which helped take American Tower public, said the wireless industry already was using 40,000 to 50,000 transmission towers in the United States. Demand for towers to accommodate cellular and personal communications services alone could raise that number close to 100,000 by 2001, industry analysts say.
Mr. Miller, like several other analysts, said he expected the tower industry to keep consolidating. The main reason is that no single company owns more than 3 percent of the towers.
Indeed, American Tower owns or operates only about 1,900 towers, while Crown Castle has 1,219. Specialty Teleconstructors, which went public in 1994, has 801, and Pinnacle Holdings has 646.
To some investors, so-called tower economics look attractive.
For one thing, the towers are relatively inexpensive to build, usually costing no more than $200,000 each. After the towers are up, they tend to generate steady revenue, much of it from blue-chip companies that often sign long-term contracts. These pacts usually require payment in advance and contain built-in rent increases.
 SOME tower management companies have amassed impressive lists of customers. Crown Castle's clients, for example, include AT&T Wireless, Bell Atlantic Mobile, Motorola, Pagenet and Sprint PCS. Last year, the company acquired the domestic broadcast transmission network of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It is also pursuing acquisitions in Australia and New Zealand.
That kind of early foothold in the international wireless market distinguishes Crown Castle from American Tower, its nearest competitor. But Crown is also carrying more debt than its rival because of acquisitions over the last 18 months. As of March 31, it had $437 million in debt, more than three times as much as American Tower, although Crown's planned initial offering could erase much of that debt.
Randall Roth, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, an initial-offering research firm in Greenwich, Conn., said Crown Castle had enough cash flow to service the debt. But he said the stock carried other risks. Because of the company's rapid expansion, he said, "it's hard to determine where their internal growth ends and where their acquisition growth begins."
In addition, he said, the company's ability to generate enough cash flow will depend on how well it can compete with other bidders for tower rights -- and on how customers rate the quality and breadth of the company's network.
When it comes to breadth, American Tower may have a two-year lead on its rivals, analysts said. It also appears to have a more diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than 10 percent of the company's revenue.
 BY contrast, during the first three months of this year, BBC accounted for about 46 percent of Crown Castle's revenue, while Nextel Communications, its second-largest customer, accounted for 10 percent.
The importance of quick expansion is perhaps best seen in a strategy change by Specialty Teleconstructors. It has been focused on building and managing towers for other companies while others were busy buying. Now the company is racing to catch up but has found that the price of existing towers has become so expensive that it is cheaper to build them.
The shift in Specialty's business plan contributed to a 12 percent decline in revenue and a 53 percent decline in profits for the nine months ended March 31, compared with the period a year earlier. But the shift from just managing to owning could eventually mean a stronger revenue stream for the company.
Specialty also expects to derive advantages from its acquisition in April of another tower company, OmniAmerica Inc., which has amassed marketing power with several wireless carriers, like BellSouth, and which also recently received an investment windfall from Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, the venture capital firm.
"This business is a great economic model on paper, but it's very complex -- it's not as simple as 'build a tower and they will come,' " said Carl E. Hirsch, the chief executive of OmniAmerica. "It's about building carrier relationships. It's not just about real estate."

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
No Longer Sizzling
Economic indicators painted a far less robust picture than they had earlier in the year. The Conference Board reported that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators slipped in June, as it had in May. It stood at 105, down 0.2 percent from May. "It doesn't mean bad times for the U.S. economy, but we've seen the best," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics. Similarly, the Federal Reserve said in releasing its beige book that although the economy was healthy, growth showed signs of slowing as exports to Asia slumped. Personal incomes rose a scant 0.2 percent in June. The nation's unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent and wage growth eased in July. 

HEALTH CARE
Hemorrhaging Red Ink
Managed care, manage thyself, investors might well say. United Healthcare, one of the nation's largest health maintenance organizations, said it would take a $900 million charge in its second quarter, in part to abandon unprofitable Medicare plans. "People seem to forget that Medicare was created because private insurers could not make money on the elderly population," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer organization in New York. Following the debacle at Oxford Health Plans, another managed care concern, the move sparked an investor stampede out of health care stocks and possibly jeopardized United Healthcare's proposed $5.5 billion merger with its rival, Humana Inc., which would create the nation's largest H.M.O.
 
AUTOS
Streamlining G.M.
General Motors, the world's largest auto maker, said it would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly plants in North America. To the dismay of the United Automobile Workers, which effectively shut down G.M. with eight-week strikes against two parts facilities, the new plants could use as little as half the number of workers currently employed at G.M. assembly plants, like this one in Shreveport, La. Outside suppliers, many with nonunion workers, would do much of the work. G.M., which reported that sales fell 38 percent in July, also announced a sweeping reorganization of its internal distribution structure that is expected to save $200 million to $300 million a year and eliminate as many as 1,000 white-collar jobs, and said it would spin off Delphi Automotive Systems, its parts unit. Ford reported a 4.3 percent slide in domestic car and truck sales for July, and Chrysler registered a 3 percent gain.
 
SUNBEAM
Less Than Sunny
Sunbeam, the appliance maker, said it would restate last year's financial statements, resulting in a "material adjustment," and possibly the results for 1996 and the first quarter of this year, too, because of possible accounting irregularities. One analyst estimated that the adjustment would be $25 million to $50 million. The stock slid $1, to a new low of $7 on Thursday. The disclosure followed an announcement that Sunbeam and Albert J. Dunlap, the former chairman and chief executive ousted by the board in June, had signed a "joint cooperation agreement" to share various documents related to lawsuits and an investigation into the financial results. But the two sides quickly began bickering about what they had agreed on. Still, one thing went right for the company: the American Medical Association agreed to pay Sunbeam $9.9 million for backing out of a deal to endorse the company's humidifiers, blood pressure monitors and other products.
 
THE INTERNET
New Frontier for Business
A century and a half ago, when Americans pushed back the Western frontier, they panned for gold. Well, so far, this century's frontier, the Internet, has not proved itself a gold mine. But business is trying. Amazon.com, showing that its aspirations extend to selling far more than books over the Internet, bought the Junglee Corporation, which operates a service that lets people shop on line for everything from clothing to computers, and Planet All, which operates a vast Internet address service. And Agency.com agreed to acquire Eagle River Interactive. The Omnicom Group will own just under half the combined company, which will be the Internet's largest ad agency.
 
DEALS
Allied Signal's Bid
Allied Signal, a maker of aerospace and automotive products, announced a $9.8 billion unsolicited offer for AMP Inc., which said it would review the offer. . . . Albertson's Inc. said it would acquire American Stores for $8.3 billion in stock, in a deal that would create the nation's largest supermarket chain. . . . Eastman Kodak agreed to buy the Imation Corporation's medical imaging business for $520 million in cash. The move shows that Kodak, after shrinking operations and its work force earlier this year, is now rebuilding.
 
SOFTWARE
A Setback for Microsoft
A Federal judge ordered Microsoft to turn over to the Government the source code for its operating systems, Windows 95 and Windows 98, and to make its chairman, William H. Gates, and 16 other executives available for pretrial depositions taking as long as the Justice Department deemed necessary to prepare for a Sept. 8 trial in the Government's antitrust suit against the company. . . . A vulnerability was discovered in Eudora, the most widely used E-mail software, just days after a serious security flaw was found in two rival electronic-mail programs. The flaws would permit an attacker to destroy or steal data or tamper with a personal computer, although no incidents have been reported.
 
CREDIT UNIONS
Victory From Defeat
Bankers were cheering five months ago when the Supreme Court ruled that the nation's laws did not permit credit unions to include more than one occupational group in their memberships. But credit unions had the last laugh. Congress passed a measure to permit them to expand their memberships, and President Clinton said that he would sign it, even though it does not require credit unions to abide by fair-lending rules that banks must follow. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said of the credit unions, "We need them in these days of consolidation and mega-mergers to serve the little guys."

HEADLINE: Coverage of Club Raids Showed Bias for Owners

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I thought your July 5 article "The Cafe Police Pop in for a Raid" was very unbalanced and biased toward the club owners. The photo caption, "Hilly Kristal, owner of CBGB's, endures a visit by Social Club Task Force agents," was too much. 
 Perhaps your follow-up article should have a photo of one of the residents living near one of the rowider venues in the East Village/ Lower East Side who has endured yet another night of lost sleep due to thumping bass, open doors allowing over-loud music, crowd noise and rowdy patrons entering and leaving.
For the record, Hilly Kristal is one of the more responsible club owners.
Andrew Rasiej's comment that the night life industry is "unfortunately not seen as a component of the social and economic fabric of New York" is simply warped logic. Enforcement of laws and regulations does not imply blindness toward any one industry.

HEADLINE: U.S. Oilmen Chafing at Curbs on Iran

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and STEVE LeVINE 

DATELINE: BAKU, Azerbaijan

 BODY:
American oil companies, the largest players on the energy-rich Caspian Sea, are expressing growing exasperation with the White House policy forbidding American investment in Iran.
Despite an overture to Iran by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in June, the Administration has insisted that geopolitical strategy outstrips the commercial advantages being ceded to European companies doing business there. 
 Intense lobbying by letter, in advertisements and by oil executives personally has got nowhere in an Administration that promotes commercial diplomacy but draws a line at Iran.
"It has to be admitted there is a problem with American companies," Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the State Department, said in a telephone interview. "But this is a situation where the strategic interests of the United States are so great that they outweigh temporary advantages of American companies."
By moving into Iran, Mr. Eizenstat said, European companies are providing revenue that the Iranians may use to develop weapons of mass destruction.
"This seems to be a factor the Europeans discount," he said. "We don't have the luxury of discounting the strategic burden."
The conflict dramatizes an Administration in agonizing flux, trying to adapt to a changed, intensely competitive global economy in which America's allies are brazenly defying sanctions while trying also to appease a Republican-controlled Congress that adamantly supports the continued isolation of countries like Iran, Libya and Cuba.
For the first time since the fall of the Shah nearly two decades ago, Iran is aggressively marketing investment opportunities, making it a particularly hot subject for American oil companies.
At a conference in London in July, European corporations lined up to bid on 43 oil and gas projects worth $5.6 billion offered by the state-owned Iranian National Oil Company.
In contrast the American oil companies, constrained by a sanctions law and a 1995 Presidential order barring business in Iran, sent only middle-level representatives who could gather information but could not negotiate.
"The London conference provided a great opportunity for the West Europeans to gain great advantage," said Archie W. Dunham, the president of Conoco. "I hope it's only a short-term advantage."
In a letter to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Dunham made clear that as European companies increasingly disregard American sanctions against Iran, they are getting more than just a leg up. In the medium to long run, American oil executives say, it is economically not realistic to exclude Iran from the development of the Caspian as the region becomes one of the world's major energy sources.
Conoco has been a chief critic of the sanctions since the company was forced to cancel a $2 billion contract with Iran two years ago, only to watch this May as the United States granted a French-led consortium a waiver from sanctions for the same deal.
The consortium included Total S.A. of France, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia. President Clinton granted the waiver in return for an agreement by the three countries to clamp down on the sale of nuclear technology to Iran.
The 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, in addition to barring American business from the two countries, imposes penalties against any company from any nation investing more than $20 million there.
Mr. Dunham told Mr. Clinton that he supported the waiver even though Conoco's competitors benefited, but he warned that the European companies were gaining long-term advantages in Iran.
"It is clear that the governments of the foreign companies investing in Iran are prepared to defend the actions of their corporations," Mr. Dunham wrote. "This is because Iran is important to the economic and national development of the Caspian region."
Some American companies see Iran, one of five countries that border the landlocked Caspian Sea, not only as a place for exploration but also as an economic route for transporting energy to Western markets.
But the Administration has put considerable diplomatic effort into promoting countries that were once part of the Soviet Union -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan -- as new sources of energy that bypass both Russia and Iran.
Increasingly, oil companies that have already started extracting oil and gas from the Caspian are questioning the wisdom of an Administration-backed plan that would put oil in a lengthy and expensive pipeline from Baku to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey.
The Administration likes this idea because it anchors Turkey, a NATO ally, in the quest for oil and avoids Iran.
Expressing the growing disquiet about the proposed pipeline, an American oil executive here said, "We don't want to be stuck with a white elephant."
 As an indication of the complexities of the questions, the Administration has appointed a coordinator for Caspian Sea issues. He is Richard Morningstar, who has been director of American aid in countries of the former Soviet Union.
Mobil and Conoco have led the effort to persuade the Administration to be more flexible.
Conoco has proposed that American companies be permitted to invest the same as foreign companies -- $20 million each annually.
In May, Mobil sponsored advertisements in two newspapers asking that United States companies be permitted to "swap" oil with Iran -- deliver Caspian crude for use in Iran's northern cities, then pick up an equivalent volume at the country's southern port of Kharg Island.
The advertisements also suggested that the companies be allowed to negotiate deals with Iran, with the understanding that these would remain unconsummated until sanctions are lifted -- a precedent established in Vietnam before the trade embargo there was abolished in 1994.
Finally, the advertisements asked repeal of a ban on the use of Iranian equipment on the Caspian, a move that would free American companies to participate with partners who use Iranian-supplied equipment.
Industry leaders have been watching the progress of an application for the swap waiver that Mobil made to the Treasury Department in April, perceiving it as a bellwether of Administration policy.
Mr. Eizenstat, the Under Secretary, said the application had not yet been considered at the highest levels. But he said swaps were not a "simple solution" to the Caspian's transportation problems, and asserted that they "could create a dangerous dependency on Iran."
Even if the United States appears unlikely to budge much, oil industry analysts said the pressure will continue to build.
They cited a recent trip to Teheran by the Italian Prime Minister, Romano Prodi, followed by a delegation of top European Union leaders. Industry analysts expect more European leaders to visit.

HEADLINE: Abortion Debated in Chile, Where It's Always a Crime

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Nine years after Gen. Augusto Pinochet decreed that abortion was a crime in Chile even when necessary to save the mother's life, the Chilean Senate has taken up the issue for the first time.
Advocates of women's rights here say it is time for a change. But in fact the bill before the Senate would only tighten regulations by increasing prison sentences for anyone convicted of conducting an abortion. 
 Conservative opposition senators pushing the bill say they want to crush the "abortion industry," which experts say is responsible for up to 160,000 clandestine abortions annually in this country of 15 million people.
But the conservatives concede that they hope to make abortion an issue in next year's presidential election to embarrass Ricardo Lagos, the Socialist who is leading in the polls and who has been studiously ducking the issue.
"This is a moral question in which we have public opinion on our side," said Senator Hernan Larrain, the leading proponent of the legislation who is also a close adviser to a conservative presidential candidate. "If we pass this in the Senate, we are going to push this issue hard."
Senator Carlos Ominami, the leading opponent of the bill and an adviser to Mr. Lagos, said: "Abortion is a supercharged issue in Chile and it is a very difficult one for any progressive politician. Don't forget this is the only country in Latin America without a law allowing divorce."
At the end of an interview, he said, "I want to make myself perfectly clear that I do not favor legalizing abortion."
Abortion is illegal everywhere in Latin America except Cuba, although it is widely practiced among all social classes. Chilean law was consistent with abortion laws around the region until the Pinochet regime, with conservative church allies, put family issues at the forefront of Chilean politics.
Chileans are particularly polarized on political and social issues, with about one-third expressing very liberal views and another third expressing extremely conservative views. Each sector is represented politically, with the governing Christian Democrats leaning toward liberal economic policies but more conservative social policies.
About 50 Chileans, most of them poor women, are prosecuted each year for having or carrying out abortions. Few spend more than a few days in jail. Conservatives say that only by stiffening the penalties can the practice be deterred.
There is a good chance the Senate will approve the legislation, perhaps as early as next week. The Christian Democrats, who govern as part of a coalition, are divided on the issue. Passage in the more liberal lower chamber of the Chilean Congress is considered less likely, though still possible.
About one in every three pregnancies ends in an abortion in Chile, one of the highest rates in Latin America, according to estimates gathered in the early 1990's by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based abortion rights group. As many as 100 Chilean women die every year from botched abortions, according to local health experts.
Four million abortions a year -- one out of every 11 in the world -- take place in Latin America despite its being the most devoutly Roman Catholic region in the world.
Abortion has always been illegal in Chile, but under a 1931 law it was allowed in cases where a woman's life was in jeopardy. But that law was repealed by decree in 1989 during the final months of the Pinochet regime.
Only El Salvador, Malta and Andorra have abortion laws as restrictive as Chile's, abortion rights groups say.
Under current Chilean law, a woman who has an abortion can be sentenced to three to five years in prison. An abortionist who is not a medical professional can be sentenced to 18 months to three years, and a doctor, nurse or midwife can face three to five years. But in most cases judges have handed out suspended sentences or allowed those convicted to serve time at night or to carry out some kind of public service.
Under the proposed law, abortionists who are not medical professionals would face a minimum of five years in prison, and a professional practitioner would face a minimum of 10 years. Judges would have less leeway in reducing or suspending sentences. The bill would not raise the sentences for women who have abortions, but would encourage them to testify against practitioners in exchange for lower sentences.
Human rights advocates say poor women, who are by far the most vulnerable to abortions carried out without proper medical care, are already regularly interrogated in hospitals when they arrive in emergency rooms with problems that appear to be abortion-related.
"I'm worried," said Lidia Casas Becerra, a leading Chilean advocate of abortion rights. "The whole criminal justice system would work against the poor if this bill passes."
Ms. Casas said that any well-to-do woman can safely have an abortion in a private clinic or hospital for $1,000 to $2,500 -- a price out of the range of most Chileans.
But, she said, poor women must turn to abortionists who lack medical training, who may charge about $200 and who use wires or primitive rubber probes.
Any toughening of the law, she said, could raise prices exorbitantly for all groups and make the whole process more clandestine.
The debate on the bill has received scant attention in the Chilean press despite a march on the Senate on Aug. 4 by 60 women who support abortion rights. Some jeered from the gallery at senators who support a tougher law.
More than anything else, some experts say, the lack of news coverage is a reflection of the fact that Chileans are extremely reluctant to discuss abortion at all.
Senator Ominami, the adviser to the Socialist presidential candidate, knows how touchy the issue is.
"Abortion," he said during a debate on the Senate floor last month, pausing for effect. "It's a strong word. It strikes a blow to the ears. It's almost inevitable that from this subject only the most acid discussions can surge."

HEADLINE: Two Feuding Democratic Voices Call a Truce

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Two long-feuding pillars of the Democratic Party, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Democratic Leadership Council, have agreed to a detente in which they pledge to stop attacking each other and to seek common ground to help the Democrats this fall and beyond.
This truce between the leadership council, the Democrats' leading centrist voice, and the labor federation, the party's most powerful liberal voice, comes after the council and the federation savaged each other in last year's dispute over trade legislation. 
 Al From, the president of the Democratic Leadership Council, went so far as to accuse the 13-million-member union group of leading the opposition to the President and of wanting "to stop change in our party."
After White House officials warned the council that its harsh words were undermining Democratic unity, Mr. From and John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., agreed to abide by a nonaggression pact and to seek to forge some common positions. In the past, the two groups have clashed not only over trade, but also over education, reducing the size of the Federal Government and overhauling welfare.
In an interview, Mr. From said, "If we could ever bring the New Democrats, with our broad appeal to the electorate, together with labor and its organizational strength, we would have one big progressive coalition."
Showing that it wanted to mend fences with labor, the leadership council opposed a California measure, defeated in a June referendum, that would have crippled labor's political clout by requiring that unions get each member's permission annually before spending a member's dues on politics.
Although the two sides still clash over trade, they are trying to find common positions on many issues, including Social Security and charter schools, innovative public schools that are allowed to operate free of many bureaucratic rules. In the past the leadership council has supported wholesale changes in the schools, while unions have been ambivalent, wanting to insure that innovative schools did not threaten teachers' job security.
The two groups also agreed on the leadership council's call for "expanding the winner's circle" to help insure that most Americans, not just a minority, benefit from increased trade.
This agreement comes at the same time that the White House has brought many of the party's leading moderate and liberal thinkers together to try to forge a united voice and common themes that would help strengthen President Clinton's legacy and would help Democrats in this year's midterm elections and in the Presidential election year 2000.
The leadership council generally backs programs that promote market-driven solutions on economic policies. It has long fought with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other liberal groups that are more enthusiastic about Government-sponsored programs that protect the disadvantaged.
The council has been one of the Democratic Party's most outspoken voices in favor of freer trade. It fervently backed the fast-track legislation, shelved last fall in the face of intense labor pressure, that would have made it easier for Washington to sign free-trade agreements with other countries. Fearing that the legislation would drag down wages and eliminate jobs, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. fought it.
Despite the truce, many tensions remain. In the spring issue of its magazine, the leadership council criticized "the union hierarchy" for seeking "political allies among left-wing activists."
The council and the federation also disagree about the best strategy for the Democrats in November. The leadership council favors a moderate message that appeals to suburban middle-class voters, a pivotal swing group. But the A.F.L.-C.I.O. backs a more have-nots versus haves, class-tinged message that would mobilize the party's liberal-labor base.

HEADLINE: In Fishing Hamlet, No Grief Cormorants;
Near the Scene of a Slaughter, the Protected Birds Are Blamed for a Decrease in Jobs and Revenue

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: HENDERSON HARBOR, N.Y., Aug. 6

 BODY:
When nearly 1,000 double-crested cormorants were found shot dead on an island in eastern Lake Ontario near here last week, Federal wildlife officials labeled the incident "a brazen act of environmental terrorism."
An animal rights group in California offered a $1,000 reward for the capture of those responsible for what it called "a brutal act of animal cruelty." 
 But around this hamlet, where nearly everyone makes a living indirectly or directly from sport fishing, the incident was likened to the Boston Tea Party, and the shooters, who have not been identified, were hailed as heroes.
"I only wish they'd killed every last one," said Ronald Ditch, a longtime fishing guide. Mr. Ditch and many of his colleagues have spent a decade pressing Federal and state wildlife officials to permit shooting of the rapidly multiplying fishing birds, which the guides blamed for a sharp decline in stocks of smallmouth bass, perch and other popular game fish.
In the surrounding town of Henderson, where vacationing fishermen help swell the population to 10,000 from 1,200 every summer, anything that threatens the fish also threatens a way of life, said Frank Ross, the Town Supervisor and a mechanic at a local gas station.
Just a few years ago, about 70 guides were kept busy all summer here taking fishermen from across the United States out into the eastern basin of the lake, which was renowned as one of the best bass-fishing spots in North America. Now there are about 20, marina owners say.
The cormorants were nearly extinct on the Great Lakes in the 1950's, depleted by the combined effects of shooting, DDT and pollution. Although never protected by the Endangered Species Act, they have been covered since 1972 by a Federal law governing migratory birds.
But now their numbers have rebounded across North America, and every spring and summer thousands settle in to nest on Little Galloo Island, 10 miles west of Henderson Harbor.
As the 52-acre island has grown to become the largest nursery for cormorants in the United States, it has also become a focus for the hatred of dozens of fishing guides and other business owners in Jefferson County, who have seen a decline in revenue as fishermen shift to waters with more fish and fewer birds.
No conclusive link has been established between the return of the cormorants and the decline of bass and other fish here. Nevertheless, marina owners and fishing guides are losing patience with Federal officials, who prohibit shooting the birds unless a clear economic loss is demonstrated.
The birds have so many enemies that the criminal investigation this week was taking on the appearance of an Agatha Christie mystery in which everyone is a suspect. Conservation officers were faced with half a dozen communities in which almost everyone, from fishing guides and gas station attendants to motel owners, had motive, opportunity and -- given the popularity of duck and deer hunting -- the necessary weaponry.
The incident also had political overtones, since local residents resent what they regard as the intrusion of unreasonable regulations written far away and long ago.
"You can only oppress people for so long and they're going to strike out," said David McCrea, a third-generation fishing guide, as he left four anglers and their catch of 20 bass and 4 walleyes at the Henchen Marina and Fishing Camp after a day on the lake. "If these birds did this in Washington or on some politician's golf course, they'd be gone in a minute."
Federal and state wildlife officials, traditionally focused on saving threatened species, find themselves dealing increasingly with problems created by species that have recovered so well from past troubles that they have moved from rarities to nuisances. That is the case with the double-crested cormorant.
The mass shooting was by far the most brutal of several recent incidents in which large numbers of birds protected under the 80-year-old Migratory Bird Treaty Act have been killed. That pact was worked out among the United States, Canada, Mexico and several other countries to protect hundreds of bird species that cross international boundaries.
Before dawn on July 23, in Carrollton, Tex., city officials used bulldozers in a pre-dawn raid on a large rookery for several kinds of protected herons and egrets, killing hundreds of birds and injuring many more. They were responding to complaints about the squawking and odor from the colony.
Around the same date, bulldozers clearing a road for a development in Conway, Ark., plowed through woodlands containing hundreds of egret nests, apparently killing many birds and sending orphaned baby egrets wandering around nearby streets and backyards.
Across the country, protected birds have occasionally been shot in anger and hunters have exceeded permitted limits for protected waterfowl, Federal and state wildlife officials said, but nothing in recent decades has come close to the systematic slaughter of the Little Galloo Island cormorants.
The extreme nature of the incident most likely sprang from two factors, local residents and wildlife officials said: the exasperating nature of the cormorants, and the nature of the community here.
The birds are voracious predators, diving up to 60 feet to hunt fish, from minnows to 12-inch bass. Each one can consume a pound or more of fish a day. They brazenly dive under boats, swooping past anglers' lures. "They're an in-your-face kind of bird," explained Russell McCullough, a state fisheries biologist.
Like the birds, most of the little towns along the shore are almost entirely focused on fish. "We've got no Kodak, no Du Pont," Mr. Ditch said. "You're either a fisherman or a farmer if you're going to live here."
For 14 years, he and other guides said, the cormorant population has risen unchecked, until now tens of thousands of birds camp out each spring and summer on Little Galloo. The birds and people were bound to clash, everyone around here says.
Tensions intensified with a recent unexplained crash of the population of smallmouth bass, which was the main species fished from Henderson Harbor for generations. Sampling by state biologists over the last 22 years has revealed a precipitous drop.
Some people in the area say that some of the anger of the fishing community is misplaced, that the fishing guides should shift their business as the lake ecology shifts.
"Everything here is a kind of weird balancing act between exotic species, native species, changes in the weather, changes in tourism patterns," said Stephen Fort, senior planner for Jefferson County. "The charter captains and the whole industry just has to adapt."
But that view was nowhere to be seen at the Henchen Marina, where the docks were busy with the late afternoon rush of boats returning from a day on the water.
Diane Gamble oversaw the pumping of gas, the sale of ice and the steady flow of fishermen sticking their catch on a board studded with pegs to pose for cameras. Her grandfather had built the marina 60 years ago, and the family had seen many ebbs and surges in fishing, but the drop in the bass these days -- and the related drop in business -- was like nothing in memory, she said.
On top of the chest for bags of ice, white wooden placards painted with the names of three dozen fishing guides sat in stacks, but only a half dozen placards hung on hooks under a sign that read "Out."
Mrs. Gamble said that just a few years ago, the numbers would have been reversed, and that most guides would be out on the water on a hot, sunny day like this.
To illustrate how the drop in bass was driving away customers, Ms. Gamble pulled out an apologetic letter sent in April by a regular visitor from Clinton, N.Y., Lorne Bradbury.
"I've been in touch with my fellow fishermen, and we have decided not to fish the area as we have in the past," Mr. Bradbury wrote. "Our decision was made on the poor results of bass fishing last year and on the predictions of a poor year this year."
He wrote that he agreed with the Gambles that the growth of the cormorant colony had to be related to the troubles with smallmouths. Beneath his signature, Mr. Bradbury typed one of the mottoes of the fishing community here: "Catch a fish -- starve a cormorant."
If the cormorant population was kept in check, Mrs. Gamble said, she doubted that people would hate the birds as they do. But when fishermen have to pass through floating cordons of the birds hundreds of yards long, their frustration is hard to contain, she said.
"Nature normally takes its course," Mrs. Gamble said. "But nature's out of balance right now."
Lieut. Christopher Hanley, who is leading the criminal investigation for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said that no matter what the fishing communities felt, there was no excuse for what took place on the island.
"I've never seen anything like this," he said. "These were fledglings that could not fly away. This is a terrible crime."
The attack was discovered on July 29, when a team of state wildlife biologists and technicians visited Little Galloo Island as part of a study of the bird's eating habits. The study is intended to determine, once and for all, whether the birds are responsible for the changes in fish stocks.
This week, the same team returned to the island to resume the work, which involves picking up regurgitated balls of fish bones, then studying the material to determine the diet of the birds.
But the biologist and two assistants also spent time picking up more 12-gauge shotgun shells, which could be distinguished from old shells left behind by duck hunters because the new brass still gleamed in the sun.
They crossed a barren landscape of roughly heaped nests, weeds and dead birds. In the last 30 years, the colony grew from a few nesting pairs to more than 8,000 at its peak in 1996. The birds have transformed the island from a grassy spot that once attracted picnickers into a place of yard-high dunes of guano that feel like a spongy mat underfoot, a place where the few remaining trees stand like bleached skeletons, whitened by years of bird droppings.
The assistants, Brian Edmonds and Laura Brown, circled the island as they had once a week since April, stooping to bag the little clumps of fish bones, called "pellets."
They reached the spot where they realized that something terrible had happened a week earlier. "I found 7 freshly killed birds," Ms. Brown said. "Then 7 led to 200, and 200 more."
"Around here is where we stopped collecting pellets and started collecting evidence," Mr. Edmonds said.
Just offshore, fleets of young cormorants bobbed in the chop. They said the shooting happened at the tail end of the nesting season, so most of the birds escaped.
But hundreds did not. They passed spot after spot where dozens of birds were shot en masse and the desiccated carcasses were receding into the powdery soil, little more than black smudges of feathers and bones.
In the center of the island, several dozen surviving fledglings huddled in fuzzy groups, croaking and stumbling awkwardly on big webbed feet as the researchers approached. "You can get a sense of how easy it was," Mr. Edmonds said, referring to the shooting.
State biologists said they were sympathetic to the plight of people whose livelihoods were linked to fishing. But they said it was still too soon to conclude that the cormorants were the main problem.
A state biologist, James Farquhar, said the data from the diet study would be sifted by December, when a final report would be released and a recommendation made about whether something should be done to control the cormorant population.
"But obviously," he said, "someone couldn't wait."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Begins to See Results in Battle Against Sex Shops

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
A funereal procession of police cars crawled along a narrow street in lower Manhattan before stopping outside the storefront in question. More than a dozen police officers and city inspectors conferred on the sidewalk for a moment, then filed inside to begin a process that may become commonplace in the city of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani:
The sex-club shutdown. 
 The procedure Thursday night had a ritualistic feel, one that recalled the shuttering of burlesque shows by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in the early 1940's. Reporters and photographers who had been tipped off were kept at a distance, but not far enough to obstruct their views. Neighbors shouted their support. Then, with a police videographer recording the moment, inspectors slapped a bright orange sign onto the front door that announced the shutdown of a Walker Street establishment with the wink-wink name of Angels.
After nearly three years of court challenges, New York City has begun to enforce a zoning law specifically intended to curtail its adult-entertainment industry. And although that enforcement has generated a whole new round of court hearings that began last week, the seemingly endless litigation has done nothing to slow the city's resolve. Inspectors are dispatched every night into the shadowy world of peep booths and lap dances, diligently seeking out violations of the city zoning law.
So far, seven live-entertainment clubs have been temporarily shut down, while dozens of others are trying out ways to comply -- and still make a profit. Many more adult video and book stores, like the XXX Video Store on Reade Street in lower Manhattan, have voluntarily locked their doors and hung out signs that say: "Closed for Renovations to Meet City Ordinances -- Will Open Soon."
But with those results have come questions. Is there enough wiggle room in the language of the zoning law for some of the adult clubs to bypass its intent? Will enforcement lead to the creation of red-light districts along the fringes of struggling neighborhoods around the city? And, ultimately, does it reflect a triumph of puritanism over free expression in a city that prides itself on tolerance?
A sign of the times, perhaps, is that Norman Siegel, the ubiquitous director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, stands virtually alone as an outspoken critic of the zoning law, which he says was designed to stamp out legal activity that the Mayor finds personally offensive. He divines hope in the law's language.
"There are some confusing areas in the law because it is not that specific, intentionally so," Mr. Siegel said. "And maybe some of it will create problems for the judges, resulting in that the city won't get what it wants."
But many others, including some critics of Mr. Giuliani's, see the zoning law as a triumph for his administration. "It's a significant legislative and legal victory for City Hall and our neighborhoods," said the city's Public Advocate, Mark Green.
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch agreed. "I think it's a good thing and I commend him for it," he said.
For decades, New York City grappled with how to strike a balance between the rights of its adult-entertainment businesses and the quality-of-life expectations of its communities. By the early 1990's, the issue had risen to the fore of the public debate: depressed real-estate values had led to a proliferation of sex shops in residential areas around the city and, especially, in Times Square.
Then, in September 1994, nine months into his first administration, Mayor Giuliani proposed comprehensive zoning regulations to prohibit adult video stores, X-rated theaters and topless bars from operating within 500 feet of residences, houses of worship, schools or one another. His proposal would essentially eliminate the adult trade from Times Square, an area that was ripe for redevelopment, and banish the businesses to the city's wastelands.
"They hurt the economy of the city," the Mayor said then. "They cost us jobs. They cost us money."
The Mayor chose his words carefully. The United States Supreme Court has held that sexually explicit expressions are protected forms of free speech, as long as they are not judged to be obscene. But the courts have also allowed municipalities to use zoning laws to restrict the adult trade as long as they demonstrate "secondary impacts" that hurt the community, like increases in crime and declines in real-estate values.
And the Mayor felt confident that the city could demonstrate those secondary impacts. The Department of City Planning and its director, Joseph B. Rose, had just completed a survey of the Times Square and Chelsea sections that outlined anecdotal evidence of the harmful impact of the adult trade on neighborhoods. The report also explored the experiences of other cities -- including Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles -- in restricting adult establishments.
"That was the core of the problem," said Albert Fredericks, a former assistant corporation counsel who helped draft the law. "We had to strike a balance between dealing with a serious problem while observing the constitutional limitation and allowing some access to this kind of entertainment material."
The zoning plan was scrutinized, tinkered with and debated by community boards, the five borough presidents and various other public agencies. At a two-day public hearing, 56 of the 80 speakers opposed it; some decried the restriction on free speech, while others complained that adult entertainment would be harder to find.
Those critics complained in vain. In October 1995, the City Council overwhelmingly approved the zoning law. But before Mayor Giuliani could gloat about another triumph in his quality-of-life campaign, a series of court challenges were filed -- and eventually beaten back, including one last month before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. There were so many stages in the process that the Mayor caustically began to keep a public tally of the judges who had supported the law: 23 at last count.
Now that the adult establishments have nearly exhausted their options in appealing the law's constitutionality -- their last hope is with the United States Supreme Court -- Mr. Giuliani has become more candid in expressing his distaste for the businesses and his intention to reduce their numbers.
"I realize that you can't eliminate all of them," he said last week. "We're going to have to tolerate some. Maybe on a personal basis I would wish that we could, but I understand the Constitution of the United States. I understand that there are going to be some that end up surviving. And there has to be, in order to save the constitutionality of this program. But if there's a reduction of 20, 30, 40, 50 percent, 60 percent, that will be a good thing for the city."
But in many ways, enforcing the law in the streets of New York has proven just as challenging as defending it in court. Inspectors now find themselves mastering terminology such as "completely and opaquely concealed" and "discernibly turgid state."
The broad language of the law has also allowed for subjective interpretation by adult businesses determined to survive. At Billy's Topless on West 24th Street in Chelsea, the dancers now wear bikini tops, as well as bottoms that cover their buttocks; its owner contends that, technically, he is no longer running an adult business. Other establishments have concocted various methods -- using makeup, latex, even Saran Wrap -- to create the illusion that the breasts of performers are exposed.
Causing the greatest confusion has been the law's use of the phrase "substantial portion" in defining what makes a nightclub or video store "adult." Once the city acknowledged that "substantial" meant at least 40 percent of a store's inventory, floor space -- or some combination of both -- strip clubs and video stores scrambled to comply.
A wood-paneled courtroom with a drooping American flag in the State Supreme Court building in lower Manhattan became the stage last week for a protracted and frequently comic debate over "substantial portion" and other aspects of the law. Those three days of arguments centered on the city's plan to shut down six more establishments on the grounds that they posed an immediate threat to public safety and violated the new zoning law.
Representing the adult businesses was Herald Price Fahringer, whose white hair, crisp dark suits and soft-spoken manner lent an air of elegance to discussions about lap dancing; each time he stood up or sat down, his wooden chair creaked. Representing the city was Daniel Connolly, who called a parade of police officers to describe what they had seen during undercover explorations into the sex-club netherworld.
Apparently intimidated by the courtroom's formality, the officers sometimes hesitated to define exactly what they meant by "spent condom" and "lap dance," in which a dancer gyrates on a patron's lap. When words failed them, they would imitate the gestures of the performers.
One officer who happened upon a "transvestite night" at Angels alternately used "he" and "she" to describe the person who, he said, offered to go to a hotel with him for $200. Another officer preferred specificity in delivering a deadpan assessment of what he had seen: "The females were moving their posteriors left and right. Up and down."
At first it seemed that the city might have a hard time linking the suggestive gestures of semiclad performers to an immediate threat to public safety. "There is constant touching and contact," one of the city's lawyers explained, in arguing the dangers of a lap dance. "That is how diseases are contracted. This person goes back to his family and friends."
Judge Stephen G. Crane seemed initially skeptical and jokingly told the lawyer that if he had such a fear of disease he should avoid riding the subway. But by week's end, the testimony of solicitations inside the clubs and used condoms inside and outside the clubs had persuaded the judge to permit the temporary shutdowns of two establishments operated by a former dancer named Madeline D'Anthony: Angels and the Harmony Theater, just around the corner on Church Street.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Fahringer will succeed in arguing, among other points, that used condoms on the sidewalk do not legally constitute a zoning violation. It is also unclear whether those establishments that try to conform will still be able to make a profit. Said Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens, "The marketplace is going to begin to have an impact."
In the meantime, the move toward compliance continues. Last week, Show World, the sex emporium that looms over Times Square, ended a quarter-century of live adult performances; the "peep-a-live" performers have been let go, leaving only a few adult-video booths as remnants of its stock in trade. Its manager, Tom Simmons, said that Show World might become an arcade, or perhaps a health club.
He watched as workers piled some uprooted booths into a corner; these "confessionals," with telephone wires dangling from their sides, had once allowed patrons to watch women undress in private as they carried on intimate conversations.
Mr. Simmons said he planned to save a few of the booths. "Maybe the Whitney Museum of Art will want them someday," he said wistfully.

HEADLINE: In Europe, New Allure of Air-Conditioning

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Marco Liberali decided not to fiddle around while Rome burned. Seeking relief from Rome's tropical temperatures, the 41-year-old mechanic installed central air-conditioning in his family's apartment on the edge of the city.
"What a difference it makes," Mr. Liberali said with the assuredness of the newly converted. "Humid heat is bad for you." 
 When Americans rushed to cool their air, Europeans traditionally just slowed down and endured the summer heat. But now people like Mr. Liberali, who got to know air-conditioning at the hotel where he works, have decided to stop going without.
Indeed, Europe is becoming a big market for the air-conditioning industry. Sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses have grown more than 20 percent over the last three years, even as they stayed flat in the United States, and the growth shows no sign of abating.
In Europe, sales of air-conditioners for homes and small businesses, including central air units for homes, are expected to reach $3.2 billion this year, from $2.5 billion in 1996. In the United States, they are expected only to inch up to $7.74 billion, from $7.73 billion in 1996.
Credit some of the growth to the pressures of a global economy, which are increasingly forcing Europeans to work summers. Air pollution is also bolstering the demand for air-conditioning, and Europeans are becoming more accustomed to it in offices and their cars, and increasingly want it in their homes.
But environmentalists are concerned. Air-conditioners consume a significant amount of energy, and their emissions help deplete the ozone layer.
To be sure, many hurdles must fall before Europe can fully indulge its new fondness for the big chill. Both electricity and air-conditioners are costly, many homes lack proper wiring, home power supplies are often weak and many Europeans view air-conditioning as unhealthy: there is simply a bias to rely on nature.
Still, the trend toward a cooler Europe is clear.
"Above all in the whole area of small businesses and homes, the use of air-conditioning is increasing," said Alfred Voss, director of the Institute for Energy Use and Rational Use of Energy at Stuttgart University.
But Europe has a long way to go before air-conditioning becomes the norm in homes. In Italy, 7 percent of homes are air-conditioned, and in Spain 11 percent, compared with 71 percent in the United States and more than 90 percent in Japan.
Hotels, post offices, police stations, even hospitals, except for operating rooms, generally do not have air-conditioning.
So it is hardly surprising that the world's biggest air-conditioner makers -- Japanese giants like Mitsubishi and Daikin Industries, and American leaders like the Carrier Corporation, a unit of United Technologies, and the Trane Company, a unit of American Standard -- view Europe as a potential El Dorado. European companies, like Riello and De Longhi in Italy, are jockeying to catch up.
"The culture of air-conditioning is spreading," said Carlo Segato, head of marketing at De Longhi, a specialist in portable and room air-conditioners.
But as temperatures climbed over Italy this summer, the country's Green Party, echoing warnings from environmentalists across Europe, argued that air-conditioners, while cooling the inside of homes, forced out warm air, raising temperatures outside. Moreover, they argued, more air-conditioners mean more ozone-depleting gases in the atmosphere, which contribute to global warming. "Turning on your air-conditioner today," said Fulco Pratesi, a Green Party spokesman in Rome, "means suffering more from the heat tomorrow."
The European air-conditioning market did not arrive overnight. It was created after World War II by the companies that pioneered the technology in the United States, including Carrier and the York International Corporation.
In the 1980's the Japanese arrived. Mitsubishi has a factory in Scotland, Daikin has one in Belgium and Toshiba has one in Britain. And the Japanese got a leg up by introducing small, quiet portables and wall models suited to small European dwellings. The Americans responded quickly. Carrier bought local manufacturers in Spain and Italy and redesigned its products to meet European demands.
European companies, for their part, took a chapter from the Japanese and copied Japanese models. The Italians introduced snappy new models at competitive prices.
De Longhi, long a maker of room heaters, began importing Toshiba air-conditioners in 1988, then built its own, and its engineers now use refrigerants that do not damage the atmosphere, including a butane mixture similar to lighter fluid.
Air-conditioning makers must scramble to find economical substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, gases traditionally used as refrigerants, which were banned by the Montreal Protocol, a 1987 treaty signed by more than 150 countries, because they deplete the earth's ozone layer.
Subsequent accords banned the production of the interim substitute, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, after 2020.
Europe's industry is under particular pressure because Germany, Italy and Sweden, heeding environmentalists, want these gases gone by 2000. When a company in eastern Germany first produced refrigerators using butane in 1992, Greenpeace bought the first 10 prototypes.
But substitutes are expensive. Sergio Zanolin, De Longhi's head of research, said butane air-conditioners cost 10 percent to 20 percent more than conventional models. While Americans can trundle down to a Home Depot and pick up a window unit for about $200, the least expensive room models in Europe sell for almost $1,000 because of low production runs and expensive components.
This year De Longhi expects to sell about $165 million worth of air-conditioners and has even carved out a niche in the United States. In part, sales received a boost in Europe from air-conditioning's use as a marketing tool by stores, shopping centers and professional offices of dentists and lawyers.
"The last five years have seen a revolution in light commercial use," said Halsey Cook, Carrier's head of marketing in Europe.
When automobile air-conditioning caught on in the early 1990's, it was largely thanks to stagnant auto sales, which prompted car makers to offer air-conditioners to attract buyers. Five years ago, hardly any European cars were air-conditioned; now, 28 percent are.
That may be peanuts compared with the United States, where 95 percent of cars are air-conditioned, but the market continues to grow.
"It's getting started, people are buying it, and the technology now allows it," said Sandro Frigerio, who follows the auto air-conditioning market at Standard & Poor's DRI in London. He said innovation and miniaturization now enabled auto makers to cool small European cars without significant power loss or higher gas consumption.
And as Europeans grow fond of air-conditioning in cars and dentists' offices, more want it at home.
Not that sales have exploded. "The domestic market is really on the edge of a boom," said Jacques Benoist, director of certification at Eurovent, an industry association established recently in Paris to certify air-conditioning equipment. "But it didn't happen yet."
And there are many reasons.
The first, of course, is price, which is compounded by energy problems. In some countries, like Italy, sufficient electricity is scarce. Typical Italian homes are equipped with smaller circuit breakers than new American homes. In Italy, a separate circuit for air-conditioning costs as much as $400.
Partly, Europe's reluctance can be traced to the relatively mild climate, with little of the tropical heat that assaults cities like Houston or Miami. Yet temperatures in Granada, Spain, or Palermo, Sicily, can easily surpass those in New York. Thus, some experts also point to a tendency for Europeans to favor nature over technology.
"When they design a building, they take greater advantage of natural lighting and ventilation," said Bruce Anderson, head of marketing in Europe for Trane, based in Tyler, Tex. "So owners will say, 'There's no reason to have air-conditioning.' "
Such reluctance is bolstered by a conviction that air-conditioning is unhealthy.
Italian newspapers, which regularly advise readers how to deal with the heat, warn against it. The weekly health insert of La Repubblica in Rome recently warned readers that air-conditioning could cause colds and sore throats and spread "germs, viruses and bacteria" through unclean filters.
In the United States, many experts argue the opposite. In the recent heat wave, more than 120 deaths were attributed to the heat. Indeed, some European doctors increasingly recommend air-conditioning for the elderly and for people with heart trouble and respiratory ailments.
In response, European manufacturers have developed quieter and more efficient models. And increased production, economies of scale and cheap foreign imports will cut prices. In television ads, Italian importers offer cheap Chinese air-conditioners free to viewers who order mattresses.
Moreover, as Europe deregulates the energy market, electricity supplies are expected to rise, thus reducing the cost. In France the national utility, Electricite de France, offers bonuses to builders who install energy-efficient heat pumps, which warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. Italy's national utility, Enel, now penalizes energy use by charging higher rates as more power is consumed. "Ten to 15 years ago, we had power shortages," said Roberto Formigoni, Enel's marketing director. "Now we have lots to sell." So Enel is petitioning Rome's energy authority to cut rates and increase the supply for homes.
Antonietta Marconi, marketing director of GMC Climatizzatori, where Mr. Liberali bought his equipment, says it cannot happen too soon.
"I've been in the air-conditioning business for six years, and prices will fall," she said. "It will become like central heating."
Professor Voss, of Stuttgart University, agrees. "With energy prices coming down, I think it's safe to say the tendency will be for demand for appliances like air-conditioners to continue to grow," he said.

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT LAGS IN STEPS TO WIDEN HEALTH COVERAGE

SERIES: AFTER THE REVOLUTION: The Uninsured

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
In 1994, when President Clinton's effort to reshape the American health care system collapsed, a political consensus emerged from the rubble: in the future, any such changes should be made piecemeal, one step at a time.
But four years later, the limits of that incremental approach are becoming clear, in the view of many experts. Most immediately, Congress is confronting demands to provide broad new consumer protections for patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care. Lawmakers also face a deeper, more intractable problem. Despite the passage of several laws intended to expand coverage step by step, the number of Americans without insurance has risen steadily, by an average of one million a year. 
 The number of uninsured has increased each year since 1987 and now exceeds 41 million, roughly one-sixth of the population.
Moreover, this steady rise has occurred despite a remarkable economic boom. The nation has created more than 14 million jobs since 1993, but most of these are in small businesses, which are far less likely to provide health insurance than are large companies.
In Congress, members of both parties keep returning to the problems of the uninsured, but the cost and complexity of the issue pose extraordinary hurdles. Lawmakers say they are determined not to repeat the mistakes that killed Mr. Clinton's plan, but beyond that, there is little agreement.
Congress has enacted two significant health care laws since the collapse of the Clinton plan. It created a new program to finance health care for low-income children last year. And in 1996 it passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, to make insurance more readily available to millions of people who change their jobs or lose them.
These efforts, along with previous expansions of the Medicaid program, have made a difference; without them, experts say, the number of uninsured would be even higher.
But there have been problems:
*Federal and state officials say that insurance companies have found ways to skirt the Kassebaum-Kennedy law by shunning people with medical problems or by charging them very high premiums. The law does not limit what insurers can charge.
*Sweeping changes in Federal welfare policy may inadvertently increase the number of uninsured children, offsetting some of the expected gains in coverage from the new Children's Health Insurance Program.
*The Government has struggled to carry out its duties under the new laws. Federal officials had assumed that states would quickly adopt the standards established by the Kassebaum-Kennedy law, but that has not happened in California and four other states. In such states, the Federal Government is supposed to enforce the law directly, but the Clinton Administration acknowledges it was unprepared for this immense new responsibility.
So, while officials grapple with these problems, the number of uninsured keeps growing.
 
The Workers
Patchwork System For the Uninsured
Neither the new laws nor the power of a fiercely competitive medical marketplace has delivered health insurance to Mildred Davis, a custodian and security guard in Austin, Tex.
"I have no health insurance, no dental plan," Ms. Davis said as she sat at the front desk of the community health center where she works. "When you walk into a doctor's office, the first thing they say is: 'How will you pay? What insurance do you have?' I have to go to the bank before I go to the doctor."
Like many people who are uninsured, she deferred doctors' visits and medical care until she had a serious need.
As a result, said Ms. Davis, who is 48, she had an emergency hysterectomy in January after several weeks of uterine bleeding. She received a hospital bill for $8,000 and a doctor's bill for $2,000.
"I would have gotten care earlier if I had had health insurance," she said. Instead, she waited until the pain became unbearable.
"I would get up to patrol this area," Ms. Davis said, pointing to the corridors of the health center. "The pain was so bad that I'd fall over. I lost four and a half pints of blood. I was literally bleeding to death."
Ms. Davis's case highlights the patchwork nature of the current insurance system and illustrates what can happen to uninsured people when they become ill. Even if parents have coverage through their employers, their children may be uninsured. (Many companies have cut back benefits for dependents.) Conversely, many children covered by Medicaid, the Federal-state program for low-income people, have parents who are uninsured because Medicaid's eligibility rules are much more generous for children than they are for adults.
Ms. Davis said that her 7-year-old daughter was covered by Medicaid.But Ms. Davis herself, like many of the uninsured, was caught in between. Her income was too high for her to qualify for Medicaid, and she could not afford private insurance. Ms. Davis says she hopes to get health insurance later this year when she becomes a full-time city employee.
The Medicaid eligibility rules are devilishly complex. They differ from state to state, and family income limits vary with a child's age. So a healthy 4-year-old boy may be protected by Medicaid, while his 8-year-old sister, though severely ill, is ineligible for coverage because the income limit for her age group is lower.
The plight of the uninsured may seem distant to members of the middle class riding the current economic boom. People are less anxious about losing their jobs and their benefits than they were in the recession of the early 1990's. "Health security" was the buzzword then, just as "patients' rights" is now.
But William S. Custer, an economist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said: "The problems that the Clinton health plan was intended to address have not gone away and may worsen in the future. If the economy slows or if health costs rise much faster than prices in general, we'll probably see more rapid growth in the number of Americans without health insurance."
 
The Cost
Opting for Pay Over Insurance
Today, as in the early 1990's, the cost of coverage is crucial. Paradoxically, the Public Health Service says, the number of workers offered health insurance by their employers has increased in the last decade, but the proportion of workers who accept such offers has declined, in part because of the cost.
Philip F. Cooper and Barbara S. Schone, economists at the Federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, found large declines in the proportion of people accepting employer-sponsored insurance among two groups: workers with low wages (less than $7 an hour) and workers younger than 25.
They estimate that six million workers are offered health insurance by their employers or their unions but do not take it.
Rita J. Carrillo, 26, works 30 to 40 hours a week as a customer service representative for a company that schedules repairs for Frigidaire appliances in Texas. The company offers health insurance, she said, but "for me as a single mother, it's too expensive to afford."
Ms. Carrillo explained: "My paycheck after taxes is $350 to $400 every two weeks. For health insurance, they would deduct $60 from each paycheck. I would be left with $290, which is not a lot to deal with. If I could afford the insurance, I would take the children to the doctor more often. Lucky for me, they are healthy children."
Nationwide, about half of all uninsured workers are either self-employed or working in businesses that have fewer than 25 employees. When coverage is available in such companies, the employees are often required to pay a large share of the cost.
Small businesses give many reasons for not providing insurance to their employees. They say that premiums are too high, that their profits are too uncertain for them to make a commitment to insurance and that health benefits are not always a high priority for workers.
Sal Z. Valiani, who operates four dry-cleaning shops in Austin, said that he offered health insurance long ago and even paid half the cost. But, he said, employees repeatedly asked him not to deduct their share of the premiums from their wages.
"It's one or the other, a pay raise or health benefits," Mr. Valiani said, and in the eyes of many employees, higher wages are considered more important.
 
The Laws
Guarantees Prove Not to Be Foolproof
None of the measures passed by Congress in the last few years raised higher hopes than the 1996 law to guarantee health insurance for people who change jobs or lose jobs. The law is known by the names of its authors, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Kansas Republican who retired from the Senate last year.
In signing the legislation, President Clinton said, "It seals the cracks that swallow as many as 25 million Americans who can't get insurance or who fear they'll lose it."
The Kassebaum-Kennedy law guarantees that people losing group health insurance will have access to coverage in the individual insurance market, regardless of pre-existing medical problems, but it does not limit how much they may be charged. The law generally guarantees that people moving from one job to another will be promptly eligible for coverage if the new employer provides health benefits.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said recently that the law was not working as intended. People who exercised their rights under the law were often charged premiums far higher than the standard rates. Deborah J. Chollet, vice president of the Alpha Center, a health policy research institute in Washington, said the cost of such insurance -- $10,000 to $15,000 a year, or more -- "has to be prohibitive to most people."
One insurer, American Medical Security of Green Bay, Wis., said it reserved the right to charge high-risk individuals five times the rates charged to healthy people.
Dr. Gary F. Krieger, a pediatrician who is speaker of the California Medical Association, was more blunt. "The promise of the Kassebaum-Kennedy law has proved to be a sham," he said. "Insurers are dumping patients by simply charging premiums much higher than what the patients paid when they were part of their employer plans."
President Clinton has denounced such behavior, and he says the Government will no longer do business with insurers that flout the law. But whether he can use it as a lever to increase the number of people with insurance remains to be seen. For the Kassebaum-Kennedy law does not guarantee coverage for people who want to buy insurance as individuals and have never had group coverage. And conservative Republicans say they do not want to use the law as a vehicle or precedent for more Federal regulation of private health insurance.
There are some problems, as well, in the other major initiative to expand coverage: the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides almost $24 billion over five years to finance coverage for some of the nation's 10 million uninsured children.
Many experts fear that unrelated changes in welfare policy made by the Federal Government and the states in the last few years may have the opposite effect -- inadvertently increasing the number of uninsured children. The new welfare laws impose time limits and other restrictions on welfare benefits.
Children are often still eligible for Medicaid after they lose cash assistance, but their Medicaid coverage may be interrupted or lost. Many parents do not know that their children still qualify for Medicaid, and state officials do not always check such families to assess their eligibility.
Marilyn R. Ellwood, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research in Cambridge, Mass., said, "States have tried to keep Medicaid open to those losing welfare benefits, but the number of people on Medicaid has still dropped."
The number of people on the Federal welfare rolls has dropped by 5.2 million, or 37 percent, since January 1993, to 8.9 million in March of this year.
"Falling welfare caseloads are leading to unexpected declines in Medicaid enrollment," even though many states have slightly expanded eligibility for Medicaid, Ms. Ellwood said.
President Clinton has repeatedly expressed dismay that many children who are eligible for Medicaid are not enrolled. In January, Federal officials estimated the number of such children at three million. In May, after more rigorous studies that included older children, the Government suggested a much higher figure: 4.7 million.
Adults who leave welfare often get low-wage jobs in small businesses, the type of employment least likely to offer health benefits.
 
The Solutions
No Consensus On How to Proceed
 Lawmakers say they keep looking for ways to expand coverage, but there are sharp divisions over how to do it. Republicans are philosophically opposed to price controls, which play a role in some schemes to expand coverage, and few Democrats openly advocate such regulation. Some liberal Democrats continue to push legislation that would require employers to provide coverage, but such mandates are anathema to conservatives in both parties.
Federal lawmakers in general are reluctant to dictate programs to the states. And they say they cannot find the money for the subsidies that would be needed to make insurance truly affordable to millions of low-income Americans. As a result, the plight of the uninsured appears to be a low political priority in the current Congress, much to the frustration of their advocates.
Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota and a potential Presidential contender, says: "Here we are at peak economic performance, and we are being told that we cannot provide health coverage for everyone. If not now, when?"
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, want to create tax breaks to help people buy private insurance. Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Commerce Committee, wants to create "health marts" to offer insurance to self-employed people and businesses with fewer than 500 employees.
Senator Kennedy has introduced a bill that would require employers with 50 or more employees to offer insurance to their workers and to pay at least 72 percent of the premiums.
"Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage and to obey the child labor laws," Mr. Kennedy said. "It is long past time for businesses to contribute to the cost of basic health insurance coverage for their workers. There can be no excuse for large firms to shirk their responsibility."
And Senator Wellstone recently introduced a bill that would give states large sums of Federal money to help achieve the goal of universal insurance coverage.
Proposals like those from Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Wellstone stir little interest in a Congress controlled by Republicans, who are viscerally opposed to any new mandates on employers.
Republicans say such mandates will not work in a voluntary employer-sponsored health insurance system. There is, they say, strong evidence that employers will drop coverage (especially for workers' dependents), curtail benefits or shift costs to employees if the Government imposes new requirements. And in interviews, uninsured workers say that, while they yearn for coverage, they are very sensitive to the cost. They often pass up the offer of health insurance if it will take a noticeable amount from their paychecks.
But concern for the uninsured will not die. The Health Insurance Association of America, which helped kill President Clinton's proposals with its "Harry and Louise" commercials in 1994, is now seeking ways to extend private coverage to the uninsured.
"Newspapers, television and radio news reports may no longer focus on the plight of the uninsured as they did in 1993 and 1994," said Donald M. Peterson, who is chairman of the association and of the Trustmark Insurance Company in Lake Forest, Ill. "But for millions of Americans, the lack of affordable coverage remains a crisis."
Insurers worry that if the erosion of private employer-sponsored insurance continues, consumers will demand new Government programs, to which the industry is opposed.
Drew E. Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which has done many studies of the uninsured, said: "This is the biggest problem we face in American health care, and it's not on the political agenda. There's no significant solution on the horizon. The country doesn't want to put up the tens of billions of dollars it would take to provide coverage for the uninsured. We have been making some progress with the small incremental reforms, but it's like shoveling sand against the tide."
 
After the Revolution
 
This series looks at changes in the nation's health care system. The first article described the effects of the changes on doctors; a future article will examine the problems of managed care.

Charts/Graphs: "AT A GLANCE: The Growing Ranks Without Coverage . . ."
As the population grows, the ranks of the uninsured grow faster. The graph shows the percentage of Americans who are uninsured since 1987.
Some employers are cutting back health coverage, especially for dependents, so the proportion of Americans with employer-sponsored health coverage has declined. The graph shows the percentage of non-elderly Americans who have employment-based insurance, and the percentage of children who have employment-based insurance since 1987.

INTERNATIONAL 3-17
 
Investigations Begin At African Bombing Sites
Israeli soldiers took over efforts to rescue people still trapped under tons of rubble from a terrorist attack on the United States Embassy in Nairobi, as American medical teams and F.B.I. agents arrived to investigate bomb attacks there and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 140 people were killed in what appeared to be coordinated bombings against American targets. 1
 
President Clinton said that the United States would not buckle under to the threat of international terrorism as American personnel were arriving in East Africa to help victims and launch an investigation into the embassy bombings. 11 

Floods Threaten China Cities
Chinese officials said that the nation's worst flooding in 40 years threatens to overwhelm several large cities in the central part of the nation. State news organizations reported that the army is evacuating more than half a million people from an area in Hubei Province where they may have to take emergency measures to divert water that endangers larger cities downstream. 1
 
Conditions Worsen in Kosovo
A United Nations official said that ethnic Albanian refugees driven from Kosovo have little protection against disease and starvation, estimating that half the refugee children are dehydrated and suffering from effects of malnutrition. Refugee officials said they were unprepared for the crisis. 12
 
Congo Army Recruits Troops
The Government of Congo launched a recruitment drive, aimed at enlisting unemployed youths into the country's armed forces to defend against a week-old anti-Government rebellion. The Government rounded up members of an ethnic group believed to be allied with the rebellion. 9
 
Calm Anniversary in Myanmar
The 10th anniversary of a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators passed quietly without the violence many had feared, but also without any sign of a resolution of Myanmar's deepening problems. 8
 
NATIONAL 18-26
 
Gaps in Health Insurance Continue to Grow
Congress is confronting demands to provide broad new consumer protections for patients fed up with the restrictions of managed care. Lawmakers also face a deeper, more intractable problem. Despite the passage of several laws intended to expand coverage step by step, the number of Americans without insurance has risen steadily, by an average of one million a year. 1
 
Reliving the Pain
People in Jonesboro, Ark., a diverse college, manufacturing and farming town of 50,000, have a sense of hopelessness going into the adjudication hearing, the juvenile court equivalent of a trial, of two boys accused in the schoolyard killings. There seems to be little drama over the outcome, only a malaise as the people hurt most prepare for a fresher pain as the day of March 24 is replayed in the courtroom. 18
 
Prison Population Booming
The nation's prison population grew by 5.2 percent in 1997, according to the Justice Department, even though crime has been declining for six straight years, suggesting that the imprisonment boom has developed a built-in growth dynamic independent of the crime rate, experts say. 18
 
The DNA Question
As F.B.I. scientists conduct tests on one of Monica S. Lewinsky's dresses, trying to determine whether it contains physical evidence of a sexual encounter with President Clinton, they are employing a science that, though still sharply debated in court, is considered highly reliable and capable of answering a number of questions with remarkable speed and accuracy. 24
 
G.M. Changes Its Ways
Three initiatives by General Motors, all of which were expected at some point but not all together last week, are significant because they would change the way G.M. has done business since the 1920's. 26
 
NEW YORK 29-35
 
Controversy Over Cormorants
When nearly 1,000 double-crested cormorants were found shot dead on an island in eastern Lake Ontario last week, Federal wildlife officials labeled the incident "a brazen act of environmental terrorism." But around the hamlet of Henderson Harbor, in upstate New York, where nearly everyone makes a living indirectly or directly from sport fishing, the incident was likened to the Boston Tea Party, and the shooters , who have not been identified, were hailed as heroes. 29
 
Questions on Sex Shop Zoning
So far, New York City has temporarily shut down seven live-entertainment clubs under new zoning laws restricting sex shops, while dozens of others are trying out ways to comply -- and still make a profit. But with those results come questions. Is there enough wiggle room in the language of the zoning law for some of the adult clubs to bypass its intent? Will enforcement lead to the creation of red-light districts along the fringes of struggling neighborhoods around the city? And, ultimately, does it reflect a triumph of Puritanism over free expression in a city that prides itself on tolerance? 29

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE WOUNDED;
3 Victims In Kenya Airlifted To Pretoria

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, Aug. 8

 BODY:
After a confusing scene at the Nairobi, Kenya, airport this morning, three wounded employees of the United States Embassy in Kenya were flown here aboard a South African military airplane as other bombing victims awaited medical approval to be transported.
Upon arrival in Pretoria, the two men and a woman were rushed to a military hospital. A member of the hospital's medical staff reported that the woman, identified as Mary Robinson, an administrative attache at the embassy in Nairobi, suffered a broken jaw and a broken bone in her left hand. 
 She told The Associated Press that she had heard what sounded like gunfire and ran from her office.
"We went out into the corridor," she said. "Then we heard this boom, and that's all I remember until I woke up in the hospital."
One of the wounded men, who declined to give his name, was wearing a bandage covering a four-inch laceration on his head and was accompanied by his wife. "The blast was enormous," he said. "I have no idea what happened to my colleagues. It was terrible. There was absolute chaos. But I'm alive, and I'm very grateful for that."
The South African jet had been equipped to carry up to 60 casualties. But as the wounded were brought from local hospitals to Nairobi airport, a doctor on board the South African airplane said American officials had decided that only patients in stable condition could be evacuated. It was unclear how many of the wounded made it to the airport.
Dr. Dawie Roux described a mixture of chaos and order at Nairobi.
"The situation at Nairobi airport was calm and quiet, except for the operations rooms where United States officials were trying to sort out where the injured should go," Dr. Roux said. "They were still trying sort out the injuries on the ground, and didn't want to change their plans about where the injured should go."
A German airplane arrived in Nairobi shortly after the South African jet, indicating that another airlift was expected, Dr. Roux said. Bruce Wharton, press and information officer for the United States Information Service, declined to identify the three embassy workers brought to Pretoria pending notification of their families. Mr. Wharton said two of the injured worked in the foreign commercial service, and the third in the economics section.
A spokesman at the South African military hospital said the three victims would be kept at the hospital for three days. "They have minor injuries, mostly lacerations from the blast, but the major factor is shock," the spokesman said.
Robert Pringle, deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Pretoria, said that within an hour of the Nairobi blast his consulate had spoken with the South African air force about the need for clearance for relief aircraft.
The embassy, which he said had "well-oiled channels of communication with the South African Defense Force" had hired a private commercial airplane that was on its way to Nairobi when the offer came from the South African air force. Mr. Pringle said cost was not discussed.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE AMERICAN DEAD;
For Victims' Kin, Sudden Bad News Comes From Afar

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

 BODY:
The Friday mail brought a flimsy letter from Africa to the home of Delbert and Mary Olds in Panama City, Fla. It was from their daughter, Sherry, and inside the envelope was a Post-It sticker. It read, "Will E-mail you soon."
By Friday evening, two Air Force officers arrived with another letter. It informed the family that Sherry Lynn Olds, a senior master sergeant with the Air Force, had died earlier in the day after a terrorist bomb exploded outside the United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. 
 "She was a beautiful girl," said Pat Casey, the victim's aunt, who spoke for the parents. "She was very special to her parents. It is a devastating loss to them."
For the families of the victims in various parts of the country, there was no good way to learn the bad news. The phone rang before sunrise at Bonnie Hobson's home in Lamar, Mo. Her son, Sgt. Kenneth R. Hobson, Jr., 27, had been killed. Her daughter-in-law, Debbie, was calling from Nairobi, sobbing uncontrollably.
"He's gone," she said.
It was the telephone call that did not come that worried friends and relatives of Molly Huckaby Hardy, 51, a State Department employee from Valdosta, Ga. They had seen the bombings on television. "When we hadn't heard from her, we knew something had happened," said Marsha Bates, a childhood friend of Ms. Hardy's. "If she could have crawled to a phone, she would have let us know she was O.K.."
The American death toll was not yet clear, but by last night, the State Department had identified five of the victims. They are Master Sergeant Olds; Sergeant Hobson; Ms. Hardy; Sgt. Jesse N. Aliganga, 21, a marine from Tallahassee, Fla., and Arlene Kirk, 50, a Defense Department budget officer who had just returned to Nairobi from home leave in South Bend, Ind.
The State Department also released the names of four other Americans killed: Prabhi Kavaler and Michelle O'Connor of the General Services office; Tom Shah, an employee of the political section, and Jean Dalizu, an employee of the Defense Attache's office. The Associated Press added two more: Jay Bartley, whose father, Counsul General Julian Bartley, is reported to be missing, and Louise Martin of Atlanta, an employe of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Ms. Martin, 45, worked for the health agency in Kenya with her husband, Douglas Klaucke.
Susan Bryson of Lawrenceville, Ga., said of Ms. Martin, her sister: "I still don't believe it's real. She died in a country she loved. She died doing the things she liked."
Ms. Kirk and her husband, Robert, 50, a project development officer for the United States Agency for International Development, had planned to extend their stay at home for several days, said Ms. Kirk's sister, Katherine Wright, from South Bend.
But Ms. Kirk worried that her bosses wanted her back to work sooner, her sister said, so the couple and their 14-year-old son, Robbie Jr., flew back, arriving in Nairobi early Friday morning. "They were both exhausted," Ms. Wright said. "She went home and then was rushing to get to work. She went to work late. We think she went into work just before the bomb went off."
During her six weeks in South Bend, Ms. Kirk cared for her elderly parents, Frederick Arthur, 84, and Mary, 83. "She was busy trying to get them enrolled in some exercise classes," said Ms. Wright. "She took them to the doctor. Their health is not that great."
The youngest of six children, Ms. Kirk met her husband at Indiana University. After graduating from Indiana University business school, they went to South Africa, where Mr. Kirk taught democratic principles to township mayors. During the next 25 years, they worked for the Federal Government in various positions in Botswana and Egypt and, for the last three years, in Nairobi.
The couple lost a young daughter, Kamilah, to cancer in 1992. Their oldest child, Maisha, 23, attends Tuskegee University in Alabama. Family members said the couple planned to move back to the United States next year. "It's a bitter pill to swallow," Ms. Wright said.
After a State Department career that spanned more than two decades, including posts in Brazil and Laos, Ms. Hardy had told friends and family that she also planned to return to the United States, possibly next June, to work as an instructor for State Department employees. Her childhood friend, Ms. Bates, described a woman who loved the adventure of her job. Her family had recently received letters and photographs of her remodeled home in Africa.
"She just loved being there, I think," Ms. Bates said. "She found it a beautiful place. Molly was fun-loving, just great -- an intellectual that everybody liked."
While working in Laos in 1973, Ms. Hardy became pregnant, Ms. Bates said. Like other civilian employees, she was ordered to evacuate, and her only child, Brandi Plant, was later born in Washington. Ms. Hardy and her former husband were later divorced. Her last visit to Valdosta had come in April 1997 to attend the funeral of her sister, who had died in an auto accident.
Several months ago, Ms. Hardy apparently had a potential brush with danger. "A plane went down in South Africa that Molly was supposed to have been on," said Ms. Bates, noting that Ms. Hardy ended up catching a different flight.
While riding on the second flight, Ms. Hardy called to tell her mother and daughter not to worry. When a similar call did not come on Friday, her family feared for the worst.
Sergeant Olds had returned to Nairobi in June after spending two months in Birmingham, Ala., taking courses to qualify for a promotion to chief master sergeant. Her aunt, Ms. Casey, said Sergeant Olds passed the test and was expected to receive her promotion in a few months.
Sergeant Olds had joined the Air Force out of high school, following the footsteps of her father, who is now a retired civil servant. Ms. Casey described her niece as a "free spirit" who had also served in Saudi Arabia.
During her coursework in Alabama, Sergeant Olds also spent a week with her family in Panama City, engaging in her favorite hobby. "Shopping," said her aunt with a laugh. "That sounds very strange, but that was her favorite pastime."
On one shopping spree, Sergeant Olds purchased boxes of corn meal and grits -- the ingredients of some of her favorite Southern dishes -- and mailed them to her address in Nairobi. She often sent her family presents of African jewelry, amber and carved wooden games.
Like Sergeant Olds, Sergeant Hobson joined the military as a ticket to see the world. "He knew there was more to life out there, and he was determined to see it," said his mother.
Growing up in a modest blue house behind a sturdy maple tree, he was known as a talented and popular boy. He loved to debate world affairs and play tennis, act in school plays, go hiking, cook gourmet meals and paint.
Sergeant Hobson, the son of a Vietnam veteran, dreamed of retiring from the Army at age 37, attending culinary school and then opening a bed and breakfast, his mother said.
"He had a lot of dreams," his mother said. "And if he had lived, he would have fulfilled every one of them."

The No. 1 Gun Dealer

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

 BODY:
The United States has kept its title as the world's biggest arms merchant, but Russia and France are poised to overtake it, the Congressional Research Service reported. 
 The United States has led the world arms trade for seven straight years. It sold $15.2 billion worth of weapons to other nations last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms market. That shrinkage has a number of causes: the end of the cold war, the end of a splurge of weapons purchases after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the economic crisis in Asia and the long slump in crude oil prices, which has helped slow arms purchases by Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations.
Nonetheless, the world remains awash in arms. Developing nations alone have bought $172 billion worth in the 1990's.

HEADLINE: GURU: Bash;
The Man to Call To Get Your Dog Past a Co-op Board

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH HAYT 

 BODY:
HE has cured a springer spaniel of what he diagnosed as "rage without reason." He has helped a Great Dane overcome sibling rivalry after the birth of its owners' first baby. At the moment, he is ministering to a bulldog with a compulsive appetite for its master's Gucci belts and Hermes bags.
Bashkim Dibra, a dog trainer who has such a cult following among Manhattan pet owners that he is known simply as Bash, like a rock star, charges $200 an hour to go to your apartment and bang on pots to quiet your barking schnauzer. 
 His clients have included Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Ronald O. Perelman, Linda Wachner and Henry A. Kissinger. He's the "top dog" of trainers, said Georgette Mosbacher, the society figure.
Bash said: "Everything I do, I think of the dog's point of view. I actually think like a dog."
He said that it usually takes six to eight lessons for him to "city train" a pet on a leash, and another seven lessons to "country train" it off the leash. Given the life styles of many of his clients, a "town and country" dog, as he calls it, is a must.
In April, Bash flew to Paris for an emergency visit to a Jack Russell terrier that had forgotten its table manners. Although the dog had been trained to lie quietly under outdoor restaurant tables along Madison Avenue, once away from home, it lunged at other dogs. Bash spent two days going from bistro to bistro, teaching the dog to nibble baguette crumbs peacefully off the cobblestones at its owner's feet.
"Bash is as much a dog psychiatrist as a trainer," said Victoria Newhouse, the wife of S. I. Newhouse Jr., the owner of Conde Nast Publications.
"My dog, Nero, at 12, started to withdraw," she said. "Bash came up with the idea of teaching him a new trick every year. It would revitalize him. The challenge of learning something new made it not true that you can't teach an old dog new tricks."
Bash, who is 46 and was born in Albania, has accompanied dogs to their owners' interviews with co-op boards on the Upper East Side. While the people try to prove their own good breeding, Bash shows off the dogs'. After one such appearance at 1185 Park Avenue, he said, a board member told him, "I wish the kids who lived here could be so well mannered."
Bash and his family came to America in 1963, settling in Riverdale in the Bronx. Bash is still based there, operating his private training service through Fieldston Pets, a grooming and pet supply shop owned by his sister, Mereut. He has a degree in animal behavior from City University and is the author of "Dog Training by Bash" (Dutton, 1991), now in its eighth printing, and "Teach Your Dog to Behave" (Dutton, 1993).
In 1975, he was hired to train and domesticate a wolf pup for a television movie, "A Boy Who Cried Wolf." He named the pup Mariah. "This was my greatest teacher, the rearing and training of her," Bash said. "The wolf is the ancestor of the dog. It's the primal part of the dog that exists. It gave me insight into the mind of the dog."
When he is not making house calls (all of his lessons are private), Bash is a big kahuna on the pet charity circuit. In 1992 he started the Dog Walk, to benefit shelter programs sponsored by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and in 1993 he created Paws for Cause, a dog walk for the American Cancer Society to promote awareness that animals can also get cancer. He has been on the board of the Delta Society, which brings dogs together with people with disabilities. Earlier this year he created Canine Court in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the first dog playground in the city. And he is creating Starpet.com, an on-line animal talent agency for advertising and entertainment.
With an average of 50 clients a week, Bash logs 14-hour days, but he doesn't mind the schedule. "I'm a good barometer of the economy," he said. "There's a new wealth of people -- young Wall Street people living in Scarsdale, Greenwich, Pound Ridge. It's hot to have a dog trainer, just like it's hot to have a personal trainer. I'm like the dog's personal trainer."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 15, 1998, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Sunday Styles this week about Bashkim Dibra, a dog trainer whose clients have included many celebrities, misstated his role in Paws for Cause, a fund-raising event for the American Cancer Society. Mr. Dibra did not create the event; he was one of several people who first organized and ran it. The article also misstated the event's first year. It was 1992, not 1993.

HEADLINE: Boeing Chairman Sees Jet Output Peaking in'99

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The Boeing Company's jetliner production will peak next year and will drop by 10 percent or more in 2000, according to the company's chairman, Philip M. Condit.
After that, how rapidly demand for aircraft will decline depends primarily on the health of economies in Asia, one of Boeing's key markets, Mr. Condit said in an article published today in The Seattle Times. 
 Mr. Condit, once hailed as the man to lead Boeing into the 21st century, is trying to quash rumors he may lose his job. He was interviewed along with Boeing's president, Harry C. Stonecipher, on the first anniversary of Boeing's merger with McDonnell Douglas, where Mr. Stonecipher had been chief executive.
A year ago, Boeing's shareholders were smiling and its plants were humming as the company worked to more than double jetliner production. But Boeing's rapid production increase, combined with problems in bringing out its new-generation 737's, resulted in snarled assembly lines and more than $3 billion in charges. And the Asian crisis meant deferred aircraft orders and deliveries.
Mr. Condit said he expected the profit per airplane to continue rising regardless of events in Asia. But he said Boeing's order-and-delivery cycle is almost certain to top out with next year's expected delivery of a record 620 aircraft.

HEADLINE: Deals to Move Global Positioning Technology Toward Everyday Use

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 9

 BODY:
The world's two largest digital cellular phone companies and a Japanese microelectronics giant plan on Monday to announce separate deals with a three-year-old Silicon Valley start-up to produce global positioning system chips inexpensive enough to be installed in cellular telephones.
Nokia of Finland will announce a $3 million investment in the start-up, Sirf Technology Inc., while both Ericsson of Sweden and Hitachi will announce partnerships to develop global positioning systems, or G.P.S., for consumer products. 
 G.P.S. devices use signals from satellites to pinpoint a location anywhere on the globe. The technology was developed by the Pentagon and first made its way into civilian use in specialized navigational systems for ships and airplanes.
The new backing for Sirf, a relatively unknown company, is the strongest signal to date that G.P.S. technology will increasingly become part of everyday life.
Start-ups like Sirf are being joined by established contenders like Trimble Navigation in rapidly adapting global positioning technology for a wide range of consumer electronics gadgets as well as for virtually any movable object, whether automobiles or luggage.
"We will put this technology in our products beginning as early as the year 2000," said Daryl Toor, an Ericsson executive. "Our vision is that increasingly, a small portable phone will be your gateway to the world."
The convergence of portable wireless electronic devices and the World Wide Web may soon make it conceivable for consumers to type questions like "Where is the nearest pizza parlor?" into hand-held devices and receive an answer in text or even from a robotic voice.
By licensing its technology to consumer electronics companies and chip makers, Sirf is hoping it will be able to transform the G.P.S. industry, which until now has been built around different proprietary systems for every company.
"Bringing in Ericsson and Nokia is a huge coup for Sirf," said Dale Ford, an industry analyst with Dataquest of San Jose, Calif., a market research firm. "Licensing technology to semiconductor companies could become a very large business."
Sirf has been developing G.P.S. technology on smaller and smaller chips, and at the same time has been lowering the price to the point where this technology can now be an economical component in most consumer electronics products.
The company's founder, Kanwar Chadha, a former Silicon Valley executive at Intel and at the S3 Corporation, describes an array of applications for G.P.S. technologies that go far beyond currently available navigational devices used by sailors, pilots and hikers.
For example, when G.P.S. receiver prices fall below $10, probably some time early in the next century, it will be possible to use them as security devices. Anything from a car to a computer would know its location and could be programmed to automatically shut itself off if it was moved illegally.
"Nobody had been looking at the really exciting G.P.S. applications," Sirf's founder said.
By re-engineering G.P.S. receivers based on microprocessors and digital signal processors, the chips that enable sound in computers and cellular phones, Sirf executives say, the company has realized major performance improvements in the technology.
Industry analysts who have seen Sirf's prototypes said they were more sensitive than existing products, permitting them to function at an acceptable level in the urban canyons that have traditionally blocked G.P.S. signals.
Sirf engineers recently demonstrated a prototype device that was able to begin reporting location information almost instantly and could continue to communicate with orbiting satellites from the basement of a one-story parking garage.
Current G.P.S. systems usually require a number of minutes to start delivering location information and fail when they are blocked by buildings or trees.
The new technology also has privacy and security implications, in part because the Federal Communications Commission has required that cellular phones be able to provide position information to within 125 meters, or roughly 400 feet, by 2001 so they can be located when placing 911 emergency calls.
There are now two contending technologies competing to meet the F.C.C. requirement. One, developed by companies like True Position Inc., uses complex software to locate cell phones by a triangulation method based on measuring the difference in arrival times of signals received by different network antennas.
In contrast, the G.P.S. receivers provide location information based on measuring the differences in arrival time from a constellation of Air Force satellites.
Both systems have strengths and weaknesses -- and different implications for privacy. For example, while the network method may prove superior in some urban areas, G.P.S. systems will be more reliable in rural regions.
Some privacy advocates prefer the G.P.S. systems, which they argue give the user control in deciding whether or not to transmit location information.
Using a triangulation system, the phone company could determine the user's location any time the phone was turned on.
This difference has become more important in recent months because the F.B.I. has indicated that it expects cellular telephone companies to make location information available to law-enforcement agencies.

HEADLINE: Behind Blue Chips, Small Stocks Chip Away at Bull Market

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Max G. Rodel, a 55-year-old chemist and investment fanatic, is agonizing over his stock portfolio and feeling a bit rotten about the way his small-company stocks have cratered in the last few weeks.
"It's been absolutely miserable, not only for the last few weeks but for the last few years," he said in a bout of frustration. "I'd invested in small caps for years and done well. But I'm having a very bad year investing, one of the worst in 25 years." 
 In fact, Mr. Rodel, who works part time, took a few days off from his consulting practice in Mill Valley, Calif., last week to glue himself to CNBC financial news and to peruse his subscription of Oberweis, a newsletter about small-company stocks. But as the stock market swooned, he watched helplessly as some of the stocks in his portfolio plummeted as much as 80 percent from his purchase price.
What's going on? While the stocks of large, well-known companies like McDonald's and Boeing have been battered for much of the last month, the stocks of smaller companies have been hit even harder. For instance, the Dow Jones industrial average -- a gauge of larger blue-chip stocks -- has fallen 9 percent from its high in mid-July, while the Russell 2000 index of small stocks has dropped 19 percent from its high in April.
Indeed, a study by John Manley, a securities analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, showed that the majority of really small-company issues -- 5,464 stocks with market values of less than $250 million -- had fallen 45 percent on average from their peak through Tuesday.
The evidence has prompted some Wall Street analysts to talk about a darker side of the bull market and to even suggest that a bear market is in the offing. Despite solid gains in many blue-chip issues, they say, the broader market is much sicker than many investors realize.
"It's just semantics, just a word game," said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Warburg Dillon Read. "Most everyone owns stocks, and no one wants to hear the words bear market. But this is a bear market that's been working its way from the bottom up, and that's classic."
Of course, few on Wall Street are willing to view the recent selloff as the prelude to a stock market crash, noting that the economy is still growing and that foreigners continue to be eager buyers of American stocks. Meanwhile, many analysts simply see a new paradigm -- powered by baby boomers pouring money into retirement plans -- that favors index funds of the big blue-chip companies over small-company stocks. Besides, sharp declines in smaller stocks have not always infected the broader market, and on Thursday and Friday both the small and big stocks rallied, ending one of the nastiest selling bouts in recent years.
But the downturn in small-company stocks is difficult to ignore. Their weakness can be glimpsed in what market analysts call the advance-decline line, a measure of how many stocks rise versus how many fall over a given period. In the 30 days ended Tuesday, 9,394 more stocks fell than rose, one of the worst performances in a decade.
That selloff caused blue-chip stocks to decline nearly 10 percent from their records, a sizable drop that analysts generally consider a market correction. A bear market is defined as a 20 percent drop.
Whether or not the misfortunes of smaller company stocks have any greater significance in the current bull market, their weakness has many on Wall Street paying heed.
"What this says is that the bull market has become increasingly narrow," said Claudia E. Mott, who tracks small-company stocks at Prudential Securities. "There's so much to be said for the bargains in the small-stock sector, but the money is going into the big names."
How bad is it? According to analysts, the performance gap between large and small stocks is approaching the levels of the Depression. The disparity, however, is not new. Since early 1994, stocks of big companies have vastly outperformed stocks of smaller companies. In April 1997, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had risen 19.8 percent in the previous 12 months, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks had fallen 5.1 percent -- creating a spread of about 25 percentage points.
Early last week, the chasm between small and large stock performance widened once again, to 17 percentage points. And perhaps more important, the Russell dropped into negative territory at its low on Wednesday, showing small stocks down 8.7 percent on the year while the S.& P. 500 was up 11.4 percent.
"This is close to the largest spread we've seen since October 1929 and October 1937," said Theodore Aronson, an analyst and principal at Aronson & Partners, a money management firm in Philadelphia. "You can drive the proverbial truck through that spread."
Such disparities exist despite studies that have shown that smaller- company stocks generally outperform blue chips over the long haul. In his book "Stocks for the Long Run," Jeremy J. Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says that going back to 1925, small stocks have produced a compound annual return of 12.5 percent compared with 11 percent for the S.& P. 500. To be sure, Mr. Siegel and other studies note that if the data exclude certain unique periods, large stocks outperform smaller stocks by a narrow margin.
Smaller-company stocks have also had a relatively strong track record in earnings growth. Ms. Mott of Prudential said smaller companies outpaced larger companies in earnings growth for five consecutive quarters, a trend expected to continue well into 1999. In the second quarter of 1998, she said, small companies had profit gains of about 10 percent, compared with just 2 percent for S.& P. 500 companies.
As a result, smaller-company stocks are at or near historically low valuations. So investors are paying relatively little per share for each dollar of earnings growth.
Cheap as the shares may be, investors want to see appreciation over time, and over the last few years investors like Mr. Rodel have watched their shares slip and slide while blue chips have soared.
The reasons for underperformance are many. But chief among them seems to be the growing popularity of index funds that mimic the performance of the S.& P. 500. Millions of investors, eager to ride the bull market of blue chips, have tied their fortunes to such indexes.
Portfolio managers, fighting a losing battle against the index funds, often find themselves riding the same stocks, trying to keep pace, which creates a kind of blue-chip buying frenzy. And foreigners, increasingly eager to invest in American companies, are buying into the safest, most heavily traded stocks.
This has helped push blue chips to record highs. In fact, much as happened with the Nifty Fifty stocks of the 1970's, buying power is being concentrated in an ever smaller group of stocks. For instance, in the first half of this year, the top 10 stocks in size in the S.& P. 500 had an average gain of 24.9 percent, while the smallest 200 gained just 6.5 percent, on average.
That kind of buying does not sit well with Jim Oberweis Sr. Since 1976, Mr. Oberweis, whose office is in North Aurora, Ill., has run the Oberweis small-stock newsletter and a mutual fund that boasts an annualized return of about 25 percent over the last decade. This year, however, his portfolio of small stocks is lagging badly behind the S.& P. 500.
"We have clients scratching their heads saying, 'Why do I go through the effort to find good companies with good earnings and then they don't do well?' " he said. Meanwhile, "Coca-Cola is selling at 50 times earnings with revenues growing 7 percent. That's asinine. It may be a great company, but it's not a great stock."
For many on Wall Street, the debate over small stocks comes down to this: Is this a new era in which investors simply favor blue chips in a global marketplace, despite higher prices and concerns about Asia, or are investors signaling a bearish downturn by retreating from a broad segment of the stock market?
If history is any guide, the deterioration in small stocks usually signals a sharper downturn for the broader market. In 1929 and 1972, small-company stocks began to deteriorate well ahead of larger stocks, until the market behemoths collapsed.
There have been exceptions, notably in 1997, when sharp slowdowns in smaller stocks did not lead to a bear market, but analysts say that more often than not, bear periods follow broader meltdowns. And although this bull market -- now one of the longest in history, having begun in October 1990 -- has defied many historical markers, a growing number of analysts are concerned about its longevity, particularly now that earnings growth has slowed drastically for big companies.
Robert Farrell, a longtime analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, noted last week that some 70 percent of all over-the-counter stocks were down 30 percent or more from their all-time highs, and he said this weakness was a sign of bearishness.
"It's only a bull market in the sense that the big major stocks haven't come down 10 percent," he said. "But if you were told 50 percent of your portfolio was down 40 percent, it would be hard to argue you weren't in a bear market."
Even more, once-bullish market commentators like Ralph J. Acampora, a technical analyst at Prudential Securities who once predicted the Dow would reach 10,000 by 2000, are turning bearish. Mr. Acampora's bearish words on CNBC last Tuesday helped send the Dow plunging 299.43 points.
But Mr. Aronson said that despite the bearish signals, nothing was exact in the global marketplace, which depends on emotions as much as calculations. "None of these statistical relationship are anything approaching E=mc2 ," he said. "There's no formula. A lot of it is market psychology."
As for Mr. Rodel, he is going to wait and hope that this is not the onset of a bear market, but a cycle that could end with small stocks taking back a leadership role.
"I have friends who only invest in the S.& P. 500 funds, and they kind of tease me," he said. "But I think I'm going to stick to my guns."

More than a year has gone by since the collapse of Thailand's currency, the baht, signaled the beginning of the Asian crisis. Hopes that the turmoil would be contained to one or two countries, and would end soon, have long since been dashed.
The problem is worse than it might have been because Japan waited too long to deal with the aftereffects of the collapse of its stock and real estate markets eight years ago. However, Japan's new Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, hit all the right notes in his first major policy speech on Friday, promising economic deregulation, tax cuts, increased public spending and a program to rescue the country's banking system. But important details are still vague, and Mr. Obuchi was right to warn that it will take "a year or two" to get a Japanese recovery underway. 
 Healing sick banks is a necessity in virtually every Asian country. Having lent money to finance inflationary booms when Asia was growing faster than the rest of the world, the banks now find their loans are backed by assets whose value has collapsed or, worse, were made to companies that had plenty of political influence but no real way of earning money to repay the loans.
In Japan, the problem is both larger and more solvable than in other Asian countries. There may be as much as $1 trillion in bad debts on the books of Japanese banks, making that problem far greater, in proportion to the size of the economy, than the one that confronted American banks at the beginning of this decade. But, like the United States, Japan is a wealthy country that can afford to clean up the mess if there is the political will. It appears that will is finally present.
China's problems provide another risk for the region. There is renewed speculation in financial markets that China's currency, the renminbi, will be devalued despite the Government's promises to hold the line. Chinese exports are being hurt by the weakness of the yen and other Asian currencies, particularly the South Korean won. South Korea is winning export markets in products like steel and cement that China needs to export as it tries to reform its economy and shrink the bloated state-owned enterprises that employ most Chinese workers but lose large sums of money. It has kept those enterprises afloat, and its economy growing, through "loans" from state-owned banks, which as a result would be insolvent if reasonable accounting standards were applied.
China has enough foreign exchange to defend its currency, and its relatively closed financial system makes speculation against the currency difficult. But the Chinese leadership fears a slowdown in its economy, and it might decide within a year that it needs to devalue, even if that risks worsening the problem for other Asian countries.
Earlier in this decade, Asia's strength helped bring prosperity to the rest of the world. Now it appears that the world will have to deal with a weak Asia for some time to come.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE SCENE;
Caprice Of Terror: Who Dies, Who Lives

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 9

 BODY:
An Air Force employee lost a chance to spend Thursday night in Amsterdam, and lost her life when she went to work on Friday.
A 21-year-old Marine guard would probably have lived if he had been at his post, in the front of the United States Embassy here, but he had just gone to get money for the weekend at the cashier's office, in the back of the building, and was killed. 
Many of the Kenyan victims had gone to the embassy early that morning seeking visas, or jobs.
By design, terrorist attacks are ruthlessly indiscriminate. The blast that tore through the embassy here was no exception, taking and sparing lives at will as it shattered the belief that any United States' outpost could be low risk.
Still, timing blessed the most senior diplomats, who were attending their weekly meeting in the Ambassador's spacious office on the fifth floor, the top.
"That saved my life," said William Barr, the embassy's chief spokesman.
For unknown reasons Julian Bartley, the consul general, was not at the meeting, as he would normally be. Today he was the last of the dead Americans to be identified. His son, Jay, a university student who had a summer job at the embassy, was also killed.
At the senior officers' meeting, one of the main items of discussion was security, with talk about how to impart to this summer's arrivals the need for prudence in this city, which has been gripped by street crime, while avoiding a siege mentality.
"It was rather ironic," Donald R. Mackenzie, regional director for the United States Agency for International Development, recalled today.
"We wanted to tell them, 'Kenya is really a marvelous place, you can enjoy yourselves,' " said Mr. Mackenzie, who first began to appreciate the country as a Peace Corps volunteer here 28 years ago. "This has traditionally been a place with a low terrorist threat."
But at 10:35, as the meeting was ending, there was a loud thud.
"Some one next to me said, 'That's an explosion,' " recalled Paul Peterson, who arrived here only three weeks ago as the State Department's regional security officer. "I knew instantly it was a bomb."
Ten seconds later came the second and far more powerful blast, the one that tore through the embassy, leveled the building next door and blew out every window to the top of the 22-story Cooperative Bank building.
What happened is still far from clear. It appears that a vehicle loaded with explosives drove into a parking lot behind the embassy. There have been reports in local papers, unconfirmed, that gun shots were heard before the explosions.
The blast knocked Mr. Mackenzie, who was sitting near a window, out of his chair, and he suffered minor cuts. He picked himself up and quickly followed the others out of the room. They started down the stairwell, now without any light.
And with the walls crumbling, debris turned the stairs into something more akin to a slide. "The dust was just horrible," he said. "A lot of us were fearing that we could not go on breathing."
There was no panic, not even screaming inside the embassy, several diplomats recalled.
But there was random death.
Among the unfortunate were those employees who, with the weekend approaching, had gone to the cashier's office and a Citibank branch to get money. They are both in the back of the embassy, on the first floor, which took the brunt of the blast.
That is where Jesse N. Aliganga, a Marine sergeant from Panama City, Fla., was killed, said Mr. Peterson, the security officer.
Because of a strike at Kenya's commercial banks, the secretary for Mr. Barr asked for time to go from the spokesman's offices, about a half mile from the embassy, to the Citibank branch.
"She went down and she didn't come back," Mr. Barr said. He asked that her name not be published because the Kenyan Government has not released the names of the Kenyan victims.
Fate also dealt cruelly with Arlene Kirk, 50, an Air Force employee at the embassy, and Robert Kirk, who worked for the Agency for International Development. They were returning to Nairobi from vacation. Their flight from Amsterdam was overbooked and the airline asked for volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for some money and a free night in Amsterdam.
The Kirks decided to take it, Mr. Barr said, but by the time they got to the counter, other passengers had volunteered. So the Kirks got on the flight, and returned to work on Friday, when Mrs. Kirk was killed.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: IN NAIROBI;
As 155 Kenyan Lives Ended, Many More Changed Forever

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 9

 BODY:
On Friday morning, Jack Omukhani paid a visit to his wife at her job in the switchboard room of the Ufundi Cooperative House.
He had time to spare because he was on strike from his bank job. They talked of little things. His wife, Elizabeth Akino, insisted that he stay for a cup of tea to brace him against the chilly weather. He left just after 10 A.M. 
Today he picked up her mangled body from the city morgue. A half-hour after they parted, Ms. Akino was killed by the terrorist's bomb aimed at the American Embassy next door, which caused even worse devastation at the Ufundi building.
Ms. Akino was among at least 155 Kenyans who were killed in an act of terrorism that investigators say appears to have nothing to do with them.
"As for me, it was actually by the grace of God I survived," Mr. Omukhani said, as he fought back tears outside the City Council Mortuary, the main morgue, where he had found his wife's body on the floor. "I had just seen her, and we had talked."
As the death toll from Friday's bombing continued to rise, the families of victims turned to the grim tasks of burying their dead and rebuilding their lives.
The blast ripped through a busy downtown district dominated by banks and government offices at 10:30 A.M. Many of the people who died were educated, middle-class Kenyans: office workers, bankers, engineers, accountants.
In a country like Kenya, where jobs are scarce and the average income is less than $260 a year, the effects of Friday's carnage will spread far beyond the immediate families of the dead, like rings in a pond, to hundreds of dependents living in rural areas, Kenyans said.
Even for those who survived the blast and the storm of flying glass and shrapnel that followed, life has been forever altered. More than 500 people were hospitalized for wounds. Scores were blinded or permanently scarred, hospital officials said.
Many relatives of victims expressed a quiet outrage that Kenyans were paying with their lives for American foreign policy decisions. Some expressed the opinion that the American marines and officials had done too little to help dig out victims from the rubble of the Ufundi house in the crucial early hours of the disaster.
"If it's a war between the Americans and other people, they should take the war elsewhere," said Dr. Charles Onudi, who was waiting for a relative's body outside the morgue. "Lots of innocent lives are being lost."
At the City Council Mortuary today, lines of relatives snaked slowly through the horrifying rooms of disfigured and mutilated bodies. Most had been searching hospitals since the blast in a desperate attempt to find missing relatives alive. Every few minutes, there were muffled cries, followed by the sound of weeping, as people discovered their kin.
On the front gate was a list of 34 names of people already identified by the police, scrawled in felt pen on a paper bag.
No. 28 was John Ouko Onyango, a 33-year-old engineer who worked at the Kenya Power and Lighting Company. He was a polite, religious man who seemed to have a bright future ahead of him, friends said. His wife is a nurse at the Nairobi Hospital. They had two small children, the second only a month old.
Last month, Mr. Onyango purchased a new car, a sign he was coming up in the world. A cautious man, he went to the Ufundi building on Friday morning to buy more automobile insurance, his friends said.
"He was the person who was well-off in the family," said his cousin, Apollo Abiero. "He was the bread-winner. He supported four brothers and a sister."
Further up on the list was Caroline Ndolo, a 29-year-old single mother who worked as a clerk in the destroyed building at the Ufundi Cooperative Savings and Credit Society. Her brother, Frederick, a father of two boys, also worked at the bank. He is missing and presumed dead.
Friends described Miss Ndolo as a talkative and independent young woman who liked to go dancing in Nairobi nightclubs and enjoyed her single life. She had been pleased to discover that she was pregnant last year. Her boy is three months old.
"She was happy about the baby," her father, Michael Opondo Ndolo, a retired civil servant, said as he waited for his daughter's body to be loaded into a hearse. "She had a plan of opening a small shop, a boutique."
Echoing the sentiment of many grieving people here, Mr. Ndolo said the American Embassy should be moved far from the center of town.
Naftali Muyonga, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry, came to the morgue to take care of arrangements for his brother-in-law, Moises Ashton Mwani, who was a high-ranking civil servant in the Teachers Service Commission. Mr. Mwani, 50, was killed by shrapnel from the blast as he sat in a meeting on the fourth floor of another building next to the Ufundi building, Mr. Muyonga said.
"What we fail to understand is why the terrorists should pick on a peaceful country like Kenya," Mr. Muyonga said.
At about noon, Mr. Omukhani and his friends carried the body of his wife, Elizabeth Akino, out of the morgue on a stretcher and into a van. Half her face and head had been destroyed by shrapnel. The hearse took the body to a funeral home in Nairobi's center, to keep until the family can collect enough money to transport her body to western Kenya for burial.
Ms. Akino's death was a heavy blow for her family. She has two children, an 8-year-old boy and a 3-year-old girl. Her husband has been on strike from the Kenya Commercial Bank for a week, along with thousands of other bank employees. The striking workers were dismissed by management last week, and it is unclear if they will be allowed to return to work.
"I have to be worried," Mr. Omukhani said. "I don't know my fate as of now. I'm just wishing that all will go well and I'll go back to work."
Ms. Akino's older sister, Tereza Okidi, 45, said she was worried that the family would not have enough money to support the children. Ms. Okidi, a former secretary, said she had recently started a small restaurant. But she has two grown children of her own, both unemployed, and her earnings will not stretch far.
"I don't know how to start life with these small children," she said. "I can't neglect my sister's children. I can't run from the responsibility. It has found me, and it is mine."
Her friends and relatives described Ms. Akino as a strong, athletic woman. She played semiprofessional volleyball for the Kenya Commercial Bank team for several years before she gave it up to devote herself to her children, friends said.
Born in Nairobi, Ms. Akino was the sixth child in a family of nine. Her father was a mechanic. She finished high school, but never had enough money to go to college, relatives said. She was studying typing and shorthand and dreamed of becoming a secretary.
In recent years, she had grown more religious. She loved gospel music and spent much of her spare time working with women's organizations and church groups. Though she was not garrulous, she had many friends. Her desk at work was a magnet for people on coffee breaks, so much so that her boss sometimes complained.
Ms. Akino and her husband and children lived in a one-room apartment in a barracks-style public housing project in Bahati, a working-class neighborhood. She talked often to friends about her desire to move into a bigger house, buy a car and have a third child.
The walls of the tiny home are decorated with banners from volleyball tournaments. There is a showcase with trophies on one wall. Her husband also plays, for the Kenya National Team.
In the afternoon, her family and friends met at her home to share stories and talk about funeral arrangements. Several fought back tears as they gathered outside on wooden benches under a gray sky. They prayed together and then began to talk about what was needed for a respectable funeral.
"She was my best friend," said Danae Tirop, 28, who also played for the bank's volleyball team. "She was the maid of honor at my wedding. She was warm, generous, kind, understanding. She always thought of her children first."
Ms. Tirop's eyes welled up.
"On that Friday, I actually wanted to go to see her," she said. "But I decided to wait until after lunch."

HEADLINE: Sweden, Once the World's Conscience, Now Drifts

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The waterfront palaces and baronial shoreline buildings of this northern capital stand as hardy symbols of Scandinavian stability, and the sailboats and tourist vessels that glide over the gray Baltic waters leave barely a ripple.
But for all the outward signs of sureness, continuity and calm, Sweden is approaching its future and an election with a sense of drift and loss and an unaccustomed confusion over what to do about it. 
 In this decade, Swedes have lost their feeling of being exceptional, and experienced their first unemployment, social spending scandals and a decline in competitiveness. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has reduced Sweden's per capita income standing from 4th to 15th place in the world, ranking it behind its Scandinavian neighbors, Denmark, Finland and Norway, as well as Ireland and Italy.
Its largest and most successful company, the telecommunications giant Ericsson, is threatening to move its headquarters to Britain, where it finds the business climate better. Industrialists cite high personal income taxes and rigid labor rules as impediments to remaining competitive globally while doing business here.
The country that produced Gunnar Myrdal and preached racial tolerance has now developed segregated communities in Stockholm's suburbs for many of the 800,000 immigrants who have come here during the last 30 years from the Middle East, Asia, South America and Eastern Europe.
Long quietly proud of their country's position as the world's good conscience, Swedes miss being the society that attracted admiration from afar for a nation of fewer than nine million people living on the chill edge of Europe. Then, they were the future, a model of rationality, tolerance, cradle-to-grave care of citizens and generosity to people living in less advantaged countries overseas.
The nostalgia arises in every conversation with Swedes about their country and has produced an election campaign in which the most repeated claim is not a dynamic pledge to bring change but a stolid promise to restore what was.
"Restore is the key word," said Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, a political and economic columnist for the Svenska Dagbladet. "The desire is to go back to when Sweden was one of the three or four richest countries in the world, when we were listened to in the United States and labor and management used to come and tour Sweden to see how we did it and everyone looked to us for the solution."
It was the renowned Middle Way that sought to provide a humane passage between controlling totalitarianism and uncaring capitalism, and its home was Sweden.
"It was absurd, but we thought of ourselves as a kind of superpower," said Arne Ruth, an author and former editor in chief of Dagens Nyheter. "We had the certainty that progress was permanent. Now that feeling of exceptionalism has been lost, and we are just another normal nation."
Like other normal nations, Sweden faces the new pressure of competing in a globalized economy where progress is measured in enterprise and productivity. Meeting that challenge may be at cross purposes with satisfying its aging population's desire to keep huge welfare state subsidies intact.
Tentative Government attempts to trim its welfare costs are so resented that officials have promised to increase spending and abandon talk of tax cuts. "Talking about tax cuts in this campaign is like swearing in church," said Toivo Sjoren, research chief at the Sifo opinion surveying group.
The Government spends 46 percent of Sweden's gross national product on welfare, more than any other country, and its overall public spending is 63 percent of gross national product. The income taxes required to support this public munificence take 59 percent of the pay of people earning as little as $30,000 a year and oblige employers to pay up to 41 percent of employee remuneration into social security and pension plans.
While center-left parties in European countries like Britain, the Netherlands, France and Spain have cut government subsidies and encouraged private business, Sweden's ruling Social Democrats go into the Sept. 20 parliamentary elections facing irresistible demands from their aging constituents to restore what was cut.
"There are Swedes who are excited about the possibilities of the future, but more who are scared by them, and the politicians respect the scared part because that's where you get the votes," said Mats Lindgren, the chairman of the consulting firm Kairos Future.
"No one," Mr. Sjoren said, "is sure about what the way for Sweden is anymore." He produced study charts measuring the dispositions of major countries that placed Sweden in the corner representing the pursuit of stability instead of innovation. Other industrialized countries were crowded into the top quarter for their willingness to take risks and act decisively. Sweden's only companion in the forlorn bottom spot was Japan.
Stockholm offers reminders of Sweden's days as a pioneer of style and social conscience. Wheelchair runners are common, stoplights along the Drottinggatan shopping route feature a staccato beep that alters rhythm to allow blind people to cross safely. Every three or four blocks are stores that take Swedes' donated old clothes, refurbish them, sell them at bargain prices and devote proceeds to aid for Africa.
The passing car is most likely a Volvo, the Swedish make that famously sold itself not on sex appeal but on safety. Downtown offices reflect the sleek Swedish Modern style, whichrevolutionized design in the 1960's. Swedish Modern was clean, unadorned and functional.
Similarly, Swedes expect strict probity in public life. Mona Sahlin, the front-runner to become Prime Minister after Ingvar Carlsson resigned in 1995, had to leave politics after it emerged that she had used her state-provided credit card to pay for personal snacks and auto rentals. She had made reimbursements, but they were deemed too tardy.
The end of the cold war has dramatically altered the rationale for Sweden's traditional nonaligned posture. Once, the Baltic Sea was a strategic wall between Sweden and the Soviet republics of Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Now, one of the the first signs off the highway in from Stockholm's Arlanda International Airport points to the ferry for Tallinn, the Estonian capital. Sweden has found itself pressed to drop the neutrality it adopted in both world wars and join an expanding NATO. While determined to resist that, it has taken part in the Bosnia peacekeeping run by NATO.
In a 1994 referendum, Swedes narrowly decided to join the European Union, but the public has blamed many problems since then on Brussels. Polls suggest that a vote today would go against European Union membership. Sensing this mood, the Government of Prime Minister Goran Persson has ruled out even holding a vote on whether to join the European single currency being introduced next year.
Once a nation that spoke out on conditions around the world, Sweden has become self-absorbed. Once, it gave the world Dag Hammarskjold, Secretary General of the United Nations from 1953 to 1961, and Olof Palme, a pioneering Social Democrat Prime Minister gunned down by a still unknown assassin in 1986. Their fame on the foreign stage was an asset at home.
Now, Carl Bildt, the former Prime Minister who spent two years as chief foreign peace envoy to Bosnia, has returned home to find his opposition Moderate Party losing popularity, and predicted to poll little more than the 22 percent it recorded in the 1994 elections that brought the present Government to power.
Mr. Bildt argued that the two major parties were on the same train but that his was on the front looking forward and Mr. Persson's was on the back staring at the past. Voters still seem to favor the latter stance.
Any attempt at restructuring faces formidable cultural resistance. The work force is 80 percent unionized, and 31 percent of the jobs are in the public sector. Pressure for change is coming from frustrated entrepreneurs and young people.
"Businesses can't grow here because it's too expensive to hire people," said Mr. Lindgren of Kairos Future.
"Young people are starting to think globally," he said. "They're comparing themselves with the people around the world that they meet on backpacking trips, or on the Internet or where they've studied abroad or at a job for a multinational. Some of them are moving away, and they are the people that Sweden needs most."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Margeotes/Fertitta Is Acquired by MDC

BYLINE: By Andrew Ross Sorkin 

 BODY:
The agency world continues to get smaller as yet another independent shop announced that it had been acquired. Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners in New York said that the communications and marketing services division of the MDC Communications Corporation in Toronto had acquired a majority interest in the agency. Financial terms were not disclosed.
As part of the deal, Margeotes/Fertitta, which was founded in 1973, will continue to operate as an independent agency under that name. George Fertitta, 52, a founder, president and chief executive of Margeotes/Fertitta, will continue to head the shop in that role. He will also own a "substantial majority stake" in the agency. 
 "I think 25 years is a long enough stretch to go on your own," Mr. Fertitta said, adding that, "it's nice to have a big brother to help you grow and expand your business on behalf of your clients."
Margeotes/Fertitta has 115 employees and billings estimated at $175 million to $190 million from clients including Benckiser Consumer Products, Godiva Chocolatier, the National Football League, Media One and McGraw-Hill.
Mr. Fertitta said that over the last several years, Margeotes/Fertitta has had numerous expressions of interest in being acquired by or merged with a wide range of agencies, holding companies and foreign communications companies. "Although there were attractive financial numbers offered to us, none of them offered the kind of entrepreneurial model that MDC offered us."
Miles S. Nadel, president and chief executive of MDC, said "This acquisition is an important strategic step in expanding our presence in the marketing services industry in the United States." MDC, which owns three agencies in Canada, acquired an Internet-based marketing agency in May called Cyber Sight in Portland, Ore.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE CONSUL GENERAL;
The Last Hope Of One Family Is Extinguished

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER with JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 9

 BODY:
She already knew that her son was dead.
But as Sue Bartley and 150 other mourners left a memorial service here today for the American victims of Friday's terrorist bombing, they were hoping against hope that Mrs. Bartley's husband, Consul General Julian Bartley, was still alive. 
 They listened to a reading from Ecclesiastes, heard a mournful taps, then went home to wait, grasping red roses in trembling hands.
Within hours, their wisp of a hope was gone. Using torn clothing, strands of hair and a ring, doctors positively identified Mr. Bartley's badly disfigured body this evening, adding his name to a list of 11 dead Americans that included the Bartleys' 20-year-old son, Jay.
"He was the last missing American," Chris Scharf, an embassy spokesman said.
By all accounts the father and son were an immensely popular pair whose headlong embrace of Kenyan life had been lovingly returned.
"Julian was greatly loved by Ken yans," Mr. Scharf said, "not only because of his respect of them, but also because of his ability to relate to the person who was trembling in line for a visa. He would go outside the embassy and work the line, talking to people. He was extraordinarily popular among Kenyans, even those who might be denied a visa."
After Julian Bartley was declared missing, Kenyan soldiers searched for him in emergency rooms and the public morgue. But later his body was found in a private mortuary where a tag misidentified his as a Kenyan, Mr. Scharf said.
At a ceremony at Ambassador Prudence Bushnell's residence today, colleagues "spoke about how Julian had touched so many people" as he supervised the administrative affairs at the embassy, said Donald R. Mackenzie, director of the regional office of the United States Agency for International Development.
"He's a very special person," said Mr. Mackenzie, who found it difficult to talk about his friend and colleague in the past tense. "When he talks to you, you feel like you are the most important person in the room, and not that he was looking around to see if there was someone more important around.
"He had a great sense of humor. Though I guess it isn't so funny now, he used to say to people who came to him, 'I'll take care of you from womb to tomb.' "
Mr. Bartley, 55, was born in Jacksonville, Fla., according to a statement released by his daughter, Edith, who lives in the United States and was en route to Nairobi tonight to join her mother. He grew up in South Jamaica, Queens, where his mother, Gladys Baldwin, still lives. He worked for the Foreign Service for 24 years, including assignments in the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Spain, Israel and Korea. Before joining the Foreign Service, he was a Peace Corp volunteer.
At today's crowded memorial service, held on the porch of Ambassador Bushnell's home, Mr. Bartley's friends recalled that he had once taken a night job to help pay medical bills for his son, Jay.
Jay Bartley had come to Kenya two years ago, full of youthful enthusiasm about Africa. When he died, he had carved a young man's comfortably frenetic niche for himself in Nairobi, coaching a girl's basketball team, jet skiing at African beaches and teaching friends to ride horses.
At the time of the bombing, Jay Bartley was working at the embassy in a summer job, preparing for his sophomore year at the United States International University in the Kasarani section of Nairobi, about 12 miles from the city center. The university is based in San Diego but has an 1,800-student campus in Nairobi.
Dr. Freida Brown, executive director of the Nairobi campus, said Jay Bartley had planned to spend one more year in Nairobi before returning to the United States to complete his bachelor's degree, possibly in international relations.
"When the explosion first hit, you felt detached from it," she said. "But Saturday morning, when they called me and said he had died, I was totally distraught, because I could just see him walking across that campus."
She described Jay Bartley as gentle, outgoing and caring, a lanky young man with a wide grin and soft voice. "He was the kind of kid who got up first and made his parents breakfast in the morning," she said.
On a recent trip to Mombasa with some friends, Dr. Brown recalled, Jay Bartley took it on himself to oversee the welfare of a student who had broken her leg after falling off her jet ski. "He took her to the hospital," Dr. Brown said. "Then after her foot was put in a cast, he piggybacked her to the bus. He was always looking after other people."
Dr. Brown said Jay Bartley had a learning disability that made it difficult for him to complete written tests, but that he had more than compensated with a buoyant, dogged personality and a laptop computer provided by his father. "It was a real struggle for him, but he never let that stop him," she said.
She described Julian Bartley and his wife as similar to their son: easygoing, upbeat, sociable people. "Julian always had a big smile and hug for everybody," she said. "They were three of a kind."
During a visit to the Bartley home on Saturday, Dr. Brown described Mrs. Bartley as being "in a state of shock." Yet she still had enough presence of mind to ask Dr. Brown whether she had received a cookbook from the Nairobi American Women's Association.
"She's amazing," Dr. Brown said. "She was looking after people even in this time of sorrow."

HEADLINE: Web Concern Gets Patent For Its Model Of Business

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
A small start-up company in Connecticut has been awarded a broad patent that appears to protect not just the virtual nuts and bolts of its electronic commerce system, but also its entire business model for buying and selling goods and services on the Internet.
The company, Priceline.com L.L.C. of Stamford, best known for allowing consumers to "name your own price" for airline tickets, said it would be issued United States patent No. 5,794,207 tomorrow for both the method and the use of "buyer-driven commerce" from the Patent and Trademark Office. Priceline in effect convinced the Patent Office that it had invented a new way of doing business, one that was fundamentally different from any other form of electronic commerce today. 
 Priceline's "reverse auction" method is such a narrowly specific approach to on-line business that analysts said few other Internet commerce companies were likely to be significantly restricted by the patent. But the Patent Office's growing willingness to protect an entire Internet business model -- and not just the technical wrinkles -- could set a precedent with far-reaching implications for electronic commerce.
"Internet-related business patents are extremely important," said Carl Oppedahl, a intellectual property lawyer in Frisco, Colo. He cited the continuing case of E-Data, a New Jersey business that is suing more than a dozen companies over its patent claims to control fundamental aspects of electronic commerce. Depending on the outcome of the E-Data case, Mr. Oppedahl said, "Microsoft levels of money either will or will not change hands, and there are likely to be other Internet-business-method patent lawsuits with similarly high stakes."
Several computer-related business-method patents have been upheld by the courts in the last decade. But the Priceline patent is one of the first awarded since the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed last month that a "practical application of a mathematical algorithm, formula or calculation" could be protected.
As such, Priceline's patent could touch off a race to control the underlying framework of electronic commerce.
In the Priceline system, consumers submit a bid, known as a "conditional purchase offer," to buy goods or services -- airline tickets or automobiles, for example -- from unknown sellers at a certain price, and they guarantee the offer with a credit card. Priceline presents the offers to the sellers, who then have the option of either fulfilling or rejecting the bids, or making a counteroffer. Priceline then completes the transaction.
For example, a buyer might wish to buy two airplane tickets from New York to Seattle. He or she would set conditions: the flight must be on a major airline on a certain date, allowing one change of planes if the layover is no more than two hours, and the price per ticket can be no more than $300. Any airlines that participate in the Priceline system can review the offers, and the first one that responds, meeting all the conditions, gets the sale.
Andrew B. Whinston, director of the Center for Research in Electronic Commerce at the University of Texas at Austin, said that from a traditional economic perspective, the Priceline business model was hardly radical. It seems very similar to the method by which a government agency or a corporation puts out specifications and conditional purchase orders to multiple contractors or vendors, he said.
Besides Priceline's use of cryptography and other networking technologies, what appears to be new and original, said Mr. Whinston, who holds professorships in both economics and computer science, is that by using computers and the Internet, the company is able to bring this method of buyer-driven commerce to consumers.
"Because it has one buyer and multiple sellers, it is a mirror image of Internet auction companies like Onsale.com, in which you have one seller and multiple buyers," he said.
Priceline officials said that the patent would also cover the "apparatus" the company developed to authenticate customers' identities and verify their ability to pay, to protect the anonymity and privacy of both buyer and seller, to enable sellers to browse the list of offers, and to complete the pact electronically.
Although Priceline does almost all its business on the World Wide Web, company officials noted that its buyer-driven method could also be carried out through electronic mail, voice mail or fax.
Jay Walker, Priceline's chairman and chief executive, said that the business model for buyer-driven commerce on the Internet was developed over the course of several years by researchers at Walker Digital, an unusual company he formed several years ago as a combination research center, invention factory and patent law office. The patent, Mr. Walker said, was among nearly 200 that his company had filed in the last three years, including some that seek protection for new electronic business methods as well as for the technical systems that make them possible.
Walker Digital sold the rights to the buyer-driven system to Priceline.
Priceline said last week that it had received $20 million in private financing from the venture capital firm General Atlantic Partners. The investors expect revenue from Priceline's business operations, but the real potential payoff will come from the licensing of its methods to other electronic commerce companies, Mr. Walker said.
"Priceline is really entering into an exciting space, one that I know many other large organizations, notably Microsoft, have also looked at," said Kenneth H. Smith, director of on-line retailing research at Mainspring, a Boston-based consulting company. "My assumption is they will be challenged on this patent."
Mr. Smith and other analysts noted, however, that the Priceline model was very likely to appeal to a relatively small niche of buyers who know the exact specifications and reasonable prices for the product or service they want.
Travelers must be willing to fly at unpopular times, for example, and give up their choice of airline and perks like frequent-flier miles.
Priceline asserts that it has sold 40,000 airline tickets to leisure travelers in its three months of operation, despite the fact that only a handful of domestic airlines now participate in the system. Even so, the airline industry reports that the average number of seats that fly away empty every day is about 500,000. Mr. Walker said that there was untapped demand for those seats at the right price.
The company recently broadened its offerings to include new cars, but the participating car dealers are limited for now to the New York area.
Mr. Walker said Priceline would soon expand its on-line products to include hotel rooms, automobile financing, credit cards, personal computers, home mortgages, life insurance, rental cars, cruise ship vacations and other services.
James McQuivey, who analyses on-line retail strategies for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., described Priceline's broad strategy as "brilliant" but said that its success would depend on the selection of goods that are offered. "There's really no incentive for the airlines to play," he said, because all the seats are managed by relatively few sellers. "In the car business, though, power is diffused through more than 20,000 dealers."
Mr. Smith of Mainspring was also sanguine about Priceline's patent. "I think they have a real chance," he said. "More so than in any other industry, the Internet allows a new and interesting business a chance to deliver value into the marketplace. At the same time, it can quickly deliver the message from the market if the value proposition is either not wanted or not needed.
"In other words, you get a chance, but you find out very quickly if you're going to be a failure."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 12, 1998, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about a patent awarded for an Internet auction system misidentified the court whose ruling last month helped pave the way for the new patent. It was the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals from district courts in patent, trademark and copyright cases, not the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

Saving Madagascar's Bounty for Its Lemurs and Its People

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
Patricia Wright's trail to Madagascar and environmental heroism began in the 1960's with an act that is now considered the antithesis of conservation: the purchase in a Brooklyn pet store of an owl monkey, and then a second one to keep it company.
Within a week of the birth of her own daughter, Amanda, the monkeys too produced a Brooklyn baby, and Dr. Wright, then a mother and housewife, became increasingly intrigued by the behavior of these nocturnal monkeys. The female monkey's only responsibility appeared to be breast-feeding. The male did all the parenting, carrying and caring for the baby. 
 Dr. Wright, who had loved the woods growing up in upstate New York and had an undergraduate degree in biology, decided she wanted to study these monkeys in the wild. Books in the New York Public Library told her that the "wild" meant the jungles of Peru, home to wild boar, jaguars and deadly fer-de-lance snakes. She consulted Dr. Warren Kinzey, then an anthropologist at City University of New York, pumping him for guidance.
Dr. Kinzey told her that without a graduate degree and university affiliation, no one would finance her effort. But she was undeterred. Through a friend, she arranged an affiliation with the New School for Social Research and persuaded Nancy Mulligan, a wildlife fancier from Rochester, N.Y., to finance the expedition for herself, her husband, their daughter, 3, and a native guide.
Dr. Wright's library research had led her to a site that turned out to have long since been converted from jungle to coffee plantations. No monkey had been seen there for 25 years. The next stop was a six-day canoe ride into the jungle, family in tow. Her guide soon got bored looking for monkeys in the dark, so one night Dr. Wright ventured alone into the jungle. Frightened by what sounded like wild boar and with her flashlight growing dim, she spent the night in a spiny tree, only to be scolded by none other than two owl monkeys whose territory she had invaded.
They were the first of many for Dr. Wright. Six months later, she returned to Brooklyn with notebooks filled with observations, the first data ever gathered on nocturnal monkeys in the wild.
At Dr. Kinzey's urging, she enrolled in graduate school at the City University in 1977. After nine years, which included a 14-month trip to the Amazon, she received her doctorate.
Then it was off to Madagascar, known for its rare species, especially lemurs. Armed with a grant from the World Wildlife Fund, Dr. Wright hoped to find the "probably extinct" greater bamboo lemur. Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean, had physically split from the African mainland about 150 million years ago, becoming a laboratory of isolated evolution. The shrinking jungles harbor thousands of species of plants and animals known nowhere else on earth. Eighty percent of Madagascar's wildlife is unique to the island, including nearly all of its mammals, 90 percent of its reptiles and amphibians, 80 percent of its plants and half its birds. The rosy periwinkle that is the source of the life-saving leukemia drug vincristine is one of 8,000 native plants. But all of this bounty was imperiled.
"Flying over the island," she recalled, "all I saw was devastation," the result of decades of slash-and-burn farming.
En route to establishing that the greater bamboo lemur, a little primate with big, watchful eyes and charcoal-gray fur, was indeed alive and doing better than expected in the rain forest, Dr. Wright discovered a new species of lemur with golden red fur, the golden bamboo lemur, which thrives on the cyanide-laced shoots of young bamboo, though how this three-and-a-half-pound primate tolerates an amount of poison that could kill a man is still anyone's guess.
"But no sooner had I found this new species than I heard farmers sawing down 200-year-old rosewood trees, each of which takes about nine smaller trees with it," Dr. Wright said. An appeal to an official to protect the forest ended with a challenge to Dr. Wright to help establish a national park.
She explained that the inroads into the rain forests were nothing more than stopgaps for the farmers living in one of the 10 poorest countries in the world. After only two years of farming on newly cleared land, the soil would be depleted, forcing them to cut down yet more forest. Meanwhile, the runoff of ochre-tinted soil ruined waterways and the loss of trees threatened the watershed. And since few Malagasy were aware of the economic potential of ecotourism, the farmers gave little thought to the fast-disappearing habitats of Madagascar's unique flora and fauna, which include 32 species of lemurs (16 of the largest ones have already become extinct).
By the time Dr. Wright arrived there in 1985, more than 80 percent of the forests had disappeared from the island and there were only two national parks in Madagascar, the last one established in 1930.
It took her five years to create the park, five years of days-long treks to visit farmers and explain the purpose of the park and its potential value to their families, five years of negotiations with village elders and government officials, five years of international phone calls and grant proposals to raise the money needed, not just to create the park but to give the villagers something for the land they would sacrifice.
In the end, with the help of $6.27 million from the United States Agency for International Development and the support of various conservation groups, there was not only a 108,000-acre park but eight new schools, 10 renovated schools, four health-care centers, a team of visiting doctors and nurses, rural libraries with books on conservation and 133 villagers working in the park. In addition, the villagers receive half the entrance fees to the park, now visited by 10,000 tourists a year.
"Pat's extraordinary contribution has been her ability to see the intimate link between the beauty and fascination of the animals and the lives of the people," said Dr. Alison Jolly, a primatologist at Princeton University who studies ring-tailed lemurs in Madagascar. "It's so easy to say that what matters is the animals or what matters is the people. Pat has been able to say that what matters is both."
Among her many prized honors is the Knight of the National Order of Madagascar, bestowed in 1995 by the President of a country that now knows the rewards of saving its rain forests.
Dr. Wright is executive director of the Institute for the Conservation of Tropical Environments at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and international coordinator of Ranomafana National Park, the rain forest in Antananarivo, Madagascar, rescued by her determination to save the only known home of the newly found lemur.
Dr. Wright is now in her 13th year of studying lemurs, most recently the diademed sifaka, a large, black diurnal primate. "I've finally come out of the dark," she noted, which makes her work attractive to Earthwatch volunteers, amateur researchers who pay to help support environmental research all over the world.
Nowadays, Dr. Wright and an expanded research team work intensively during the six months a year that are not cyclone season. Though Dr. Wright and co-workers still sleep in tents without electricity, the campsite now has two buildings: a research station and a dining hall. The onetime rice-and-beans diet has been enhanced as well by a local cook who persuaded Dr. Wright to send him to cooking school.
During the off-season, Dr. Wright teaches courses on primate conservation and behavior and ecology at Stony Brook. There she is joined by her second husband, Jukka Jernvall, a Finnish paleontologist and developmental biologist who works at the University of Helsinki when she is in Madagascar. He visits her there and they spend a month together each summer in Finland.
"We have a tricontinental marriage," she said, obviously pleased with the unusual arrangement.
She is also pleased with her study subjects. The sifaka, a spectacular leaping lemur that at 15 pounds is the biggest of the living lemurs, is a lot easier to track than owl monkeys. One by one, each animal is tranquilized and fitted with a color-coded nylon necklace. Once a year, the animals are weighed and measured, tooth impressions are taken and their reproductive condition noted.
"As with most other species of lemurs, the female sifaka rules the roost," Dr. Wright explained. "The female is first into the fruit tree where she gets the best and most fruit. Her mate dares not enter the tree until she's finished. If the male forgets and starts up the tree, she'll slap him in the face. If he persists, she'll lunge at him and may even nip him. He then backs away saying 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.' "
And, of course, when it comes to courting, the females choose. The males fight each other, she said, but often, females do not choose the winners. According to the "wimpy male hypothesis" formulated by Dr. Alison Richard, an anthropologist at Yale University, the female, by selecting a loser, may insure her dominant status.
With the sifaka's habitat protected, Dr. Wright said the main loss of these animals nowadays is the work of another endemic species, the fossa, "a fierce mongooselike animal with big teeth and a big appetite and retractable claws that enable it to climb trees fast. The fossa is long, lean and mean and it eats lemurs."

HEADLINE: Ford Cutting Average Price On Cars and Trucks 0.3%

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced today that the average price of its 1999 model cars and trucks will decrease three-tenths of 1 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. It dropped the prices of its highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, significantly.
"Last year, for the first time in over 30 years, we were able to hold the line on prices; this year is the first time in over 30 years we've actually reduced prices," Lloyd Hansen, controller for Ford's marketing and sales operations, said in an interview. 
 The 1999 model year, which starts Oct. 1, will mark the second consecutive year that all major auto makers will hold the line on prices.
"We've seen outright deflation in car prices over the last two years," said William P. Wilson, vice president and economist for Comerica Bank, Detroit. The bank's tracking of new-vehicle transaction prices, the price for which vehicles actually sell, shows an eight-tenths of 1 percent drop this May compared with May 1997.
Mr. Wilson said that worldwide excess capacity in auto production had created an extremely competitive environment in North America that prevented auto makers from increasing prices.
The Chrysler Corporation announced in July that its overall prices remained essentially unchanged from 1998 prices, up one-tenth of 1 percent, or about $35 a vehicle, largely as a result of regulatory emission costs. In the 1998 model year, Chrysler's prices remained virtually the same as in 1997. Price increases in 1995 and 1996 were under 2 percent. The General Motors Corporation said its prices, only a few of which have been announced, would be relatively flat. In June, G.M.'s Saturn division said that its 1999 prices would include a price reduction on its coupe. Saturn, which does not offer incentives and prohibits price haggling in the showroom, reduced prices and added equipment to some models last year as well. G.M. does not plan to announce an overall percentage of price change, but will announce prices on individual 1999 models as they are introduced. With a few exceptions, G.M.'s 1999 models will not arrive in dealerships for a couple months because of a 54-day strike by the United Automobile Workers union at two parts plants that shut down almost all of G.M.'s North American assembly plants. Most plants are back in full operation and will produce 1998 models through September to use up the inventory of parts designed for those vehicles before changing over to 1999 models.
Import manufacturers typically announce prices in late summer or early fall.
At Ford, prices of cars dropped an average of 1.7 percent; truck prices fell five-tenths of 1 percent. Prices of Ford-model cars and trucks dipped two-tenths of 1 percent; prices of Lincoln-Mercury vehicles, mostly cars, fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
The price of the Ford Taurus LX dropped $1,000, to $17,995, including destination fees. A typically equipped SE sedan will have a base price of $18,995, down $1,080, and the SE station wagon drops $1,840, to $19,995. Prices of the Taurus's cousin, the Mercury Sable, also dropped between $1,000 and $1,800. "We're trying to put a price on the car that is a recognized value," Mr. Hansen said. "We're hopeful over time we will not have to resort to incentives."
Ford is hoping the lower prices will spur sales, as it did last year. For example, Ford decreased the prices of the Mustang, the two-door Explorer and Escort ZX2 for the 1998 model year, resulting in double-digit sales increases. Prices were decreased for the small Ranger pickup, and sales doubled. For 1999, the Ranger will be offered with a flexible fuel engine -- one that burns ethanol and gasoline -- for no extra charge; flexible-fuel engines typically cost more than gasoline-only engines.
Ford also says it is the first auto manufacturer to eliminate the added charge for emissions equipment required in California, New York and Massachusetts. Ford previously charged $170.
On other cars, the Escort and Contour particularly, Ford added equipment for the same 1998 price. Mr. Hansen said that beyond competitive pressures, Ford's pricing strategy had been to not increase prices. This year's lower prices have been made possible by reducing costs. Ford reported a total of $4.3 billion in cost reductions in 1997 and through the first half of 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expects Ties to Improve Under Colombia's New President

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The Administration says the inauguration of President Andres Pastrana of Colombia should mean the end of years of ill will between his nation and the United States, especially if he moves quickly on a pledge to stem the flood of Colombian cocaine into the United States.
Mr. Pastrana was sworn in Friday, less than a week after returning from Washington, where he met with President Clinton. 
 The Administration's decision to offer Mr. Pastrana a pre-inauguration meeting at the White House was in stark contrast to its treatment of his predecessor, Ernesto Samper, who was denied a visa to the United States after evidence indicated that a drug cartel had provided $6 million for his 1994 election campaign.
Administration officials said that during his meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Pastrana, 43, a Conservative, had promised that he would try to shut down drug trafficking operations in Colombia, which are the source of most of the cocaine that ends up on American streets, and to end a decades-old guerrilla war.
Colombia, a country of 37 million, has been in the grip of an armed insurgency for 30 years. In many areas leftist guerrillas have allied themselves with drug traffickers, who underwrite their purchase of weapons.
Mr. Pastrana, a former television anchor who understands the value of dramatic images, ventured into the Colombian jungle last month to meet with the leaders of the largest insurgent group. He has promised to begin formal peace talks in the first three months of his administration.
James Dobbins, senior director for inter-American affairs at the National Security Council, said President Clinton had "expressed admiration for the courage Pastrana had shown in his election and in his steps immediately after the election."
Administration officials said they believed that by tackling the insurgency, Mr. Pastrana might be able to curb the narcotics trade.
During his Oval Office meeting, Mr. Dobbins said, Mr. Pastrana said the two problems were inextricably linked, since the drug cultivation and trafficking generally took place in the areas where the insurgency was most active.
Mr. Dobbins said President Clinton had told Mr. Pastrana that "the United States wanted to support an integrated approach to the problems of drug trafficking and bringing peace, ending Colombia's civil conflict." He said Mr. Pastrana had already accepted an invitation to return to Washington in the fall for a state visit.
On Sunday Mr. Pastrana replaced his top military commanders after a series of embarrassing defeats in clashes with the guerrillas.
The Administration made Mr. Pastrana's job easier with its decision earlier this year to lift economic sanctions that had been imposed on Colombia for two years out of dissatisfaction with Mr. Samper's drug policies. The lifting of the sanctions, Mr. Dobbins said, offers "both Governments the opportunity for a new start."
Mr. Pastrana swept into office with the largest margin in his country's history. A former Senator and Mayor of Bogota, the capital, Mr. Pastrana will govern without a majority in Congress.

HEADLINE: Jess J. Present, 77, Legislator and G.O.P. Leader

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
State Senator Jess Joseph Present, a Republican leader from upstate New York who spent more than three decades in the State Legislature, died on Saturday at his home in Bemus Point, N.Y., near his native Jamestown. He was 77.
A heart attack was the apparent cause, the Senate press office reported. 
 Since his election to the Senate from Chautauqua County in southwest New York, he had filled a string of important committee assignments. But his influence fell victim to party infighting in recent years.
He was closely allied with Ralph J. Marino, the majority leader from Oyster Bay, N.Y., who was a rival to his fellow Senator, George E. Pataki, from Peekskill, N.Y. Mr. Marino chose Mr. Present as his deputy majority leader in 1993.
With Mr. Pataki moving into the Governor's office after the 1994 election, Senator Joseph L. Bruno of Rensselaer County engineered Mr. Marino's ouster and succeeded him as majority leader. In January, Mr. Bruno named a new deputy, and Mr. Present retired from that post.
At his death, Mr. Present was chairman of the Senate Commerce, Economic Development and Small Business Committee and a member of the National Legislatures' Committee on Commerce, Labor and Economic Development. His 56th Senate District covers Chautauqua, Allegany, Livingston and Cattaraugus Counties.
Senator Present survived a scare in the 1992 election when it appeared at first blush that he had lost his seat to a Democrat, but the completed count of absentee ballots returned him to Albany once again with just 190 votes to spare. The last time around, in 1996, he sailed past his Democratic challenger with a winning vote of 69 percent to 31.
Mr. Present attended Allegheny College but enlisted in World War II to serve with the Eighth Air Force in England. After the war, he worked in a family jewelry business in Jamestown.
He started his political career in 1960 as a Jamestown City Councilman, serving until 1963. He represented the Jamestown area in the State Assembly from 1965 until he was elected in 1968 to the State Senate, where he concentrated on commerce and education. He was a past chairman of the Chautauqua County Republican Committee.
He is survived by his wife, Elaine Coates Present; two sons, Jeffrey B. and Randall L., both of Bemus Point; two brothers, William E., of Lakewood, N.Y., and Leonard R., of West Bloomfield, Mich; a sister, Anna Rae, also of Bemus Point, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Steady as Strong Demand Is Expected at Auctions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bonds were little changed yesterday, with yields at one-month lows and prices at highs, reflecting expectations that Asian financial turmoil would bolster demand at the Treasury's $37 billion quarterly debt sale this week.
"There's a flight to quality that bodes well for U.S.-based assets," said Roger Hamilton, who helps manage $1.1 billion in bonds at John Hancock mutual funds in Boston. 
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 2/32 , or 67.5 cents per $1,000 bond, to a price of 1076/32 , nudging its yield down a basis point to 5.62 percent, the lowest since July 10. The yield on the two-year note rose a basis point, to 5.33 percent.
Thirty-year bond yields fell on July 6 to the lowest level -- 5.57 percent -- since the Government began regular sales of the securities in 1977, as international investors sought refuge in Treasury bonds.
The problems overseas may lead investors to snap up the $37 billion in new longer-term securities that the Government is putting up for auction this week. The Treasury will sell $16 billion of five-year notes today, followed by $11 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Of the new securities, about $27.8 billion of debt is being refinanced and $9.2 billion in cash is being raised by the Treasury.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills:
 

(000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.751	97.503	Discounted Rate	4.94%	4.94%	Coupon Yield	5.07%	5.13%	High Price	98.759	97.513	Discounted Rate	4.91%	4.92%	Coupon Yield	5.04%	5.11%	Low Price	98.751	97.503	Discounted Rate	4.94%	4.94%	Coupon Yield	5.07%	5.13%	Accepted at low price	82%	97%	Total applied for	$31,947,325	$31,206,185	Accepted	$8,807,771	$11,434,011	Noncompetitive	$1,290,062	$1,318,594

HEADLINE: For Sale: 5% of Maine, Plenty of Trees

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, Me.

 BODY:
Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of forest a swath that is about 5 percent of the land in Maine -- is for sale in the northern part of the state, prompting a debate over the future of the heavily logged yet alluring woods.
Conservation groups have called for selling the land to the public to restore it to its original wilderness. Many residents here are more comfortable with the status quo of much of the century: industrial logging of the land by timber companies that give the public free access for hunting, fishing, boating, snowmobiling and other sport. But people in both camps worry that some land -- only a six-hour drive from Boston and featuring miles of undeveloped lake shores -- will be developed, profitably but irretrievably, for more tourism, recreation and country houses. 
 As paper companies liquidate their land holdings in the Northeast to raise money for their mills, millions of timbered acres from northern Maine to the Adirondacks of New York are either for sale or being considered for sale, making their availability one of the latest conservation issues in the region.
"Across the Northern Forest region, three and a half million acres of incredibly valuable land are for sale by willing sellers," said Andrea Colnes, executive director of the Northern Forest Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups. "It is historic, and it will have a defining impact on the region."
But the issue is most pressing in Maine, where practically all open land is owned by industrial forestry companies. In an unexpected move last June, Sappi Ltd., a South African paper company, announced that it would sell 911,000 acres. And another company, Bowater Inc., has said it will consider selling all of its Maine holdings, more than two million acres, after completing a pending $2.5 billion acquisition of Avenor Inc., a Canadian forest products company. In all, as much as 15 percent of the state may be for sale.
Sappi, which gained control of the land four years ago when it acquired the S. D. Warren Company's forestry operations from the Scott Paper Company, is selling heavily harvested softwood tracts in wild mountains, moose country glittering with countless lakes, streams and bogs.
As timberland it is worth at least $200 an acre, but some waterfront sections are prime real estate, and the ecological worth is inestimable.
Quietly, state conservation groups and private bidders are trying to put together deals for Sappi land, although details are not known. Their ideas include buying conservation easements or critical tracts and more far-reaching plans.
And while the tracts are so big that other paper companies are the likeliest bidders -- the outcome Sappi says it prefers -- the new owners might be tempted to carve out prime parcels for real estate developers, a prospect that has conservationists and many local people alarmed.
"East of the Mississippi, there isn't another area of wilderness-like terrain of this magnitude left anywhere," said Jim Glavine, who owns Beaver Cove Camps on Moosehead Lake, at 75,000 acres the largest lake in New England. "If you look across the shoreline, you don't see anything. Essentially, there is nothing. There are no lights to see in the evening.
"This is an opportunity for conservation-minded folks and residents and people who live and work in the area and make a living from everything from forestry to tourism to see to it that what we see when we look out across this lake doesn't change."
The most ambitious plan, if not the likeliest, would convert most of Sappi and Bowater's lands, along with other tracts, into a huge national park including parts of the Allegash Wilderness Waterway, surrounding Baxter State Park and Moosehead Lake and the 100-Mile Wilderness stretch of the Appalachian Trail.
Jym St. Pierre, the Maine director for Restore the North Woods, a conservation group that advocates creating a 3.2-million-acre national park and preserve, said, "From Mount Katahdin to Moosehead Lake, the region has the collection of natural, cultural and historic resources that qualify it for a park, and it has large ownerships with land for sale and is virtually uninhabited."
But Gov. Angus King called plans for a national park misguided. "I am dead set against the idea," he said in an interview. Like many other political leaders in Maine, he views the timber industry as too important to supplant.
Mr. King said that though it was not feasible for the state to acquire the whole tract, it hoped to make a bid for part of the land for conservation soon.
Many local residents join the Governor in not embracing the creation of a national park. People are used to the gravel scrapes and clear-cut scabs that tally forestry's contribution to the state's economy and its effects on the state's environment.
"If someone buys the land and won't let us cut on it, we are all going to be out of a job," said Charles Libby Sr., a trucker who was about to haul a semi-trailer of chips to a pulp mill. "Right now, the way I feel, we have enough tourists up here. We lock the gate down on the Interstate, it wouldn't bother me a bit. Keep them out. We've got plenty of parks."
The biggest concern of many people who live in and near the woods is that they would lose access to the land if the Government took it over.
Even though forest product companies control almost all of the woods, they let anyone fish or hunt, hike or ski, or cross their property in canoes or snowmobiles.
"Most of the tourists who come up here are ecotourists," said Toni Blake, executive director of the Moosehead Chamber of Commerce, based in Greenville at the foot of the antler-shaped lake. "They want to do the hiking and the biking and to get out in the woods. Snowmobiling is a big industry, and I think that would all change. A national park is something that sets restrictions."
Fred Candeloro, who owns a sporting camp in Kokadjo, said: "Right now with Sappi, we have the best land-use deal in the world."
The park's advocates are proposing that part of it be held as a preserve open to uses like hunting that are not allowed in parks.
"The conundrum of the whole thing," said Garrett Conover, a canoeing outfitter and guide, "is the people of Maine are desperately afraid of Federal controls because of lack of access."
He supports public acquisition of the land, which despite the relentless logging he considers the best canoeing region this side of Minnesota.
"Nobody in history ever made the mistake of putting aside too much wilderness," Mr. Conover said.

HEADLINE: The Courtship Of Black Consumers;
Corporate America Absorbs a Growing Number of Minority-Owned Businesses

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Long before other girls her age were torturing their tresses with hot combs and chemical straighteners, Terri Gardner and her dog, a mutt named Cinnamon, became testers for the shampoos and pomades her father mixed in the basement of their brick bungalow on Chicago's South Side.
One day, Edward Gardner would slather Cinnamon with creams he concocted to condition coarse, curly hair. The next, he would coat his 8-year-old daughter's brown locks with a thick glaze he envisioned other black women and girls using to style their bobs and finger waves. 
 On occasion, the experiments would go horribly wrong, including one that left the girl's hair and hands tinted mauve for weeks. In time, though, Mr. Gardner perfected his techniques, and the business he created with his wife, Bettiann, grew into Soft Sheen Products Inc., one of the largest ethnic hair-products companies in the country, with sales last year of $80 million.
Last month, though, Ms. Gardner, now 42 and Soft Sheen's president and chief executive, and the rest of the Gardner family took a hard look at market trends and decided to sell their company to L'Oreal S.A. of France, the world's largest cosmetics company. The Gardners figured that with corporate giants chasing the increasingly lucrative African-American market, their growth prospects were dim without access to more capital.
L'Oreal, for its part, saw Soft Sheen as a gateway to consumers whose needs and neighborhoods it had overlooked.
As it turns out, the same calculations that lay behind the L'Oreal acquisition are powering lots of other deals around the United States. Black-owned companies in areas like beauty products, funeral services and insurance, which first thrived in a segregationist era, are deciding that it makes more sense to join big corporations than fight them. And though blacks are steadily creating businesses in a wider range of fields than ever before, some see the recent acquisitions as an unfortunate end of control by the pioneers of black entrepreneurship in this country.
At the same time, corporations buying the companies are doing so because they are waking up to an explosion of black economic strength. A study released last month by the University of Georgia's Selig Center for Economic Growth calculated that black purchasing power would reach $533 billion in 1999, up 73 percent from $308 billion in 1990, compared with a 57 percent increase projected for all Americans. Such income growth "should create tremendous opportunities for businesses that pay attention to the needs and preferences of African-American consumers," said Dr. Jeffrey M. Humphreys, a University of Georgia economist.
As a result, companies born in storefronts and basements in the 1950's and 60's that grew into thriving enterprises in the 70's and 80's have become guests at corporate America's latest merger party. It is a little-noticed trend that stands in contrast to the deal-making boom of a decade ago, when black-owned companies stayed largely on the sidelines.
To be sure, there have been high-profile sales of black-owned companies in the past, such as the acquisition of Motown Records by a consortium headed by MCA Records in 1988. But though no one has exact figures, marketing specialists say the pace has picked up in recent years. One of the biggest transactions was IVX Bioscience Inc.'s purchase of the Johnson Products Company, which makes ethnic cosmetics and hair care products, in 1993 for $67 million in stock. (IVX sold the unit last month to Carson Inc. for $85 million.)
Also in 1993, the Shorebank Corporation of Chicago bought Indecorp Inc., the second-largest black-owned banking concern in that city.
These are among the deals concluded since then:
*The acquisition in 1996 of U S Radio, then the largest black-owned radio group in the country, with 25 stations, by Clear Channel Communications.
*The purchase by Stewart Enterprises, a multinational conglomerate of more than 500 funeral homes and 135 cemeteries, of the Hillcrest funeral parlor in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1996 from its black and Hispanic owners for $1 million.
*The 1997 merger of Garrett & Davenport in Raleigh, N.C., the state's oldest minority-owned certified public-accounting firm, with Cherry Bekaert & Holland of Richmond, the largest accounting firm in the Southeast.
*The sale last March by the Universal Life Insurance Company, a venerable concern started 75 years ago, of the bulk of its business to the American Capital Life Insurance Company for $13 million.
The acquisition in May of McNeely & Associates in Milwaukee, one of Wisconsin's largest African-American law firms, by the Milwaukee firm of Domnitz Mawicke Goisman & Rosenberg.
*L'Oreal's agreement last month to buy Soft Sheen for an undisclosed price that one analyst estimated at well above $160 million.
"You are starting to see a lot of larger black-owned companies becoming attractive targets for other large companies that want to reach in and expand their market," said Alfred A. Edmond Jr., executive editor of Black Enterprise magazine.
Though the owners of the acquired companies can expect a handsome payoff, not everyone views the changing of the guard as cause for celebration. "It is the alligator eating up the goldfish," said the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, whose Rainbow/PUSH coalition has been calling for more career opportunities and access to investment capital for members of minorities so they can more often be the acquirer in these deals.
Some large corporations, of course, have long been developing products and services aimed at black consumers. But now, more corporations are looking for a quicker route to African-Americans' pocketbooks by snapping up businesses whose legacies and brands, like Ebony magazine and Soft Sheen's Optimum hair relaxer, are as well known in ethnic households as Tide and Colgate are.
"It's all about the numbers," said Lafayette Jones, chief executive of Segmented Marketing Services Inc. in Winston-Salem, N.C., an ethnic-marketing consultant. "The American population is increasingly becoming ethnic, and by ethnic I mean African-American, Latino and Asian. We are talking about $750 billion in collective spending power."
And it's not just Americans that big multinationals are aiming at. Many believe that buying brands that have become cultural icons that represent ethnic Americana holds huge appeal in Africa and other developing countries. L'Oreal, for example, is adding to its arsenal such popular products as Soft Sheen Hair and Scalp conditioner, which softened Afros in the 1960's, and Care Free Curl activator, which was used to create the trendy mop of glossy ringlets in the 1980's known as "the curl."
Soft Sheen products are key to the company's strategy to expand into countries with a need for ethnic hair and cosmetics products. "Africa is the new major area of development for us," said Guy Peyrelongue, president and chief executive officer of L'Oreal's American subsidiary, Cosmair Inc.
The cosmetics giant's international ambitions helped persuade the Gardners to let go of their company. "We knew we had to compete with bigger players with deeper pockets," said Ms. Gardner, who will continue to run Soft Sheen for L'Oreal and will join the board of Cosmair.
As for Edward Gardner, he was once so singularly focused on the business brewing in his basement that his two sons and two daughters often waited for dinner until Bettiann Gardner retrieved her pots and pans and washed off the chemicals. Now, at 73, he takes a remarkably unsentimental view about relinquishing his venture. "Selling the company to me is just a phase, just like starting the company," he said.
Despite Mr. Jackson's lament that old-time black companies are being picked off by corporate America, there is plenty of evidence that black entrepreneurs have broken into industries that were largely closed to them in the days when Mr. Jackson was marching alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blacks are pursuing their entrepreneurial ambitions in industries ranging from computer software to musical production to cable-television programming.
Moreover, some black business pioneers are resisting pressures to sell. One is John H. Johnson, founder and chairman of the Johnson Publishing Company, which puts out Ebony and Jet magazines.
"The big companies have been asleep and are awake now and realize there are great opportunities out there," said Mr. Johnson, who founded Johnson Publishing in 1942 when he was 24 and who added a cosmetics business to his empire in 1973 to cater to women with skin tones that range from coffee with and without cream. "They are making offers that are hard to refuse."
Mr. Johnson said he saw nothing wrong with others selling their businesses, but do not look for his family name to be peeled off the office door. He said he routinely received calls from investment bankers whose clients wanted to buy his business -- and has instructed his secretary not to put them through. "I have a granddaughter who is 9 years old, and she is already saying she is going to take over," he said.
Harold Shaw Jr., the great-grandson of the founder of Universal Life Insurance, grew up with similar aspirations but is now reeling from poor succession planning and a failure to keep pace with changes in technology.
Mr. Shaw, 35, who heads the company's underwriting division, said the financial outlook had become so bleak that in March the company was forced to sell $53 million in life insurance premium obligations to American Capital Life for $13 million. The company now believes the best option might be to unload the rest.
"It's a challenge for me personally and professionally to have to try to make something happen out of this," Mr. Shaw said, his voice trailing off. "But it will come down to prudent and real business decisions, not emotion," he added more forcefully.
Like Universal Life, Hillcrest, the funeral home in Albuquerque, faced the same fate when much bigger corporate rivals intruded on its turf. At first, the owners pinned their hopes on the loyalty of the black and Hispanic communities that they served. But those hopes faded fast after the big rivals began hiring black employees and slashing prices.
"They would open a cut-rate facility and sell services for $2,000 complete, and at the other end of town sell them for $6,000 -- and the same company owned both places," said Eddie White, a Hillcrest partner. When Hillcrest fell behind on its taxes, he said, he and his partner sold out.
Stewart Enterprises, Hillcrest's current owner, says it does not try to drive local operators out of business when it enters a market.
Though Mr. Jackson acknowledges that market forces are altering the complexion of black business, he worries that something precious will be lost.
"In the end, we'll have less pride, we'll have less control," Mr. Jackson said, "and a level of infrastructure that took years to build will go in a minute or two."

On the Whole, Caribbean Isle Is Not Part of a Sum

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CHARLESTOWN, Nevis, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Barely two miles of water separate the pair of islands that make up the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Kitts and Nevis. But if the 10,000 or so people who live on the 36-square-mile speck of land called Nevis voted as predicted today in a referendum on secession, the smallest country in the Western Hemipshere will soon be severed in two.
The United States and leaders of other Caribbean nations may worry that Nevis is too small to stand on its own. But local leaders say they cannot wait for Nevis to leave behind its status as junior partner to St. Kitts, to take control of its destiny and to become an independent state with its own voice at the United Nations. 
 "The people in St. Kitts don't know what the problems are over here," said Vance Amory, the premier of Nevis, who has led the drive for secession. "Nevis is something they have forgotten about, and we cannot continue to operate on the basis of tokenism. The days have passed when we can be told to be quiet."
On one level the issue on the ballot in this charming, cloud-capped island 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico could not be simpler or more direct. "Do you approve of the Nevis secession bill and Nevis becoming an independent state separate from St. Kitts?" Nevis residents were asked. Voters in St. Kitts, which has about 36,000 people, were not eligible to take part.
For the proposal to be approved, two-thirds of the ballots cast must be in the affirmative. An informal poll conducted by The St. Kitts-Nevis Observer, a weekly, found that more than 70 percent of potential voters favored secession. Moreover, in a nonbinding ballot in the 1970's, 80 percent favored independence.
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas has said he will honor the result of the vote, whatever it is. "My Government stands ready to assist with whatever choice you make," he said in Parliament last week, so that St. Kitts and Nevis (pronounced NEE-vis) "can continue to live in harmony and prosperity."
But Mr. Douglas has also made clear his regret that "the secessionsit genie is out of the bottle" and predicted "disastrous consequences" if the nation split apart. To take such a step, he argued, is an act of provincialism defying the logic that has led to the creation of the European Union and a global economy.
"The people of St. Kitts and Nevis have more in common than the people of Germany and France," he argued. "If it were not for the water that separates us, there would be no justification for secession."
To outsiders, the differences between Kittitians (kit-TISH-uns) and Nevisians (neh-VISH-ans), as residents of the two islands call themselves, are indeed virtually imperceptible. But Nevisians have always complained about being forced into union with St. Kitts, a step that Britain took during colonial rule more than 100 years ago for administrative convenience. They have clung to the notion of a separate identity.
"It's only two miles of water," said Bernard Brooks, 43, who works as a taxi driver in the United States Virgin Islands but came home to vote for secession and take part in summer carnival. "But if you travel, you'll find there's a big difference between the people. Nevis people are more gentle, more polite."
St. Kitts and Nevis became independent of Britain in 1983. Its Constitution established the capital in Basseterre, on St. Kitts, and created a Parliament that reserved eight seats for St. Kitts and three for Nevis. The charter also included a provision allowing Nevis to secede, and last year, after much debate, the Nevis Island Assembly unanimously approved the vote on the issue.
Since independence from Britain, both islands have depended heavily on tourism and their respective financial sectors. But even on those points there are disagreements. People in Nevis complain that St. Kitts is trying to strangle the Nevis economy with offshore legislation and that too much of the revenue generated by Nevis from upscale tourism remains on the other island.
Nevis is for "high net-worth individuals," attracting Hollywood celebrities and British royalty, explained Mark Brantley, an Oxford-educated Nevis lawyer who is a leader of the independence drive. By contrast, he maintained, St. Kitts attracts "low-scale package tours, the secretary who saves up all year for a week in the sun," but it has the more modern airport.
The vote is being watched with some anxiety by members of the Caribbean Community, or Caricom, a regional trade and political grouping of 16 small and predominantly English-speaking nations. Several are also multi-island states whose smaller components have been known to chafe at their status, among them Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. There are fears that secession fever could spread.
As Edwin Carrington, secretary general of the group, said last week, "It is a source of great concern to us if there is to be a fragmentation of St. Kitts and Nevis and a creation of yet another micro-ministate in our region when all the implications and dangers that it entails come at a time when we are to integrate and not disintegrate." Mr. Carrington called the vote the region's most serious challenge since the American invasion of Grenada in 1983.
The United States, evidently alarmed that a ministate might be vulnerable to the pressures or blandishments of drug cartels, has echoed those worries. "Maintaining the federation would be more compatible with the trend toward greater regional integration, with all its considerable benefits and advantages," the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said recently.
But Mr. Amory, the premier, rejected any suggestion that Nevis would be worse off on its own. "Size is not an indication of viability," he said in an interview. "There are some large countries in Africa that are not viable states," he asserted, pointing out that several small island states, among them Singapore, Nauru and Tonga, are flourishing.
Because of "technology and the way institutions are established," he added, "that idea of a criticial mass can no longer be used as a criterion."
Those who favor remaining in a federation with St. Kitts stress practical issues, none of which have been negotiated in advance of the vote. Fishermen wonder whether they will be barred from St. Kitts waters; store owners fear that tariffs may be imposed on goods moving from one island to the other, and others ask where the money for public services will come from.
"I don't think we're in a sufficient state of preparedness," said Trevor Chapman, owner of a grocery store here. "There hasn't been enough education, and there are still too many unanswered questions, the primary of which is what will be the source of our income? It's not going to be no bed of roses."

HEADLINE: Taxes Help Foot the Payrolls As States Vie for Employers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Since the 1950's, state governments have lured corporations with expensive incentives such as free factories, canceled property taxes, low-interest loans, free access roads and special tax credits. Now in the 1990's, the competition among states and even Mexico to attract companies has spawned a new incentive, one strikingly uncharacteristic for a free market economy: wage rebates.
Wage rebates allow companies to lower their labor costs through taxpayer-financed subsidies. For each job created by a relocated or existing company, a state reimburses the company for part of the wages paid. These subsidies, offered by only 8 states in 1989, are now offered by 21 states, mostly in the South and Midwest, according to the Council of State Governments, a research group financed by the states. 
 Consider Whirlpool, which opened a stove factory in Tulsa, Okla., two years ago and hired more than 1,100 workers. For 10 years, it will get back 4.5 cents of every dollar paid in wages to those workers.
In all, nearly one million jobs appear to be covered by the rebates, judging from the few states that report new jobs. In some states, including Oklahoma and Ohio, the wage subsidy has become the single most expensive corporate lure. It is costing Ohio taxpayers more than $25 million a year. In other states, including New Jersey, North Carolina and Maine, it is the fastest-growing corporate incentive.
When wage rebates began to spread in the mid-1990's, the unemployment rate was higher than it is today, and states were struggling to generate new jobs. Now, a robust economy is generating millions of new jobs, pushing the unemployment rate to its lowest level in decades. That is raising questions about the value of taxpayer-financed wage rebates, which increasingly reward companies for creating jobs they would have created anyway.
"The real issue is whether, in a tight labor market, these rebates have turned into a windfall for the companies," said Van Doorn Ooms, research director of the Committee for Economic Development, a research group supported by business. "In a high-unemployment situation, wage rebates are useful as a stimulus for creating jobs. In a tight labor market, they are more likely to simply pass on some of the cost of labor to the taxpayer from the employer."
Mitchell Gold shares that view, although he does not put it that bluntly. The Mitchell Gold Company, which he owns, makes upholstered furniture in Taylorsville, N.C. -- furniture sold through Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel stores. With business thriving, Mr. Gold decided to expand a year ago. He looked into the incentives available from North Carolina and found that his company qualified for a wage rebate.
So for the 80 workers being added to the company's 250-member work force, Mitchell Gold will get back a portion of the state income taxes withheld from each employee's check for four years. The rebate is equal to roughly 2 percent of the typical worker's annual pay.
"Frankly I would have stayed in North Carolina and expanded without the wage rebate," Mr. Gold said, "but in a competitive, labor-intensive business, every little bit helps."
The subsidies are almost always restricted to manufacturers and high-end service companies that bring "good jobs"; that is, jobs paying more than $7.50 an hour. The Oklahoma rebate law, for example, applies only to jobs that pay at least $9 an hour and carry health insurance benefits. Temporary workers are ruled out. So are people who move to the state for the new jobs.
Such rules let the states alter the marketplace in a form of industrial policy much criticized by those who advocate a reduced role for government. "We are becoming more regulated at the state level even as we become less so at the Federal level," said John Bishop, a Cornell University labor economist.
As Joseph Kramer, vice president for economic development of the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, sees it: "Wage rebates have become a very important modern-era incentive for companies. And they are pay as you go, much more than other incentives. A company does not get the rebate until after the new worker is actually on the payroll."
Mimicry plays a big role in the spread of wage subsidies. The Maryland Legislature, for example, enacted a subsidy in 1996 and expanded it last year to cover more industries because neighboring Virginia had such a subsidy. Similarly, the Ohio Legislature quickly followed Kentucky's lead in 1992, prodded by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber, which feared that companies would choose to build in Cincinnati's suburbs on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River.
Ohio will soon have 100,000 jobs covered by wage rebates, state officials say. And Kentucky is moving up quickly, having recently agreed to rebate a portion of the wages for 6,000 jobs that United Parcel Service is creating at a distribution hub being built in Louisville. U.P.S. officials have pointed to the wage credits, totaling $3.5 million a year for 10 years, as a key reason for choosing Kentucky for the new hub. And such thinking pops up frequently.
"Not to have a wage-reimbursement program today is a terrible thing," said Jerry Wade, a research economist at the Department of Business and Economic Development in Maryland. "When Virginia adopted a wage subsidy next door, we found ourselves telling companies that we would have one, too. The perception was that Virginia, because of its subsidy, had a better overall business climate than we did."
Mexico also looms in the equation. Oklahoma's subsidy, lowering the cost of labor, led Whirlpool to put its stove factory in Tulsa rather than in another state or in northern Mexico, where the company already has factories.
"We had four states and Mexico under consideration, and Oklahoma gave us the Quality Jobs Act," as the wage-rebate legislation is known, said Thomas Vining, a Whirlpool vice president. "That incentive, along with another incentive, were the tie-breakers." The second incentive was a diversion of the county sales tax revenue for a year to pay for construction of the Whirlpool factory.
The wage reimbursements take several forms. Some states, like Ohio, offer a credit against corporate income taxes, and if the corporate tax is not sufficient, they send out checks to cover the difference. Other states cap the reimbursement. The state income tax provides the other most common way of handling the rebates. In this version, states return to the company a portion of the taxes withheld from qualified employees at the end of each year.
Whatever the mechanism, officials in states with the rebates increasingly argue that they are the most efficient incentive in creating jobs. Unlike the other incentives -- investment tax credits, for example, or state-financed factory construction -- no taxpayer money goes for wage rebates until the jobs exist. Even then, the jobs must last for a certain number of years or the companies must give back the rebates.
In many states, a company must create 25 jobs a year to qualify for a rebate. Maryland has set the minimum at 60, pointedly undercutting the 100-job requirement in Virginia.
"We view wage reimbursement as revenue neutral," said Lisa Cruz, spokeswoman for the Department of Commerce and Economic Development in New Jersey, the only state in the New York metropolitan area that has adopted the rebates. In the two years since New Jersey began to provide rebates, some 30,000 new jobs have qualified for the credit, which goes as high as $3,800 a year for a single $75,000-a-year employee. "These workers," Ms. Cruz said, "generate sales taxes and corporate income taxes that would not otherwise have existed."
Such big corporations as Raytheon, Hewlett-Packard and Bristol-Myers Squibb, having put new operations in New Jersey over the last two years, are now receiving wage rebates for more than 1,700 of their employees, all of them earning the minimum of $7.73 an hour required by New Jersey law, or 150 percent of the Federal minimum wage.
Competition with nearby Maryland played a role in Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's decision to ask the Legislature for a wage rebate program. "Our strategy has been to tie state-funded incentives directly to the creation of good jobs," said Gil Medina, Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Economic Development in New Jersey.
Wage subsidies have existed for years in a different form, as part of a social welfare program. In these programs, companies receive wage rebates to create jobs in inner cities and other areas of high unemployment or hire people on welfare, ex-felons and others who have trouble finding work. More than 40 states offer such wage rebates, usually in the form of a tax credit, as does the Federal Government. The programs aim to help the disadvantaged, who would otherwise not have jobs, even in tight labor markets.
California, New York and Connecticut have such programs, arguing in effect that taxpayer-financed wage subsidies should be aimed at encouraging employment of the needy and not employment of people who are already sufficiently skilled to be attractive to corporations. The legislatures of these three states have never enacted wage rebates for high-skilled, high-wage jobs.
"We have not had to take that step," said Chris Holben, an under secretary of trade and commerce in California. "Yes, we are constantly told by companies considering California that other states will give them a wage rebate, and why not us. We believe the package of incentives that we do offer is sufficient. And we have a strategic advantage: We serve the Pacific Rim and the Mexican market."
At the national level, Congress enacted a broad wage rebate program in 1976, like those now proliferating among the states. The program was intended to stimulate job creation in the wake of the mid-1970's recession. To qualify, a company had to increase its employment by 2 percent in a single year. If it did, it received a corporate income tax credit equal to half of the first $4,200 of each new worker's wages.
The program did generate jobs, according to a study done by Mr. Bishop of Cornell. But it was phased out after two years as too expensive, having cost $4.5 billion in 1978 alone.
The wage rebates and all the other incentives used by states to entice companies face a similar criticism today. "We are funneling tens of billions of dollars into shifting jobs from one state to another," said Charles Horn, a Republican State Senator in Ohio. "That money should be going to schools and roads and other public outlays that would make states truly more competitive."
The House of Representatives has before it a bill, introduced by David Minge, Democrat of Minnesota, that would force corporations to declare as income all the state incentive payments they receive each year. These would then be taxed at the Federal level. Arthur Rolnick, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, supports the measure, and even goes a step further. He wants state incentive payments outlawed as illegal obstacles to interstate commerce.
"Congress has the authority," he said, "under the commerce clause of the Constitution to end this war between the states."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Man of OutsizedActs and Spending

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Garth H. Drabinsky, the Canadian showman whose flamboyant rise to prominence on Broadway has apparently come to a halt, was a man who inspired both admiration and resentment from his colleagues in the staid business of live theater.
Mr. Drabinsky, ousted yesterday as chief creative director of Livent Inc., the theater company he helped found, was known for outspending rival producers for actors' salaries, stage sets and advertising. As a result, he was long the subject of suspicion among those who could not figure out how he made the numbers add up. 
 At the same time, many of his loudest critics gave him credit for his accomplishments: the lush and lovely revival of "Show Boat," which ran for two years at the Gershwin Theater and recouped its cost, though at $10 million it was very likely the most expensive musical revival of all time; the construction, on time and on budget, of the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on West 42d Street, a nearly universally praised building that, with musical theater houses in short supply, Broadway and New York City needed, and the original musical "Ragtime," which won four Tony Awards and is virtually selling out at the Ford Center eight times a week.
"I admired his passion and commitment to his goal, which was the production of quality theater that would appeal to and reach worldwide audiences," said John F. Breglio, an entertainment lawyer who has had wide dealings with Mr. Drabinsky. "But as an outside observer, I was confounded by certain business decisions, namely the production and advertising costs, which seemed to contradict good economic sense."
Mr. Drabinsky, 48, is known as a man with expensive tastes, considerable self-regard and no lack of confidence. The profile of a man who would spend lavishly, perhaps recklessly, to support and sell his artistic vision is in sync with Mr. Drabinsky's reputation for arrogance and hubris. And he has been cut down before.
In 1979, he founded Cineplex Odeon, the movie theater concern, building it over a decade from an 18-screen complex in Toronto to an 1,800-screen chain throughout the United States and Canada. But in his expansion plans, which included film production and distribution and forays into live theater, he ran afoul of MCA, the partner he had taken on in 1986 to avert bankruptcy. MCA dismissed him in 1989.
As severance, he took with him the company's live entertainment division, consisting of two assets: the newly renovated Pantages Theater in Toronto, and the right to present in it the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical "The Phantom of the Opera." That was the foundation of Livent.
Now, having once again taken on partners to avert financial disaster, history has repeated itself, as he has again been dismissed from the company he created.
Since Livent was revamped in April, Mr. Drabinsky's position has been widely speculated to be precarious, but yesterday's announcement was nonetheless surprising.
"I'm surprised and I'm sad, because our experience with Livent under Garth's direction has been excellent," said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42d Street, a nonprofit development agency that is effectively Livent's landlord for the Ford Center and that signed an agreement with Livent last week to take over the Times Square Theater, the last empty theater on 42d Street. (Livent has proposed to create within the current building a 500-seat house for plays and small musicals, a restaurant and offices.)
"We have other men who own theaters," Ms. Cahan said. "We don't have too many with such vivid dreams. It's sad what's happened to him."

HEADLINE: State Dept. Halts a Pioneering Boeing-Russian Space Venture

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Worried that sensitive aerospace data were being transferred overseas, the State Department has suspended all work between the Boeing Company and its Russian and Ukrainian partners in a pioneering venture meant to fire rockets into space from a floating platform at sea.
A State Department official said the department was working with the Defense Department and was passing along the results to the Customs and Justice Departments, which are looking into whether Boeing's transfers broke any American laws. 
 Neither Boeing nor the Government would spell out the nature of the offense that prompted the suspension, and it was unclear whether the trouble was more procedural than substantial.
The Boeing-led venture, Sea Launch, seeks to adapt Ukrainian and Russian rocket technologies to tap an emerging market for the lofting of hundreds of communication satellites into orbit.
Boeing characterizes the work as turning swords into plowshares. Its Ukrainian partner, the Yuzhnoye design bureau and Yuzhmash production plant, once made the Soviet Union's deadliest missile, the SS-18.
A recent investigation in Washington over whether American aerospace companies aided Chinese rocket makers has brought the Boeing venture and similar endeavors under close scrutiny.
The suspension took place on July 27 and forced up to 40 Russian and Ukrainian engineers to leave the venture's home base in Long Beach, Calif., Timothy L. Dolan, a Boeing spokesman, said yesterday. Mr. Dolan had no estimate of how long the suspension might last or whether it would delay the sea rocket's inaugural launching.
The rocket's rise with a communication satellite from a floating platform in the Pacific would be a space-age first.
"We're putting all our efforts into working with State to get these matters resolved," he said. "We want the suspension to be as brief as possible."
But a Government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said: "This is a big project. We would not suspend it unless there were serious concerns."
Mr. Dolan said Sea Launch was responsible for about 10,000 jobs in the Ukraine and Russia.
"It's very important from that standpoint," he said. "It's very good for economic stability in that region. And it's a program for which there was no existing template. Few of us have walked this way before."
The suspension was done without public announcement and was first reported on Saturday in The Washington Post.
The State Departmentsuspended Boeing's technical assistance agreement, a Federal official said yesterday. This plan, agreed to by Boeing and the Government in April 1995, spelled out the rules by which the company would work with foreigners while protecting sensitive data.
A new plan is being worked out, Boeing and Federal officials said .
Space experts said the incident appeared to be part of a pattern of tightening in matters of national security, prompted mainly by the Chinese disclosures.
"Over the past few years, the climate has been to try to make these joint ventures work, with only secondary emphasis on concerns about technology transfer," said John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. "Now the pendulum is swinging back to more of a balance between economic and security interests."
The mystery in this case is that Russians and Ukrainians are highly regarded as rocket makers, their work at times considered superior to that of the United States, especially their efficient engines. In contrast, Chinese rocketry is considered inferior.
Charles P. Vick, a rocket expert at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, said the trouble might have arisen because of integration problems in Sea Launch's rocket, the Zenit.
Mr. Vick said the Ukrainian rocket had flown out of Russia in a version with two stages but never with three, which is how Sea Launch wants it to fly for greater lifting power. Boeing's mistake, he said, may have been in supplying information to help tie an additional stage to the existing Zenit, a process that can be technically daunting. Boeing is an expert integrator.
"The security for these kinds of things has increased dramatically," Mr. Vick said. "The question is how far this goes before we start hurting ourselves" with broken promises and missed opportunities.
The team's Zenit rocket was originally scheduled for its first launching in October, Mr. Dolan said, but that date was recently pushed back to early 1999 by the satellite customer in a delay unrelated to the current investigation.

Earnings Rise59% At British Airways

BYLINE: Bridge News 

 BODY:
British Airways P.L.C., Europe's largest airline, said yesterday that its pretax profit for the three months that ended on June 30 rose 59 percent, excluding a one-time gain a year earlier. The airline earned a pretax profit of 145 million ($236 million), up from 91 million a year earlier after excluding a one-time profit of 129 million recorded from the sale of a stake in U S Airways Group Inc.
The carrier said, however, that it had lower passenger loads compared with a year earlier because of a "less strong economic situation in the U.K. and the Far East." The American depository receipts of British Airways fell yesterday, dropping $4.8125 each, to $91.4375, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: As Vacation Begins for Congress, Problems Follow the G.O.P. Home

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress left last week for their summer vacation deeply divided, fighting themselves as hard as they fought Democrats and unable to fill the policy vacuum left by the hobbled Clinton Presidency.
With only one month left in the Congressional session before mid-term elections that will decide control of the House and Senate, Republicans in both chambers have been unable to agree on a budget. They are squabbling over tax cuts. They have yet to send the White House one of the 13 spending bills needed to keep the Government running when the new fiscal year begins in October. 
 House Republicans now say they may not move forward with their own scaled-back antismoking bill, which they promised when the Senate legislation to regulate tobacco died.
"Trying to craft a bill that will garner a majority has been elusive," said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the chairman of the House Republican Conference.
Across the board, the divisions among social conservatives, moderates and the party's business wing have resulted in prominent broken promises and stalled spending bills.
Even tax cuts no longer seem to be the unifying force that they once were for Republicans.
Speaker Newt Gingrich sent his rank and file home with instructions to gin up a public outcry in August in favor of a House Republican plan to devote $700 billion of a projected $1.5 trillion Federal surplus over the next decade to tax cuts and dedicate the remaining surplus to Social Security.
But the tactic seemed as much about putting pressure on Senate Republicans who balk at the proposal as it was about staking out ground against the Democrats for the midterm election.
"When the American people learn about the size of the surplus," Mr. Gingrich said on Friday, "when the American people learn about the power of economic growth to save Social Security, when the American people learn about what we're proposing to do, I am confident that by September you will see virtually all of the senators on the Republican side in favor."
Senate leaders adamantly oppose tax cuts of such magnitude this year, and since the first days of the 1995 Republican revolution, the Republican-led Senate has usually been wary of the sweeping changes sought by the Republican-led House. Mr. Gingrich has conceded to other House members that, partly because of this stance, the House may end up getting only about $70 billion in tax cuts this year.
In some ways, the problems facing the Republicans are endemic to Congressional parties without a President to articulate an overarching message. Making matters worse for the Republicans is Mr. Clinton's skill at stealing their rhetoric, leaving them flummoxed with little to oppose. And not only do the Republicans lack one dominant figure, their Congressional leadership is hampered by one of the smallest House majorities this century.
Mr. Boehner, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House leadership, justifies the gap in policy making as the inevitable consequence of a natural pause between the set of domestic concerns that ended last summer with the balanced budget agreement with President Clinton and a new set of issues that he calls "not quite ready for prime time."
Those new concerns include the search for a way to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for the baby boom generation and the Republican push for tax cuts of historic magnitude in a new era of Federal budget surpluses.
"So there was by nature this vacuum that we were going to have to deal with this year," Mr. Boehner said.
Other Republicans say the party lost the unifying ideas that allowed the disparate elements of the party to unite in the past -- anti-Communism and the battle to erase the Federal budget deficit.
And so elements of the party check, or perhaps checkmate, each other.
The Senate has stalled legislation sought by social conservatives but opposed by business that would require sanctions against nations that persecute religion.
And despite Mr. Gingrich's pledge to business groups that he would push in July for financing for the International Monetary Fund, the House abruptly put the issue off until September, with Representative Dick Armey of Texas, Mr. Gingrich's second in command, leading the battle against the money.
In an odd pose for a party that once projected itself as internationalist, Mr. Armey recently took pride in his lack of interest in foreign travel. "I've been to Europe once," he said. "I don't have to go again."
Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska recently called the split between his party's business and social conservative wings "terribly dangerous."
"It could undermine our party," Mr. Hagel said. "It could defeat us in 2000 if we don't put our party back together."
The Democrats, accusing the Republicans of running a "do-nothing Congress," are hoping the Republican infighting can be turned to their advantage in their struggle to retake the House. And they underscore the lack of action constantly.
"This is a Bart Simpson Congress: underachievers and proud of it," Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, said as the House left for August. "Instead of working to address the real challenges, which most American families face, the Republicans continue to run out the clock."
But voters, when asked which party they would prefer to lead Congress, have put the two at a tie for months. And Democrats say surveys earlier this year by two White House pollsters, Mark Penn and Douglas Schoen, found that the public did not necessarily think a do-nothing Congress was bad -- as long as the economy was good.
So the Democrats are trying to highlight particular issues to show voters what it means to them if Congress has a scaled-back agenda. Their list of legislation left undone includes an antitobacco measure, regulation of health maintenance organizations, overhaul of the campaign finance system and higher spending on education.
Last week, House Republicans and Democrats each seemed to be spoiling for precisely the political confrontation that most scares Senate Republicans, a debate over whether the Republicans' proposal for a large tax cut would risk the long-term health of Social Security.
That allows each party to play to its traditional strengths.
"We will fight together to make sure Republicans don't betray our obligation to Social Security and the American people," Mr. Gephardt said. "If that's what they want to run on, that's good. Let's engage."
Mr. Gingrich, anticipating the Democratic line of attack, said that under current economic projections of the surplus, a tax cut of $700 billion would still leave $761 billion over 11 years to be set aside for Social Security.
"They want to keep all the money in Washington, frankly so they can spend it," the Speaker said.
The entire political mood could change in the fall, depending on the investigation of Whitewater and Mr. Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel. That in turn could affect whether Mr. Clinton and the Congress hurtle to another Government shutdown instead of reaching an agreement on tax cuts and spending.
After receiving a veto threat from the White House on seven spending bills, Republicans last week preemptively began accusing the Administration of seeking such a confrontation as a diversion from Mr. Clinton's troubles.
Mr. Gingrich himself was cautious about predicting the session's outcome.
"In my judgment," he said, "we'll get something done this fall unless the whole place melts down."

HEADLINE: What's Good for G.M. Is Good for Its Workers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "General Motors Plans to Build New, Efficient Assembly Plants" (front page, Aug. 6), you note that the United Automobile Workers is concerned that the plants will need fewer workers. Both G.M. and the U.A.W. are missing the obvious. If labor-saving devices were used for their legitimate purpose -- to reduce work time without a cut in pay -- the number of jobs would be maintained. 
 Managers and union leaders alike would have widespread support for such an approach. According to a U.S. News & World Report poll, 65 percent of Americans think that a movement to shorten the workweek is a good idea, while 62 percent of managers say shorter work hours would give employees an incentive to be more productive and would have little effect on living standards.

HEADLINE: Strikes and Asian Crisis Are Factors in U.S. Productivity Drop

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The productivity of United States workers fell in the second quarter, the Government said today, the first such drop in three years, as Asia's economic crisis and strikes at General Motors plants took a toll.
Productivity -- a measure of the time and effort of providing goods and services -- fell in the second quarter at an annual rate of two-tenths of 1 percent after surging at a 3.5 percent pace in the first three months of the year. 
 Still, second-quarter nonfarm productivity was 1.9 percent higher than it was in the corresponding three-month period a year ago and near the 2.4 percent year-over-year increase posted for the first quarter.
As economic growth picks up in the second half of the year, productivity should rise, too, analysts said.
"Even with this setback in the second quarter, the trend in productivity growth is pretty solid," said Mark Vitner, an economist with the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. "Productivity is decent enough that inflation concerns aren't likely to intensify."
The slower rate of productivity growth in the second quarter comes as no surprise to Federal Reserve policy makers. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, told Congress last month that a slowdown in second-quarter gross domestic product growth would likely result in weaker productivity for the period.
The drop in productivity in the second quarter was the first since the first quarter of 1995, when productivity fell at an annual rate of four-tenths of 1 percent. Analysts said productivity was depressed by two strikes against the General Motors Corporation in Flint, Mich., which shut down nearly all the company's North American plants.
"The G.M. strike cut into output growth," said Carol Stone, an economist with Nomura Securities Inc. in New York. "Cutting out 30 percent of the nation's auto industry is a problem." Additionally, the productivity slowdown to a certain extent was an effort on the part of manufacturers to reduce inventories, she said.
Fed policy makers are counting on productivity gains to compensate for the rising cost of workers.

HEADLINE: Adobe Systems Warns Loss Is Possible inThird Quarter

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Adobe Systems Inc. warned today that its third-quarter revenue would fall below analysts' expectations, resulting in a potential loss. Adobe also announced the departure of three senior executives and a reduction of 240 to 300 jobs, or 13 percent of its work force.
Shares of Adobe fell $1.375, to $30.8125, on Nasdaq before trading was halted for the company's announcement late in the afternoon. 
 Adobe, based in San Jose, Calif., is a leading maker of software programs used in publishing, including Photoshop, Illustrator, Pagemaker and the Postscript language used in printers. Although Adobe has modified many of its programs to take advantage of the Internet, and many are used to create Web sites, analysts said the company had run into difficulty exploiting the transition to electronic publishing.
"Adobe is a tremendously successful company in the print world, but they haven't really figured out the right products and strategy for making money and being successful on the Web," said Christopher J. Galvin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist.
Adobe also said in its announcement today that business continued to be hurt by Japan's recession. The company said that cost-cutting efforts, including the reduction of jobs, would lower expenses by as much as $60 million a year.
The company said revenue for the quarter that will end Aug. 28 was likely to be $220 million to $225 million, compared with $230 million in the quarter a year earlier.
After a one-time reorganization charge and other nonrecurring expenses, Adobe said, net income may break even or be a loss, compared with net income of $53.4 million in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts had expected Adobe to earn 52 cents a diluted share, according to First Call, which tracks company earnings.
Adobe also said today that three top executives, P. Jackson Bell, executive vice president and chief administrative officer; Robert Roblin, executive vice president for marketing, and Ross Bott, executive vice president for product divisions, had resigned.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
As the Yen Falls, Markets Fear Japanese Savers Will Look Elsewhere

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
As the yen falls to new lows against the dollar, ordinary investors are fleeing to other currencies, heightening concern that a fundamental shift in sentiment is under way against the yen.
Among the factors mentioned by currency traders as immediate causes of the yen's fall are the faltering stock market, doubts about the new Government's commitment to dealing with problems in the banking sector and the possibility that China might devalue its currency. 
 Such concerns pushed the yen down to a rate of 147.63 to the dollar in London trading early today, an eight-year low, and to 147.35 in New York later. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell for a seventh consecutive trading day, closing down 219.40 points, or 1.4 percent, at 15,406.99. In Hong Kong, the main stock index fell 3.6 percent, to 6,779.95. Most other Asian markets were also lower.
The biggest worry among currency traders is that the yen is reaching a level where Japanese housewives, who control the family purse strings and thus a vast pool of savings, are swapping their yen for dollars, German marks and pounds sterling.
"That's the main worry for me," said Steven Barrow, a currency strategist at Bear Stearns International in London. "The key here is what's happening to Japanese savings and the fear that ordinary Japanese are looking to send their cash abroad in droves."
The yen's slow erosion over the last few months has contributed to a surge in the Government's already large surplus in the current account, which measures the difference between income from foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net capital investment.
Few have been paying attention, however, to the even larger outflows from capital and investment accounts since last spring, a strong indication that Japanese households are beginning to seek higher returns and less volatility in other currencies.
Mr. Barrow noted that while the current account surplus has been running at one trillion to 1.5 trillion yen a month, according to Government figures issued in July, Japan's capital and investment accounts are running deficits of 2 to 2.5 trillion yen a month, reflecting a net outflow of money.
"While they're earning more foreign currency from trade, it seems they're only too willing to see even greater sums flowing back out to take advantage of higher yields elsewhere," he said.
One of the biggest factors in the decision last month by Moody's Investors Service, the credit-rating agency, to put Japan's triple-A rating on review for a possible downgrading was concern that the household sector had joined the flight to other currencies.
"Of particular concern is the potential for volatile portfolio shifts into foreign currency assets by Japanese residents in the post-Big Bang environment," Moody's said in its news release, referring to sweeping financial reform measures that went into effect on April 1.
And traders worry that the Government statistics fail to fully capture the flight from yen to dollars or other currencies. A shift of individual savings out of yen and into other currencies may not show up in the Government numbers because the money may never leave the country. Instead, it may sit in a foreign currency account at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Citibank, Sumitomo Bank and other banks that offer such accounts.
It is difficult to get a read on how big that shift is, however, since most banks refuse to disclose breakdowns of foreign-currency deposit accounts and yen deposit accounts.
Japanese bank officials contend that April's financial reform measures did not really enhance the ability of Japanese depositors to shift their savings into dollars and other currencies, but they do concede a marked uptick in demand for foreign-currency accounts since then.
Until this spring, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi was almost the only Japanese bank to promote foreign-currency accounts aggressively. Katsumi Tsuiji, a Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi spokesman, said the demand for those accounts had accelerated since April, although the increase was somewhat modest because the bank already had a significant part of the foreign-currency deposit market.
Mr. Tsuiji declined, however, to disclose the amount in foreign-currency deposits, as did a spokesman for Citibank.
Sumitomo Bank began offering foreign-currency deposit accounts in five different currencies last year, in advance of the financial reforms. A spokesman said that from March until the end of July, the amount of deposits held in foreign-currency accounts had increased 150 percent.
Few believe the Government is prepared to step in and try to stem that tide. In the past, intervention has taken place only in advance of a significant policy development, and there is no new policy in sight.
Indeed, various senior officials of the ruling party have expressed dissatisfaction with the yen's direction in recent days, but to no avail. Today, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa hinted obliquely that the Government might move to prop up the yen, and Eisuke Sakakibara, Vice Minister of Finance for international affairs, suggested that the Group of Seven industrial nations would join in support of the Japanese currency.
Mr. Miyazawa, noting the negative impact that the slide in the yen is having on other Asian currencies, said, "I couldn't speak of specific levels, but it is necessary to intervene if the market is not moving in an orderly fashion."
The markets assume that as the yen weakens, Japanese exports become more competitive with those of other Asian countries, and concern is mounting that the Chinese will be forced to devalue their currency, the yuan, in spite of pledges not to do so.
A report today in The Financial Times said the Chinese Government was selling yen, in a major shift in its foreign-currency portfolio.
"The next key point is 150" yen to the dollar, said Hiroshi Sakuma, a foreign-exchange trader at Barclays Bank in Tokyo. "That's the target point for a lot of investors and speculators because that's the point that many think the Chinese will have to devalue."
Some economists and strategists suggest that allowing the yen to weaken is, in fact, the Government's newest plan to reinvigorate the deteriorating Japanese economy, in spite of the stern tone of disapproval emanating from the Ministry of Finance.
Economists like Paul Krugman have argued that Japan should deliberately unleash inflation, which would encourage consumers and companies to spend rather than save in fear that their purchasing power would be diluted in the future.
Craig Chudler, chief strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. said: "This could be the economic policy they're after. If they allow the currency to depreciate, it should be inflationary by making imports more expensive, and many economists believe Japan desperately needs inflation to get the economy going again."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Northwest Is Pressured To Reduce Some Fares

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from North Dakota politicians and local airport managers, Northwest Airlines said yesterday that it would cut business fares to and from the state as part of a six-month trial to stimulate passenger traffic. The fares, discounted as much as 60 percent on connecting flights and 42 percent on nonstop flights, are available immediately for travel from Sept. 14 through March 31, 1999.
The new discounts come against the backdrop of mounting political pressures in state legislatures and in Congress to rein in rising business fares. Just this Monday, a Democratic candidate for Attorney General of Minnesota said that if elected, he would summon a task force to recommend ways of increasing airline competition in the state and would also investigate whether Northwest had violated antitrust laws -- a suggestion the carrier denies. 
 Reacting to yesterday's decision, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, said: "Community representatives and our airport managers have been in ongoing discussions with Northwest on the issue of reducing fares since last October. Northwest is responding to our analysis and concerns that the current business fares are inhibiting some North Dakota travelers."
Last May, in what it said was an effort to spur economic development in the nine-county greater Des Moines area, UAL's United Airlines cut fares between Des Moines and other Midwest cities by 34 percent, to $249 each way. It also cut 50 percent off 14-day advance fares that do not require a Saturday night stay. And by deploying bigger planes between Des Moines and Chicago, it added 812 seats each week during the summer.
Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, said that both the United and Northwest decisions were directly related to the increasing business, government and news media pressure on the airlines. Yesterday's cuts, he said, "underscore the usefulness of Federal Government leadership on the competition issue in providing local communities with impartial data and analysis."
Nevertheless, Northwest does not seem prepared to lose revenue indefinitely on its North Dakota experiment. "A substantial increase in the unrestricted business fare traffic will be required to maintain these fares after the test period," the carrier said in a statement. "For example on many routes, passengers in the business fare category will have to double their current level just to maintain present revenue levels for Northwest."
During the test period, one-way fares between Bismarck, N.D., and Chicago, for example, will fall to $195 from $460, between Bismarck and Washington to $325 from $680 and between Minot, N.D., and Chicago to $195 from $484. Reductions on flights from both Bismarck and Minot to Minneapolis-St. Paul will range between 36 and 42 percent.
Northwest said it would support its lower business fares with increased marketing, advertising and by including the rates on its World Wide Web site. Test results will be reported by early January 1999, and a final evaluation will be released about mid-June.
 
Cheap Seats to Hong Kong
From now through the end of the month, Cathay Pacific is offering round-trip flights to Hong Kong from New York and Los Angeles for $399 plus taxes and fees. Seats are limited and tickets -- nonrefundable even in the event of illness -- are valid for travel between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, among other restrictions. Moreover, the fare is available only via the Internet, although there is no charge for registration (www.cathay-usa.com/hop) and it takes only a few minutes.
 
Traveling With Laptops
An American Express survey of business travelers has found that 65 percent of respondents always or almost always use a laptop computer on overnight trips. Those travelers will probably be pleased to learn that the new security gates at United Airlines' Terminal 7 at Los Angeles International airport, scheduled to open in early September, will allow passengers to go through without switching on their computers.
Security-minded laptop owners may be glad to know that Port Inc., which already offers a motion-sensitive system for notebook-computer carrying cases, has developed a remote control security system. When motion is detected, an electronic sensor triggers an alarm that activates a siren, which sounds for up to 30 seconds. A key chain remote control, usable up to 40 feet, has a panic button that signals an immediate alarm to find a lost carrying case or to signal an alert if a thief grabs the case.

Brothers Land On Their Side Of the Divide

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
SHRIEKS and squeals filled the yellow school bus as it bounced and bumped over the potholes along the factory-lined streets of the East Williamsburg Industrial Park. They subsided, only to be replaced by the bouncy beats of a hip-hop song on the radio. Bear Mountain was still an hour away, but the children from St. Barbara's Day Camp were getting psyched for the summer's final outing on Monday.
"I'd rather have bus music," one child shouted. "She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes. Yee-haw! She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes. Yee-haw!" 
Brother Rick Dixon, the camp's director, savored the exuberant scene, speaking up only a few times to quiet the group when the yee-haws reached rodeo riot levels. He did so reluctantly, at that, since he knew this was a big day for youngsters who feel cooped up in their Bushwick neighborhood.
"With a group like this, the more ordered and controlled it is, the easier it is for us," Brother Rick said. "At the same time, it's not good for human relations. I'm continually struggling with that balance."
The bus trip was a breeze compared with the demands of his own spiritual journey as a member of the Little Brothers of the Gospel, a tiny Roman Catholic order that practices prayer and contemplation in neighborhoods that are poor, violent and sometimes raucous. Odder yet to some of their neighbors, their mission is not to build schools or hospitals, but to offer simple acts of constant companionship. With the income gap between the rich and poor widening, Brother Rick said the hardest part of his mission was to convince others that money may help, but it doesn't heal.
"In our consumer-oriented culture, there is so much pressure," he said. "The only things kids see is this drive for money, exploitative love and sex. It's almost like we've forgotten that profound friendship is love, too."
Brother Rick and his confreres didn't need any studies to tell them how rich and poor were diverging more and more. Good economic times forced them to move to Bushwick two years ago from their longtime home on the Lower East Side. Four of them had lived in an apartment just steps off the Bowery on East Fourth Street until skid row gave way to sidewalk cafes, pricey apartments and clubs of the moment. Most of the poor families they had known over the years had gradually been scattered to other parts of the city.
"The Lower East Side is a better community because it attracts tourists," Brother Giorgio Gonella said. "But in recent years we felt like guests and the neighborhood belonged to the people who went to restaurants and theaters."
What had once been a struggling community, he said, began to feel more and more like a no man's land of urban individualism. What Bushwick lacked in material wealth, they discovered soon after their arrival two years ago this month, was offset by what it had in human bonds. And while their neighbors first thought they were undercover police officers, little by little they became friends with the people they saw each day sitting outside on stoops, chatting in bodegas or worshiping at church.
A previous generation once measured success by the mile, equating it with how far they could move from the neighborhood. Jackie Gracie, a day camp counselor, credits people like Brother Rick for reminding others how they can work to improve the block.
"He's willing to listen," Mr. Gracie said. "He may be a Brother, but he's really like a brother from a different mother."
THE Little Brothers call the neighborhood a little village, even if the curses that filter into the small chapel in their apartment would make it appear that this was hardly a place for contemplation. Quite the opposite, they said.
"When survival is a daily challenge, somehow there is something beautifully naked," Brother Giorgio said. "The dialogue always comes down to the basic questions. Why life? Why death? Why poverty? The more middle-class you are, the more expert you are in the art of hiding from the real questions. Living in a poor neighborhood, your contemplative life is enriched by the tragedies which oblige you to be truthful."
It all adds up to a richness of life that Brother Giorgio didn't see being replaced anytime soon by cafe society.
"You don't come here unless you belong here," he said. "So far, we don't have any yuppies moving here. They're all going to Williamsburg."

HEADLINE: Drifting to a New Iraq Policy

 BODY:
These first days of August have brought a disquieting retreat by the Clinton Administration on Iraq. Without saying as much, the White House seems on the verge of altering seven years of American policy by letting Saddam Hussein slip free of the international effort to prevent him from developing a new arsenal of biological and chemical weapons. That would be a grave mistake.
The change of tone and direction have been striking in the week since Mr. Hussein ended Iraqi cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors, breaking the agreement he reached earlier this year with Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the U.N. Instead of warning Mr. Hussein that his resistance was no more acceptable now than it was before, and would be met with military force if necessary, the Administration has deliberately downplayed the defiance. Mr. Annan, for his part, has urged the Security Council to review the inspection system and accompanying economic sanctions that have been in place since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
 This is just the kind of equivocating performance Mr. Hussein has been hoping to provoke. A relaxation of sanctions and reliance on less intrusive inspections might be in order if Iraq had complied with the Security Council requirement that it dismantle all weapons of mass destruction and make no effort to rebuild them. But Iraq has resisted inspection at every turn, leaving inspectors convinced it retains the ambition and means to develop biological and chemical weapons.
Mr. Hussein has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to attack his neighbors, even his countrymen. Allowing him to replenish his stockpile of biological and chemical weapons would threaten the Persian Gulf region and its oilfields, as well as Israel. Few developments would so directly endanger American security interests.
There should be no illusions in Washington about the difficulty of keeping Mr. Hussein in check. The Security Council is wobbly, with Russia and France eager to ease inspections and sanctions. Mr. Annan's resolve seems in doubt. Many Americans question the need to maintain pressure on Baghdad and would oppose the use of force.
But the threat is too great to give ground to Mr. Hussein. The cost to the world and to the United States of dealing with a belligerent Iraq armed with biological weapons would be far greater than the cost of preventing Baghdad from rearming.
Without a clear and consistent message from Washington that it is prepared to enforce the inspection system, Iraq's weapons programs cannot be reliably contained. Unless Mr. Annan insists that Baghdad fully honor its agreement with him, increasingly bold Iraqi challenges to U.N. authority are certain to come.

HEADLINE: A Budget Balance in Congress

 BODY:
With Congress in recess, Washington is filled with threats of another government shutdown over the budget in October. Underneath the surface, however, a fragile majority of moderate Democrats and Republicans is emerging in both the Senate and House that could set a less confrontational tone when lawmakers return in September. On budget issues, moderate Republicans are warning sensibly against big new tax cuts and spending reductions in essential areas. It would be healthy for Republican leaders to pay attention.
Passage of the Shays-Meehan campaign finance legislation owed much to independent-minded Republicans in the House this year. In that vote, more than 60 Republicans ignored Speaker Newt Gingrich and voted with the Democrats. An equally large bloc of Republican moderates voted with House Democrats recently to save the National Endowment for the Arts and defeat a gay-bashing amendment pushed by social and religious conservatives. Moderates in the Senate, especially veterans of past budget battles like Pete Domenici and William Roth, refuse to go along with the big tax cuts advocated by the budget-cutters in the House. 
 Fights between Republican moderates and conservatives have so tied up the budget this year that none of the 13 appropriations bills financing the Government after the end of September have been passed by both houses of Congress and sent to President Clinton. Congressional Republicans could not even agree on an overall budget resolution. Meanwhile, moderates in the Senate support full funding for the International Monetary Fund to help it deal with the Asian economic collapse. House conservatives seem more in the thrall of the isolationism of Dick Armey, who recently commented: "I've been to Europe once. I don't have to go again."
The White House may be in crisis but can count on the country rallying against another budget siege by Republicans, shutting down the Government as they did in 1995. Last week, when some House Republicans were saying that this time they could reap political gains from a shutdown, it was Mr. Gingrich's turn to cringe. The title of his recent book, after all, is "Lessons Learned the Hard Way." The paradox of this moment is that while the conservatives brought Mr. Gingrich to power, the moderates are the ones who learned the lessons.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKES & BONDS;
Treasury Securities Gain As Investors Seek Havens

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities made modest price gains yesterday as investors sought a haven from the stock market and from overseas markets.
The demand for Treasuries pushed down the long bond's yield, which falls as prices rise, close to its all-time low. One reason for the demand was that the dollar surged to an eight-year high against the Japanese yen, and investors grew concerned that Russia might default on debt repayments. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, not only for the return but also for the potential gains from currency trans lations. 
 By late in the day the 30-year benchmark issue was up 11/32, to a price of 107 17/32, and its yield fell to 5.60 percent, from 5.62 percent on Monday.
At the Treasury's $16 billion, five-year-note auction yesterday, part of its quarterly sale of notes and bonds, the yield came in at 5.327 percent, a little worse than expected, although not surprising considering bonds were rallying at the time. Usually dealers will raise yield levels ahead of an auction to attract investors, but the rally may have cut into that pre-auction preparation.
Today, the Government will auction $11 billion of 10-year notes by reopening the 5.625 percent issue due May 15, 2008, and tomorrow, it will sell $10 billion of a new 30-year bond. In when-issued trading, the 10-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.36 percent and the 30-year bond at a price to yield 5.52 percent.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management, said the bond market's strength came from two sources yesterday, primarily from the so called flight to quality from other assets like emerging markets and stocks. The second source of strength, he said, was "from people beginning to wonder if Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan would entertain the idea of an ease in interest rates to offset some of the global weakness that seems to be deteriorating further."
Toward the close of the New York market, bond yields came off their best levels of the day, in response, Mr. Whelan said, "to a stabilizing stock market and a mediocre five-year note auction, which I thought was affected by the rally in Treasuries."
Even strong economic data yesterday were overwhelmed by events in overseas markets and in domestic stock markets.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said: "Clearly the stock market decline is an indication of an asset reallocation play going on. There is a question now being asked: What is the most desireable asset? People are rethinking their positions, but it does not reflect any change in fundamentals in the market., The economy has not changed except to slow slightly."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Colleges Agree to Share Chores, But Without Uttering the M-Word

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Four years ago, LeBron Fairbanks, the president of a small, distinctively Christian liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, Ohio, had an inspiration. Budget cuts were threatening his institution, but, he figured, he could save "bushels of money" by combining resources with neighboring colleges.
The idea was daring for an institution like Mount Vernon Nazarene College, which is committed to its religious traditions and wary of blurring its identity. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Fairbanks came up with a proposal in which Mount Vernon and five other Ohio colleges would seek ways to combine administrative tasks. He found a receptive ear for his experiment at the Teagle Foundation, a midsize private philanthropy that was just then shopping for a way to make a significant contribution to higher education. Teagle so liked the idea (and trusted Mr. Fairbanks, as an earlier grant recipient) that it set up the Collaborative Ventures Program and has issued more than $4 million in grants to help colleges set up money-saving collaborations.
While only a handful of such consortiums existed in 1995, today there are at least 21 representing more than 125 colleges and universities. They range from the elite Five Colleges Inc. (Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, Smith and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst) to the Montana Consortium of American Indian tribal colleges (Rocky Mountain, Salish Kootenai, Little Big Horn and Fort Peck Community College).
The appeal for Five Colleges was not just to save money but also to enrich academic programs. Specialized courses like Arabic, early music and astronomy rotate among the Five Colleges campuses, which individually might not be able to afford such unusual offerings. Students are encouraged to register for the shared courses at member institutions for no additional fees, and free intercollege bus service is provided.
Five Colleges is now trying to consolidate programs in American ethnic studies. A $135,000 Teagle grant will help pay for a new ethnic studies teacher who will shuttle from campus to campus this fall.
In contrast, the colleges in the Montana Consortium are too far apart for shuttle buses, so they are creating an on-line university using distance-learning techniques, with a shared curriculum and faculty exchanges.
"A great many of these small institutions are being caught in a squeeze," said Richard W. Kimball, president of Teagle. "On the one hand, their costs are going up because education is labor-intensive, and on the other they can no longer continue to raise tuition faster than the rate of inflation because the public won't stand for it. They've got no alternative but to reduce costs."
When he was approached by Mr. Fairbanks, Mr. Kimball said he was aware that some collaborative efforts in the past had failed. But he recalled thinking, "If a very conservative school like Mount Vernon Nazarene College is interested in this, maybe the time is right nationally."
The idea of consortiums is not entirely new. The Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities, an organization of five colleges in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, has shared academic programs for about two decades. It is expanding its collaborations and is now working on a plan to share security services.
"The future will require higher-education leadership to reach out to others where there are administrative overlaps and academic programs which can be combined," said Larry Osnes, president of Hamline University in St. Paul, a Twin Cities institution.
Some of the most striking efforts involve institutions that have strong religious ties. A consortium of seminaries around Columbus, Ohio, is linking libraries and requiring students of each institution to take at least one course at another consortium member.
"We're fairly avant-garde in this," said Norman E. Dewire, president of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, part of the consortium. "But we realize we can't live in a world apart."
College administrators are not unmindful of the risks. "Of course we have to be careful," said Mr. Fairbanks of Mount Vernon Nazarene College, which is now in league with five diverse institutions, including Ohio Dominican College, a Roman Catholic institution, and Wilmington College, which is affiliated with the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers. Teagle awarded $560,000 to the consortium.
"People have a fierce loyalty to these institutions," Mr. Fairbanks said. "If you talk to the alumni about mergers, changing the name or losing your identity you're looking for another job."
Lorna M. Peterson, the coordinator of Five Colleges Inc., also expressed the need to proceed with caution. "We don't want this to become a threat to the distinctiveness or autonomy of the members," Ms. Peterson said. "The whole is smaller than the sum of its parts."
Mr. Kimball said Teagle did not use the word "merger." "If we use that word, we're dead," he said with a smile. "We don't want them to loose their identity, but does that mean they all need to cut their own grass?"

British Petroleum to Buy Amoco in $48.2 Billion Deal
British Petroleum announced that it would acquire Amoco, the big oil company, for $48.2 billion in stock. The deal is the largest oil industry merger ever, as well as the largest foreign takeover of an American company.
If approved by regulators and shareholders of both companies, BP Amoco, as the company is to be known, will be the world's third-largest multinational oil company in terms of net income after Exxon and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies. Page A1. 

Russian Markets Plunge
Russian stocks fell 9.11 percent, nearly as great a decline as on Monday. Government bonds tumbled to their lowest prices ever, as rates on the Russian equivalent of United States Treasury bills approached 80 percent for three-month maturities and 140 percent for nine-month maturities. "It's a collapse in confidence about the Russian Government's ability to fund itself," a former World Bank official said. A3.
 
The Belarussian ruble -- called the zaichik, or bunny, after the engraving that is its main feature -- has lost half its worth in five months, and the Belarus Government will no longer accept it as payment for exports. A3.
 
Bell Atlantic Workers End Strike
Ending a two-day-old strike against Bell Atlantic, members of the Communications Workers of America declared victory and returned to work. They reached a tentative agreement with management that insures that jobs in the company's high-technology growth areas will go to union employees. A1.
 
The Yen's Fall From Favor
With the yen trading at eight-year lows -- 147.35 yen to the dollar in New York -- currency traders fear a fundamental shift in sentiment is under way against the yen. Housewives, who control vast savings, are moving into dollars, pounds and marks. D5.
 
Second-Quarter Productivity Off
Workers' productivity fell at an annual rate of two-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, the first such drop in three years, as Asia's economic crisis and strikes at General Motors plants took a toll. D3.
 
Long Bond's Yield Near Low
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.62 percent, near its all-time low, as investors seeking a haven from stocks and overseas markets pushed up bond prices. D7.
 
Wal-Mart Profit Exceeds Forecasts
Wal-Mart Stores said that its quarterly earnings rose 30 percent, to $1.03 billion, or 46 cents a diluted share, 3 cents above analysts' forecasts. Profit surged almost fivefold at its international stores. D3.
 
Geocities' Successful I.P.O.
Investors clamored to buy the stock of Geocities, which gives its 2 million members pages on the World Wide Web to display pictures of their kids, their pets and their bottle-top collections -- a business on which it has not proved it can make money. Shares closed at $37.31, more than double the offering price of $17, in a day the market tumbled. D6.
 
Adobe Issues Warning on Revenue
Adobe Systems warned that revenue would fall below analysts' expectations, possibly resulting in a third-quarter loss, and that three senior executives would leave. Adobe is cutting 240 to 300 jobs. D2.

HEADLINE: The German Consensus

 BODY:
Gerhard Schroder, the German Social Democrat who may put an end to Helmut Kohl's chancellorship in elections next month, came to Washington last week to see and be seen with President Clinton. Along with trying to assure Germany that strong ties to America will continue, Mr. Schroder is reinforcing parallels with a politician he admires. He paints himself as a tough and energetic reformer running against a stodgy incumbent.
The comparison of himself to Mr. Clinton is misleading. Germany has rejected the kinds of economic reforms now taken as gospel in Britain and America. The generosity of the German welfare state sometimes verges on parody. But Germans strongly believe society should take care of all its members. Even after 16 years of the conservative Mr. Kohl, benefit deductions average 42 percent of workers' salaries, a record. Employers have won more flexible work hours, but labor costs remain among Europe's highest. 
 At 54, Mr. Schroder may be relatively young and energetic, but he is unlikely to depart from the German consensus. With unemployment at 10.7 percent, slightly down from a postwar high, Mr. Schroder's main issue is job creation. But his ideas are vague and contradictory. What he could do depends on the coalition the Social Democrats could form -- and on the party's chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, who advocates wage hikes. Mr. Schroder, who favors a tax cut, also wants the Government to pick up some expensive benefits now paid by employers. He wants to turn low-wage temporary jobs into "real" jobs, which could exacerbate unemployment. While he is one of the most pro-business members of a party with a union base, he advocates little that the unions could oppose.
Mr. Kohl was the architect of German unification and is now the chief advocate of European integration. Mr. Schroder, once a skeptic about Europe's single currency, now says that even if he governs with the Green Party, there will be no change in any major aspect of foreign policy.
It is still very possible that Helmut Kohl will win a fifth term as Chancellor. But it is a mark of Mr. Kohl's influence on modern Germany that even if he loses, his policies are likely to live on.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE MARKETS -- Market Place;
Less U.S. Ability This Time To Halt Falling Yen's Damage

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
With the Japanese yen falling to eight-year lows, helping to pull down financial markets around the world, the United States finds itself with few options.
It can intervene in the currency markets to support the yen's value, as it did in June, or jawbone the Japanese Government into stimulating its economy. Yet neither tactic is likely to be very effective in the absence of drastic measures by Japan, a point repeatedly made by Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin. 
 In June, the United States had the element of surprise when it worked in concert with Japan to prop up the yen, which had then traded as low at 146.78 to the dollar.
The move was intended to give the Japanese some breathing room to carry out bold policy changes -- changes that have not yet materialized. Timed just before President Clinton's trip to China, the intervention was also intended to placate the Chinese, who had been sending signals that a further decline in the yen might force them to devalue their currency, the yuan.
A Chinese devaluation would deepen the financial crisis in Asia and reverberate through other other international markets, perhaps setting off more devaluations.
After the joint intervention, the yen briefly rallied, at first to a rate of 136.75 to the dollar. China reassured the President that it would not devalue its currency.
The move also helped calm worried financial markets. After the June 17 intervention, the Dow Jones industrial average started a 7.8 percent run-up to a record high of 9,337.97 about a month later.
And foreign stock markets got a lift, albeit a smaller one. Hong Kong rose, and Mexico, which has suffered sharp losses this year, rallied for a time. Canadian stocks got a boost, as well, though they are now down 19 percent from their high to date this year.
But currency traders view the intervention as a one-time success.
What the United States can hope is that the yen does not fall precipitously, but grinds down slowly, said Richard Medley, president of Medley Global Advisers, which gives advice to institutions and hedge funds. To achieve this, he said, the United States and Japan might be forced to intervene again.
But a second intervention, he warned, would be less effective. For one thing, traders are expecting it now and have positioned themselves accordingly.
In addition, the new Japanese Government has not convinced investors that it will take the necessary steps, like tax cuts and banking reform, to revive the economy.
"We are telling investors to buy the dollar," Mr. Medley said. "You may get some smoothing intervention, but don't expect it to be an effort to reverse the trend."
For now, the falling yen has become a sell signal on the world equity markets. How much further can it fall? It will not be hard for the yen to reach 150 to the dollar, analysts said yesterday. And in New York trading, it dropped eight-tenths of a percent to settle at 147.35, its lowest level in eight years. Some year-end forecasts have the yen as far down as 180 to the dollar. In Asian trading on Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 146.10 yen.
"There are no fundamentals supporting the yen," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
This could spell a stormy end of summer for the financial markets as investors grapple with a still-uncertain outlook for Asia and its impact.
Yesterday and Monday, the weakening yen -- and the fear of a Chinese currency devaluation -- was blamed for sharp declines in stock and currency markets around the world.
A devaluation by the Chinese would make their exports cheaper, taking sales away from other Asian nations that are fighting back from economic collapse.
And it would cut into American corporate earnings in two ways: American export sales would drop further as the Chinese and other Asian nations lose purchasing power, and goods brought into this country would be cheaper, putting downward pressure on the prices charged by American competitors.
Stocks slumped yesterday in the United States after a rout overnight in Asia. In Latin America, where, it is feared, a Chinese devaluation would set off currency declines there, the main Brazilian stock index dropped 5.6 percent in two days and the Mexican market fell 6.8 percent. The Mexican peso dropped to a low against the dollar, a rate of 9.19.
In Europe, the French CAC 40 index was off 2.37 percent yesterday, while in London, the Financial Times 100-stock index fell 2.77 percent, and the German DAX index declined 3.2 percent.
Commodity prices are also following the yen's lead. Oil and copper prices fell yesterday on concern that consumption in Asia would slow.
What is complicating the situation for American policy makers is that investors fear a further decline in the yen's rate will set off a Chinese devaluation -- repeated Chinese denials of such plans notwithstanding. Not too long ago, a level of 150 yen to the dollar appeared to be the line in the sand to hold off the Chinese.
Many economists, however, argue that there is little direct correlation between the two currencies. The Japanese and the Chinese do not compete very much in terms of exports. In addition, the benefit to China in making its exports cheaper is not sufficient to offset the political and social costs of a devaluation on the giant domestic economy, Mr. Weinberg argued.
Mr. Medley considers the Chinese trade surplus a more important gauge than the yen. He said that if the surplus fell to zero -- it was $20 billion for the first half of the year -- China would have to devalue because such a trade deficit would threaten its huge foreign-currency reserves.
"We recommend keeping your eyes on this number for the next few months, rather than news wire headlines," he told clients.
But thoughts of a Japanese-Chinese currency link have taken hold, in part because the June intervention was seen as a response to complaints from Beijing.
"There are portfolio managers we speak to who have set sell orders on their emerging market portfolios that are linked to the level of the yen," said Jeremy P. Fand, senior foreign-exchange strategist at BankBoston. While he does not think the link is appropriate, he said a lot of those orders were bunched at 150 yen to the dollar. Or, as Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics said, "The perception is more important than the reality."
This means that a weakening yen could become more disruptive to financial markets, even if China does not feel compelled to devalue its currency, because even if there is no yen-yuan link, the markets see it that way for now.
"China, Japan and the United States are connected in every trader's mind," Mr. Fand said.
But the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which would conduct any future intervention, cannot afford to become "the policemen of world financial markets," he said. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, he said, "doesn't even want to be responsible for the fate of the Dow."

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble 1.3% As Asian Fears Grow

 BODY:
Stocks buckled as investors grew increasingly fearful over world financial developments: the yen plunged on news that Japan's economic slump was deepening, and markets elsewhere in Asia and in Russia also tumbled, leading to fears that the malaise abroad would drive down corporate earnings in the United States. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent on the day, closing off 112 points. The Dow was down nearly 3 percent at one point, 254 points, but demand for oil stocks trimmed losses in the market gauge.

HEADLINE: A Brooklyn Race Pits Two Former Friends and Allies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
They were not merely up-and-coming officials from the same Brooklyn neighborhood, but kindred politicians close enough to have been the best of friends for years. Over nightcaps in neighborhood bars, they planned their political futures. They worked on each other's campaigns. They went to family reunions together and even, at times, vacationed together.
But now, in one of the odd twists that are often part of politics, Assemblyman Darryl C. Towns and City Councilman Martin Malave Dilan have become political adversaries. 
 Mr. Towns, 37, is in a heated Democratic primary for re-election to a seat he won in 1992, representing the northern Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bushwick and Cypress Hills. Mr. Dilan, 47, who was elected to the Council in 1991, is running against him. It is a race in which Mr. Towns has had to defend his record, presenting himself as a vigilant advocate for his district as Mr. Dilan has offered a dissenting view and the promise of "a more active presence in Albany and in the district."
"The current Assemblyman has been an absentee Assemblyman," Mr. Dilan said of his former confidant. "Many of the people in the district, if they were to see his face, would not know who he is. In fact, I think he has been in a holding pattern waiting for Daddy to retire."
He was referring to Mr. Towns's father, Representative Edolphus Towns. The Congressman's relationship with the Democratic Party organization in Brooklyn adds another layer of complexity to the race for the Democratic nomination for the Assembly seat. The contest between Mr. Dilan and Mr. Towns is widely seen as an extension of a feud between Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the Brooklyn Democratic chairman, and Congressman Towns.
Mr. Norman and the elder Mr. Towns, once close friends themselves, have become bitter political adversaries, a result of disagreements over endorsements. When Congressman Towns decided to support Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, in last year's mayoral contest, Mr. Norman announced that the Democratic organization would no longer support the Congressman.
Earlier this year, Mr. Dilan had planned to run for Congress, against Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a fellow Democrat. But last month, Mr. Dilan, a close ally of Mr. Norman, announced that he could not raise enough money to topple the popular Congresswoman. Instead, he announced for the Assembly seat held by the younger Mr. Towns.
Both Mr. Norman and Mr. Dilan say they are not involved in any plan to injure the Towns family. "One might have that perception," Mr. Norman said. "But I want to make it perfectly clear that the county organization is neutral. Despite the fact that I have some differences with the father, it has nothing to do with my relationship with the son. There is no backdoor support to Darryl's opponent."
Not all are convinced, however. "He's neutral against an incumbent?" Congressman Towns asked. "I find that strange, because the incumbent usually enjoys the Democratic organization's support."
The Congressman added that Mr. Dilan also endorsed the Mayor but was not attacked for it by Mr. Norman. "I think that Clarence is being vindictive," Congressman Towns said. "Instead of dealing with me, he wants to deal with my son, and that's unfortunate."
Mr. Dilan, too, accuses Mr. Towns and his father of disloyalty. "When I decided to run against Nydia, I expected they would be supportive, or at least neutral," he said. "But they supported her. The Congressman was vicious, and worked hard to reverse the decisions of the people who supported me. They had no pity and mercy."
The race in the 54th Assembly District is also marked by ethnic issues. Mr. Towns, who is black, and Mr. Dilan, who is Puerto Rican, are running in a district that is predominantly Hispanic. And one of Mr. Dilan's campaign themes is that it is time for the district to send a Hispanic Assemblyman to Albany.
The 1990 census showed the Assembly district as 66 percent Hispanic, 24 percent black, 5 percent white and 3 percent Asian, and demographers say the Hispanic population is now more than 70 percent.
For his part, Mr. Towns says he has been vehement in his efforts to enhance economic development in his district, which includes working-class and low-income residents.
"I've been a strong voice in Albany," Mr. Towns said. "Even through a time where resources have been cut drastically, I've still been able to address the issues of concern to all of my constituents."
Mr. Towns is likely to benefit from the power of incumbency and a network of support from his years of work among community organizations, not to mention assistance from his father and from Ms. Velazquez. Mr. Towns has been able to win the nomination consistently with more than one Hispanic opponent.
Mr. Dilan, a Democratic district leader, also has a broad network of community support based on years as an elected official. "Darryl Towns could be in trouble, simply because of the demographics," said Michael D. Nieves, a political consultant.
But Mr. Nieves said that Mr. Dilan, too, may have some difficulty because of his longstanding campaigning on behalf of the Townses.
"For years, the alliance between him and the Townses has been so strong," Mr. Nieves said. "He has been telling people why Darryl Towns was good for the community. He now has to convince those same people to vote for him. And he has to give a reason other than the fact that they don't get along anymore."

Diplomatic Posts Are Shut In Response to Threats
Several American diplomatic posts have been temporarily closed in response to threats made after the terrorist attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, State Department officials said. A1
 
Federal agents began reconstructing hundreds of pieces of vehicles blown apart in the attack in Nairobi, in an attempt to identify the pickup truck that carried the explosives. A8 

F.B.I. agents in East Africa have been granted nearly unrestricted access to evidence, witnesses and possible suspects, which they hope will yield evidence to unravel the bombing plot. A8
 
A security camera that was pointing directly at the American Embassy gate in Dar es Salaam where a terrorist bomb exploded did not contain videotape but was merely used for monitoring by Marine Corps guards, a security official said. A8
 
Belarus to Refuse Its Currency
The Belarussian ruble has lost half its worth in five months. Now, the Government has announced that starting next week, Belarus will no longer accept its own currency as payment for exports. A3
 
Russia's stocks and bonds fell to near-historic lows. Some analysts questioned whether the Russians, already embarked on an all-out effort to avert bankruptcy, would be able to rebuild the confidence of world financial markets. A3
 
Israel Will Not Block Treaty
Israel announced that it would not block the next step in a United Nations effort to draft an international treaty that would halt the production of the materials used to make nuclear weapons. But Israel tempered its announcement by making clear that it still has deep misgivings about signing such a treaty. A4
 
Taliban Captures Afghan City
Taliban fighters captured the capital of Takhar province, a stronghold of Ahmed Shah Masood, a commander of the forces battling the Taliban, in a push for control over Afghanistan. A4
 
Caribbean Secession Defeated
A majority of voters on the Caribbean island of Nevis supported secession from St. Kitts in a referendum but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed, officials announced. If the measure had been approved, Nevis would have become one of the smallest nations in the world. Leaders in St. Kitts and Nevis said they would try to work out differences between the islands, which constitute the smallest nation in the Western Hemisphere. A4
 
Little Aid for Albanian Refugees
International aid agencies said they were not able to provide adequately for the refugees who had fled the Yugoslav Government's recent military offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels. Relief officials have only a general notion of how many refugees there are and which villages have been evacuated, and they do not have the staff in Kosovo to respond properly. A6

In Jonesboro Shootings, Killer Offers an Excuse
Just before a judge remanded 14-year-old Mitchell Johnson and 12-year-old Andrew Golden into juvenile detention for a school shooting spree in Jonesboro, Ark., that killed a teacher and four little girls, the older boy offered a courtroom filled with their relatives a childlike excuse. He said he did not mean to do it. "I thought we were going to shoot over their heads," said a trembling Mitchell. A1
 
Boston Columnist Keeps Job
The Boston Globe's editor announced at a crowded noon staff meeting that he would no longer demand the resignation of Mike Barnicle, a star columnist, but had imposed a two-month suspension instead. The editor, Matthew V. Storin, said he had been persuaded that "the punishment doesn't fit the crime," which was using jokes that paralleled the writings of the comedian George Carlin. A10
 
A Poet Laureate by the Bay
Mayor Willie L. Brown of San Francisco named Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a voice of the Beat Generation, as the city's first poet laureate. The honorary post requires Mr. Ferlinghetti only to give a speech now and then in his year-long term and promote poetry around the city. A10
 
Church Bans Same-Sex Unions
The United Methodist Church's highest court ruled that ministers who conduct same-sex unions violate the denomination's law and can be tried in its courts. The ruling, by the nine-member Judicial Council of the 8.5 million-member denomination, declared that a sentence added to the Methodists' rule book two years ago barring ministers from conducting gay unions was not advisory but binding.

Balloonist Leaps South Atlantic
Speeding along at more than 100 miles an hour, the adventurer Steve Fossett became the first balloonist to cross the South Atlantic Ocean. As he passed the southern tip of Africa on his way eastward from Argentina, Mr. Fossett clocked 5,000 miles -- one-fifth of the distance he hopes to cover in the next two weeks to become the first balloonist to circle the world nonstop.

President's Friend Testifies
Harry Thomason, a television producer and friend of the Clintons, testified for 90 minutes before a Washington grand jury about how he helped the President navigate the first chaotic days of the Monica S. Lewinsky crisis. He said that prosecutors had asked him to describe the advice he had given to the President in January. A14
 
As his rendezvous with a grand jury draws near, the face that President Clinton shows in public could not seem more relaxed. In a whirlwind coast-to-coast political fund-raising tour this week, the President has appeared upbeat, energetic and, above all, engaged in his official duties, keeping an eye on the plunging stock market and vowing revenge against terrorists who planted bombs at two embassies in Africa.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE SECURITY ISSUE;
U.S. CLOSES DOWN SOME OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN POSTS

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Several American embassies and other diplomatic installations have temporarily closed down routine operations in response to threats made after the terrorist attacks on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, State Department officials said today.
The officials, speaking on condition that they not be identified, said the embassies affected include those in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Kampala, Uganda. 
 The embassy in Mbabane, Swaziland, was evacuated for several hours today after a bomb threat. In West Africa, the American Embassy in the Ivory Coast said it had cut back its business hours while security was reinforced.
The Cairo office of the Agency for International Development was also shuttered and its employees moved into the well-fortified American Embassy.
The State Department also said today that it had received information about possible threats to American targets in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen. "This could include attacks on buildings," the department said. The embassies in those places were continuing to operate, though in some cases at reduced levels.
The department said Americans in those countries "should exercise caution" but it did not issue travel alerts.
Officials said they could not recall a similar instance in recent years in which several American diplomatic installations, which often get threats of violence, had suspended operations simultaneously.
The United States has announced a worldwide alert for embassies and other diplomatic installations after the terrorist attacks last week. The State Department and Congress have faced criticism since the attacks that they failed to provide sufficient security for embassies abroad.
Many American diplomatic missions were not given the upgraded security recommended by an independent commission after the bombing of the American Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983.
Patrick F. Kennedy, the Assistant Secretary of State for Administration, said that since the bombings last week, the Department and its overseas posts had received between one dozen and two dozen threats, including some considered "copy cat" threats of terrorist attacks mimicking those in Kenya and Tanzania.
"We are not leaving," he said. "We are taking, in effect, a brief time-out in order to make the security adjustments that are necessary to be responsive to a threat."
Another State Department official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that, "where prudent, we're reducing staff, we're moving from one building to another, we're reducing hours."
But he insisted that Americans living or traveling abroad would be able to obtain emergency services from all embassies, regardless of threats. "You will always be able to get an operator at the embassy and be connected to a duty officer -- 24 hours a day," he said.
The department refused to provide a formal list of the shuttered embassies out of concern that it might be used by terrorists to identify targets for attack.
"I'd prefer not to go into identifying specific embassies," Mr. Kennedy said at a news conference. "I think that just probably leads to more copycat calls." The suspended operations, he said, had occurred in "several regions" of the world.
He said the embassy operations had been curtailed at the request of ambassadors or, in their absence, the highest-ranking local American diplomat.
"We have always said to our chiefs of mission that they are responsible to protect the lives and safety of personnel overseas," Mr. Kennedy said.
"If the chief of mission feels that there is information available to him or her that says, 'I must take a particular step, including potentially briefly suspending operations until adjustments to the security posture can be made,' then we feel that is absolutely the right thing to do."
He did not describe the threats that had prompted the decision to cut back operations, but he said all were being taken seriously.
"When a call comes in or whatever it is," he said, "each call is analyzed and measured and then the post, the ambassador, the regional security officer, the emergency action committee at the post does what is appropriate."
An American official at the United States Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said the embassy closed its iron gates today for all but emergency services for American citizens. The official said it would remain closed Wednesday in order for the compound to be "hardened" against a possible terrorist attack.
"No one thinks of Kuala Lumpur as a terrorist target, but we want to take every precaution to keep our people safe," the official said. "I think you'll see additional barricades outside the embassy later this week, some more barbed wire."
State Department officials said the American Embassy in Uganda, which borders both Kenya and Tanzania, was closed today but was expected to reopen Wednesday, with security measures tightened.
The attack on the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, has hindered the conduct of American diplomacy not just in Kenya but across much of East Africa.
The embassy there effectively functioned as a regional headquarters for the State Department and other Government agencies.

HEADLINE: Drought in Texas and Oklahoma Stunting Crops and Economies

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Figuring out how far Lynn Bartlett's erector-set grid of sprinklers can reach as they pivot around his sun-cracked cotton fields along the Salt Fork of the Red River is really not much of a chore.
The plants within the irrigation perimeter stand three or four feet high, thick and bristling with moist green bolls of healthy cotton, some of them as big as an apricot. Just beyond the water's reach, though, the plants slouch only a foot above the scaly soil and most have just two or three dusty bolls, none bigger than a Ping-Pong ball. 
 "This is basically burnt-up cotton," Mr. Bartlett said. "We had a good planting rain back in May, then a week or so later the tap just shut off and it's been off ever since."
While many parts of the country, including the Northeast, are suffering through dry months verging on drought, the situation is particularly severe in Texas and Oklahoma. Just two years after a drought ravaged large swaths of the rich agricultural region, both states are in the midst of a dry spell that officials say shows signs of developing into the costliest and most devastating the region has seen since the Dust Bowl years.
There is not a corner of Texas that is not laboring under severe or extreme drought conditions. President Clinton has declared each of the state's 254 counties a Federal disaster area, making farmers eligible for low-interest loans. "The crops have been lost, the livestock has been liquidated and there's really no relief in sight," said the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Rick Perry. "I am starting to hear reports that this is the worst ever."
During crucial growing weeks from April through June, Texas received little measurable rainfall at all. South Texas, which has been hit hardest by the drought, received only 8 percent of its normal precipitation, the citrus ranchlands of the Rio Grande Valley only 4 percent.
Oklahoma received only two-thirds of its normal rainfall from June 1 to Aug. 1, and the southwestern corner of the state received less than a third. Adding to the problems is the extreme heat throughout the region this summer, taking away the last bits of moisture in already dry fields.
The United States Agriculture Secretary, Dan Glickman, recently declared 66 of Oklahoma's 77 counties Federal disaster areas, and state officials are hearing the same sort of dire reports about the drought's effects.
"All of agribusiness is very much affected," said Oklahoma's Agriculture Commissioner, Dennis Howard. "The ag dollar goes around Main Street six, seven, eight times, but it's not going around now, because it's not there. Small-town Oklahoma is really hurting."
But Texas and Oklahoma have changed a great deal since the Dust Bowl years of the 1930's, growing more urban and more economically diverse, particularly in the last two decades. So even though the drought could have a ruinous effect on farmers, cattle ranchers, small towns and agriculture-related businesses, the region's overall economy could well be cushioned.
On Wednesday in Washington, the Agriculture Department will release its monthly crop report, estimating how many of the country's planted acres will be worth harvesting and what their expected production.
The news is not expected to be good for Texas or Oklahoma.
Already, officials in Texas have estimated that the drought will cost farmers and ranchers $1.8 billion and will result in a $4.9 billion drain on the state's economy. In Oklahoma, officials last week predicted a total statewide cost of $2 billion.
But both Jared Hazelton, director of the Center for Business and Economic Analysis at Texas A&M University, and Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of North Texas, have said the drought will not have as dire an effect as some are predicting.
That, they say, is because agriculture accounts for only about 1 percent of Texas's $641 billion economy, even though Texas ranks third in the nation in net farm income, behind California and Iowa.
"The wonderful thing about the growth in the 90's is it isn't tied to a single-sector economy," Mr. Hazelton said. "There is no dominant industry."
Even in Oklahoma, where agriculture remains the state's leading industry, the economy has thus far been able to withstand the drought's impact.
"Now, thank goodness, Oklahoma's economy is more diversified than it was," Mr. Howard said. "The whole state isn't being impacted like it was during the drought in 1982, when we really went into a nosedive."
Even without such a nosedive this year, agriculture officials say, the drought will still be crushing to those corners of the region where agriculture remains at the center of life. In rural Texas and small-town Oklahoma, they say, businesses will close, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, cattle herds will be affected for years to come, and nervous bankers will refuse to lend money to more and more struggling farmers.
"In metropolitan cities, the impact will be felt in consumer prices and in those businesses connected to agriculture," said Carl Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M. "But the real impact will be felt in smaller farm communities, and it's going to be devastating. They're going to have problems collecting taxes to keep open their schools. It's going to speed up the drying up of these small, rural communities."
Economists say that while the drought will inevitably affect prices at supermarkets all over the country, it is too early to say which products will be affected and by how much.
A $500 million Federal aid package is in a House-Senate conference committee, but agriculture officials in Texas and Oklahoma are complaining because half of that money is earmarked for farmers in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Mr. Glickman told officials in his recent swing through the region that he wanted the total raised to $1 billion, maybe more. He spoke to farmers and officials again today about Federal drought-relief efforts.
Last Friday, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma organized a Plains States Rural Crisis Summit meeting in Oklahoma City, where he and the Governors of three other states concerned about the drought -- South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska -- adopted 22 emergency and long-term recommendations, including urging President Clinton and Congress to act more quickly to pump drought relief into the region.
Mr. Perry, the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, is pushing a plan to use some of Texas's budget surplus for a fund to provide aid in natural disasters. But the Texas Legislature, which meets biannually, is not scheduled to meet this year, so such a law could not be passed until 1999 at the earliest.
"God forbid this drought will still be going on then," Mr. Perry said.
Truman Zybach raises cattle on 1,700 acres in southwestern Oklahoma and across the Texas line. On his 900-acre ranch in Oklahoma, Mr. Zybach said, he would normally have 700 head of cattle at this time of year. But last Friday, with no grass in the fields for the cattle to eat and little hay available in the markets, he packed up four truckloads and sold them off, leaving him with only 50 or 60 cows.
"There's no green grass at all," Mr. Zybach said. "We're plum out of green grass."
Jack Feagley, manager of the Farmers Cooperative Society No. 1 in Wellington, Tex., said conditions were as bad in the Panhandle as he had ever seen them.
Most of Mr. Feagley's business comes from the co-op's two cotton gins. But this year, business has been so bad that the co-op is trying to sell one gin. The co-op also provides a weighing service for trucks full of cattle on their way to be sold.
"Normally, you'd start getting the cattle trucks in September," Mr. Feagley said. "But the ranchers are all out of grass out there, so they're selling early. They have to. I weighed 12 trucks already today."
Ernie Davis, an economist at the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, estimates that Texas cattle ranchers have already lost more than $450 million from being forced to sell off their herds early and from buying expensive feed in a vain effort to keep the herds going. If there are no rains in August, the year's loss figures could double, said Larry Boleman, a cattle specialist at Texas A&M.
In Oklahoma, the story is similar.
"Dry-land cotton is gone," Mr. Howard said. "Irrigated cotton is very stressed. Much of it won't make it. The watermelon crop is three-fourths off. The pecans, they're pretty well wiped out. Hay crop is 70 or 80 percent off. The horticulture industry is feeling it. People aren't buying shrubs and trees. If we don't get rain very quickly, we are not going to have any wheat pasture this fall. Corn is 80 or 90 percent gone. Soybeans are something like 70 percent gone. My dairy farmers tell me that because of the heat the cows are just off their feed, off their milk and production is down a third or a half. I know how the cows feel."
Mr. Bartlett walked through his field near the Salt and watched a neighbor's tractor kick up reddish dust. "I've heard of these droughts, but I've never been through one," he said.
On his own dry land, Mr. Bartlett said, he would normally expect to get 300 to 400 pounds of cotton per acre. This year, he will get only 50 to 100.
"The irrigated cotton is close to normal," he said, "but it's costing me $50 more an acre in watering. That's an expensive crop I've got in the ground."
If all goes well from now until the harvest, he expects to lose about half of what he would have earned on a normal crop.
"There may well be a few less farmers around here next season," Mr. Bartlett said. "Who knows? I may be one of them." He tossed a shriveled cotton boll back into a crusty furrow. "No, I don't really think so. I'll make it. But it all depends on how understanding your banker is. The bankers have their rules and regulations, too, I suppose. It's just life, I guess."

HEADLINE: Health Care Solution Is Over the Border

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is extraordinary that the number of medically uninsured Americans has risen to 41 million while the national economy has never been better (front page, Aug. 9). Children are particularly hard hit. 
 Over the past decade there has been a steady trend of dropping children from employer-provided health care plans and a growing number of children eligible for, but not enrolled in, Medicaid. Urged on by President Clinton, Congress last year passed legislation to expand child health insurance coverage, which may bring three million to five million uninsured children into the system over the next five years.
But if employers keep dropping those already in private plans and confusion around key aspects of welfare reform continues to erode enrollment in Medicaid, there is a danger that net gains in coverage from the new legislation may be dramatically reduced.

To the Editor:
Forty-one million Americans cannot afford health insurance in this time of global capitalism (front page, Aug. 9). At the same time nine insurance executives earned more than $10 million each last year, according to a recent study. 
 This has escaped most news organizations' attention while they work to bring us news most of the public does not want -- trivial sex scandals, for instance. Political corruption may be at an all-time American high. If this is the celebrated triumph of capitalism over other forms of economic organization, what exactly did we win? Have we gained the world at the cost of our souls?

HEADLINE: Medicine at the Click of a Mouse;
On-Line Health Files Are Convenient. Are They Private?

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Guy Yarden, a musician who lives in Brooklyn, recently received a letter from a doctor asking him to press his health plan to pay an outstanding bill. By going to the insurer's World Wide Web site, Mr. Yarden could review the payments to his doctors, saving time on the phone for both himself and the health plan.
Propelled by the soaring popularity of the Internet plus the shifting economics of health care, the medical industry is rapidly going on line. 
 The Internet is already a popular place to search for general information about medicines and treatments, but now a growing number of insurers and doctors are also using it to provide members and patients with personal medical information, from lab results to payment records.
"A potential revolution" is brewing in "how the consumer interacts with the health plan and, down the road in a different way, with the providers of care," said Jim Hudak, a managing partner with Andersen Consulting.
And Mr. Yarden, who describes himself as a "big on-line user," said he hoped that what was available now would be only the beginning. "They should be offering a lot more information," he said, "like the doctor's diagnosis and prognosis."
All this has the potential to be a huge benefit for consumers, doctors and insurance company employees, who can become bogged down in mountains of paperwork and, when seeking information, often face clogged phone lines.
But it also raises serious questions about the privacy of such highly personal information wafting about the digital world. A person with AIDS, for instance, might not want his employer to know, and a politician or an executive up for a promotion might want to keep a serious illness secret.
The issue thus fits squarely into the broader debate about privacy and security on the Internet, whether it involves protecting credit card numbers or keeping children from offensive information.
For while the variety of Internet offerings has exploded, privacy has limped far behind. Medical privacy was a factor recently when the White House backed away from the idea of assigning every American a medical identification number. The notion was shelved, the Administration said, until Congress passes legislation to protect patient privacy. The current version of that bill has faced criticism for not going far enough.
Mr. Yarden said the privacy issue "doesn't worry me," adding, "I change my passwords regularly."
Carol Haberman, who works at the National Library of Medicine, noted, "If you pay a doctor on your credit card, your privacy is gone right there."
But Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a trustee of the American Medical Association, is skeptical. "If vandals can break into a C.I.A. Web site," he said, "it doesn't make the A.M.A. feel real secure that some vandals won't break into a health plan."
Managed-care companies say that they are eager to safeguard members' privacy and that their security systems can protect the electronic information, sometimes more effectively than with paper records.
One Blue Cross plan even invites subscribers to dial in tips when they suspect fraud.
In California, the Kaiser Permanente health plan says it will provide laboratory results next year to patients over the Internet using a personal identification number. Oxford Health Plans has similar safeguards.
"We are continually walking a very fine line" between preserving the confidentiality of patient records and using the information to improve care, said Richard Huber, chief executive of Aetna Inc.
Its Aetna U.S. Healthcare subsidiary says it hopes to have "a significant percentage" of information for consumers on the Internet soon, including benefits data, the status of claims and a way to get approval for referrals to specialists.
The United Healthcare Corporation said it also planned to test an Internet project in October, though it gave no details.
Doctors, for their part, are starting to exchange messages, typically about nonurgent matters, with patients in remote areas and computer-savvy patients everywhere who are willing to risk having some hacker eavesdrop on their cholesterol reports.
Dr. Paul Tang, an internist and researcher at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said he often received E-mail from patients telling how their blood pressure or allergy medicine was working or describing symptoms and asking whether they should come to the office. "One hundred percent of my patients would rather have communications with me any time of day or night," he said, "than worry about the small risk that someone would intercept any message."
Physicians at Columbia University are testing an electronic program that will allow patients with chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes to see and add to their medical records. Patients type in an identification number displayed on a card that resembles a smarter version of an A.T.M. card. A machine receives and automatically verifies the number, which changes every 60 seconds.
"We're trying to prove that there are big benefits" to the patients by involving them more deeply in their treatment, said Paul Clayton, chairman of the department dealing with computerized medical information at Columbia.
Half the respondents to a survey in Boston said they would be interested in communicating with their doctors by E-mail.
This could pose hazards for the doctor. Michael Ackerman, who directs computer research contracts for the National Library of Medicine, said he had heard warnings from "malpractice insurance persons that a written document by a doctor might show up in a court and bite you." But he noted that the same could be said of a tape of a doctor's advice by telephone. "How far are you going to push this stupidity?" he said, expressing exasperation at the intrusion of litigation.
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a Massachusetts-based health plan, said it was planning "a secure Web site" in response to members' requests for Internet programs to get lab results, doctors' appointments and prescription drug renewals.
Dr. David Cochran, an associate medical director at Harvard Pilgrim, agreed that "computers have both benefits and risks." He added that "we're not going to jump into" on-line services to patients until other plans get more experience.
Harvard Pilgrim was severely criticized three years ago when it became known that the records of members with mental health problems were widely available to general practitioners. "We learned a lot about patient confidentiality from that," Dr. Cochran said.
Most health plans already have Web pages that provide lists of doctors and hospitals in their networks, and information about staying well. But some began to require a password to look at their lists after they learned rival insurers were snooping and recruiting their doctors.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey even provides street maps showing the primary-care doctor closest to the member. Members of all Blue Cross plans can dial up a list of participating hospitals in 80 countries.
A few plans, like Health Partners in Minnesota and Blue Shield of California, let employers and insurance agents enroll members over the Internet. Blue Shield also has contracts with 18 California companies with 9,000 employees who can select their type of coverage and physicians over an encryption-protected Internet line.
"There's a big difference between security and confidentiality," said A. G. Breitenstein, director of the Health Law Institute, a private nonprofit research center in Boston. "The salient question is: How many people other than the Kaiser member have access to that lab result?"
Information about prescription drugs that may indicate that a patient has the virus that causes AIDS or suffers from depression or male impotence is "bought, sold, disseminated and researched on, all without the patient's consent or knowledge," she said.
The American Medical Association says patients have a basic right to the privacy of their medical information and records, a right that "should be honored unless waived by the patient," Dr. Palmisano said.
It is common for individuals worried about privacy to avoid seeing a doctor who would take notes on their condition. Others pay out of their own pocket for psychotherapy, for example, rather than risk having their insurers or employers know of their problem.
On the other hand, a rigorous requirement for individual consent could cripple the work of epidemiological researchers, who scan thousands of patient records seeking patterns to explain diseases like cancer.
"Privacy is always an issue," said Jay Silverstein, chief marketing officer of Oxford. "We're not in the business of collecting medical records."
Aetna said that in a test over several months, experts from the International Computer Security Association had tried unsuccessfully to breach its privacy safeguards.
Tim Kieschnick, a strategic development manager at Kaiser, said his employees were using industry standards similar to those used in on-line banking to encrypt exchanges between Kaiser and the member. "We are satisfied with it and still improving it," he said, though adding that there was always more to improve.
Part of the fear is that the Internet, which attracts millions of curious cybersurfers every day, could be a breeding ground for horror stories similar to those involving computerized medical records at hospitals and insurance companies.
Tammy Wynette, the country singer, was outraged to find her medical records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center reported in two supermarket tabloids. She sued the papers, The National Enquirer and The Star, for invasion of privacy, and the case was settled -- no terms were disclosed -- shortly before she died in April.
Paul Tsongas, the late Massachusetts Senator, complained before he died last year that an insurer had used his computerized medical records without his permission in a training program.
And Nydia M. Velazquez, a Brooklyn Congresswoman, testified at a Senate hearing that records of her treatment several years ago at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, following a suicide attempt, were leaked to newspapers.
"There is a long history of bribing hospital employees to get to the records," said Alan F. Westin, a legal scholar and privacy expert. Even before electronic communication, he said, such records had been misused by blackmailers to discredit rival executives for promotions and by neighbors in personal vendettas.
"We don't yet have adequate security for access to Internet technology," he said.
A number of experts on privacy issues warned that a determined hacker could probably get into protected records. But several privacy specialists said that most interlopers would have little interest in medical insurance claims.
The economic payoff from breaking into health care records is "a lot less than for banks," said Dr. Clayton of Columbia. "A hacker in Holland probably wouldn't gain any economic benefit from knowing that my syphilis test was positive," he said.

HEADLINE: British Petroleum Is Buying Amoco in $48.2 Billion Deal

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
British Petroleum P.L.C. announced today that it would acquire the American oil giant Amoco for $48.2 billion in stock in the largest oil industry merger ever.
The deal would also be the largest takeover of an American company by a foreign concern. 
 If approved by regulators and by shareholders of both companies, BP Amoco, as the company is to be known, would be the world's third-largest multinational oil company in terms of net income after the Exxon Corporation and the Royal Dutch/ Shell Group of Companies.
Consumers in the United States are unlikely to feel any immediate effects of the deal. Prices at gas pumps are mostly dependent on world oil supplies, which are currently plentiful. And while the consolidation of gasoline outlets may slightly decrease retail competition, the combined exploration prowess of the companies could eventually result in larger supplies of crude oil.
Executives at other oil companies said that the deal benefited both B.P. and Amoco. The main strength of British Petroleum, they said, is in looking for and finding oil reserves. But the company is weak in the business of refining oil into products and chemicals and distributing it to consumers, operations at which Amoco excels.
"The strength of Amoco is in areas that are lacking at B.P. such as the natural gas reserves which it possesses and petrochemicals," Andrew Avramides, an oil consultant in London, said. "The merger brings these assets into a larger, far more comprehensive structure, making BP Amoco a true giant with enhanced structures."
The merger will allow the companies to consolidate their spending on exploration, which would exceed that of Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. In addition, officials of both companies said the deal would allow them to become more competitive in regions like the former Soviet Union, China and Latin America, where competition has increased as companies seek new sources of revenue.
Analysts and deal makers alike said the announcement could set off a wave of consolidation in oil companies not unlike that seen in the financial services and telecommunications industries. Until now, the major players in the oil industry have relied on joint ventures, rather than comprehensive acquisitions, to increase profitability.
Companies that might consider moves now are the Mobil Corporation, the Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc., all of which saw their stocks rise today despite a general downdraft in the American stock markets.
People close to the talks said that the chief executive of British Petroleum, Sir John Browne, approached the chairman of Amoco, H. Laurance Fuller, in late spring about a possible merger. Sir John believed that consolidation was inevitiable and, an executive close to the deal said, "Both of these guys said if we don't pick a partner, we are going to be last."
It is expected that the merger will take months to be approved by regulators, although there are no obvious impediments to the deal's structure.
A Justice Department spokesman said: "A merger of this magnitude has to come under review. We will be looking at it."
The two companies employ a total of 99,450 workers worldwide. Amoco, with 43,450 total employees, expects to cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs, but none in its Chicago headquarters, Dan Dietsch, the company's media relations adviser, said. A spokesman for B.P. said the company planned to cut about 1,000 jobs in Cleveland when refining and marketing operations there are moved to Chicago. Other cuts are expected at Amoco's research offices in Houston.
Amoco and B.P. said that Chicago would be the headquarters for the new company's North American operations in refining, marketing and transportation, "and, in due course, the worldwide chemicals business." Amoco is the fourth-largest company in the Chicago area.
Today's merger announcement coincided with another significant drop in oil prices on world markets, which are flooded with supplies. Producers have been hurt by the economic slowdown in Asian economies, a mild winter and overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
As the deal was announced in London this afternoon, the average oil price around the world hit a 10-year low at about $10 a barrel, which, adjusted for inflation, is lower than the price of oil 25 years ago.
Senior oil executives and analysts alike stressed that the move by British Petroleum must be looked at as a strategic decision transcending the fluctuations in the price of what remains one of the world's most essential commodities and a vital element of economic growth worldwide. Mr. Avramides said that today's low oil prices were "not a permanent condition."
David Mayhew of Cazenove & Company, a London brokerage firm, said that no company could ignore current oil prices, but added that "this move provides considerable economic and financial benefits in the long run; it makes a great deal of sense."
Sir John, who will head the new company as its chief executive, said the merger was forced by the need for economies of scale and by increasing competition in a global economy.
"International competition in the industry is already fierce and will grow more acute as new players emerge," Sir John said at a news conference today. "In such a climate the best investment opportunities will go increasingly to companies that have the size and financial strength to take on those large-scale projects that offer a truly distinctive return."
In an interview later, he added: "People always ask me if such mergers are good for consumers. Competition always is good for consumers. It is also exciting and challenging. This deal moves us into the super-league and provides the prospect of real competition for those already in it."
Sir John said that the merger would bring some $2 billion in savings as the companies eliminated redundancies and consolidated divisions.
The merger ranks as the world's largest combination of industrial companies, surpassing the $36 billion acquisition of the Chrysler Corporation by Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany announced in May, and it is the sixth-largest merger of any type.
Both parties in the merger descend at least in part from John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire, which was split up in the early part of this century by the United States Supreme Court. BP America was the former Standard Oil of Ohio Company, and Amoco was created from Standard Oil of Indiana.
A senior oil executive in Kuwait, a country that holds about 7 percent of B.P.'s shares, hailed the deal. "Over the past decade they have gone through a major rationalization process cutting costs, staffing, increasing their reserves of oil worldwide and their efficiency," the Kuwait official, who insisted on anonymity, said in an interview in London.
B.P. will exchange American depository receipts equivalent to 3.97 of its shares for each Amoco share. B.P. closed Monday at 7.73, making the value of the deal $50.15 for each Amoco share, or $48.2 billion based on 964,406 million Amoco shares outstanding.
By the close of trading today, B.P. shares had increased 22 pence in London, to 7.95, raising the value of the takeover to $49.7 billion. Shares of Amoco, which had closed at $41 on Monday, climbed as high as $52.125 in early trading before closing today at $46.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The board of the new company, which will be based in London, will have 13 B.P. directors and 9 from Amoco. Amoco must pay $950 million if it breaks the agreement; B.P. will have to pay $1 billion if it backs out. Although both companies strove today to represent the deal as a merger, analysts tended to look at it as an acquisition by B.P., which will control 60 percent of the new company. British Petroleum will also assume $4.86 billion in long-term Amoco debt.
The combined company will have 9.2 billion barrels of crude oil in reserves. Amoco has been struggling recently to refocus its growth overseas in an effort to move away from the saturated American market. The company sold about one-third of its domestic oil and natural gas properties last year. By buying Amoco, B.P. also acquires 9,300 retail gasoline outlets. The new company will also be the largest natural gas producer in North America. If completed, the merger would make B.P. the largest company in Britain, supplanting the pharmaceutical manufacturer Glaxo Wellcome.
For the first six months of the year, Amoco's net income fell to $673 million from $1.3 billion a year ago and revenues dropped to $15.4 billion from $17.6 billion.
Share prices of United States oil companies have been battered this year because of overproduction by world oil producers and falling demand from Southeast Asian countries. Amoco's stock, which was split earlier this year, is down 12 percent from a year earlier.
British Petroleum was advised by J. P. Morgan & Company and the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. Amoco was advised by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz law firm.

HEADLINE: THE MARKET TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW;
Asia Crisis Takes Toll On U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Stocks buckled yesterday as investors grew increasingly fearful that sickly Asian economies would drive down corporate earnings at United States companies in the second half of the year.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent on the day, closing at 8,462.85. That puts the average 9.3 percent below its July 17 high of 9,337.97 and within shouting distance of a 10 percent correction. 
 Unlike last Tuesday's 300-point decline, which came on a day with little in the way of news, yesterday's drop came amid a raft of fresh and frightening world developments. First was an indication that the Asian typhoon appeared to be gathering speed. Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report that the country's worst slump since World War II was deepening; this sent the Japanese yen plunging to 147.35 to the dollar, setting an eight-year low.
The yen is crucial to world markets because the further it falls, the greater the fear that China will devalue its currency, causing another round of devaluations across the Pacific Rim. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 219.43 points yesterday, or 1.4 percent, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index lost 3.6 percent. Malaysia's stock index fell to its lowest level in 10 years.
 Asian markets were steadier on Wednesday. The Nikkei was virtually unchanged in afternoon trading, while the Hang Seng was up six-tenths of 1 percent at midday.
The situation in Russia worsened as well yesterday as investors, concerned that the Russian Government would not be able to meet its debt payments this year, fled the country's stocks and bonds. Latin American stocks reeled as well.
By the time all this news had registered with United States investors -- around 10:30 A.M. -- the Dow was down 220 points. At its low point, it had lost 254 points, or almost 3 percent. By the end of the day, a buying spree in oil stocks brought the average back a bit to close down 112 points.
Once again, smaller stocks took bigger hits yesterday than their large-capitalization brethren. The Nasdaq composite index lost 46.51 points, or 2.53 percent.
By all accounts, investors seemed to watch the day's events warily but without panicking. Several mutual fund companies reported that the heaviest selling took place in the morning. According to John Woerth, a spokesman for the Vanguard Group, buyers began returning to equity funds shortly after noon.
But not everybody was willing to buy on this particular market dip. One stockbroker in St. Louis reported a distinct mood change among his clients. Last Tuesday, when the Dow dipped nearly 300 points, the bargain hunters came out in force. But they were on the sidelines yesterday.
In any case, the consensus du jour among Wall Street analysts -- that a bear market cannot begin unless interest rates rise or a recession looms -- lost much of its credibility yesterday. "The earnings side of the stock market is really starting to deteriorate rapidly," said Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. "We are in a profit recession where we will have zero or minus 10 percent earnings growth this year. That's what we think the market is seeing here."
Indeed, three elements began to sink into the investor psyche yesterday. One was that the continuing deterioration in Asia means corporate earnings among American companies in the second half will not bounce back as Wall Street's Pollyanna analysts continue to claim. Although hard data to support this belief will not be available for quite some time, anecdotes about declining sales at a variety of American companies are spreading. The stock market is picking up this buzz.
Yesterday's developments in Russia also seemed to show that investors are increasingly skeptical about governments' ability to stem currency devaluations. Back in June, when the United States Treasury joined the Japanese Government in defending the yen, it was an attempt to stop the Asian contagion dead in its tracks. So much for that idea: the yen is seven-tenths of 1 percent below where it was when the two Governments intervened.
The $22.6 billion bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund in mid-July was another line in the sand drawn by Robert E. Rubin, Secretary of the Treasury, and the International Monetary Fund. The bailout was given an initial chance of success by investors hoping to see fiscal reforms across Russia. But Charles A. Peabody, an analyst at Mitchell Securities, said: "The markets are starting to wonder why Secretary Rubin and the I.M.F. have not been successful. The markets fear that they are failing."
But the most troubling view that crept onto investors' radar screens yesterday was that for all the Federal Reserve's concerns about inflation, it could be deflation that ultimately undoes the United States stock market. As investors absorb the possibility of another round of Asian devaluations, so too do they begin to comprehend what a deflationary spiral could bring.
Deflation is disastrous for an economy, as Japan is discovering, because as the prices of goods fall, consumer spending grinds to a halt. People simply wait to buy goods until they feel that the prices will fall no further. What this kind of behavior does to earnings is obvious.
E. Han Kim is professor of finance and international business and director of the Mitsui Financial Research Center at the University of Michigan Business school. Mr. Kim also acted as a financial adviser during the debt negotiations with the Korean Government earlier this year and is a specialist in Asian finance and economies. While last year's devaluations actually benefited the United States economy by keeping prices of foreign goods down and inflation low, he said, American companies would find another devaluation less pleasant.
"Right now we have virtually zero inflation," he said. "So the next thing could be deflation. The chance of a deflationary spiral is greater now. It was really slim before, but is a real danger now."
One reason why even the whiff of deflation scares the daylights out of the stock market is that it is a virtual unknown. The United States economy has not experienced deflation since the 1930's, so few investors know what to expect or how to measure it. "What scares people the most is the unknown," Mr. Kim said.
Economists do know that deflation plays out slowly and insidiously and that the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, has little in his arsenal to counteract it. While Mr. Greenspan can curb inflation by slamming on the monetary brakes and raising interest rates, in a deflationary environment the Fed has few levers to pull. The only way to get out of a deflationary period is to contract the supply of goods. This means shutting plants, laying off workers -- anything that will remove excess supply from the economy and restore companies' ability to raise prices of their goods.
So what are the chances that China will devalue its currency? Better and better with each fall of the yen, say market watchers.
Richard Babson, chairman and president of Babson United Inc., an investment advisory firm with $2 billion under management, said: "We expect the Chinese to devalue and unpeg the Hong Kong dollar in the first quarter of next year. If it's a choice between maintaining an international system by not devaluing and having riots in the streets of Beijing, they'll devalue."

HEADLINE: THE CANADIAN BUCK STOPS AT THE BORDER;
Towns in North Country Feel the Pinch Of Their Neighbors' Weak Currency

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: OGDENSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
It is high summer in the North Country, with the back-to-school shopping season fast approaching. Time for local business people to reminisce about the days not so long ago when the Canadians flocked across the border at this time of year as dependably as the swallows to Capistrano.
"They would show up with empty suitcases and literally no spare clothes, and they would do all their clothes shopping in one afternoon," said Norman V. Garrelts, the president of Hacketts, a local department store here, recalling another North Country store he once managed. "At the end of the day, the parking lot would be covered with empty shopping bags." 
 Lou Williams, the owner of two motels here, remembered: "They would come over on Friday and, basically, party hearty all night and spend all day Saturday shopping. Then they'd shop a little more on Sunday and go home."
Now, the Canadians are staying away. The Canadian dollar has fallen to its lowest level in modern times, and the commercial fortunes of dozens of towns along the border have fallen with it.
It is as if half the people around here had suddenly moved away. Along almost all of the United States-Canada border, the Canadian side is much more populous, and shopping by Canadians, who were drawn across the border by lower sales taxes, longer shopping hours and often more choices, has formed an important part of local markets on the American side.
Since the Canadian dollar began to plummet, however, trips by Canadians to New York State, by far the biggest destination for Canadians, declined by 9.3 percent, to 2.4 million trips in 1997 from 2.6 million in 1996, according to Statistics Canada, a Government agency. Canadian spending in the United States has declined for each of the three consecutive quarters ending in March, the latest figures available.
In the small towns of northernmost New York State, the decline has been even more acute.
"We have three shopping centers, and one is derelict, one is struggling and the third is half-full," Mr. Garrelts said. "We were just over-stored, and it was all based on getting the Canadian dollar."
And if that was not bad enough, Mr. Garrelts suspects that his own American customers, lured by Canadian advertising in newspapers on this side of the border, are beginning to venture north.
"The Canadians aren't dumb," he said. "Now they're advertising in our papers for our customers."
The effects of the Canadian dollar's drop have been felt all along the snaking border, from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
At the Bellisfair Mall in Bellingham, Wash., business is down 5 to 10 percent, said John Bucksbaum, the executive vice president at General Growth Properties, which owns the mall. And Blaine, Wash., which sits right on the Canadian border, seems to be hurting even more.
"Being a border town, we kind of took for granted that all the Canadians would come down," said Anne Fournier, the coordinator for the Blaine Visitors Information Center.
Mickie Blazicevic, a supervisor at Cost Cutters in Blaine -- which Ms. Fournier described as "where Canadians used to go" -- said that even with the discount outlet's lower prices there were fewer Canadians going across the border regularly to buy groceries. And several gas stations in the area have closed.
In Maine, towns that had refashioned themselves as French Canadian tourist destinations, complete with signs in French, are also feeling the pinch, said Vaughn Stinson, the executive director of the Maine Publicity Bureau. "It's really been very, very soft," he said. "They have just not come in the numbers this year."
For most Americans, the decline in Canadian spending in the United States may mean little more than a drop in the number of Canadian quarters, pennies and dimes that show up in their pocket change.
But people in the North Country, as the four New York counties that border the St. Lawrence River are known, are connected to Canada as much as or more than they are to the rest of the state. And they have been that way since before Gov. Daniel Tompkins, in 1808, sent the New York militia to defend the customs house at Ogdensburg from irate smugglers on both sides of the river.
After all, Syracuse, the closest American city, is three and a half hours away by car, while Albany is four and a half hours, and New York City, nine. But Ottawa, with a million residents, is less than one hour from the river, and Montreal, a little more than two.
"We are oriented toward Canada, absolutely," said Ram L. Chugh (pronounced choodge), a professor of economics and director of the Rural Services Institute at the State University College at Potsdam. "Our commercial relations are not only with Canada, but our major cultural, sophisticated and important urban areas are Ottawa and Montreal. We even go to Ottawa when we want to fly to the U.S.A."
Per-capita income in the four New York counties bordering the St. Lawrence River -- Jefferson, St. Lawrence, Franklin and Clinton -- is among the lowest in the state, averaging $14,700 a year, compared with $24,900 for the entire state. The average unemployment rate in 1997 was 8.1 percent, compared with 5.5 percent for the whole state, although the impact of lost Canadian trade on employment has been offset in the far north by state prison construction and Federal military base spending in recent years.
Not surprisingly, people here follow the value of the Canadian dollar the way farmers watch the weather. And what they have seen has been troubling.
Driven down by the low worldwide demand for Canadian commodities, which is partly a function of the Asian economic crisis, the value of the Canadian dollar has fallen from a high of 89.3 cents in American money in 1990 to 66 cents, a loss of 26 percent of the Canadian dollar's purchasing power in the United States.
Traffic on the Ogdensburg Bridge to Canada reflects the widening disparity between the two dollars. Bridge crossings hit a peak of 866,000 in 1991-92, when the Canadian dollar could still hold its own, but has declined without interruption each year since, to 517,000 crossings both ways in 1997.
"First it was a 10 percent difference and then it was 20 percent, and it just got harder and harder to market to the Canadians," said Mr. Williams, the motel owner who is also president of the Ogdensburg Chamber of Commerce. When times were good, Mr. Williams said, 30 to 40 percent of his customers were Canadians, and American wedding receptions had to clear out of his restaurant by 6 P.M. to make way for the Canadians. Now, he said, perhaps 5 percent of his trade is with Canadians, and newlyweds can linger at their parties.
For a while, as the Canadian dollar slid, American businesses tried to keep their Canadian customers by giving them, in effect, a discount. Signs saying, "Canadian at par," offered equal value for both currencies at many stores. Informal discounts are still common -- Mr. Williams gives Canadian customers 75 cents for their dollar, instead of the market's 66 cents -- but the advantage has clearly moved across the river: "$1.00 U.S. = $1.50 Canadian," says an advertisement for Young's clothing store in Prescott, Ontario, that ran in local American papers.
The loss of so much of Mr. Williams's business is not just a theoretical problem for Ron Dashnow, a handyman who often works for him. For one thing, Mr. Dashnow's wife, Sue, lost her job at a Canadian paper goods plant in Ogdensburg when the plant moved back across the border a year ago, chased home by the rising cost of paying employees in American dollars, Mr. Dashnow said. And Mr. Dashnow is no longer sure Mr. Williams will need him to put a new roof on one of his motels.
"If Lou doesn't get the trade, I'm not going to get a job putting that roof on -- it just goes down the line," he said.
Do not blame Bobbie White, an 18-year old from Wallpole, Ontario, who was on the American side the other day not to shop, but to hunt for a job that pays in American dollars. "To me, the way the dollar has gone means 'Stay on the Canadian side,' " Ms. White said. "Everybody used to come over here to shop all the time -- there were these long lines at the border going back -- but not anymore."
"Now you need that almighty American dollar," her father, Robert, a police officer, said with rueful good cheer.
Ms. White's first stop in job-hunting was at a sparkling, 500,000-square-foot mall built in Massena, 35 miles east of here, to capture Canadian business. The St. Lawrence Centre -- even the spelling is Canadian -- opened in 1990, when the Canadian dollar stood at nearly 90 cents in American money and as the Canadian Government was about to impose the widely detested 7 percent national sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax.
"Because of all of those factors, the Canadians were basically flocking to the U.S.," said Ron Patnode, director of marketing for the mall. "Our license plate count showed that 40 to 50 percent of our shoppers were Canadian, but then it began to decline."
The mall's license plate census hit 10 percent Canadians in 1995, Mr. Patnode said, but it has come back some to about 20 to 22 percent. "They're still coming, but it's not like it was before," he said.
"I used to go the Massena mall," said Rosa Spagnola, a Canadian from Prescott who recently graduated from Clarkson College in Potsdam. "It was new, it was American -- that was definitely part of the psychology. But I pretty much shop on the other side now -- a loyal Canadian."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the financial strains on upstate New York since the fall of the Canadian dollar to record lows misstated the college affiliation of a woman who said she shopped in Canada. Rosa Spagnola graduated from Clarkson University, in Potsdam, N.Y.; Clarkson College is in Omaha.

HEADLINE: DESIGN NOTEBOOK;
Barbecue Pits for Those With Money to Burn

BYLINE: By Donna Paul 

 BODY:
SMOKE gets in their eyes -- and that's only part of the attraction. Once man cooked over an open fire in a cave. Some time later came the 1950's backyard grill, a mammoth creation etched on the landscape in brick or stone. In the 60's, more mobile chefs, or those without backyards, swore by their portable hibachis and Weber kettle grills. And then came the 80's and the portable gas-fired grills that turned summer cookery into something as romantic as, say, lighting the kitchen range.
And now? After two decades of growth, the American economy has brought a return to the backyard barbecue. Fire-hungry homeowners who want to keep up with the Dow Joneses are moving beyond rusty iron grills to a new generation of built-ins. They want fish baskets, wood-fired pizza and bread ovens, smokers and rotisseries. They may even want a designer fire pit. 
 That's because the experience of cooking over wood or charcoal is powerful. "The mingling of the fragrances with the air, the unique quality of the smoke and the aroma of charcoal is very healing and purifying," said Barrie Kavasch, a Native American food historian who maintains that fire is "emotionally magnetic."
Whether it's done in a primitive oven in a hole in the ground or in a rooted-in-stone artisanal outdoor command post of the sort that is becoming popular today, cooking over fire is in fact booming. Steven Raichlen, author of "The Barbecue! Bible" (Workman, 1998), says he believes that the "grill mania" sweeping the country is a reaction to the high-tech lives people are living. "Grilling has a timelessness about it," he said. "It appeals to a primal yearning for fire-cooked food."
In Hamilton, Mass., a seaside town north of Boston, a tall stone fireplace has a shiny stainless-steel grill and a fancy rotisserie. Its owner, Frank McClelland, a chef in Boston, lives in a new house, built a year ago, along with the outdoor hearth. "I wanted to experience the great pleasure of cooking outside during the spring, summer and fall months," Mr. McClelland said.
Frank Martin, the owner of Martin Grill and Oven Works, in Providence, R.I., recently made a fish basket for Mr. McClelland that attaches to the rotisserie. Mr. Martin said that the demand for expensive outdoor cooking areas is increasing and that outdoor ovens for the home have risen to 20 percent of his business, from 5 percent five years ago.
Alice Ross, a food historian who has taught courses in historical cookery in Smithtown, N.Y., for 20 years, noticed the change about two years ago. "All of a sudden there was an interest specifically in building brick ovens and learning how to bake and cook in them," Ms. Ross said. The demand was so great that she has added a course on the subject.
When Mr. McClelland and his family moved to Hamilton from an apartment above his Boston restaurant, L'Espalier, he hired Peter Giordano, who describes himself as a muratore. (The word is Italian for mason.) Mr. Giordano, born in Palermo, Sicily, has been building with stone since he was 14. Now 53, he and his son Peter Jr., 26, built a fireplace for Mr. McClelland that is an update of a traditional design.
The fireplace is made primarily of local field stone. The stone chimney and grill area are built on a brick base; counters and the grill are standard height, 36 inches. High-quality iron spot bricks, which cost $1.35 apiece as against 40 cents for standard bricks, was chosen. The top of the chimney is made of the same bluestone as the surrounding terrace, and a food preparation area is also made of bluestone.
Although the design is simple and timeless, it includes modern modifications, particularly inside the fireplace. For the walls, the masons used cement blocks rather than solid stone. "If we would have built this using the ancient method, we would have had 12- to 16-inch solid walls on both sides," Peter Giordano Sr. said. Instead they determined that stone veneer over cement blocks would be more efficient and less expensive. Yet, the cost for the fireplace still ran about $5,000, or $35 a square foot.
Worth it, Mr. McClelland said. "When I cook at home, I love to let my hair down," he said. "The idea of coming out here when the weather is cool and roasting game or meat is fantastic."
In Austin, Tex., June and Mark Chandler purchased a house four years ago and found a crumbling outdoor fireplace held together by little more than ivy. They hired Gardens, a local landscape design and construction concern, to recreate and embellish an outdoor cooking area where one had been built 70 years earlier.
Bill Bauer, an architectural designer at Gardens, was inspired by traditional Italian stone techniques to create a new oven, entertainment area, grill and terrace. He said his emphasis was on using stone the way it is supposed to be used. "There is nothing fancy here," he said. "We used the simplest materials: limestone, galvanized metal and pea gravel. What this is really about it is how it is executed."
Using blocks of white Texas limestone measuring 24 by 12 by 6 inches, Mr. Bauer made the walls of the oven tower 12 inches thick. "Stone is meant to be heavy and big and support itself," he said. "In today's world, stone is often used as a veneer. In our construction, all of our stone becomes load-bearing walls."
When the quarry stone arrived, it was in a rough rectangular shape; stonemasons reworked each block by hand to make certain the corners were crisp and straight.
The limestone blocks in the Chandlers' original terrace had been pushed up by tree roots. The masons were able to recycle the blocks for the new terrace; pea gravel was used to fill in where the roots were intruding.
The $2,500 wood-fired pizza oven the Chandlers selected came from Italy in terra-cotta sections. Although they fit together tightly, Mr. Bauer had stonemasons seal the oven entirely with a layer of cement.
The tower that houses the oven looks like a folly sitting in a Tuscan garden. It is 10 feet high with a standing-seam metal roof. Ivy climbs its walls, and the whole thing looks as if it had been on this spot for years.
The terrace is 30 feet square, including the area for the barbecue grill, storage cabinets and galvanized metal counter tops, which won't rust, set along a 19-foot-long limestone wall. Cabinet doors are made of teak and wire mesh. The total cost was about $38,000.
When Donald and Virginia Sohn were renovating a 60-foot-long terrace behind their home in Beverly Farms, Mass., "it seemed to need a fireplace," Mrs. Sohn said. What she had in mind was quite different from what her architect, John Pears, drew for her. Mr. Pears, who was born in South Africa, presented a hybrid of several different fireplaces he had seen in Africa.
"Particularly in Malawi, they don't do structures," he said. "They make a pit in the ground. Here the sunken terrace that already existed became like the pit."
Stone walls surrounded the area, and would provide seating. It was the congeniality of a circle around a fire that inspired Mr. Pears. "Everyone faces inward and looks at each other across this event, while people cook together," he explained. In the end, he adapted an African concept to fit an American life style.
The fireplace consists of a 48-inch circular drum, built with bricks recycled from a chimney in a nearby carriage house. Firewood is stored on a bluestone cap above the drum. The firebox is a conical steel structure that contains the fire. Topping that is a 42-inch rotating steel grill. The grill gently spirals up and down, so food can be raised high when the fire is hot and lowered as it cools. Mr. Pears also designed a circular steel ledge, at counter height, to hold implements, plates and drinks.
Custom fabrication added to the costs. With the architect's design fee, the tab for the Sohns' grill was nearly $15,000. But it was an instant success.
"The first party we had was in October, and the night was brisk," Ms. Sohn said. "As the evening drew on, the crowd sat on the walls around the fireplace."
Whether a fire pit, a pizza oven or a fish basket added to a fireplace well anchored to the land, the new accouterments have attracted fans of entertaining outdoors. "If you are cooking your very chic buffalo burgers on a very chic outdoor grill," said Ms. Kavasch, the food historian, "they do taste better."
 
The Fire Bearers
 
AN outdoor oven is usually dome-shaped and gets as hot as 600 to 700 degrees. Wood is set inside and fired up, and afterward the coals are raked out. Baking is done directly on the oven floor.
"Correct dimensions when building an oven are critical," said Frank Martin, owner of Martin Grill and Oven Works in Providence, R.I. "The door height should be no more than 65 percent of the height to the top of the oven."
Outdoor ovens begin at $5,000. Sources for them include Mr. Martin's company, at (401) 724-1491; Peter Giordano of Gloucester, Mass., (508) 283-2793, and Gardens in Austin, Tex., (512) 467-9934.

HEADLINE: Braindump on the Blue Badge: A Guide to Microspeak

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
DETROIT and Hollywood have invented scores of words and phrases that have become part of America's speech and psyche. Tail fin, mini-series and sitcom quickly come to mind.
Now that role falls to Microsoft. The company that has shaped the way hundreds of millions of people use computers is helping to shape the way people talk as well, with words like facemail and self-toast and new meanings for terms like dog food and ask. 
 Microspeak is a slangy company jargon made up of dozens of words and phrases commonly used at Microsoft. This Microjargon, which includes word usages unique to Microsoft as well as usages from elsewhere in the high-tech and low-tech worlds, has been documented in an informal lexicon written by current and former workers at the company, based in Redmond, Wash.
At Microsoft, "dog food" means software not fit for public consumption but good enough for internal purposes. "Code warrior" refers to a developer who writes code for software. The workers at the Redmond campus now utter sentences like, "It's kind of a klugey solution, but we don't have the cycles to clean it up."
More than a dozen current and former Microsoft blue badges (permanent Microsoft employees) and orange badges (temporary workers and independent contractors) are among the contributors to the lexicon of Microspeak, which can be seen on the Web at cinepad. com/mslex.htm. Ken Barnes, the principal compiler and editor of the lexicon, was editor of Microsoft's Music Central site when he left the company in June; he gave Circuits permission to reprint some of the definitions.
While the lexicon began life as a semi-underground enterprise, it eventually won some kind of company sanction. The company's corporate newsletter, Micro News, ran a story on it, and it was posted on Microsoft's company Web site in all its irreverence -- around the time that the company, Mr. Barnes said, began creating a similar list of its own. This may prove two things: not only that the lexicon is a good read but also that language is the ultimate software.
 
 
Adminisphere -- Organizationally speaking, the levels starting directly above you, characterized by their general cluelessness about issues you're well versed in and tendencies to make policy decisions that ignore your expert input.
 
Ask -- Used as a noun, preceded by "the," as in, "What's the ask?" which basically means, "What are you asking?" or, "What's the question?"
Bandwidth -- A cumbersome synonym for "time," as in, "I don't have the bandwidth to deal with that issue," but with implications beyond the merely temporal, encompassing the larger issue of mental resources or capacity.
 
Binary problem -- A method of paring down a complex issue to a two-possible-solutions scenario (yes or no, 1 or 0). Described by a resident Microsoft philosopher as "classic MS reductivism" and "clearly an economical way of thinking since it eliminates all need to consider the vast gray area that occupies the psychic space of most issues and problems."
 
Bitstorm -- A volume of traffic on a service high enough to cause the digital equivalent of gridlock.
 
Black hole -- A project requiring infinite amounts of work.
 
Bleeding edge -- Synonym for "cutting edge," with an added implication of the pioneer's vulnerability. Example: "We're really on the bleeding edge with this product. Hope it sells through."
 
Bloatware -- Software that takes up a huge amount of space on your hard drive. Synonym: spacehog.
 
Blue badge -- (Sometimes, slightly derogatorily, blue badger.) Synonym for full-time Microsoft employees, the Brahmins of the deeply ingrained Microsoft caste system, whose card keys have a blue background rather than the orange used for contractors and green for vendors. Derivative terms include "turn blue," meaning to earn full-time status.
 
BOOP -- One of at least 10,000 peculiar-to-Microsoft acronyms. There are so many casually-tossed-off acronyms (most of three letters, like OOF, for Out of Facility) in daily use that there is even an acronym for the concept itself: T.L.A. (three-letter acronym). This particular four-letter acronym is especially disarming; it stands for "Bill and the Office of the President," meaning Bill Gates and his three top honchos. After a reorganization on Dec. 3, 1996, BOOP was replaced by the less-endearing Executive Committee.
 
Bouncing -- Cybernetic equivalent of going off the air for repairs, a new app or other internal tinkering. "The system is bouncing at 4:30 and should be up in 20 minutes."
 
Braindump -- A process by which a departing Microsoft employee or contractor imparts the essential information vital to performing his or her job to the designated replacement. The process normally consumes no more than five minutes immediately prior to the incumbent's departure from the company, nevermore to return.
 
Bug -- All-purpose term for mistake, error, glitch. Despite its universal acceptance, the term is deliberately avoided by Microsoft technical support personnel when referring to Microsoft software. Employed instead are such euphemisms as "issue" or more highly evolved doublespeak terms like "undocumented feature," "challenge" or "design side effect." Company loyalists insist, however, that one reason for this circumlocution is that in Microspeak, "bug" has the all-inclusive definition of any problem or complaint filed about a product, whether valid or not, as opposed to the general usage, which refers only to actual problems.
 
Build -- The drive to complete a project or new version of a product. "The IE 4.0 build is eating up all our dev resources."
Bump -- Synonym for "push back," i.e., readdress an issue after an unsatisfactory or dilatory response. As in "You'll need to bump legal again on the permissions issue."
 
Buttoned down -- Compliment, meaning tightly reasoned, clear, concise, etc. Not often heard of late.
 
Buyoff -- Approval from above; green light. "We need BOOP's buyoff before this project's a go."
C.L.M. -- Three-Letter Acronym for "career-limiting move." Badmouthing adminispheric dictates, no matter how ill-considered, can be a C.L.M.
Context-switch -- A verb, unbelievably, meaning "change subjects." Example: "Enough about outsourcing issues. Let's context-switch to planning the rollout."
 
Crisp -- Well-reasoned, precisely reasoned. Opposite of random.
 
Cycles -- Another approximate synonym for "time," as in, "There aren't enough cycles in the day to drive this issue." Often used in tandem with the verb "burn," as in, "He's really burning a lot of cycles trying to resolve those U.I. issues."
 
Death march -- The long, lingering final countdown to a ship date, involving 16- to 25-hour days, catnaps on couches and plenty of "flat food" (food, mostly from vending machines, that you can slip under people's doors so they can keep working).
 
Disambiguate -- A remarkably unclear way to say "clarify."
 
Drive -- To push; to captain the initiative on a particular issue or project. "Ed is driving the HTML issue for the product."
 
E.O.D. -- Endemic T.L.A. (three-letter acronym) meaning "end of day." Example: "I need your take-away from the off-site by E.O.D. tomorrow."
 
Eye candy -- A commonly used term denoting visually attractive material, analogous to "ear candy" in the music business.
 
Facemail -- Technologically backward means of communication, clearly inferior to voice mail or E-mail. Involves actually walking to someone's office and speaking to him or her face to face. Considered highly inefficient and declasse.
 
Feature -- Euphemism for bug. Dysfunctional attributes in a product are often "explained" away by apologists with the phrase, "It's not a bug, it's a feature." As a result, "it's a feature" became synonymous with "it's a bummer."
 
Feewall -- A barrier of demarcation for financial responsibility. "Does this project fall on our side of the feewall?" translates directly as, "Do we have to pay for this?"
 
Fiber media -- Material published on the hopelessly archaic medium of paper. Example: "Yeah, I used to be a writer in fiber media, but now I'm a content provider in cybermedia."
 
Freeze -- Point in a project's times pan after which no more changes can be permitted. Or, as Cityspeak Dictionary puts it, "Point in product development after which the answer to all great new ideas is no."
 
Generating content -- Writing. "We'll need to hire some content providers to generate content by Milestone 1."
 
Global fix -- A programmatic trick to correct all instances of a recurring error. "Ed's working on a global fix to turn all the commas in the CD-ROM into semicolons."
 
Granular -- Generally used in tandem with the verb "to get," as in, "We need to get granular on this issue," meaning to examine the fine details.
 
Gronk -- The sound of a computer embroiled in bandwidth issues. "I tried to reboot, but my computer just sat there gronking until I had to call Help Desk."
 
Issue -- All-purpose term for practically anything relating to a product, from a particular characteristic or bug to a delicate diplomatic initiative.
 
Klugey -- (Also kludgey; pronounced CLUE-gee.) Clunky, inefficient, inelegant. "It's kind of a klugey solution, but we don't have the cycles to clean it up." Also used in noun form as kluge or kludge.
 
Live -- Odd biomorphic usage, sort of an electronic half-life. "Where will this data live?" means, "Where will this data be located?"
 
Mapping -- Targeting. "Mapping a user group" is synonymous with "targeting an audience."
 
Media -- Content that isn't words. Media can include photos, song clips, illustrations.
 
N.D.A. -- For Nondisclosure Agreement, meaning Keep Your Mouth Shut. A legal document, invoked by Microsoft lawyers for anything more sensitive than setting a lunch date, that allows them to crucify anyone who reveals confidential information.
 
Net -- Summarize. "Ed really knows how to net a presentation." Related command: Net it out, meaning boil it down.
 
New paradigm -- Pompous way of essentially saying "unique": "This Web site establishes a new paradigm on the Net."
Nonlinear -- Becoming nonlinear means becoming irrationally angry. "When he found out the R.T.M. date was slipping, Ed went totally nonlinear."
 
Offline -- A synonym for "in private" or "confidentially"; "Let's take this offline" equals "let's talk about this in private." Often used as a semipolite way of saying, "Shut up about that, you impolitic idiot."
 
OOF -- A T.L.A. (three-letter acronym) that has turned into a word of its own. Stands for "out of office." Historians tell us that OOF originally meant "out of facility." Occasionally used, rather irritatingly, in conversation: "I'm OOF next Friday; you'll have to drive on it."
 
Open the kimono -- A marvelous phrase of non-Microsoft origin, probably stemming from the rash of Japanese acquisitions of American enterprises in the 80's, that has been adopted into the Microspeak marketing lexicon. Basically a somewhat sexist synonym for "open the books," it means to reveal the inner workings of a project or company to a prospective new partner.
Orange badge -- Contractor, temp. From the background color of the photo ID badge-card key used for temporary workers.
 
Own -- To take responsibility for an issue. Ownership is even more serious than drivership; you can drive an issue without owning it, but it's unlikely that you would own it without also driving it.
 
Ping -- A reminder, or (used as a verb, which is slightly more common) to remind: "I need to ping my program manager to get some more test help."
 
Quality bar -- The remarkably flexible level of acceptability in a product. Tends inexorably to drop as the pressure of an impending milestone or other deadline builds.
 
Random -- A pejorative term to describe poorly reasoned analysis. Antonym: crisp.
Randomize -- To distract or throw off track by constantly changing course or emphasizing irrelevant details. "Marketing randomized him by shifting the goalposts every week."
 
Reality distortion field -- When a team deludes itself that it can achieve impossibly tight milestones and solve insurmountable tech problems.
 
Self-toast -- To fatally contradict yourself. Extension of the widespread mainstream usage of "toast" as "history," "dead," "burned out."
 
Showstopper -- A function, object or issue important enough to jeopardize a ship date. In other words, a really big bug.
 
Spec -- Used as both noun and verb: as verb, to analyze a field of information prior to the commencement of a project; as noun, the analysis of that information. Also, a preliminary plan or prospectus. "Ed will spec the song clips to see which ones we need to swap out"; "Ed, have you finished the song-clip spec yet?"
 
Take-away -- Not, as might be suspected, food to go, but impressions gleaned from a meeting or message. "My take-away from his E-mail was that he wasn't ready to drill down yet."
 
Taxonomy of options -- A greatly murkier (and therefore infinitely preferable) way of saying "range of choices."
 
T.L.A. -- Three-letter acronym. A widespread general term in computer-speak, but refined to a way of life (if not a metalanguage) at Microsoft.
 
Touch skin -- Same basic meaning as facemail or face time. A meeting arranged to counter the austerity of communicating in cyberspace. "We flew that guy to Redmond just so we could touch skin."
 
Truline -- (From screenwriting jargon.) One-sentence summary of a project's projected appeal or purpose.
 
Uninstalled -- Fired, canned, dismissed.
 
Vaporware -- A Microsoft classic, dating back to at least the early 90's) and now escaped into the world at large. Software that was conceived (and probably promoted and advertised) but never came to fruition; by extension, a foolish or fanciful conceit.
 
Weasel text -- A message on a Microsoft Web site explaining why a popular feature or option has been discontinued.
 
Weasel user -- What the outside world has learned to label "computer nerd." Specifically, a buyer of a Microsoft product who bombards P.S.S. (the company's customer support apparatus) with constant and generally ludicrous technical complaints.
 
Zero-bug release -- Not, as you might suspect, a version of a software product that's error-free, but a release with the major bugs eliminated, retaining plenty of less significant problems.

Don't Flunk the Future

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The press is drawn irresistibly to that which is loud and destructive. This seems especially true when it comes to leadership in the black community. Persistent, quiet, dedicated work generates little in the way of headlines or air time. But if someone starts making outrageous comments and playing the fool, the reporters will come running.
Hugh Price, President of the National Urban League, is not a noisy man. But he is saying some things that need to be heard. "The data tell us loud and clear," said Mr. Price, "that our children are decaying academically. We say our children equal our destiny. But what destiny awaits us if nearly 80 percent of our youngsters in Denver fail the fourth-grade reading tests, as they did last year?" 
 Delivering the keynote address at the annual Urban League conference, which was held in Philadelphia last week, Mr. Price warned: "The achievement deficits facing our children will be our undoing if we don't reverse them."
His words echoed those of retired Gen. Colin Powell, who said at the N.A.A.C.P. conference in Atlanta last month that there would be no point in preserving affirmative action programs if black youngsters were not prepared academically or socially to take advantage of them.
Both men stressed that a vast field of opportunity is now open to black youngsters in the U.S. But only catastrophe will result if the black community fails to do a better job at what Mr. Price calls "the urgent matter of preparation."
The basic preparation begins long before conception. "We must make certain that our youngsters don't start out behind the eight ball," said Mr. Price. "Yet that's exactly what we do by bringing infants into this world before their parents are mature enough to nurture and provide for them."
He told his audience that at a minimum, just to avoid the scourge of poverty, "There are three things black parents must persuade their teen-agers to do. First, get their high school diploma. Second, get married before having their first child. Third, hold off on having their first child until after they turn 20 themselves."
He said: "Only about 8 percent of children raised in households that follow these rules experience poverty. By contrast, 80 percent of the youngsters in households that ignore these rules end up poor."
Mr. Price was blunt at times in his speech and in a recent interview, but he was not pessimistic. He cited a number of encouraging trends, including the birth rate for unmarried black women, which has reached a 40-year low, and the high school graduation rate of black youngsters, which now equals that of whites.
Still, too many black youngsters are in serious trouble academically, including a large percentage of those who are graduating. And Mr. Price seemed astounded by what he described as the "blase" attitude toward this continuing academic failure.
"We say we want our youngsters to do well in school," he said, "but how involved are we in making certain that actually happens? Blase is the word. There's no other way to describe why we tolerate the lackadaisical attitude of many of our children and the lousy performance of the schools they attend."
He said: "I know I'm butting into other people's personal business. But this is no time for politeness, obliqueness or complacency. There's too much at stake and time is running out -- for our children and, thus, for our people."
Despite the myriad problems that continue to plague African-Americans, Mr. Price believes that the current conditions in the United States offer blacks the "best shot we have ever had to shove ourselves the rest of the way into the American mainstream."
He said: "With unemployment so low, employers are gobbling up almost every willing and able worker with a pulse. Shame on us if we don't seize this historic opening in the economy."
Racial discrimination? It must be fought wherever it still exists, said Mr. Price. But he suggested that the most egregious forms are, in fact, abating. He said, "I think we are moving rapidly toward the day when if you've got something to put on the table, employers aren't going to care what color you are."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Lower Dollar andSteadier Stocks Hurt Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities turned slightly lower yesterday, as the dollar fell against the yen before steadying, making dollar-denominated investments like Government securities less attractive to foreign investors.
Also putting some pressure on bonds was the Treasury's $11 billion auction of new 10-year notes, which followed a disappointing auction of five-year notes on Tuesday. Yesterday's auction results turned out to be not as good as hoped. 
 A third factor was that the stock market showed signs of recovery, easing the flight to bonds. Still, bonds held fast after a manufacturing report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggested the nation's economic growth was slowing and inflation was subdued.
By late in the day, the 30-year bond was down 2/32, to a price of 107 15/32, while the yield was unchanged at 5.60 percent.
Dealers and traders expect the market to remain uncertain through the Treasury auctions this week as investors may be wary, not only of the 10-year note yesterday but also the 30-year bond today, since everything is currently on the high side of the recent price range.
As a result, even though many people believe the dollar will strengthen again and the Asian markets will get worse before they get better, the 10-year issue was awarded at a price to yield 5.428 percent, a little behind what was hoped for, traders said.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst with Thomson Global Markets, said yesterday's auction, because it was a reopening of an existing issue of 10-year notes, was considered a dealer-driven event, rather than one for smaller investors. "It was better for those wanting to buy large amounts without moving the market," he said.
"The market behaved well late in day because of a rumor that the Russian ruble might be devalued, which spurred a late flight to quality into Treasuries," he said. "Regarding tomorrow's auction of 30-year bonds, the closer we get to a yield of 5.50 percent on the long bond, the harder it is to sell. Dealers might have to cheapen the issue to make it more attractive."
In when-issued trading, the 30-year bond was being offered at a price to yield 5.55 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Rich nation, poor nation. Is anyone even looking for a cure?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell; This is Peter Passell's final Economic Scene column. He is leaving the staff of The New York Times to become editor of the public policy quarterly for the Milken Institute.

 BODY:
MOST economists are most comfortable thinking and writing about what is, or will be. Would cutting the capital gains tax to 15 percent transform couch potatoes into software entrepreneurs? Would 4 percent unemployment lead to inflation? Just ask you friendly, neighborhood Ph.D.
And, truth be known, most economists have a weakness for clever fixes that exploit free markets. Want to prevent the overfishing of coastal waters? Privatize the rights to fish. Want to curb global warming for a fraction of the cost of conserving energy at home? Let Western consumers pay the Chinese and Russians to cut their emissions. 
 But efficiency isn't an end in itself: making more stuff for less gets you only part of the way to the economist's nirvana. And maybe, just maybe, economists -- and other Americans -- are worrying too little about dividing up the spoils.
America's economic system does work better than the obvious alternatives. After all, the socialist utopias collapsed under the cumulative weight of their internal contradictions. Asia's crony capitalism has proved that it isn't ready for prime time. Europe's mixed economies perch on a powder keg of 20 percent youth unemployment -- and can't think of any way out, save for the risky strategy of following the advice of Alexander Hamilton and adopting a common currency.
But the celebration may be getting out of hand. For while the American system is doing many things right, most economists would agree that it is doing one big thing wrong: for the last quarter century, virtually all the bounty of growth has gone to the educated, enterprising and already-affluent.
Not so long ago, growth was seen as the solution to all problems. Competitive markets, the not-so-dismal scientists reminded us, had insured that two-thirds of all income had gone to wages as far back as the division between capital and labor could be measured. Hence, a growing, fully employed economy would mean rising living standards for all.
But since the 1970's, economists have learned that a very nasty devil lurks in the details. While labor still captures about two-thirds of national income, only skilled workers have benefited. And even within this elite, the phenomenon of "winner take all" has increased the gaps between the successful and the also-rans in occupations as diverse as law, plumbing and basketball.
Defenders of business-as-usual argue that the consequences are less than meet the eye. Inequality of consumption, they note, is less extreme than inequality of wages or incomes. Social mobility allows some of the poor to make the leap to the comfortable middle. The earned-income tax credit -- a negative income tax for the working poor -- has offset some of the wage decline of the unskilled. And the elderly, the people traditionally at greatest risk, are generally shielded from poverty by Social Security and Medicare.
But such rationalizations get you only so far in an economy that has grown steadily less egalitarian over the last quarter century. The most comprehensive estimate of income distribution, by Lynn Karoly of the Rand Corporation, shows that the real income of the bottom 10th of American families fell by 13 percent between 1973 and 1995. And Brooks Pierce, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has found this growing inequality has been magnified by the decline of company-wide medical and pension benefits.
What could be done to right the imbalance without damaging the engine of economic growth? Probably plenty.
The earned-income tax credit could be expanded. State and Federal tax systems could be tilted, effectively eliminating taxes on the bottom third of the income distribution and making up the lost revenue with modest increases on the top third. Government could take some of the sting out of private income inequality by increasing outlays for communal services -- day care, early childhood education, mass transit, recreation.
What is being done? Precious little. Virtually all recent tax changes have had the effect of allowing the rich to keep more of their earnings. President Clinton's acclaimed effort to make college affordable has funneled the greatest share of the tax breaks to the middle class.
Surprising the skeptics, welfare reform has been successful in cutting dependence. But it is safe to say that tough love gets you only so far. Even its most optimistic supporters concede that the social infrastructure of day care and medical benefits is sorely lacking -- and that roughly one-third of the welfare caseload is hopelessly unprepared for gainful employment.
A decade hence, will hindsight show that American capitalism, too, was drifting toward the ashcan of history? Probably not. But history rarely looks kindly on societies that trumpet their virtues and ignore their failings.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Shift Some Jet Output to Long Beach to Ease Strain

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Aiming to ease the strain on one of its most troubled production lines in Seattle, the Boeing company plans to announce today that it will begin building some of its single-aisle 737 jets in Long Beach, Calif., beginning next year.
The decision, which has been highly anticipated for months, is good news for workers at the former McDonnell Douglas operations in California, who have seen three of the four airplanes currently built there canceled by Boeing since it bought McDonnell Douglas last year for $16.3 billion. 
 But Boeing executives and union officials acknowledged that the move would only restore about 600 jobs, a fraction of the number that will be lost when production on the discontinued Douglas jets stops in 2000.
Boeing is expected to say that it will start building three of the best-selling 737's a month in Long Beach starting in the second half of next year, possibly rising to as many as five a month after that, said executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The announcement is part of changes to an overall consolidation plan that Boeing first announced in March.
The company is also expected to say that it will transfer some of its satellite operations to California and will make St. Louis the headquarters of all future production of fighter planes.
Neither move will result in the transfer of many jobs. But the St. Louis decision could be significant if Boeing wins the competition to produce the Pentagon's new Joint Strike Fighter.
The company has said that it expects to eliminate between 18,000 and 28,000 of its 238,000 jobs by 2000 but today's announcement is not expected to provide more details on how those targets will be reached.
Boeing officials declined to comment. The move was reported yesterday by The Seattle Times.
The 737 move has been opposed by the International Association of Machinists, who represent 39,000 hourly Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area. Though Boeing now has more orders for the 737 than it can handle and has paid heavy penalties to airlines for missing delivery dates, workers fear that they will lose their jobs if orders dry up in the future.
The machinists' contract is set to expire next year, and Boeing is eager to avoid a strike like the one it suffered in 1995. The situation is complicated by the fact that the machinists' union and the United Automobile Workers union, which represents 7,600 hourly workers at Long Beach and is just as eager to get the new work as the machinists are worried about losing it, are set to merge in the next few years.
An eight-member joint committee led by Frederick C. Mitchell, the Boeing executive in charge of commercial airplane production, and Bill Johnson, the president of the union local, has been meeting in recent weeks to reach some sort of an accord.
One executive who requested anonymity said that the two sides were close to an agreement yesterday but that talks were still being held. Boeing was willing to limit production in California to five planes a month and offer some assurances that there would be no layoffs as a result of the new production line, he added.
The machinists' union did not respond to inquiries yesterday.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Interest Rates Favor U.S. Borrowers

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
One side effect of the financial crisis in Asia is incredibly low interest rates for American consumers.
Because of the region's malaise, demand for computers and their components and a variety of other products is dwindling, putting downward pressure on the earnings of many American companies. But that very damper on growth has made inflation a distant worry and kept interest rates attractive. 
 Long-term interest rates have reached historic lows in recent days, and consumers can largely expect more of the same, according to economists and market analysts.
On Tuesday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond touched 5.55 percent, its lowest level since the Treasury Department began issuing bonds on a regular basis in 1977.
Yields fall when investors clamor for bonds and push up their prices. That is what happened on Tuesday as fears increased that Japan's economic recession would worsen and investors fled worldwide equity markets for the relative safety of bonds backed by the United States Government. Yesterday the yield on the 30-year bond was down 2/32 , to a price of 10715/32 , while the yield was unchanged at 5.60 percent.
"The general feeling is that interest rates will remain good and there's not a lot of economic news out there to steer us otherwise," said Greg Lumsden, a managing director of loan originations at Countrywide Credit Industries, one of the nation's largest mortgage loan providers.
Already, home mortgage refinancings have hit their highest levels in years and are expected to continue at a strong pace. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage, which started the year at 7.05 percent, is now 6.9 percent, and has been below 7 percent for eight weeks, the longest stretch since 1993, according to Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage provider. Rates are expected to remain in that range through the end of the year, said Robert Barr, a senior economist at Fannie Mae.
If Asia's economic crisis continues to worsen, "our forecast may be a little too conservative," Mr. Barr said, suggesting that rates could fall even further.
Fannie Mae forecasts that $1.33 trillion in mortgages, for home purchases and refinancings, will be made in 1998, up from $834 billion last year. The record was $1.2 trillion in 1993.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, increasingly used as a gauge for mortgage rates, rose six basis points, to 5.43 percent yesterday, but remains near its June low of 5.35 percent, also its lowest level since 1993.
Declines in rates for other types of consumer borrowing are even more striking.
Four-year new-car loans are now available from banks at an average rate of 9.05 percent, down from 9.21 percent at the beginning of the year and 9.36 percent a year ago, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
And bank-issued credit cards offer fixed rates almost two percentage points lower than where they were at the beginning of the year. At this time last year, the average rate was 16.85 percent and it remained at 16.82 at the beginning of this year. At the current rate of about 15.06 percent, a consumer carrying a card with a $1,000 balance who switches to the lower rate from the rate of a year ago could save $200 a year in interest payments.
"The rates for people with good credit continue to go down," Bill Anderson, president of The Bank Rate Monitor, said.
A stellar credit history may qualify consumers for a credit card with a 9.90 percent fixed rate that Capital One Financial began in April or a similar card at 9.99 percent from First USA Inc.
Declining interest rates and fierce competition have also pushed some introductory "teaser" rates for new card holders to as low as zero, from the recent average of about 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent, said Robert B. McKinley, president of Cardweb Inc., a Gettysburg, Pa., research firm that tracks the card industry.
While rates are unlikely to fall much more, credit card rates for consumers with a less-than-rosy credit history are actually wending higher as lenders become more concerned about their own risks in a weakening economic environment, Mr. McKinley said. Credit card issuers are also imposing more stringent restrictions on customers. One late payment, for example, can cause a customer to forfeit a low introductory rate, and late payment fees are rising, he said.
In what is known as the subprime card market, which caters to consumers with low incomes, poor credit or no credit history, rates now run 18 percent to 21 percent, said Spencer Nilson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
Low rates on everything from mortgages to auto loans raise a note of caution from some economists.
If the economy slows drastically, consumers may find themselves overextended after taking advantage of today's favorable rates to borrow, Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Company International, said.
"People have called this the Goldilocks economy, but maybe we're getting to the part where Goldilocks meets the three bears," Mr. Brusca said.

Though the continuing economic problems in Asia have put a damper on the U.S. economy, they have also helped keep a lid on inflation. This in turn has led to lower interest rates, in particular on consumer loans, as the following examples illustrate. The graph compares interest rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage ($200,000 loan); a 48-month new car loan ($15,000 loan); and a fixed-rate credit card ($2,000 balance) from one-year ago to August 5,1998, and shows the annual savings in dollars.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Cautious Buyers,Prowling for Bargains, Lift Dow 90.11

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Once again, the bargain hunters tiptoed back into the stock market yesterday, picking up some of the issues battered the previous day.
This buying of small-company, oil, semiconductor and other beleaguered stocks repeated the pattern that led the stock market to rebound at the end of last week, after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 299.43 points on Aug. 4, its third-worst point decline in history. 
 But there were also signs of renewed interest in the big-name stocks that have performed well all year, in part because investors viewed earnings reliability as a haven in an uncertain market. This buying helped lift the Dow Jones industrial average by more than 100 points during the day. And it held most of the gains, ending up 90.11 points, or 1.1 percent, at 8,552.96.
Analysts, however, do not seem ready to say the market is out of danger yet. And they point out that much of the market -- especially small-company stocks -- is already in a bear market, having fallen more than 20 percent in value.
"It is too much to expect the market to reach the bottom on this leg," said Byron R. Wien, United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "First you have a frightening down leg, a recovery from that, a relaxation of investor fears, and then another down leg." That, he concluded, means there could be more trouble in October, the time of last year's record one-day point decline in the Dow. His forecast for the Dow at year-end is 8,000.
Jeffrey M. Applegate at Lehman Brothers is more optimistic, forecasting the Dow at 9,900 at year's end, which would give the Dow an unprecedented four years in a row of double-digit gains.
Still, he said, the market faces trouble ahead, in part because Japan has yet to prove that it can get its economy back on track. "You can't say we are out of this rolling correction yet," he said.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 15.24 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,084.22. Although both the Dow and the S.& P. regained most of their Tuesday losses, they are still down 8.4 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, from their July highs.
As has been the case in the few days of recovery recently, the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks and the Nasdaq index, with many high-technology stocks, outperformed the marquee indexes. The Russell rose 7.95 points, or 2 percent, to 408.55, while the Nasdaq climbed 32.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,825.53. They are 16.9 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, below their highs.
The buying yesterday was prompted in part by a reversal in the Japanese yen, which rallied against the dollar after hitting an eight-year low on Monday. This led to a mixed day for stocks in Asia -- which was better than usual -- and a rally in Europe before Wall Street opened.
"Just any day tell me what the dollar-yen is doing, and I will tell you what U.S. equities are doing," said Mr. Applegate of Lehman Brothers.
But Latin American stocks continued to plunge, despite the yen's rally. The Bovespa index in Brazil fell 4.4 percent and the Mexican Bolsa index dropped 1.9 percent. Both markets were rattled by growing fears that Russia would be forced to devalue the ruble, adding to the pressure on other emerging market currencies.
World markets have been following the movements of the yen recently because it is a signal of the continued weakness of the Japanese economy. American officials say Japan must turn its economy around to lead Asia out of it year-old economic crisis. Only then will Asia's drag on the American economy and corporate earnings be eased.
In addition, the weak yen has focused attention on the possibility of a devaluation by China, a move that would deepen the Asian crisis.
The yen, which finished in New York at 146.44, rallied after Japanese officials indicated overnight that the Government was prepared to intervene in the currency market to support the yen if its decline accelerated. On Tuesday, the yen fell to 147.35 to the dollar, surpassing the 146.78 low it hit before the surprise intervention to support the yen by the United States and Japan in June.
This kind of official jawboning can slow a decline temporarily. But currency traders do not seem overly concerned. Japan's intervention alone to support the yen this spring had almost no lasting impact. And the surprise intervention with the United States on June 17, while effective at the time, did not support the yen for long because Japan did not take the policy actions investors think are needed to deal with the nation's banking problems and to stimulate the economy.
General Electric and Wal-Mart Stores led the Dow higher. G.E., off 11.6 percent after the Dow hit its record high of 9,337.97 on July 17, rose 2 1/16, to 89 3/8. Wal-Mart, which announced a 30 percent surge in earnings on Tuesday, jumped 2, to 66.
And then some stocks have just continued to rise, bucking the market's trend. Apple Computer, whose stock is up 205 percent this year, rose 1 1/16 yesterday, to 40 1/16; it had risen 8.6 percent since the Dow began to plunge.
The performance of American Express yesterday was another indication of how hard it is to rebound in the current environment. It has been one of the best-performing stocks in the Dow this year, although only a middling performer when included among the stocks in the S.& P. 500.
It announced last week that the crisis in Asia would cut into its revenue in the second half of the year, and the stock dropped 6.8 percent in one day. Since hitting a high for the year of 117 7/8 on July 14, American Express had plunged 16.4 percent through Tuesday. Yesterday, it jumped as much as 2 3/4, or 2.8 percent, to 101 1/4. But by the end of the day it had given up most of its gain, rising just 1/8, to 98 5/8.

HEADLINE: Investigating Disappearance, Police Seek Man For Questioning

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Detectives trying to untangle the case of the Upper East Side widow who vanished last month are now focusing on trying to track down a traveling companion of the prime suspects in the case, Sante and Kenneth Kimes.
The police said yesterday that they hoped the man, Jose Antonio Alvarez, 24, would be able to shed light on the disappearance of the widow, Irene Silverman, 82, who was last seen on July 5 and is presumed dead. 
 Mr. Alvarez, who immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1994, apparently met the Kimeses on about May 14 in West Palm Beach, Fla., and drove with them to New York, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said.
"It is not unusual, based on the information we've developed," Mr. Safir said, "for the Kimeses to attach themselves to various people who are either unemployed or down on their luck."
Mr. Safir said that Mr. Alvarez and the Kimeses arrived in New York on June 14, and that Mr. Alvarez was later seen in Mr. Kimes's apartment in Mrs. Silverman's town house and at dinner at the Pierre Hotel with the Kimeses. Mr. Safir emphasized that Mr. Alvarez was wanted for questioning as a witness, not as a suspect.
Detective Tom Clark, of the Police Department in Manalapan, Fla., near West Palm Beach, said Mr. Alvarez had a residence in another nearby town, Belle Glades, and had been doing various odd jobs when he began keeping company with Mr. Kimes and his mother.
Detective Clark said the Florida authorities believe that Mr. Alvarez may have helped the Kimeses buy an $80,000 mobile home with bad checks. The Kimeses made an appointment to buy the 36-foot-long mobile home with certified checks on a Friday afternoon at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in West Palm Beach. By the time the checks bounced on Monday, Detective Clark said, the Kimeses had a 72-hour head start in their new vehicle.
The Kimeses are being held in New York on charges of credit card fraud and passing a bad check in Utah to buy a Lincoln Town Car, which Mr. Safir said investigators believe the Kimeses and Mr. Alvarez drove to New York. Those charges are unrelated to Mrs. Silverman's disappearance.
Detectives and prosecutors have said they suspect that the Kimeses killed Mrs. Silverman as part of a scheme to swindle her out of her town house on East 65th Street. But building a case against them has been difficult because no body has been found and neither of the Kimeses has talked with investigators.
Mr. Safir said that although Mr. Alvarez has not been seen since June 22, the police have no reason to believe he has been the victim of foul play. "He may be able to provide valuable information about the Kimeses' activities here in New York," he said, urging anyone with information on Mr. Alvarez's whereabouts to call the police confidential phone line, (800) 577-TIPS.
Mel A. Sachs, a lawyer representing Kenneth Kimes, said he hoped Mr. Alvarez is found soon. "When this individual, Jose Antonio Alvarez, is located," he said, "it will clearly show that Sante and Kenneth Kimes had absolutely nothing to do with the disappearance of Mrs. Silverman."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Amid Market Turmoil, Small Investor Is Steadfast

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The selling was furious early Tuesday. By 1:30 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average was down 257 points. And while stocks recovered late in the day, the session, the fifth busiest on record, came after a week that had the second- and third-heaviest trading days on record. This surge in activity raises a question: Who exactly is moving the market this summer?
The answer: institutional investors, the same powerful group that sold aggressively last October, when the Dow tumbled 554 points, or 7.2 percent, in a single day. And the same big-time players who have soured repeatedly on the bull market, only to jump back in later, after smaller investors have quietly affirmed their faith. 
 "The institutions are busy -- they're real busy, there's no question about it," said Bill Allyn, director of listed trading at Jefferies & Company in New York, which handles large institutional trades. "There's a lot of blood being spilled."
At the same time, small individual investors have continued to open new brokerage accounts and to buy beaten-down shares, according to executives at mutual fund companies, discount brokerage firms and market analysts.
So this summer, when most investors would be expected to be lounging on a beach somewhere, professional traders and portfolio managers are selling aggressively, presumably on fears about slowing profit growth at home and economic turmoil in Asia. They are also shaking up their portfolios, trying to find ways to beat the leading stock indexes, and engaging in huge program trades, which are growing as a percentage of all trades, according to the New York Stock Exchange.
In fact, in recent weeks computer-driven program trades have accounted for nearly 18 percent of all Big Board volume, up from 10.7 percent just eight years ago. (A program trade consists of a trade of 15 stocks worth at least $1 million).
The statistics may help explain why volume is so heavy this summer, but also why the market may not tumble in October-like fashion: because a huge majority of smaller investors have apparently not yet jumped onto the frenzied selling bandwagon by aggressively redeeming shares at mutual funds.
Of course, reliable statistics about trading activity are inexact and difficult to come by because the identity of most trading is largely secret. But there is a trickle of information that exists about who is trading, and it suggests that institutions (hedge funds, mutual fund companies and brokerage houses) have done the bulk of the selling for the last few weeks, creating a big downdraft in the markets.
Small, individual investors -- while also jittery about corporate earnings and the Asian economic crisis -- have been holding steady, just as they did last October.
"The great majority of small investors have done nothing," said Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman for Charles Schwab & Company, one of the nation's largest discount brokerage firms. "They stick to the market like Velcro."
Concern among smaller investors has certainly been heightened this summer because of market volatility. But brokers say that investors are showing few signs of panic.
"We've seen a lot more rational behavior than we've seen in the past," said Kathy Levinson, chief operating officer of E-trade, a fast-growing on-line brokerage firm. "So while the market has been going down, people have not been panicking."
The idea that institutional investors have been less bullish in these last few weeks is borne out in a study conducted this week by Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. In the period between July 24 and Aug. 11, large institutions have been more aggressive sellers of stocks than smaller investors, according to a study of stock money flows into the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts at Birinyi Associates did this by tracking large block trades -- those of 10,000 shares or more -- against smaller trades of fewer than 10,000 shares, which include, for example, an investor's purchase of 100 shares of I.B.M. Through Tuesday, the study showed, retail trades created about $731 million in net buying on the Big Board, while block trades accounted for $3.47 billion in selling. The bottom line: institutions sold and smaller investors bought.
"The key to this market is the retail investor," said Jeffrey Rubin, an analyst at Birinyi Associates. "The retail investors are the ones who have been really correct about this market. And the institutions haven't been right."
A survey of several brokerage firms this week concluded that smaller investors were nervous after the Dow tumbled 299 points on Aug. 4, and then fell 257 points in the first hours of Tuesday's session. But investors did not aggressively trade so much as inquire.
"We've seen an increase in call volume, but most of the calls are more service-related," said Beth Basilio at the Dreyfus Corporation, noting that people often inquired about the market's recent performance.
And at a Schwab branch office in Manhattan, the week has been anything but tumultuous. Even during Tuesday's steep decline, the office consisted of just a few stragglers, investors checking quotes at a computer bank and cheering on the market as it reversed course. "It's going up; it's going up," said one investor, who refused to give his name. "We've gone up 100 points in 10 minutes."
Mo Kraushar, a 42-year-old computer expert, said he wasn't planning on selling stock. "I'm not moved one way or another," he said tapping away at a computer to check quotes. "I'm a fundamental kind of guy. I just kind of chuckle at it all. It's like a sporting event."
Another measure of individual investor sentiment lies in the on-line trading arena, where about 20 to 25 percent of all retail trading occurs, according to Bill Burnham, an electronic commerce analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
On-line trading has more than doubled in the last year, to about 15 million shares a day, but on-line trading executives say that trading activity has not been unusually high this month.
"The on-line firms are contributing, but their contribution is being overshadowed by the huge volume coming out of hedge funds and other professional market speculators," Mr. Burnham said. "Ultimately, the retail investor can have an impact on the margins, but at a macro level, nothing has the power to move the market like arbitragers and hedge funds."
Last October's huge selloff was much more serious, many analysts say, and it created much more activity, even though average trading volume is actually heavier this month -- about 744 million shares a day, up from about 610 million last October.
Joe Ricketts, chief executive of Ameritrade Holdings, an on-line brokerage firm based in Omaha, said investors continued to open accounts at a steady pace this summer, and that on the day after the Aug. 4 selloff, they were eagerly buying shares using Ameritrade's on-line system.
"We were really busy," Mr. Ricketts said. "The individual investors stepped in to buy that day."
If smaller buyers are active in the market, though, much of that activity may be coming from day traders, individuals who trade professionally and actively each day, and usually close out their positions at the end of the day.
Like many other professional traders, day traders thrive on market volatility, hoping to make large profits in price swings. And with market volatility on the rise -- as a result of concerns about the strength of the bull market -- day traders have been more aggressive than usual, driving up electronic trading volume by about 30 percent, according to James Lee, president of the Electronic Traders Association.
"If there's nothing going on, we won't initiate it, but if there's activity, we'll jump in," said Harvey I. Houtkin, founder of the All-Tech Investment Group in Montvale, N.J., a professional day-trading firm. "If it's an active day, we'll make it even more active."

HEADLINE: Editors' Note

 BODY:
An article last Aug. 20 described the operations of the European Union Bank, an offshore institution based in Antigua. The article said two of the bank's original directors, Aleksandr P. Konanikhin and Mikhail B. Khodorovsky, were officers of the Menatep Bank of Moscow. It quoted unidentified British and American officials who said Menatep had links to Russian organized crime.
In fairness, The Times should have sought a response from Menatep, Mr. Khodorovsky and Mr. Ko nanikhin.
Mr. Khodorovsky has since said the allegations about Menatep were "baseless" and "entirely false." He said last fall that Menatep had earned a B+ rating from Thomson Bank Watch, an international rating service, and had recently gained approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell stock in the United States. He added that the bank had ties to the World Bank and was a "respected, reputable financial institution."
Mr. Khodorovsky said he withdrew as a director of the European Union Bank in 1994, a week after its registration, and played no role in its operations before then.
Mr. Konanikhin said the allegations against him, including an arrest in the United States, visa violations and Russian charges of having embezzled $8 million, resulted from "disinformation" by Russian intelligence, which influenced or duped officials at the United States Department of Justice.
This editors' note was delayed pending the outcome of a lawsuit in London against The International Herald Tribune over the article. The Times was not sued, and the suit has now been settled.

HEADLINE: Text of Solicitation Letter For Legal Expense Trust

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Following is the solicitation letter sent to supporters of the President and Mrs. Clinton under the signature of former Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, as provided by the Clinton Legal Expense Trust. Those receiving the letter also get a certificate for donors to sign and return with their checks.
 
Letter
In today's political climate, public service can exact a disturbing price. There is perhaps no better example than the financial crisis now facing President and Mrs. Clinton. 
 News reports reflect that to conduct his four-year investigation of the Clintons, the independent counsel already has spent more than $40 million of taxpayer money. And supporters of Paula Jones continue to fund her case on appeal.
Since entering the White House, President and Mrs. Clinton have accumulated almost $5 million in legal expenses -- an amount far beyond the President's total compensation or the first family's net worth. They are personally liable for these bills.
The Clinton Legal Expense Trust has been established to enable supporters of the first family throughout America to help defray these enormous costs. Because you are a supporter of the President, we are writing to ask for your help.
Contributions to the trust can be made by any United States citizen who is not a lobbyist or an employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government.
Contributions from PAC's, corporations or labor organizations are not permitted, and no individual can contribute more than $10,000 per year.
All of us should be concerned when the financial burden of public service becomes so great as to discourage good men and women from seeking office. Our President deserves the chance to do his job and serve our nation unburdened by the prospect of a huge personal debt.
Few Americans would deny that President and Mrs. Clinton have worked tirelessly for the benefit of our nation. Their work has helped produce economic prosperity, lower crime and most importantly a new optimism about America and our future.
Their dedication and their achievement deserve our thanks and our generosity.
I have known the President for more than 30 years, and I'm sure that your help will be deeply appreciated by the first family. Please join other friends of the Clintons in contributing to the trust. Your contribution will make a big difference.
P.S.: If you are disturbed by the way politics is conducted today, then what better response than to make your own gesture of decency and generosity. I know that it will be enormous comfort to the first family to know that so many Americans appreciate their work and have come to their aid. Thank you so much for any contribution you send.
 
Certificate
To the trustees: In connection to my contribution to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, I hereby certify that:
*I'm a citizen of the United States;
*I've made my contribution voluntarily and with my own personal funds;
*I'm not a lobbyist registered with the Federal Government;
*I'm not employed by the executive branch of the United States Government;
*Including this contribution, I've not contributed more than $10,000 this calendar year to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust;
*I understand that my name, city, state and the amount of my contribution will be publicly disclosed;
*I understand that my contribution is not tax-deductible.

Asian Malaise Brings Low Rates to Americans
In the complex chain of global economic events, the malaise that has brought pain and suffering to Asians has given American consumers low interest rates -- a trend economists expect to continue.
One result is that home mortgage refinancings have hit their highest levels in years. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage, which started the year at 7.05 percent, is now 6.9 percent. Page D7.
 
Treasury prices slipped, as the dollar fell against the yen before steadying. D7.

Daimler Options Pass Muster
A German court rejected a professor's challenge to the way Daimler-Benz rewards 1,600 of its executives with stock options. Now Daimler can tackle the differences between its executives' pay and executive pay at Chrysler, which it plans to acquire. Daimler's chief executive, Jurgen Schrempp, left, is thought to receive $1.1 million to $1.5 million a year, plus the returns on Daimler stock options. An S.E.C. filing showed Chrysler's chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, received $69 million in bonuses, stock and stock options. D4.
 
Seagram Makes Unexpected Profit
Seagram reported a slim but unexpected $3 million quarterly profit as strong results from its television and music businesses offset lower liquor sales in Asia. D3.

HEADLINE: Giuliani to Stump for G.O.P. Around U.S.

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will be traveling to several states in the next few weeks to present himself as a Republican visionary whose ideas about governance and politics have national applicability. But those visits will not be limited to the exchange of ideas; he will also be raising money for various Republican candidates along the way.
Mr. Giuliani is tentatively scheduled to attend a fund-raising event for the Wisconsin Republican Party in Milwaukee on Aug. 25. The next day, he will swing through Iowa, stopping along the way to help raise money for Representative James A. Leach, the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, deliver a speech to a group of law enforcement officials, and attend a fund-raising event for Jim Ross Lightfoot, Iowa's Republican candidate for governor. 
 A week later, Mr. Giuliani is to travel to South Carolina for a "Victory '98" dinner being held by the Republican State Committee. In mid-October, he will make several appearances in New Hampshire, including one before the Nashua Federated Republican Women's Club. And his aides are working out details for possible visits to other states, including California and Rhode Island.
Both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary figure prominently in Presidential races. But aides to the Mayor were quick to say that his visits to those states did not suggest any Presidential ambition.
"The purpose of the trips is to tell people the story of the successes in New York City and to help influence the Republican Party to accept his views on economic and social issues," said John H. Gross, the Mayor's longtime campaign treasurer. "It is also to try to help those candidates who share the same values that he does."
Nevertheless, Keith Fortmann, the executive director of the Republican Central Committee of Iowa, said visits by prominent out-of-state politicians always carry that undercurrent of ambition. "I know the assumption is that if someone is coming to Iowa, it automatically means he's running for President," he said, adding, "I'm looking forward to seeing what Rudy says, like everybody else."
The trips will mark the first out-of-state political visits that the Mayor has made since addressing a gathering of Republican National Committee members in New York City last month, during which he maintained that the party's future success depended on its ability to be more inclusive. It was an appeal that many read to be as much personal as ideological. Mr. Giuliani, who is interested in higher office, favors abortion rights and is for gay rights and gun control -- positions that are anathema to the party's strong conservative segment.
The Mayor's new-found beneficence on behalf of the Republican Party has not been limited to out-of-state visits. Next week, for example, he is serving as the host of fund-raising events for Linda Lingle, a gubernatorial candidate in Hawaii, and J. D. Hayworth, a conservative Congressman from Arizona. He has already held functions in New York for Jeb Bush, a gubernatorial candidate in Florida; Gary Franks, a Connecticut candidate for the United States Senate, and Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
All this Republican-related effort by Mr. Giuliani comes at a time when New York City has a shot at becoming the host to the Republican National Convention in 2000; the city has traditionally been perceived as too liberal for mainstream Republicans to bless it with their presence. But the administration's hopes were bolstered this week when the national committee announced that New York was one of five finalists. A choice will be made before the end of the year.
Cristyne F. Lategano, the Mayor's communications director, said some of the reasoning behind Mr. Giuliani's peregrinations was to eliminate any lingering impressions of New York City as crime-ridden, drug-infested and otherwise unsafe.
"New York City is one of the safest large cities in America," she said. "Getting that message around is very helpful for New York, especially in luring large conventions."

HEADLINE: For Afghans, Full Circle

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Aug. 12

 BODY:
A quarter of a century after the overthrow of the monarchy cast Afghanistan on a downward spiral into fratricide and destruction, the Islamic hard-liners of the Taliban movement appear to be on the brink of re-unifying the country and imposing their vision of a purist Islamic society.
In a month-long offensive, Taliban forces have overwhelmed the so-called northern alliance, which defied the Islamic militants for two years by holding on to much of the territory north of the Himalayan peaks of the Hindu Kush. 
 With a rush of victories in the last week, the Taliban now hold at least three quarters of Afghanistan, and seem poised to surround the last remnants of the alliance forces in two remaining redoubts, in the Bamiyan region of the central mountains and in the Panjshir valley of the northeast.
The Taliban thus appear to be on the verge of doing something that neither the Soviet invaders in the 1980's nor the American-backed guerrillas who ousted them were unable to do: Bringing peace to a weary, demoralized and underfed country of between 15 million and 20 million people.
While Taliban forces continue to push forward against the scattered and retreating alliance forces, which surrendered 14 northern cities and towns in recent days with only token resistance, the historic significance of the moment was proclaimed by the Taliban's representative at the United Nations in New York, Noorullah Zadran.
"After 25 years of struggle, it seems to us that we have finally come to the end of the struggle," Mr. Zadran said in a television interview today with the BBC.
If so, the outcome is full of tragic irony for a nation that seemed set on a completely opposite course in 1973, when King Zahir Shah, the last representative of the Durrani Dynasty that had ruled the country for 250 years, was ousted in a coup mounted by his cousin, Mohammed Daoud.
As President, Mohammed Daoud proclaimed himself a modernizer but lasted barely five years before he was killed in April 1978 in a coup staged by the Soviet-backed Communist Party, which proclaimed a still more radical modernization program.
The Communists' program aimed at uprooting the pervasive influence of Muslim clerics, whose support of the Durranis had consigned Afghanistan to a social and economic backwardness.
Within hours of seizing the Arg Palace in Kabul, the Afghan capital, the Communists vowed to emancipate Afghan women, achieve universal literacy, and move the country beyond its bullock-cart economy.
But the bid to force compliance with the Communist program, especially in the arch-conservative world of the Afghan village, triggered a civil war that drew in Soviet forces in December 1979.
This in turn prompted President Jimmy Carter and later Ronald Reagan, to commit the United States to backing the Afghan mujahideen, the self-styled Muslim holy warriors, who drove out the Russians in February 1989.
The American effort, backed by other Western countries and by Saudi Arabia, turned Afghanistan into one of the most dramatic confrontations of the cold war.
By the time the Kremlin withdrew its forces, the Soviet Union was barely three and a half years away from collapse.
But Afghanistan was virtually obliterated as a functioning state, with thousands of villages in rubble, at least a million people dead, and another five million living abroad as refugees, mostly in Iran and Pakistan.
When the Taliban first appeared, in 1995, many in the West were dismayed.
The movement was rooted in the ancient ways of the Afghan village, with its insistence on strict forms of purdah for women and summary executions or amputations for adulterers, blasphemers and thieves. But to many Afghans, the Taliban's rise seemed like an inevitable consequence of the conflict in which modern weapons, poured in with scant consideration for the civilian population, had reduced an ancient society to rubble.
With destruction of many of the attributes of modern civilization -- schools, hospitals and highways -- the way was cleared for a band of village clerics to offer their own brand of salvation.
While educated Afghans recoiled, many others in a country that is overwhelmingly rural accommodated quickly to the Taliban's social strictures. To villagers, and to many city-dwellers, too, what mattered most was that the Taliban held out the prospect of ending a civil war in which most of the factions have long since become little more than warlords, sustaining their rule by banditry, pillage and rape.
Now, the Taliban seem likely to be faced with a continuing resistance from the two remaining opposition forces, the Hezbe-i-Wahdat of Abdul Khalili in the mountainous redoubt of Bamiyan, and the Jamaat-Islami of Ahmed Shah Massoud in the Panjshir Valley.
Mr. Massoud, the most effective guerrilla commander during the war with Soviet forces, seems likely to pose the biggest obstacle to the Taliban. But now that the Taliban have virtually surrounded Mr. Massoud's forces, even his wily battle tactics may not be enough.
Meanwhile Taliban spokesmen have renewed demands for international recognition. So far, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have recognized the Taliban. Internationally, disapproval remains great for the Taliban's social policies, under which most women are banned from working, girls are denied education and dancing, television, kite-flying, bird-keeping and even the trimming of beards are banned.
So far, the Taliban -- the name is taken from an Arabic term meaning seekers after truth -- have played cat-and-mouse with Western Governments and international aid agencies, hinting that harsh policies against women might be relaxed in return for diplomatic recognition.
In the BBC interview today, Mr. Zadran suggested changes were possible, but just as quickly entered what seemed to be a disqualifying condition. "We will never compromise on our religion, Islam," he said.
In recent months, tightening Taliban strictures, including rules that virtually eliminated any direct international assistance for Afghan women, have prompted most aid organizations to suspend operations in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat, as well in Mazar-i-Sharif, the pivotal northern city the Taliban seized last weekend.
With a harsh Afghan winter approaching, there have been fears for the survival of the poorest city-dwellers, including at least 400,000 people in Kabul, the capital, who have relied on Western aid for food.
Russia has led a chorus of dismay at the threat of a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan spreading Islamic militancy.
"Russia considers the stepped-up military activities by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan as a real threat to the commonwealth's southern borders," a Russian Foreign Ministry statement on Tuesday said, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, the former Soviet republics that includes the Muslim states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
Iran has joined the outcry, leaving Pakistan, alone among Afghanistan's neighbors, as a supporter of the Taliban.
But the Taliban's main challenge seems likely to lie at home, among millions of Afghans who yearn for peace, but not for the harsh life vouchsafed by the Taliban.
For these people, the prospect now is for years of living in a society not much different in its political, religious and social rigors from the Afghanistan of the distant past. So far, the signs have been that Western pressure for greater tolerance may not only be ineffective, but a stir that pushes the Muslim clerics who control the Taliban to adopt still harsher constraints.

HEADLINE: If the Shoe Fits, Click It

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG 

 BODY:
MADE-TO-MEASURE" refers to a tailor-made shirt, suit or gown, something that was once available only to the wealthy few. In time, that custom fit may be readily available to the average mall shopper as well, thanks to three-dimensional body scans. Within a year or so, experts say, some consumers are likely to find such computer scans available at a handful of locations ranging from the Mall of America to Fifth Avenue.
Technology being developed in the fashion industry in the United States and abroad is likely to make so-called mass customization a reality rather than an oxymoron. "We have the capability," said Stephen Gray, head of the Computer Clothing Research Center at Nottingham Trent University in England. "If people have been through our body scanners, we can have their data on a smart card that gives the retailer all the information necessary to fit the individuals, who can, in turn, use the Internet to look at fabrics and position the garment on a personalized mannequin of their body type." 
 Right now, body scanners can be found mainly at a few research sites and special effects studios. While clothing manufacturers and retailers are intensely interested in the new technology, they are aware of the many roadblocks on the way to consumer acceptance.
One problem is what Dick Yardley, a manufacturing technology specialist at the American Apparel Manufacturers Association, calls the modesty factor: "Some people don't want everyone to see what they look like in a skintight body stocking." There are, too, the inevitable glitches that will occur when consumers trust the same technology to design their clothes that has created a new meaning for the word "bug" and threatens worldwide disruptions in 2000.
"The technology is amazing," said Andree Conrad, editor of Apparel Industry Magazine, "but inevitably problems will occur. And, granted that the fit is far better than off-the-rack, will consumers be willing to pay for it? The American public is so price-conscious that it has pushed the cost of garments way down. Is it actually going to say, 'I'm willing to pay 20 percent more for a good fit?' Right now, what they're willing to do is take 40 garments into the waiting room and try them all on -- and then say how much they hate to shop when they get home."
Eric Blackwood, a vice president at J. C. Penney, the nationwide chain of department stores, agrees that price is the defining issue for the American market. "Europeans are willing to spend more for their clothing than Americans," he said. "When you customize, the cost is higher. We think the scanners have tremendous potential, but it's not going to happen tomorrow for us. We have to refine the process to get the scanning and manufacturing costs down to what the customer is willing to pay and shrink the scanners, too. The amount of square footage they take up is not economical."
Still, problems and all, manufacturers and retailers, many of them in the high-end office-clothes market, are starting to come forward to embrace the body scanner, bulky though it may be, although few have yet bought. Homi Patel, president and chief operating officer of the Hartmarx Corporation -- which includes Hart, Schaffner & Marx, a major manufacturer of men's clothing in the United States -- is working with a research and training operation in Cary, N.C., that has developed its own scanner. That organization, called TC 2 (for the Textile/Clothing Technology Corporation; it is pronounced tee cee squared) involves more than 100 clothing manufacturers, including J. C. Penney.
"Probably we'll work with department stores to have scanning equipment available and then connected directly into our management information systems to develop custom garments at quick speeds," Mr. Patel said. "True, the scanning machines won't have the charm of a good salesman, but people will get acclimatized. Young people will have no trouble; older people will need more time."
Even if body scanning is slow to spread to mass markets, accurate information on body shape could have a profound effect on the clothing industry. "Even in the shops," Mr. Gray said, "fit is going to be better as we acquire more accurate data about our body shapes."
Those interested in the new technology of digital fashion include Edith Gazzuolo, who expects to operate her scanner at the Mall of America, near Minneapolis; Kathryn Chase, a chemical engineer and ardent seamstress who hopes to open her own scanning parlor at an Atlanta shopping center, and Brooks Brothers, the home of the button-down shirt.
Brooks Brothers has had striking success in the past year with its fledgling computer-assisted shirt-customization program, which began last August. Joe Dixon, a senior vice president for manufacturing at Brooks Brothers, said, "If you have the ability to give people exactly what they want, it's a differentiator."
For now, customers for custom shirts are fitted the traditional way, with a tape measure. Then software adapts the standard Brooks Brothers pattern to specific measurements -- for example, making one sleeve longer than the other -- before the material is cut and sewn. Delivery is promised in about two to three weeks; prices start at $75.
"We were pleasantly surprised by the level of business we've generated," Mr. Dixon said. "We started with a catalogue announcement, and only recently rolled the program out to all the stores. We are already seeing a nice uptake." He said he expected the special-order business to grow. "We're working with a couple of companies on body scanners," Mr. Dixon said, "and when we think it's right for us, we'll go ahead. There's no doubt scanning works for made-to-measure. We just need to make sure that when a customer comes in and has to strip to underwear that the customer really wants to do that."
Levi Strauss, the jeans maker, has had a custom-fit program for women's jeans for several years, using measurements taken by employees. Ike Behar, a high-end shirt company that has boutiques in Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and many other stores, does about 20 percent of its business in custom-fitted shirts but does not use scanners yet. Alan Behar, president of the company, said: "Body scanning is going to become a necessity. The shirt is the closest thing to the body. The shoulder, chest and arm holes are particularly difficult to measure for comfort." He said that his customers were exercising more and that the shirt's fit had to reflect this. He is not worried about customer reaction to scanners, he said.
Neither is Ms. Chase, who is searching for capital to open her Atlanta scanning center and a related Web site. Describing her test of a scanner, she said: "It's almost like a carnival ride. The equipment is draped in black theatrical cloth to keep out the light. You go in, get down to your underwear, put your feet on the white marks and press the button. Lights flash, music plays -- it only takes a few seconds -- and you have all the data the pattern-making software needs for a custom fit."
Ms. Chase got the idea for her business in part from observing her two daughters. "They both have the same measurements -- waist, hips, bust -- but there are very few items that they can trade back and forth," she said. "They don't look good in the same clothes. With 3-D, we'll have a better way of knowing how we actually look in the clothes we want to buy."
Body scanners are crucial to made-to-measure clothing for the masses; the technology takes measurements so patterns can be altered for individual customers.
"Traditionally, tailors have taken these measurements for their own pattern-altering methods," said David Bruner, manager of research and development at TC 2 , "but when you compare one tailor's measurements to another, it turns out each is making an educated guess; in fact, it's all guesswork -- the measurements are notoriously inconsistent."
Both two- and three-dimensional scanners are being used for the body measurements that are the basis for mass customization. In England, the Computer Clothing Research unit at Nottingham Trent University has measured more than 8,000 people. The center uses a system of side profiles and front outlines that is less expensive than point-to-point three-dimensional scanning.
"We were concerned that larger ladies, say size 32, would be unwilling to expose themselves in their underwear," Mr. Gray said. "But when we ran a piece on local radio two years ago, we had women queuing at the door. They said, 'No one understands our clothing problems.' They were glad to volunteer."
Full-color three-dimensional scanning of the entire body is being used by the United States Air Force. After all, pilots wear clothing, too, and helmets. "Everyone is interested," said Kathleen M. Robinette, an anthropologist and mathematician at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio who is managing a program called Caesar, for Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource, the first large-scale whole-body three-dimensional scanning project ever done. "Now that 3-D is here," she said, "We can measure bodies quickly and accurately in a way that tape measures could never accomplish. The technology will be applied in ways that haven't even been imagined yet." Caesar will measure 10,800 men and women of varying weights and ages, 4,000 of them in the United States and 6,800 in Europe.
"We're going to learn for the first time what we're shaped like," said Ms. Robinette, manager of engineering anthropometry, the study of human body measurements, for the Air Force. "The data will help us create realistic computer mannequins to build made-to-measure garments on. It will yield many software tools for the design and production of customized clothing. But it's also going to help for better-fitting clothing in general. Right now, there are many errors as we go from the person to a flat pattern. We'll finally take away the guesswork. It may even lead to consistent sizes across brands."
The United States military has been interested in body measurement since the 1930's because of its responsibility for uniforms and gear that must fit properly, like helmets and gas masks. "By 1980, we agreed there had to be a better way than tape measures," Ms. Robinette said. "We were disposed to 3-D automated scanning methods."
In 1987, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base bought a head-scanning system and developed software for it.
"The scanner was being used for a 'Star Trek' movie," Ms. Robinette said. "The studio was concerned with artistry, but we wanted accuracy. So we developed software not only to drive the scanner and analyze the data but for applications related to apparel."
The data became the basis for things like tight-fitting fighter pilot helmets, oxygen masks and night vision goggles. "Now we're moving on, from head scans to full-body ones," Ms. Robinette said. "Our last full-scale survey was done in 1939, and a lot has changed since then: people's bodies, even our concept of fit."
Mr. Gray, of Nottingham Trent, agrees. "Human size and shape have changed in the McDonald's years," he said.
He credits a small part of the change to undergarments. "Lycra holds things in, but not with the supportive properties of whalebone, so nipples are about five inches lower," he explained. "But there's also the rest of us. Men are more round-shouldered, and almost every person we surveyed has a stomach sticking out. In general, we're not only taller than our parents -- we are fatter."
Mr. Gray says virtual reality software would be only one of many benefits from body scanning. "The advantages will come as well from understanding the size of people and making patterns better," he said. "As the body grows, different bits grow at different rates. Gravity alone means a bigger bust is lower than a smaller one. The stomach protrudes around the sides as well as the front. People want clothing to disguise the bad and emphasize the good; we need good data on body shape to do that."
The Caesar project is expected to yield data useful across industries. Its partners include not only apparel companies, like Lee, Levi Strauss and Vanity Fair, but also other companies with an interest in body shapes and how they are changing, like Boeing and Caterpillar. Gary Pollack of the Society of Automotive Engineers, which is coordinating many administrative functions for the huge project, said there had been no lack of volunteers to be scanned so far. "Everyone has the experience of sitting in a car or airplane seat that is too small," he said. "People want their dimensions looked at and used."
Digital fashion may one day provide not only physical benefits, like clothes that fit better, but also psychological benefits: shoppers may be able to to try on clothes without specifying their size or weight, which many are reluctant to do.
"We hate to say our size," said Linda Freedman, vice president for marketing at Modacad, a Los Angeles company that produces software for electronic commerce. "And everyone -- well, nearly everyone -- lies about their weight. Don't you on your driver's license?"
Starting this August, Modacad will offer a CD-ROM intended to let young women shop for clothes by using 3-D models of different body types to try on their selections. "We ask them to choose a shape, but we don't use words like 'pear-shaped' or any other expressions like that. I'm a pear, myself, but I don't want to be called one," Ms. Freedman said.
So far, digital fashion has produced Kevlar-lined suit jackets that don't rub a bodyguard's chest and snug-fitting helmets and gas masks that would please even Darth Vader. As to whether scanning and virtual try-ons will transform cabbage leaves into Cary Grants -- given a technology that routinely messes up our monthly bills and crashes when loaded with too many Web sites -- it's entirely possible we'll end up looking more like Charlie Chaplin than the Prince of Wales.

HEADLINE: Decline of 24% In Cotton Crop Is Seen for U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The prolonged Southern drought and other weather problems will cut the nation's cotton crop by 24 percent this year from last year's, the Agriculture Department projected today.
Ideal weather elsewhere means the fall soybean harvest remains on track to set a record, the corn crop figures to be the second-largest ever and wheat yields are forecast to reach an all-time high. 
 Such big yields this year and the decrease in foreign demand because of the Asian financial crisis are almost certain to keep down the prices that farmers receive, though that is likely to be somewhat offset by higher yields per acre.
Less cotton had already been planted by farmers because of a three-year decline in prices. But drought and extreme heat in Texas, by far the top cotton-producing state, have reduced this year's expected harvest there by 40 percent, or more than two million 480-pound bales.
About 1.9 million acres of cotton have been abandoned in Texas, or about 37 percent of the acres planted this year.
In the No. 2 cotton state, California, the problem has been prolonged wet weather that triggered soil fungus disease. That state's cotton crop is forecast at 1.8 million bales, down 32 percent from a year earlier.
Coming in conjunction with floods in China's prime growing region, the decline in the harvest could mean higher prices of cotton goods like T-shirts by the middle of next year.
In an effort to ease farmers' troubles, President Clinton signed legislation today to speed $5.5 billion to thousands of farmers.
The law will ease the cash crunch by allowing farmers to receive certain transition payments at the start of the new fiscal year, Oct. 1, instead of waiting until later in the year. Thepayments are intended to wean farmers off crop subsidies.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said today's crop estimates would be used to determine the extent of drought losses and how much more emergency aid was needed above the $500 million in a Senate spending bill.

HEADLINE: BOMBINGS IN EAST AFRICA: THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR;
The 'Devastated' Envoy Now Faces Kenyans' Ire

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 12

 BODY:
This has been an agonizing time for the United States Ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell.
Her embassy was destroyed in a terrorist bombing on Friday that injured her and took the lives of three dozen American and Kenyan colleagues, many of them close friends. 
She has had to set up her mission in temporary quarters while overseeing a chaotic rescue operation and arranging to evacuate dozens of wounded officials and employees.
To make matters harder, she has also become the focus of anger among many Kenyans who believe the United States did too little to help save the people trapped under the rubble of a building next door to the embassy.
"I feel like that building over there -- devastated," Ms. Bushnell said today during a ceremony for rescue workers, pointing at the demolished Ufundi Cooperative House, where more than 100 Kenyans died.
Embassy officials say the bombing was particularly painful for Ms. Bushnell because she had been complaining privately to her superiors in Washington for more than a year about the poor security in Nairobi.
She had argued that the embassy should be moved, but a decision was made in Washington to renovate the existing building instead.
She has a reputation as an effective manager -- indeed, her background was in administration within the State Department. Within two hours of the explosion, a bandaged Ms. Bushnell walked into a temporary command center set up at another building housing the United States Agency for International Development and took charge.
She immediately ordered a secretary to take down a list of priorities: determine who was missing, establish a central control room, set up communications because the local telephones were jammed.
Until last Friday, Kenya was considered a safe foreign posting, a lovely country where diplomats enjoyed safaris and the biggest threat to security was the occasional political riot by students downtown or a spate of carjackings.
That changed drastically when a pickup truck loaded with explosives blew up at the entrance of the embassy's underground parking garage at the rear of the building.
The explosion gutted the mission, demolished the seven-story Ufundi building and killed at least 247 people.
The explosion caught Ambassador Bushnell on the 18th floor of the Cooperative Bank Building next door to the Ufundi building, where she was meeting with the Kenyan Trade Minister.
She was badly cut by flying glass and had to descend on foot through floor after floor of destruction and chaos before being led into a scene of carnage outside.
"Everybody was bleeding," she recalled at an emotional news conference on Saturday. "The banister was wet with blood."
The Ambassador has taken the tragedy personally, friends said. She had prided herself that during a three-year tenure as a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa -- a time when there was genocide in Rwanda and several other dangerous crises on the continent -- no Americans were killed.
"One thing that really upset her was that the whole time she was the Deputy Assistant Secretary in Washington, she never lost an American," one aide said. "Today she's saying, 'Now look what's happened, and it's my fault.' That's what's hurting her most."
Ms. Bushnell was born in Washington to the diplomat's life, the daughter of a career Foreign Service officer. She was raised abroad, in Germany, France, Pakistan and Iran. She speaks fluent French.
After graduating from Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., she worked as a management consultant in Texas before joining the Foreign Service in 1981.
She served as the general services officer in Bombay, and then as the Deputy Chief of Mission in Dakar, Senegal, under George E. Moose, who later became an Assistant Secretary of State and took Ms. Bushnell with him to Washington in 1993.
Like her father, she was on the administrative track in the State Department, which seldom leads to an ambassadorial appointment. But in 1996 President Clinton nominated her to become the Ambassador to Kenya, with the strong support of Mr. Moose.
She is married to a retired lawyer and playwright, Richard Buckley, and has five stepchildren.
In her two years in Kenya, she has been a persistent critic of President Daniel arap Moi's Government, pushing Kenya to live up to its 1992 promise to establish a full-fledged Western-style democracy.
She has also hammered the Moi administration again and again for being slow to clean up corruption, which is a tremendous drag on the economy.
But this week she found herself on the defensive, facing allegations from Kenyan journalists and people in the street that United States marines should have allowed local rescuers to enter the embassy in the hours immediately after the bombing to carry out wounded people. Instead, the marines turned away crowds of good Samaritans.
This evening Ms. Bushnell defended the marines on state television, saying they had been trying not only to protect the crime scene but also to keep self-appointed rescuers from being hurt.
There was a gas tank behind the building that might have exploded, she pointed out. "The effort was to keep everybody out because we didn't know if the gas was going to explode and we didn't know if the building was sound," she said.
Ms. Bushnell also tried to defuse public anger in diplomatic terms. "I feel tremendous anger and frankly it is that anger that helps me keep going," she said.
Embassy officials said Ms. Bushnell had been functioning well on the job, running staff meetings with her usual mix of humor and intensity.
"She's done remarkably well considering that she was almost killed in the explosion," one official said.

HEADLINE: SWISS BANKS REACH HOLOCAUST ACCORD

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Representatives of Swiss commercial banks and Holocaust survivors announced a settlement yesterday in which the banks agreed to pay $1.25 billion in restitution to victims of the Nazi era.
The agreement, intended to settle the claims of tens of thousands of survivors whose families lost assets in World War II, was hailed by Jewish groups and elected officials as providing long-delayed justice for the victims. 
 "I am tremendously pleased and gratified to announce that we've reached a historic agreement," said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who led the move to pressure the Swiss banks into providing money for a settlement. The settlement "will allow us to turn to healing the wounds here and in Switzerland," he added.
The banks involved are UBS, recently formed by the merger of Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank, and Credit Suisse.
As part of the settlement the plaintiffs agreed to drop a major suit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank. Clinton Administration officials said the deal was also contingent on state and local governments agreeing to drop plans for sanctions against the Swiss.
The deal was announced in front of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, where three suits filed over the last two years had been consolidated into one class-action suit. The suits had accused the banks of retaining the assets of Holocaust victims -- assets the plaintiffs' lawyers said had either been deposited in the banks by the victims or had been looted by the Nazis and stored in Swiss banks.
The litigation had been part of a growing effort to force the banks to scour their records to identify dormant accounts and the proceeds of Nazi plunder, and to return the assets to the elderly and frail victims and their heirs.
The effort galvanized many of the victims and stirred bitterness in Switzerland. But animosity was replaced by expressions of good will yesterday, as Mr. D'Amato spoke before a battery of microphones and cameras in downtown Brooklyn. The lawyers and representatives of the two sides were joined by two people who added a moving touch to the discussions of litigation and vast amounts of money to right historical injustices.
One of the two was Estelle Sapir, 73, of Queens, a concentration camp victim who is among the plaintiffs.
"I'm very happy," Ms. Sapir said in a barely audible voice. "I think this should have happened long ago. People need the money. They're getting very old, and this is not charity."
The second person was Christoph Meili, 30, a former night watchman at a Swiss bank who was fired and subjected to death threats and police interrogation in Switzerland for saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a shredder. Mr. Meili is now living in New Jersey and working as a guard at an office building in Manhattan.
"It's a great day," he said. "We move a big step forward. I'm happy. I'm glad to help the survivors."
In a statement, the banks said the settlement "represents a major milestone in our longstanding efforts to insure that justice is served." Banks officials also praised Senator D'Amato and Judge Edward R. Korman for their roles in working out the deal.
Besides direct reimbursement for survivors or heirs who can prove ownership of dormant bank accounts, the settlement envisions a "rough justice" fund to be distributed among Holocaust survivors.
But many details of how to pay the money and who would qualify remain to be worked out. The payments are to be made in four installments over three years, with the first installment, $250 million, not very likely for nine months to a year because of the work needed to start the plan, lawyers for both sides said. The work would include devising a plan to distribute the money to victims with claims who live in the United States and abroad, they said.
A number of states and cities, including New York City and New York State, had threatened to impose sanctions on the Swiss banks if they did not agree to an acceptable settlement. The threat had outraged the Swiss Government, and the sanctions were also opposed by the United States Government, which feared that the threats could complicate efforts at a settlement.
Under Secretary of State Stuart E. Eizenstat said in an interview that the deal was contingent on the officials, led by New York City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, agreeing to drop the proposed sanctions.
The calls for sanctions intensified after a settlement agreement fell apart in June, and New York officials planned to phase in a series of penalties beginning on Sept. 1. The steps ranged from barring city and state funds from overnight deposits in Swiss banks to eventually selling off the stock of Swiss companies held by pension funds.
Mr. McCall and Mr. Hevesi declined to comment last night.
Under the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a suit against the Swiss National Bank, which along with the Swiss Government had refused to negotiate with the plaintiffs, and to indemnify the bank and other Swiss companies against further claims by the plaintiffs.
Mr. Eizenstat said the National Bank's role in processing gold that it knew had been looted was not in contention, but that taking the bank out of the case was a necessary condition to reach a settlement.
"We didn't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good," he said. "I think additional monetary claims by the U.S. Government and by the private sector will not likely be forthcoming." He and lawyers for the banks said neither the Swiss Government nor the Swiss National Bank were contributing to the settlement.
"Nothing can compensate for the destruction of six million Jews," said Rabbi Hertz Frankel, of the World Council of Orthodox Jewish Communities, one of the plaintiffs. "While this is a day of satisfaction, it is not a day of celebration."

HEADLINE: Art Guide

 BODY:

 Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York City museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Summer hours vary for galleries and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
 "THE ACADEMY AND AMERICAN ART: HISTORY AND HIGHLIGHTS," National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Aug. 23). A good, economical selection of works from the museum's collection, including a pair of over-inflated allegories by the Hudson River School painter Asher B. Durand, a couple of dark seascapes by Albert Pinkham Ryder, two lovely still lifes, by William Merrit Chase (a sparkling silver ewer and a Chinese teapot) and John La Farge (a lush magnolia blossom in a purple glass), and a sharp, faux-folk portrait carved in wood by Anne Arnold. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 P.M.; Fridays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $5; $3.50, students and the elderly. (Ken Johnson) 

 * "THE ART OF THE MOTORCYCLE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 20). Yes, it is weird to see motorcycles in the Guggenheim, but American art museums have always shown objects of design, and if there's a certain peril in taking this curious show altogether seriously, on one level that's fitting because motorcycles are frivolous to begin with. The exhibition covers the ground between an 1868 French velocipede with a steam engine beneath the seat (ouch!) and a sleek 1998 MV Agusta. The show is way too big, but many of the bikes really are great to look at, and to like them you don't have to have a tattoo or know what a single-overhead-cam valve gear with enclosed rockers is. Frank O. Gehry's installation of shiny stainless-steel panels covering the rotunda side of Wright's ramp miraculously dematerialize the rotunda and makes the inside of the museum resemble a machine, an apt metaphor. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Admission: $12; $7 students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
 * "BOCCIONI AND WOMEN," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Oct. 18). A key member of the Italian Futurist group at its height, from 1909 to 1916, Umberto Boccioni (1882-1916) worked toward an art that reflected the speed and dynamism of 20th-century civilization. This small show of drawings, prints and one sculpture relating to women conveys the important shifts in Boccioni's style from 1905 until his death while serving in World War I. Unlike, say, Picasso or de Kooning, Boccioni used the women in his life -- his mother, sisters, neighbors and mistress -- to explore artistic strategies rather than his own psyche. In this show, his mother appears to be his favorite model, and the most powerful work is a sculptured head of her that is remarkable for its melding of soft, fleshy contours with Cubistic angles and planes that create a surface as roughed up as a New York City street. This show only hints at Boccioni's real achievements, but it whets the appetite for a retrospective. Hours: Fridays and Saturdays, 9:30 A.M. to 8:45 P.M.; Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 A.M. to 5:15 P.M. Suggested admission: $8 for adults; $4 for students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).
 
 * "BONNARD," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Oct. 13). Don't miss this exhibition. Americans still don't appreciate Pierre Bonnard enough. He doesn't fit comfortably into the history of modernism, so he tends to be regarded as an anachronism, an Impressionist after Impressionism was dead. But his best art deserves to be ranked with Matisse's and Picasso's, and if you doubt this, spend time in the last rooms of the show. It ends with the paintings of Bonnard's wife, Marthe, in the bath -- mysterious elegies of love -- and with his self-portraits, which are unequaled, and that's not forgetting Rembrandt, van Gogh or anyone else. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Fridays, 10:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. Admission: $12.50; $9.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "COMPARATIVE CONCEPTS," Photographs by August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt, Albert Renger-Patzsch and Bernd and Hilla Becher, International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sept. 13). A quietly stunning exhibition that brings together the work of three photographers and one husband-and-wife team, all German, whose work spans most of the century. Each devised and carried out an immense documentary project, built one carefully thought-out image at a time. Sander made a collective portrait of the German people. In exquisite photographs of plants, Blossfeldt traced decorative motifs back to their sources in nature. And Renger-Patzsch and the Bechers recorded the grand forms of industrial architecture according to their very different sensibilities. The show makes palpable the urge to order and thus to understand what motivates so much human endeavor, as well as the order already in place. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Tuesdays, to 8 P.M. Admission: $5.50; $4, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * "DEEP STORAGE: COLLECTING, STORING AND ARCHIVING IN ART P.S.1," P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Aug. 30). This ambitious show documents the urge to document in recent art, a tendency broadened in the 1970's by Performance and Conceptual Art. With Duchamp's "Green Box," which documents his masterpiece "The Large Glass," among its jumping-off points, the show ranges through five decades of mostly American and German art that amasses and orders large quantities of things -- be they objects, materials, images or bits of information. Joseph Cornell, On Kawara, Hanne Darboven and Bernd and Hilla Becher fill in the older generations. Representing the younger are Louise Lawler's deadpan photographs of museum storage rooms, an enormous installation piece (in a box) by Jason Rhoades and the portrait-lined pantheons of the painter David Deutsch. Of particular interest from Germany is Karsten Bott's "One of Each," a manically methodical accumulation of everyday objects, and "Detonation Deutschland," a video installation by Piero Steinle and Julian Rosenfeldt that orchestrates images and sounds of old German buildings being blown up, to mesmerizing, ineffably sad effect. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 P.M. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Smith).
 
 "DAVID GOLDBLATT: PHOTOGRAPHS FROM SOUTH AFRICA," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Oct. 6). This exhibition of 46 photographs of South Africa under apartheid is a dispassionate inventory of churches, monuments, shantytowns, apartment houses, graveyards, toilet seats, billboards, hedges and house trimmings. Mr. Goldblatt practices social iconography, photographing ordinary objects packed with historical and sociological meaning. He was drawn "to the quiet and commonplace, where nothing 'happened' and yet all was contained and immanent." But all is not contained and immanent in these images. Many of the pictures cry out for explanation, and their cry is answered with a torrent of text. Sometimes the words help, turning uninflected pictures into illustrations of the twisted social relations and hideous inequalities of apartheid. Sometimes, though, the text is just a tidal wave of words in which the crucial information drowns. Hours: See above. Admission: $9.50; $6.50, students and the elderly (Sarah Boxer).
 
 "IMAGE AND TEXT: ORIENTALIST WORKS ON PAPER," Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through Sept. 5). Orientalism, or the European cult of Near Eastern exoticism, has been a loaded topic for ideologically minded historians. Avoiding theory, this show presents prints depicting costumes, architecture and anecdotal narratives made by various 18th- and 19th-century Europeans for travel books. The most compelling technically and the most incorrect politically are the salacious photogravures of the French academician Jean-Leon Gerome. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Free (Johnson).
 
 SHIKO MUNAKATA, Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Sept. 27). Munakata (1903-1975) was one of Japan's most celebrated 20th-century printmakers. First inspired by van Gogh reproductions to become a painter, he turned to the woodcut and achieved a radical marriage of the most vital possibilities of Eastern traditionalism and Western modernism. Using children's chisels that could be thrown away when dull, he gouged and hacked away at the wood instinctively, producing expressionistic images of deities, saints, fauna and flora in black and white and hand-colored compositions that at best have great decorative vitality. This show presents about 60 works from the Japan Society's own collection. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Suggested donation: $3 (Johnson).
 
 * FABRIZIO PLESSI, Guggenheim Museum SoHo, 575 Broadway at Prince Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 13). Well-known in Europe for his large-scale video installations, Mr. Plessi weighs in for the first time in New York with four room-size works. The common theme is the clever theatrical play of video imagery with down-to-earth substances and situations: water, stone, metal, architectural elements and the like. In short, he mixes the virtual with the real, as in the show's most impressive piece, "Baroque Cathodic Movements" (1996), in which three ominious-looking wooden structures, painted black and echoing 17th-century architectural motifs, gyrate slowly from the ceiling. Each resembles a sort of furnace whose maw contains amazingly real-looking video flames that appear to be consuming the ancient architecture with a fierce roar. Ultra-theatrical, a ballet in themselves, they suggest coffins for the past while conveying a shivery sense of hellfire and brimstone. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).
 
 ALEKSANDR RODCHENKO, Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9400 (through Oct. 6). By turns illuminating, tragic and chilling, this fascinating exhibition details the work of an artist who spent much of his career on the cutting edge of art and history, a position that did not leave him unscathed. For a few short years in the early 1920's, Russian Constructivism was an artistic revolution in step with a political one, and Rodchenko was its most diversely innovative representative. He made paintings and sculptures that presaged Minimalism and photographs and graphic designs that were similarly ahead of their time, while also serving the needs of the new Soviet state. With Stalin, that state brutally switched its allegiance to Socialist Realism, dismissing, imprisoning and sometimes killing avant-garde artists, or requiring humiliating "reconstructions." This was the path chosen by Rodchenko, as attested by the photo-journalistic images that give this exhibition such a sad conclusion. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 * "TONY SMITH: ARCHITECT, PAINTER, SCULPTOR," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 22). Tony Smith's works work, when they do, by causing you to look carefully, as Smith did, at the way geometric forms can be combined into abstract shapes that seem to shift as you move around them. Change, the idea that the same forms can keep mutating in provocative ways, is Smith's constant. A virtue of the Modern's intelligent, not too large retrospective is that it brings together the three aspects of his career -- architecture, painting and sculpture -- so that we can see, for example, how Smith's approach to form had as much to do with Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe as with Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still, and more to do with Newman and Still than with Donald Judd. When it's not good, Smith's work suggests a certain anonymous and chilly indifference because he brought an architect's mentality to everything; he planned what he often let others complete. At the same time, he spent a lifetime trying to endow geometry with feeling, to distill emotion from indifferent forms; and there was a sense of wonderment in the way he kept discovering new shapes in these forms. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).
 
 * "LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AT THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 31). This austere exhibition, drawn almost entirely from the Met's collection, outlines Tiffany's varied production in the exquisite detail for which he is justifiably known. The opulent sensuousness comes across in small doses, sometimes kitschy, sometimes innovative. Included are examples of furniture, jewelry, ceramics, enameled objects, paintings and design studies, stained-glass windows and lamps, and the Favrile glass vases that are his most lasting achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).
 
 * "THE UNICORN TAPESTRIES," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 6). The Unicorn Tapesteries are among the most famous works housed at the Cloisters, the Metropolitan's upper Manhattan branch devoted to medieval art. But this year they're spending the summer downtown at the museum's main headquarters on Fifth Avenue. Who commissioned them, where they were made and what their images are all about are still matters for speculation. But they've had a fascinating history -- including a stint protecting potatoes against frost after the French Revolution -- and they are absolutely exquisite. Dense with flowers, animals and courtly hunters, with the unicorn himself at the center, playing the part of a captivated lover or perhaps the suffering Christ, they have a tumultuous vivacity and suggest the flavor of a medieval world in which every detail of life was exactingly recorded and everything was more than it seemed. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).
 
 "UNKNOWN TERRAIN: THE LANDSCAPES OF ANDREW WYETH," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Aug. 30). The first exhibition to concentrate on the artist's landscapes and to show his watercolors in profusion makes the most convincing case for his strange talent. The obsessively textured tempera paintings are best, especially in the 1940's, when Mr. Wyeth portrayed nature as active and fecund and used abrupt shifts in scale to create dizzyingly Spiel bergian experiences of space. And the dry-brush watercolors, similar in fineness to the temperas, are often technically dazzling. But after the first two galleries, the exhibition offers a disturbing psychological portrait of an artist progressively shutting down, eliminating color, warmth and emotional complexity. A more conventional realism prevails, overly indebted to artists like Durer and Eakins, but hollow in its virtuosity and calculated in its portrayal of the world as a bleak, hard-bitten place, devoid of sun or joy. Hours: Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 P.M. Admission: $8; $7 for students and the elderly; free on Thursdays, 6 to 8 P.M. (Smith).
 
 * "MARY ANN WILLSON: ARTIST MAID," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 595-9533 (through Sept. 27). This small show by a little-known American folk artist who worked in upstate New York around 1800 to 1825 has its charms. Biblical sources, Pennsylvania German decorative art, popular prints and personal fantasies went into her creations, which are distinguished by bright colors, sometimes abstract patterning and a happy lightness of touch. "Three Angel Heads," a trio of seraphic women's faces topped by elaborate coiffures and sprouting wings is one of the best, a lovely apparition. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Free admission (Glueck).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
 JAMES LEE BYARS, Michael Werner, 21 East 67th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through Sept. 5). Four large black-and-white works on paper never before exhibited, by one of the more singular conceptualists of the last 25 years. Made around 1960 while Byars (1932-1997) was living in Japan, these black ink abstractions fill the page with large rounded shapes, creating compositions that suggest Ellsworth Kelly with an Eastern twist. There's also a prone ladderlike construction called "The Black Figure" that calls to mind Louise Bourgeois (Johnson).
 
 "A FLOWER IS TO THE SUMMER SWEET," Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810 (through Sept. 25). This lavish bouquet of a show includes the work of more than 40 painters who celebrated flowers, among them John James Audubon (1785-1851), Martin Johnson Heade (1819-1904), Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) and many less known. One standout is "Still Life of Flowers and Fruit," a fresh, fetching arrangment of morning glories, lilies, primula and iris done in the early 1870's by one of the greats of American flower painting, Severin Roesen (1816-1872). Another is "Victoria Regia, or the Great Water Lily of America," a stunning group of four-color lithographs done in 1854 by William Sharp that traces this regal flower from bud to blossom in brilliant botanical detail. All in all, a fine garden to browse in on a steamy day outside (Glueck).
 
 "PORTRAITS OBSCURED," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Sept. 12). This oppressively museumlike show presents one work each by seven famous male heavyweights, living and dead. The title is loosely relevant: there's a camouflaged self-portrait by Andy Warhol and a big collage of expressionistic ancestral portraits by Anselm Kiefer. A gloomy, gray, abstracted woman by Picasso could portray a lover. But works by Jean-Michel Basquiat (a nice one), David Smith, Willem de Kooning and Francesco Clemente don't look like portraits at all (Johnson).
 
 "SHIP/SHAPE," Keith de Lellis, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482 (through Aug. 29). The shapes of ships, from ocean liners to rowboats, from purely architectural studies to romantic visions, is the substance of this show. It includes some 70 prints by more than 30 photographers, from 1914 to the mid-60's. Celebrated talents like Edward Steichen, Weegee and Margaret Bourke-White share wall space with lesser-known photographers like the future Edward VIII when he was the Prince of Wales. Among the more striking images are Herbert Matter's 1938 close-up of a pair of worn, weathered sails in full rig, James Doolittle's 1930 study of a sturdy anchor chain dropped from the skyscraper prow of a huge ocean liner, and Gordon Coster's "Untitled (Sky)" (1929), a view of a big, cloudy sky with the cabin and masts of a ship just visible on the horizon line. The show is a beguiling way to spend an hour at sea (Glueck).
 
Galleries: 57th Street
 
 SHIRLEY GOLDFARB, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through Sept. 4). Ms. Goldfarb's paintings from the 1960's and 70's look good enough to make you wonder why you've never heard of her. She was born in Altoona, Pa., in 1925, and lived in Paris from 1954 until her death in 1980. During the 60's she began using a palette knife to create allover fields of little squares. Some are monochromatic, some multicolored; "Chartres" has the bejeweled luminosity of stained glass (Johnson).
 
 YASUHIKO TSUCHIDA, Yoshii Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 265-8876 (through Aug. 31). A dozen lovely cups by a young Japanese-born glassmaker who lives and works in Italy. Each handleless cup has a slightly wobbly, irregular form and appears to have been made by fusing separate facets, resulting in loose grid or checkerboard patterns. They're not great art, but the jewel-like colors and the humble, slightly comical forms are irresistible (Johnson).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
 "ANONYMOUS," the Work Space, 96 Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2790, (through Sept. 12). More photography about photography and truth. This show focuses on the human figure, which appears anonymous because, in most cases, it's so blurry. Tanya Marcuse's small, fragmentary shots of bridal lingerie and skin are sexy; Jon Naiman's large picture of a corpulent fellow with feet and head cut off by a paper floor and ceiling is funny. But too much of the show is caught up in uninteresting technical manipulations (Johnson).
 
 BRIAN CLARKE, "The Glass Wall (Dedicated to Linda McCartney)," Tony Shafrazi Gallery, 119 Wooster Street, (212) 274-9300 (through Sept. 12). Taking as his leitmotif the heraldic fleur-de-lis, the English artist Brian Clarke -- in recent years noted for large-scale stained-glass collaborations with architects all over the world -- has produced a mammoth eight-panel wall that curves across the space of the gallery. A tour de force of contemporary stained glass, its brilliantly nuanced colors range from nearly transparent white to rose and sparkling blue. Big fleurs-de-lis, sometimes easily readable in bold color, sometimes so pale you can barely tease them out from their shimmering grounds, dominate the panels, each gridded with 35 squares of leaded glass. Thanks to Mr. Clarke's extraordinary sense of color and architectural design, expressed in an entirely appropriate scale, "The Glass Wall" is a very impressive work (Glueck).
 
 KENNETH GOLDSMITH, Printed Matter, 77 Wooster Street, (212) 925-0325 (through Sept. 4). Mr. Goldsmith is an artist whose primary medium is language. Some of his avant-gardist prose on view in book form is amusing, some tedious. The main attraction is a set of 13 paper suits imprinted with a transcript of a performance called "Fidget," in which he verbalized every movement of his body during one 13-hour period last year; you don't have to read much to get the idea (Johnson).
 
 "HOLLYWOOD BACK LOTS AND CANTEENS," Georges Schreiber and Fred Shane, Susan Teller Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-7335 (through Aug. 27). Schreiber (1904-1977) and Shane (1906-1990) were both American Regionalists and skillful illustrators who, at different times, made watercolors and drawings based on visits to Hollywood. Shane's paintings of movie props or a whole simulated village in ruins have a brisk immediacy. Schreiber's vivid watercolor of lunching directors and stars steals the show: look for Carole Lombard, Humphrey Bogart and Hedda Hopper (Johnson).
 
 ANN LOVETT, Dorsky Gallery, 379 West Broadway, near Broome Street, (212) 966-6170 (through Aug. 28). In "Conundrum," a neatly composed installation combining photographs of antique medical books, pictures of her own naked body printed on loose, sheer fabric and a room-circulating line of text that reads, "Neglect me, absolve me, ignore me, want me, consume me" and so on, Ann Lovett evokes familiar connections between ideology and the body. The didactic tends to override the poetic (Johnson).
 
 "MAPS," Paul Kasmin Gallery, 74 Grand Street, (212) 219-3219 (through Aug. 28). Don't expect conventional cartography in this group of maps by six artists, each of whom has his own interpretation of the word. The broadest is James Turrell's grand-scale topographical drawing for his "Roden Crater" project, the reshaping of an extinct volcano rim north of Flagstaff, Ariz. The most "mappish" is Buckminster Fuller's "Dymaxion Air-Ocean World Map" of 1980, said to be the least distorted layout of the Earth's surface in cartographic history. Other views of the world, or particular pieces of it, are offered by Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Donald Baechler and the Italian team of Alighiero e Boetti, whose flat, colorfully embroidered rendition of the globe delineates each country in terms of its national flag. Move over, Rand McNally (Glueck).
 
 "NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH," Julie Saul Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 431-0747 (through Sept. 5). This well-chosen group show presents nine photographers who study suburbia from ironic or quietly surrealistic perspectives. Todd Hido's nocturnal pictures of ordinary houses taken from the street have a suspenseful, cinematic hyper-reality; Tracey Baran's large staged shot of a sunbathing girl nagged by her mother in the backyard of a seedy house is darkly comic, and Andrew Bordwin's soft-focus view of a house through blades of grass is dreamy (Johnson).
 
 "WHITE," Mitchell Algus, 25 Thompson Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1758 (through Aug. 21). Everything in this small, eccentric selection of works mostly from the 1960's and early 70's is white, creating a dialogue between the ethereal and the material. In a painting called "Winter's Silver," Carol Haerer evokes an opalescent, vaporous space; up close, the paint has a buttery sensuality. Walter Redinger suggests a play between purity and grossness in a molded fiberglass box that morphs into a giant tongue (Johnson).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
 RINALDO HOPF, "Golden Queers," Wessel & O'Connor, 242 West 26th Street, (212) 242-8811 (through Aug. 28). A celebratory installation of 69 Warhol-style portraits of famous gay (or supposedly gay) people by this German artist. Each photo-based canvas is silk-screened in black on white, and the figure's skin is gold-leafed. Subjects include Allen Ginsberg, Sophocles and Eugene Delacroix. The whole-wall grid has a nice decorative impact, but the pictures are too mechanical. Warhol himself would have done it with more stylish sensuality (Johnson).
 
 "SENSAROUND," Pamela Auchincloss, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 727-2845 (through Sept 19; by appointment in August). More conceptual than sensual, this six-person show presents variously clever and/or oblique approaches to the five doorways of perception. It includes Alyosha Blau and Thorsten Tenberken's potted plant equipped with a little speaker making jungle noises; a picture by Spencer Finch called "Mist," which consists of sheer white fabric on white stretchers, and Erik Hanson's abstract representations of perfume in clay, photography and needlepoint (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
 "NO BOUNDARIES," Trans Hudson Gallery, 416 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 242-3232 (through Aug. 23) A show of seven artists from Korea, the United States, Costa Rica and Brazil. The title alludes to the crossing of esthetic as well as geographical boundaries, as the artists mix traditional categories. The work ranges from the unstretched, Schnabel-like canvases of Theodore Cantrell to gridded variations on the square by Malvina Sammarone to Paula Stuttman's neat conceptualist kits for making American flags (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
 "AN EXPRESSIONIST IN PARIS: THE PAINTINGS OF CHAIM SOUTINE," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92d Street, (212) 423-3230 (through Sunday). This exhibition is an exciting gantlet, a bombardment of 56 canvases thick with extravagantly manipulated paint, resonant colors and an aura of intense emotional involvement, all painted by Soutine (1893-1943) from 1916 to 1920. It departs provocatively from the retrospective format, playing down Soutine's chronological development to illuminate the way different critics have defined his role, as savage outsider, as savior of traditional French painting and finally, in the United States, as the prophet of Abstract Expressionism. It proves that much more than just beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 A.M. to 5:45 P.M.; Tuesdays, until 8 P.M. Admission: $7, with $2 surcharge for Soutine; students and the elderly, $5; children under 12, free (Smith).
 
 ALEKSANDR RODCHENKO, Howard Schickler, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo (212) 431-6363 (through today). Fans for whom the big show at the Museum of Modern Art wasn't enough might want to check out this small exhibition focusing on the revolutionary designer's work for books, including endpapers bearing a pattern of military tank silhouettes, a couple of his surrealistic photomontages and a selection of original books. Also, there are some vivid portraits of the artist and his associates (Johnson).

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Images Shimmer Upon Screens, Installed in the Imagination

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
Installation pieces involving moving images, whether film or video, are prominent among art's current staples, and the number of women pursuing the medium is on the rise. So it barely bends the law of averages to find two such installations at the Whitney Museum of American Art: "Swoon" by Janine Antoni and "Blind Side" by Liisa Roberts. And it's not so surprising that they play off each other in revealing ways.
Ms. Antoni's work has been performance-oriented, usually hammering home points about "women's work" and various female compulsions, especially those to be clean, thin and well turned out. She also often puns on male-dominated art styles. In "Gnaw," she lampooned Minimalist perfection and dramatized various cravings with a man-size cube of chocolate, a substance thought to be a female aphrodisiac, that was noticeably chewed around the edges. 
 She has made drawings by fluttering her mascara-laden lashes across sheets of paper. And in an especially well-known performance piece, she scrubbed the floor with her own hair dipped in black dye, creating a kind of cleaning-day Pollock.
But as with nearly every performance artist before her, Ms. Antoni may have grown weary of putting her body on the line and realized that she had to move on. "Swoon" is her first large work in which the viewer does not see or sense the artist's physical involvement, and it represents a big, largely successful step.
Originally seen last summer at the Capp Street Project in San Francisco, "Swoon" pursues the familiar theme of beauty and its cost, but it abandons the domestic realm to concentrate on art, specifically ballet. The viewer enters the piece through a darkened rawly finished corridor accompanied by strange, slightly disturbing sounds: heavy breathing, straining grunts and light thuds that can make one think of sex or sports.
Inside, in a darkened gallery, the source of these sounds is revealed. Beneath a beautiful red velvet curtain that is lowered almost to the ground, the bottom of a glowing screen is visible, and on it are the dancing feet of a ballerina and her partner. As they proceed through their steps, turns and lifts unaccompanied by music, her toe shoes make sharp little thuds, the stays of her costume creak, and the dancers' breath becomes increasingly labored.
In all, it's an audible account of the work, discipline and suffering behind ballet's breathtaking illusion. The image is doubled by a wall-size mirror opposite the screen, so that the viewer's shadowy reflection becomes part of the image, adding another layer of reality.
One can walk around the screen to view its "backstage" side, where the dancers are fully visible, along with the installation's inner workings: the projection booth and video tracking numbers on the screen. Yet more in the way of beauty, narrative and emotion is also conveyed: the ballerina's white feathered costume suggests "Swan Lake"; the dancers are performing the ballet's famously sad, seductive final pas de deux, in which the lovers repeatedly seem overwhelmed by feeling.
Suddenly, Tchaikovsky's music for the ballet fills the gallery, masking the sounds of effort, lifting dancer and viewer alike, making one feel slightly swoonish. But the music lasts only a few exhilarating moments before the sounds of reality take over again.
Nothing quite so dramatic happens in Ms. Roberts's "Blind Side," a Structuralist effort that also uses a two-sided screen and a mirror. In this case, a film of a well-appointed salon -- complete with formal antique furniture and oriental rugs and punctuated by three big French windows -- is projected through a translucent glass screen and reflected on a wall-size mirror on the opposite end of the gallery. Entering this gallery, viewers are thus sandwiched between mirroring life-size images, one that reflects them, one that doesn't.
The camera never moves, but the scene changes; the light outside moves from day to night and back again, in a 24-hour exposure accelerated to less than 6 minutes. As the sky darkens, the room disappears and only the windows remain, luminous rectangles through which a busy city comes into sharper focus: the lights of buildings, streets and cars speeding across an elevated highway emphasize a fast, gritty urban world far removed from the quiet unchanging formality of the room itself.
This piece is a considerable improvement over Ms. Roberts's debut last year at the Lehman Maupin Gallery in SoHo, a pointlessly busy installation involving images of statues. "Blind Side" has economy and understatement in its favor, although it may be almost too stripped down.
It seems to make deliberate reference to one of the landmarks of Structuralist film, Michael Snow's "Wavelength" of 1967. In this movie, the scene is a TriBeCa loft; the action consists of the camera's executing a 45-minute zoom slowly and inexorably toward the center point of a three-windowed wall. The light changes into a series of lurid Warholian colors (achieved with filters); the sounds of unseen street traffic intrude. Just as the camera seems about to hit the wall, the zoom shot comes to an end, centimeters from a postcard-size image of the ocean.
It is almost as if Ms. Roberts set out to rearrange the components of Mr. Snow's film: in her work the light, and its changes, are natural; the traffic is visible, the grungy loft, an industrial space redolent of old-style manufacturing, has been traded for a more genteel but equally old-fashioned setting, one whose stillness contrasts with the industrious scene outside. As day turns to night and the room fades into total darkness (like a theater), the three windows come to resemble narrow movie screens and the racing traffic the movement of film through the projector.
"Blind Side" might almost be said to out-structure the structuralism of "Wavelength." Ms. Roberts touches on the basics of film -- time, light and movement -- using reality in a more straighforward manner, and she tolerates even less narrative than Mr. Snow, who teasingly created a fragment of traditional suspense by having a couple walk past the camera talking about finding a corpse in the loft. The only figures in "Blind Side" are the shadows and reflections of the viewers (an effect, however, that evokes the work of one of Mr. Snow's contemporaries, Paul Sharits.) A problem is that too much of the work's interest lies in its dialogue with its precedent, which limits its power for viewers not familiar with Mr. Snow's film.
 Janine Antoni's "Swoon" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Nov. 15 and Liisa Roberts's "Blind Side" through Oct. 4.

HEADLINE: Earnings at Kmart and Gap Are Better ThanExpected

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Kmart Corporation and Gap Inc., two big retailers, reported quarterly earnings yesterday that were better than expected, aided by the strong economy and a return to the basic fashions favored by their mainstay customers.
Profit before a charge tripled at Kmart, the nation's second-biggest discount retailer. Net income almost doubled at Gap, the third-biggest clothing chain. 
 At a third retailer, Saks Holdings Inc., the quarterly loss narrowed as shoppers splurged on designer clothes and accessories at the Saks Fifth Avenue luxury department stores.
The economy is helping retailers of all stripes turn in surprisingly strong results for the latest quarter. "It's a good retail environment right now," said John Cabell, a portfolio manager who follows retailers at USAA Investment Management. "If you've got the merchandise, the consumer will come."
Of the 80 retailers that have reported for the quarter so far, 89 percent beat or met analysts' earnings expectations, led by the nation's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; the Abercrombie & Fitch Company, and Federated Department Stores Inc., according to the First Call Corporation. That has given retail stocks a boost.
With unemployment near a 30-year low and consumer confidence high, shoppers continue to spend money. Still, some retailers are struggling. The catalogue retailer Lands' End Inc. said yesterday that slow sales resulted in an unexpected loss for the second quarter.
In its earnings report yesterday, Kmart said profit before a charge rose to $93 million, or 19 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 29, its fiscal second quarter. That was up from net income of $31 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier and exceeded analysts' expectations by 2 cents a share. But Kmart's stock fell 87.5 cents, to $17.8125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The discounter brought back elastic-waisted pants and added more larger-sized clothes to replace the hot pants and tight, cropped shirts that had been shunned by middle-aged mothers, its primary shoppers. Strong demand for the new fashions helped the retailer avoid the steep markdowns that ate into profits last year.
Revenue for Kmart, which is based in Troy, Mich., rose 3.4 percent, to $8.12 billion from $7.85 billion.
In the latest quarter, a charge of $13 million, or 3 cents a share, for costs of an early-retirement program resulted in net income of $80 million, or 16 cents a share. There were no special items in the quarter a year ago.
At Gap, net income in the second quarter ended Aug. 1 rose to $136.9 million, or 34 cents a share, from $69.5 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat forecasts by 3 cents a share.
Gap fell $3.625, or 5.8 percent, to $63.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares, which are up about 54 percent over the last six months, gained 6.5 percent on Wednesday in anticipation of better-than-expected earnings.
The company, whose chains include Old Navy, Gap Kids and Banana Republic, has been adding more inventory and widening its selection of basic styles like T-shirts. Its ads for jeans and khaki pants featuring celebrities and young people dancing have helped make it the place to shop for those items, analysts said.
The San Francisco-based retailer's revenue rose 42 percent, to $1.91 billion from $1.35 billion.
The return to basic fashions is helping Gap sell more items at full price.
At Saks, the loss before a charge narrowed in the quarter ended Aug. 1 to $7.29 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, from $8.6 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. The results matched estimates, and the shares closed unchanged, at $26.75, on the New York exchange.
The New York-based retailer's revenue rose 12 percent, to $509.6 million from $454.7 million.
Strong demand for name-brand clothes, jewelry and cosmetics bodes well for Proffitt's Inc., which last month agreed to buy Saks.
In the most recent quarter, the net loss was $11.1 million, or 17 cents a share. A year earlier, it was $14.2 million, or 22 cents a share.

Japan's Trade Surplus Falls; Asian Slump Slows Exports

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus fell in June from May, the ninth decline in the last 13 months, as exports to other Asian nations slowed and imports rebounded from a two-and-a-half-year low.
The surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of goods and services flowing in and out of a country, fell by a seasonally adjusted 2.4 percent, to 1.465 trillion yen, or about $10 billion, the Finance Ministry said. That was more than the 1.2495 trillion yen forecast by economists, and came as exports rose 1.7 percent and imports expanded 11.4 percent. 
 The surplus fell in part because soccer fans traveled to France to see Japan's national team play in the World Cup. "Lots of people left Japan with lots of money to spend overseas," said Yasukazu Shimizu, an economist at Nippon Credit Bank Research Institute.
Japanese companies shipped fewer goods to Asian customers in June. Merchandise trade makes up three-quarters of the overall current account, and recessions in Asia, where Japan ships 35 percent of its exports, contributed to the decrease.
Companies and governments throughout the region are ordering fewer Japanese trucks, tractors and television sets as they try to reverse shortages of foreign-currency reserves used to pay for imports. That has hurt companies like Hitachi, Fujitsu and NEC.
While imports rose in June, the Finance Ministry said that might not continue because of Japan's stagnant economy. "It's too early to say whether imports will keep rising," said Masaki Omura of the ministry's international finance division.
For the first six months of the year, the Japanese current account surplus rose 52.9 percent from the corresponding period in 1997, to 7.573 trillion yen, or $51.7 billion. That was the third straight half-year rise and the biggest surplus in five years for a first half. Overall exports rose 1.5 percent, and imports dropped 10.9 percent in the half.
The semiannual figures do not include a breakdown of trade and services by country. Trade figures released separately last month showed that Japan's merchandise surplus -- not including services and income -- with the United States, its largest trading partner, rose 37.7 percent from the first half of 1997. That has increased tension with Washington, which has accused the Japanese of relying on exports for growth and not doing enough to increase consumer spending at home.
Japanese exporters have increased sales to the United States and Europe to offset the tumbling Asian sales. Japan's surplus with other Asian nations, not including services and income, fell 26.8 percent in the first half, according to figures released last month.

I.M.F.'s Japan Report Warns of Lower Yen

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund warned today of an even weaker yen unless Japan took bolder steps to revive its moribund economy and repair its troubled banking system.
The I.M.F.'s report, issued two weeks after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office, said intervention by the United States and Japan to support the yen in June had helped stabilize the currency "for the time being." But it added, "Failure to follow through with supporting policy actions could trigger further downward pressures on the yen." 
 In the report, completed on Aug. 5, the I.M.F. complained that Tokyo had so far not done enough to restore its economy, the world's second largest, saying Japanese economic health was critical to all of Asia.
"While the Government has taken a number of welcome initiatives," the fund said in its annual review of Japan's economy, "the overall response thus far has fallen short of the timely, comprehensive and forceful program that is required, given the seriousness of the present situation."
It added that Japanese short-term interest rates were at appropriate levels for now, but a few directors said a rate cut might be needed later in the year if Mr. Obuchi's planned tax cuts and other measures failed to stem economic decline.
The I.M.F. said it expected the Japanese economy to shrink 1.7 percent in 1998, a change from the fund's April forecast of zero growth this year. But it also said the economy could start to recover late in the year, bolstered by tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Boeing in Deal With Union On the 737

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company and its biggest union announced an agreement yesterday that paves the way for Boeing to produce the 737 commercial jet at the former McDonnell Douglas complex in Long Beach, Calif.
But while the deal was designed to allay union fears of job losses, Boeing also said yesterday that it planned to cut even more employees than it had indicated last month. 
 As part of the deal, Boeing agreed that assembly of most of the single-aisle jets would remain outside Seattle and that the major parts, such as the fuselage and wings, would continue to be produced at their current locations. The company also pledged that it would not lay off any union workers as a result of the move.
It is the first time the International Association of Machinists, which represents 39,000 Boeing workers, and the company have a deal apart from the union's regular four-year contract.
"This is a step into the future," said Bill Johnson, president of the machinists' local for Boeing. "There are a lot of issues that when we sit down and work together everybody can win."
But the deal does not prevent Boeing from following through on its goal of eliminating between 18,000 and 28,000 of the company's 238,000 jobs by the end of 1999. Indeed, the company said yesterday that even more cuts will come after 2000.
Boeing has provided few details about where the initial job reductions will be made. A Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the additional cuts, saying that details would not be disclosed until next year.
The new production line will require between 600 and 1,000 workers, saving only a fraction of the 6,200 Long Beach jobs set to be lost when production of three McDonnell Douglas models is scheduled to stop in 2000. Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas last year.
The company also said yesterday that it would further consolidate the operations of its fighter, satellite, space transportation, information and communications and military transport businesses. By the end of the decade, the moves will reduce the company's overall office, warehouse and manufacturing space by 21 million square feet -- three million square feet more than Boeing first announced in March.
Boeing will begin assembling a few 737's in Long Beach later this year, bringing the rate up to three a month by the second quarter of 1999. The agreement with the machinists caps production at the plant at five planes a month.
And in a move that is rich with symbolism for the former McDonnell Douglas employees, Boeing said that it would drop the remnant of the acquired company's name and call the complex the Long Beach division. It is now called the Douglas products division.
Moving production to California will help relieve the strain at Boeing, which has been struggling to fill hundreds of orders for the best-selling 737. The company will use Long Beach to make the most varied versions of the 737 -- a business version of the jet and a combination passenger and cargo version commissioned by the Pentagon -- so that its main assembly lines outside Seattle can focus on stamping out similar types for the world's airlines.
Shares of Boeing closed down $1.6875, at $37.1875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell in July, U.S. Reports

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in July, reflecting the General Motors strikes, the Commerce Department said today. Excluding automobiles, sales rose for the sixth time in seven months.
Although July's decline was the first in nine months, it was smaller than the eight-tenths of 1 percent that analysts had expected. Sales increased one-tenth of 1 percent in June. 
 Excluding automobiles, retail sales rose half a percent in July after having fallen one-tenth of 1 percent in June. Previously, June's sales outside the automobile industry had been reported as increasing one-tenth of 1 percent.
"In general, what you have is a situation where consumers have the money to spend and are more than glad to spend it," said Joel Naroff, chief bank economist at the First Union Corporation in Philadelphia. "Given that prices are rising so slowly, these are really, really strong consumption numbers."
Also today, the Labor Department reported an unexpected decrease of 7,000, to a seasonally adjusted 301,000, in the number of first-time jobless claims that were filed last week. The data suggested that the cooling economy was not slowing the robust labor market.
The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which is less volatile than the weekly report, fell to a seasonally adjusted 306,500 last week from 315,500 the previous week. That was the lowest since the week ended April 11, when the average stood at 306,000.
Last week's decline showed "the labor market has a lot of vitality," said Cary Leahey, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, N.Y.
The July retail sales report showed that sales of big-ticket goods, including automobiles, appliances and furniture, fell 1.4 percent. Orders for nondurable goods, ranging from groceries to clothing, rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
Sales at automotive dealers slumped 3 percent in July, the largest decrease since a 3.3 percent decline in April 1997. In addition to the impact on sales of the strike -- General Motors sales fell 38 percent during July, the company's worst performance in nearly three decades -- sales of cars and light trucks were hurt because auto makers ended incentive and discount programs.
Outside of automobiles, though, retail sales gains were broad based. Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores increased 1.2 percent, and sales of building materials and hardware rose 1.1 percent.
Sales by apparel and accessories stores rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in July, in contrast to June's decline of 1.1 percent.
Low interest rates, the thriving job market, steady incomes and high consumer confidence have proved a fruitful combination for retailers even as weak results from Asian operations pour in. Still, if the stock market begins an extended decline, consumer spending could suffer.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Falls 93.46as Threat of Russian Crisis Hurts Shares

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
A growing sense of crisis in the Russian economy helped push United States markets lower yesterday.
Russia's stock market fell 6.5 percent. At one point, trading was stopped for 35 minutes when losses exceeded 10 percent. The central bank stepped in to protect the ruble and the banking system, but Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's foreign debt, which already had been ranked as "junk." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,459.50, near its low of the day, down 93.46 points, or 1.1 percent. The blue-chip index, which was up as much as 18 percent for the year at its peak in July, is now up just 6.98 percent this year.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.31 points, to 1,074.91, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 22.99 points, closing at 1,802.54, a 1.3 percent decline. The S.& P. and the Nasdaq are up 10.77 percent and 14.70 percent, respectively, for the year.
Concerns about the situation in Russia, combined with continuing problems in Asian economies and expectations of slower earnings growth among United States companies, have contributed to the growing cautiousness among investors in recent weeks.
 "Asia's clearly at the top of the list," Robert W. Bissell, president and chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management, said. "Russia's in the middle."
He said institutional investors were concerned that Russia might devalue its currency. A devaluation could affect banks and financial institutions worldwide with exposure to the country, he said.
Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said: "Earlier this year people shrugged this stuff off. Now portfolio managers are paying more heed."
As a sign of investors' waning belief in the resiliency of the market, comments by the Goldman, Sachs market guru, Abby Joseph Cohen, did little to stem yesterday's slide in stocks. Last October the bullish stance of Ms. Cohen, co-chairwoman of Goldman's investment policy committee, calmed investors and helped the Dow Jones industrial average recover from a decline of more than 500 points.
In a note to clients yesterday, Ms. Cohen said stocks were now undervalued and she does not expect a recession or an uptick in inflation soon. In addition, the direct impact of events in Asia and Russia on the United States is likely to remain moderate, she said.
But that did not seem to buoy the market.
Yesterday, DuPont, which led both the Dow and the S.& P. lower, warned that third-quarter profits would be at the lower end of forecasts and below levels from the comparable period last year. The company pointed to a number of causes for the shortfall, including declining oil prices, Asia's impact on its polyester business and declining agriculture business revenues.
Last month, when DuPont reported second-quarter earnings, it also warned that third-quarter results could falter.
DuPont closed at 55, down 5 1/2 points.
Expectations that earnings will continue to weaken are keeping some investors on the sidelines, Mr. Acuff said, as portfolio managers hesitate to buy the shares of companies that may soon warn of problems.
And once again, small-company stocks faltered. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 4.72 points, or 1.2 percent, to 403.83.
As bearish sentiment becomes increasingly pervasive, analysts note that portfolio managers are becoming less aggressive about putting cash to work than they were in previous months. Aggressive buying on downturns, for fear of missing out on subsequent gains in the market, were a key factor in propelling stocks to record highs earlier this year.
This change in sentiment comes as cash flows into equity mutual funds are slowing to their lowest levels this year. In the week ended Aug. 5, $468 million flowed into United States equity mutual funds, down from $648 million in the previous week, according to AMG Data Services, a California research firm. And in the week ended July 22, investors moved $1.5 billion out of mutual funds, AMG said.
The exodus, along with the general decline in the market, has trimmed the aggregate market value of mutual funds by $200 billion to $225 billion in the last three weeks, Robert Adler, AMG's president, said.
The trend, if it continues, could also herald a sea change in investors' outlook toward stocks, he said, adding that cash flows into bond funds have been increasing recently.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies in U.S. Surge 5.5% to Record

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va., Aug. 13

 BODY:
Bankruptcies in the United States surged 5.5 percent in the April-June quarter to a quarterly record 373,460, with personal bankruptcies accounting for 97 percent of the total, according to a study released here this week.
The American Bankruptcy Institute said that although personal filings in bankruptcy court rose 5.9 percent in the second quarter to 361,908, those for businesses fell 6.9 percent from the first quarter to 11,552. To date this year, according to the institute's latest report, there have been 727,578 bankruptcy filings, outpacing 1977's record. 
 Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the institute, said the latest surge could reflect recommendations by lawyers that clients in financial trouble file for bankruptcy now before a change in law takes effect.
Legislation approved by the House of Representatives and awaiting action in the Senate would shift some debtors from Chapter 7 bankruptcy to Chapter 13, requiring them to repay some of their debts from future income. Mr. Gerdano said the increase also resulted from an abundance of credit and a decrease in the stigma attached to bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Japan's Corruption Fighter Is Shunted Aside

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Earlier this year, it seemed that a sweeping corruption investigation might send a good number of Japan's mighty philosopher-kings, the bureaucrats who largely run the country, to prison.
But these days, despite a Cabinet change, nearly the only Government employee who has gone anywhere is Katsuhiko Kumazaki, the prosecutor who led a much-heralded investigation into scandals involving expensive free entertainment paid for by businessmen who wanted the bureaucrats' favor. 
 Mr. Kumazaki, 56, was transferred in June to a relatively remote coastal city, and the investigation seems to have fizzled out.
The apparent collapse of last winter's investigation, without snaring many high-level officials, underscores the resiliency of Japan's traditional way of governing.
There has been extensive criticism in the last few years of the Japanese bureaucracy, which makes and carries out policy with far less interference from elected officials than bureaucrats or civil servants in the United States, and there had been an expectation of far-reaching change.
Mr. Kumazaki's investigation did bring about the arrests of more than 30 executives of financial institutions. Four officials of the Finance Ministry and one from the Bank of Japan, the central bank, were also taken into custody on charges of having accepted bribes in the form of entertainment.
More broadly, the investigation seemed to readjust the pecking order in Japan. Traditionally, the most respected elite in the country was the corps of career bureaucrats in the Finance Ministry. But their glory seemed to fade a bit when Japanese turned on their television sets in the spring and saw images of armies of prosecutors marching into the Finance Ministry, the central bank and the nation's top commercial banks to confiscate boxes of documents.
Now, though, surprisingly little is different. And Kasumigaseki, the district near the imperial palace where the Government ministries are situated, has emerged only partly chastened.
"The investigation destroyed the common wisdom in Kasumigaseki that being entertained was not a problem, but it ended halfway, and I regret that," said Michio Sato, a member of the lower house of Parliament who is a former prosecutor.
Mr. Kumazaki, who is not giving interviews, was not the only man behind the investigation. But as the head of the Tokyo prosecutor's office, he essentially directed it. His transfer brings the inquiry substantially to a close.
These days, he works in a city that is bypassed by the bullet train, where only six flights a day land at the airport. Back in Tokyo, the lights in the special prosecutors' offices go out early. There has not been a prominent arrest in months, and the legal crew of dozens of people poring over boxes of confiscated documents has dwindled to less than half.
Although Mr. Kumazaki's investigation has apparently fizzled, there is some possibility that there will be other efforts to crack down on bankers and bureaucrats. Some experts say arrests of bankers and officials may result from the Government's new plans to clean up the banking system.
Those plans, which could be carried out in the fall if approved by Parliament, may lead to disclosures of unsound or dishonest banking practices and bureaucratic complicity in those practices.
"If they embezzle, cheat or that kind of thing -- criminal conduct -- I think they will be sent out," said Kiichi Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister who is now Finance Minister. But he added a cautionary note: "It really takes time. Nothing happens all at once.
In any case, Mr. Kumazaki's investigation did have one long-term consequence. It made bureaucrats far more careful about accepting meals or entertainment from business executives. These days, Finance Ministry officials say they eat lunch in the ministry's cafeteria and have their evenings and weekends free.
Their hesitance about accepting dinners arises in part because prosecutors like Mr. Kumazaki pounced on bureaucrats on suspicion they had accepted bribes that were not in cash but in the form of regular dinner invitations, lunches and golf outings.
No cash ever changed hands, and the dinners in some cases amounted to several hundred dollars -- which is not an outlandish figure in Tokyo's high-priced restaurants.
For the Finance Ministry mandarins, though, probably the worst part of the punishment was that their names were published in the newspapers, along with the punishments received.
"Even if they don't indict a single person, the question is whether these people have been punished socially," said Jiro Nomura, who teaches law at the Chiba Institute of Technology. "For those who quit the Finance Ministry or received other punishments announced by the Finance Ministry, that is considered to have been punishment enough."
Ministry officials say that morale is low, and that attitudes are indeed changing. The Finance Ministry and the central bank are not attracting the elite graduates the way they used to. The best students are taking jobs elsewhere.
"This is a kind of cultural revolution in Japan," said a senior Finance Ministry official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The investigation "destroyed the old establishment."
He compared the scandal to a wager gone awry.
"When someone is playing golf, they often bet small money or some chocolates," he explained. "And then suddenly the police arrest him for gambling. This is the kind of feeling we have here."
But critics say such sentiments will be short-lived, mainly because business entertainment has been part of the Japanese culture for a long time.
"I think things will go back to the old-fashioned way," said a Japanese journalist who covers the courts and the prosecutors for a major daily newspaper. "Entertaining has been a part of the Japanese custom for several centuries. I don't think it will go away just because of the current investigation."
Some legal experts say there was a good deal of political pressure on Justice Ministry officials and the prosecutors to wind up the investigation. With the economy slipping into recession and the banks swimming in several hundred billion dollars in bad debt, these experts say, the Government needs its mandarins to steer the country back on track.
And a rash of suicides by people under investigation or involved in the inquiry alarmed the nation and dampened public enthusiasm for the investigation.
"I think the top-ranked Justice officials looked around at the sentiment in society," said the Japanese journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Criticism was mounting in the political and business world. People were using the term 'prosecutors' recession.' So high-ranked Justice Ministry officials made this decision to stop."
Others say that the challenge of taking on the Finance Ministry was just too great and that Mr. Kumazaki and his team hardly got past the door of the ministry before they were overwhelmed.
"The investigation was epoch-making, but Kumazaki was pushed back at the entrance," said Nobuto Hosaka, a member of Parliament. "That is the reality."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Championing Liberalism Under New Name

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
WHEN Martin S. Begun, for years one of New York's most prominent Jewish leaders, told his friends recently that he had decided to convert, some feared he had lost his mind.
There were those who were angry, convinced he was betraying his heritage. One friend accused him of outright treason. Others, once they put their jaws back into place, smiled one of those "that's Marty" smiles and told him to go for it. Even his wife, the prominent real estate executive Louise Sunshine, was surprised at his choice. 
 But Mr. Begun is a thoughtful, deliberative man and did not arrive at apostasy easily. After realizing over several months that he felt disconnected from his roots, he went all the way: the lifelong Democrat switched his registration to the tiny Liberal Party, an artifact of the anti-Communist era that has occasionally been influential in city politics. And as if that were not enough, he will also become a close adviser to the Liberal Party's famously canny leader, Raymond B. Harding, writing a platform of ideas for a party that has long had little use for ideology.
Mr. Begun, never a casual Democrat, is used to the astonishment by now. He was, after all, a Democratic district leader from the East Side for 14 years in the 1960's and 70's, a Democratic candidate for Congress and a close friend and adviser to Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. He is now a Democratic appointee to the city's Campaign Finance Board, named by City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whose rival for the Democratic nomination for governor is the Liberal Party's candidate, Betsy McCaughey Ross.
But he says he has drifted from his party, at least at the state level. To his mind, New York politics has become a pastime of personality, not an arena of ideas, and the Democrats have done little to expand political thought to fit the next century.
"I want to help create a liberalism without illusions," he said, "the kind of thing that Tony Blair has done for the Labor Party in Great Britain. It should move away from its left-of-center orientation, and come up with common-sense recommendations that are pro-business, pro-economic development, pro-labor. It would redefine a constructive liberalism for a new era."
That he should want to create an intellectual base for the modern-day Liberal Party, however, is a confounding notion for those who have watched the party become a doctrine-free vehicle for the advancement of a small group of people at its core. The party almost never runs its own candidates for elective office; instead, it simply cross-endorses candidates of widely varying political thought from the two major parties, like Ms. McCaughey Ross and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and counts on patronage jobs if those candidates win. Two of Mr. Harding's sons have high-ranking positions in the Giuliani administration.
"The Liberal Party is for sale," Mr. Koch said. "Maybe Ray Harding realizes that a person of conscience, like Marty Begun, will help bring it some integrity."
Mr. Harding rejected the notion that he is importing respectability from another party. Rather, he said, Mr. Begun's decision was a coup for his party, a recognition that the Liberals are a pragmatic alternative for those who believe that the Democrats have moved so far to the left that they have lost their way.
"There's a new century, a new millennium, and we are coming to the inexorable end of the Giuliani epoch," he said. "So I thought it would be worthwhile, to make sure the party continues to be relevant, to do some think-tanking and examine the position of the Liberal Party."
He first broached the idea with Mr. Begun a few months ago, at a party at Gracie Mansion. Mr. Begun had left his position as associate dean of the New York University School of Medicine last September, giving up a job he had held for 35 years after opposing the proposed merger with Mount Sinai Medical Center. (He has since been running a small consulting group, MSB Strategies, with several health-related clients.) His three-year tenure as president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York was also about to expire, and friends said he was itching to remain a player on the political scene.
One disappointed longtime friend, Mr. Dinkins, an archenemy of the Liberals, said he wished that Mr. Begun would instead expend his energy on improving the Democratic Party. But at age 66, Mr. Begun has decided that he can exercise much more influence in a smaller pond, even if he won't necessarily support each candidate endorsed by his new party.
"Third parties in America have an important function in nudging the major parties to take stands on important issues," he said. "There's more to a political party than running a candidate in your own name."
And it may give him a chance to have some fun tweaking his more orthodox friends. Since marrying for the first time last year and leaving his job, friends say, he has become even more playful than usual, more open to change. He is also enjoying some of the perquisites of a prominent marriage, including an apartment at 71st Street and Park Avenue, a long way from his birthplace in Washington Heights. As he well knows, he may need a sense of humor in the coming months.
"I know some people will give me gift certificates to a psychiatrist," he said. "But maybe some people will give me some credit."

Weaker Dollar and Debt Sale Help Keep Securities Depressed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A weaker dollar and the third part of the Treasury's quarterly debt auctions kept prices of Government securities depressed yesterday for the second consecutive day. Also weighing on prices is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee meeting next week. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond dropped nearly a half-point, to 107, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.63 percent, from 5.60 percent on Wednesday.
Yesterday's $10 billion auction of 30-year bonds was the final and most difficult part of the quarterly debt sales. With yields already near record lows and investors holding higher-yielding long-term issues, traders think market participants may be a little reluctant to buy more. The new 30-year issue was bought at an average price to yield 5.590 percent, mostly in line with expectations. Bonds began the session down when the dollar dropped against the Japanese yen because investors feared the Japanese central bank would sell dollars to support the yen. A strong dollar makes Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, not only because of the high return but also because of the potential gains in currency translation. Still, Treasuries did receive a small boost from foreign investors seeking shelter from turmoil in Russian and Asian markets. 
 Investors keep watching for signs that Asia's slowdown is weighing on economic growth in the United States. The Government said yesterday that retail sales fell four-tenths of a percent last month after rising one-tenth of a percent in June.
"Consumer spending is the mainstay of the economy and the key to the economic outlook," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, "and the Federal Reserve is highly unlikely to ease monetary policy until consumption slows significantly and sustainably from its ebullient pace over the past year.
"But while a more accommodative monetary policy does not appear to be on the horizon, "neither does a tightening." He said the pace of economic growth appeared to be slowing, in large part because of the financial crisis in Asia, which would be exacerbated by a rate rise in the United States. "With the Fed on hold, it has hardly been a surprise that the bond market has been locked in a narrow range of between 5.60 percent to 5.80 percent," he said, adding, "In the anticipated absence of an inflationary outbreak on the one hand and signs of recession on the other, bond yields are likely to remain in this range for quite some time."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a new 30-year bond:

HEADLINE: U.S. to Change Strategy in Narcotics Fight in Colombia

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 12

 BODY:
After steadfastly refusing to pay for programs to help Colombia's coca growers switch to legal crops, the American Government is shifting course and is now agreeing to finance alternative development under this country's new administration.
While the precise amounts and mechanisms of the help have not been determined, American officials say that development aid will be part of the United States anti-drug strategy in Colombia. 
 As the head of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, Thomas A. Constantine, arrived here to lay wreaths honoring the 143 soldiers and police officers slain in a preinaugural rampage by rebel forces last week, American officials denied that any Americans were among those killed or taken hostage.
A rebel commander, Jorge Briceno of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had been quoted in the daily El Espectador as saying that Americans were among those abducted by the group.
"No American citizen was captured or killed during the recent guerrilla attacks in Colombia," an American Embassy statement said. The attacks covered half the countryside and leveled the counter-narcotics base at Miraflores. About 300 Colombians were killed, and 124 police officers and soldiers were abducted.
In a letter of condolence to President Andres Pastrana, sent hours before his inauguration last Friday and made public here, President Clinton pledged $2 million to help internal refugees, and promised to seek Congressional approval for stepping up aid to the military and police. "We also propose to increase our other assistance to Colombia to include support for a multi-year alternative development program and for justice sector reforms and human rights," President Clinton wrote.
Mr. Pastrana has insisted that aerial fumigation of drug crops, the cornerstone of United States counter-narcotics efforts here, is useless without providing coca growers with a legal alternative. He has announced his intention to create what he calls a Marshall Plan for Government investment in coca-growing regions, similar to the American-financed reconstruction of Western Europe after World War II.
In the past, American officials have given minimal aid -- less than $1 million a year -- to finance consultants to study alternative development in Colombia, but no direct assistance for crop substitution work.
In Peru and Bolivia, rural development, in conjunction with eradication or other law enforcement efforts, has paid off. In Peru, coca production dropped 40 percent in the last two years; in Bolivia, coca growing declined 7 percent last year.
But United States officials have ruled out such aid for Colombia in the past, citing distrust of the previous administration of President Ernesto Samper and rebel dominance of coca-growing regions.
Mr. Pastrana has made peace negotiations with Colombia's 20,000 armed rebels a priority of his administration. The rebels have indicated they would curtail the drug trade among peasants in zones they control as part of a peace accord. But some see the offer as a gambit to gain autonomy over parts of eastern Colombia, from which the rebels could launch further attacks after signing an accord.
American officials are skeptical that the rebels, who are estimated to earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year for protecting coca crops and laboratories, would seriously curtail trafficking. "That would be like killing the goose that lays the golden egg," one said. Last week's attack on Miraflores has only heightened their doubts.
American officials are saying that aid for alternative development would flow only to areas where the Government has established control. The aid could be a way to strengthen the state presence, whose absence peasants in remote regions cite as one reason for guerrilla control.
Sergio Uribe, a consultant to the National Drugs Council who advised Mr. Pastrana on drug control strategy during his campaign, called Washington's move to support alternative development "the first admission that American eradication policy is not working."
"It's what we've always told them, that eradication for eradication's sake doesn't work," Mr. Uribe said.
American officials, who insisted on anonymity, said that aid might not take the form of crop substitution, but could involve finding other ways for reformed coca growers to make a living, like development of local industry. Most Colombians live in rural areas, but their country's economic opening in the early 1990's destroyed the market for traditional domestic crops.
Barry R. McCaffrey, the retired general who is the White House's anti-drug chief, told reporters last week that eradication would remain "the central aspect of U.S. counternarcotics thinking."
"That can't be taken off the table," he said.
Today, as a new military high command took over, Miraflores remained in a state of "red alert," beyond Government control, a police spokesman here said.
President Pastrana replaced Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, Chief of the Combined Armed Forces, and other senior commanders with officers who have openly supported a peace agreement with the rebels.
The military is particularly discredited now. Investigations have shown Government soldiers were beaten after commanders failed to back up units under rebel attack. The military's budget largely benefits senior officers, while foot soldiers often go hungry, military experts here say.
Two senior officers are under investigation for ties to right-wing death squads, which traffic in drugs. A third, Gen. Ivan Ramirez, lost his American visa because of his alleged ties to the death squads.
A Washington Post report that General Ramirez was also a paid informant for the Central Intelligence Agency has caused a stir here.

HEADLINE: Report Says City Economy Is Too Tied to Wall St.

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13

 BODY:
New York City's economy is now more heavily dependent on Wall Street's fortunes than it was before the stock market crash in 1987, according to a report released today by the office of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
The report shows, among other things, that 56 percent of the real earnings growth between 1992 and 1997 was generated by the boom on Wall Street, although it accounts for only 5 percent of the jobs in the city. 
 That amounts to more income than Wall Street generated during the bull market of the 1980's, when 23 percent of the growth in income in New York was generated by financial markets, the report showed.
Mr. McCall said there has long been intuitive evidence of Wall Street's role in fueling the current economic boom in New York City. But he said today's report gave the most accurate figures on just how big an impact that was.
The report provides new ammunition for bond raters and fiscal monitors, including Mr. McCall, who have repeatedly warned that both the state and city economies are precariously linked to the fortunes of a market that is bound to take a downturn.
"During these times of prosperity, it is a good time to use the surpluses to prepare for the times that might come, when Wall Street might not be performing so well," Mr. McCall said in an interview. "We need to pay down some existing debts, to do our capital financing on a pay-as-you-go basis and to put more down for the future." Both the city and the state, he said, need to diversify their economies further to ease their dependence on Wall Street.
In the 1996 fiscal year, the city had a $224 million surplus; the surpluses grew, in line with the market surge, to $1.4 billion in 1997 and $2 billion in 1998. The surpluses also reached records in Albany, $1.4 billion and $2 billion in each of the last two years.
Among the report's other findings was that Wall Street was largely responsible for the growth of personal income in New York City. The average Wall Street annual salary was $181,900 in 1997, almost four times the average New Yorker's salary of $48,800.
More than that, Wall Street paychecks grew in real terms after inflation by more than 2 percent a year from 1992 to 1997, while non-Wall Street paychecks increased by 0.2 percent, according to the report.
The report also showed that while other sectors of the economy added more jobs, Wall Street was by far the economy's largest contributor to earnings. For example, retail jobs grew by 39,000 from 1992 to 1997; culture and the media added 27,500 jobs in the same period. During that same period, Wall Street added 25,200 jobs.
But at the same time, the report showed, the securities industry added $12.2 billion in earnings from 1992 to 1997. Its closest competitor was the business services sector, at $3.5 billion in added earnings.
Bonuses also hit records during the latest market boom. They rose from $4.7 billion in 1992 to an estimated $12 billion in 1997, compared with, say, the total of $6.5 billion recorded during the market rally between 1985 and 1987. The recent bonus increases make up almost 7 percent of the city's total wages.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Ruble Throws Another Scare Into Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The growing possibility of a devaluation of the Russian ruble swept the world's markets yesterday. Although the Russians insist there will not be a devaluation, the threat has already led to a major selloff in emerging markets and proved a drag on Wall Street and other major stock markets.
But the prospect of immediate shocks in the markets is only the first of many worries. Given all the other problems clouding the world's economic outlook -- such as the falling yen and the deepening woes in the rest of Asia -- Russia's crisis could be a sign of a broadening malaise that would stunt the stubbornly strong economy in the United States. 
 "If what is going on in Asia and Russia spreads to Latin America, I can't see how the United States can be immune from that," said Desmond Lachman, managing director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
The ruble scare, which has been a low-level worry for some time, stole the spotlight from Southeast Asia on Wednesday as the Russian Government imposed currency controls, seen by some as a precursor to a devaluation.
Yesterday, the Russian stock market plunged and was closed temporarily as sellers swamped buyers. Yields on short-term Russian bonds jumped to nearly 200 percent. The main stock market index fell 6.5 percent for the day, resulting in a loss of almost 50 percent in just the last four weeks. Adding insult to injury, George Soros, the well-known financier and big investor in Eastern Europe, called for major financial reforms and a 15 to 25 percent devaluation of the ruble.
"It is a very complex situation, and the risk is that investors will rush for the door," said Constance Hunter, a portfolio manager for Firebird Management L.L.C., which runs three hedge funds investing in equities and bonds in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
Russia's woes have been building for some time despite the approval of a $22.6 billion rescue package cobbled together in July by the International Monetary Fund and various nations.
The ripples have been felt in places that do business with Russia and in other emerging markets whose currencies are considered particularly vulnerable. Although three of Latin America's main stock markets -- Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela -- rose yesterday, they had plunged on Wednesday and their main indexes are down 22 percent or more for the last four weeks. The stock markets in Poland and Hungary all fell yesterday and their main indexes are off 14 percent or more for the four weeks.
As the riskiness of debt from emerging economies has become more apparent, investors have demanded ever higher yields. The premium on bonds issued by emerging market countries has soared, jumping to nearly nine percentage points over comparable United States Treasury rates from around six percentage points at the end of July.
"Its been fairly ugly the last week," Mr. Lachman said.
The world's developed stock markets have been more insulated. But some sectors, especially German banks, are vulnerable given their lending activities and investments in Russia. The uncertainty in Russia added to the negative sentiment in the United States and European stock markets yesterday, contributing to a 1.1 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
And the list of risks to the markets and the world's economies keeps growing: the drag of the Asian crisis on corporate earnings; the performance of the new Japanese Government; the threat of China's devaluing its currency; President Clinton's testimony in the Lewinsky matter on Monday, and Iraq's refusal to permit full weapons inspections.
A ruble devaluation, of course, would lead to bigger concerns. "If Russia devalued, the second-biggest nuclear power on the planet would be in a severe financial crisis, which would raise the issue of a growing political crisis," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. While he does not expect a devaluation, he said, "No one is immune from that increase in political risk."
German banks seem to be the most vulnerable to the new financial turmoil in Russia. According to the Bank for International Settlements, German banks had $30.5 billion in loans outstanding to Russia at the end of last year, about 40 percent of Russia's total borrowing.
According to Merrill Lynch in London, the four biggest German banks say their net exposure at risk, after offsetting credits and reserves, is $3 billion, but their stocks have slid sharply. Deutsche Bank stock is down 18.9 percent since July 21 while Dresdner Bank is off 17.4 percent since July 22.
American banks have far less exposure, with $7.1 billion, according to the B.I.S. Charles Peabody, a bank stocks analyst at Mitchell Securities, said in a recent report that "the good news is that U.S. bank exposure to Russia is minimal."
"J. P. Morgan is probably the largest exposure, which I estimate at $1.5 billion to $2 billion," he said. Chase Manhattan also owns Russian Treasury bills, known as GKO's, which would lose value in a devaluation or a debt restructuring designed to give Russia more time to pay.
Analysts caution that parsing the impact of a Russian devaluation is complicated. The effect on emerging markets, which have a habit of swooning en masse when one of their own is in trouble, would certainly be greater than on the markets of Europe and the United States. And the overall impact would be less severe than that of a Chinese devaluation of its currency, the yuan, which would worsen the situation throughout Southeast Asia.
In Russia, "the political risk over the next couple of years is more important," said David Bowers, European equity strategist for Merrill Lynch in London. "You may end up with a more nationalist tone."
Mr. Bowers says the economic risk is greater from Japan, a much larger economy now mired in recession.
Despite Russia's deepening financial mess, some investors still expect the I.M.F., the United States and its key industrial allies to come up with additional aid to stabilize the situation and the currency.
The consequences of a ruble devaluation would be too severe, they argue, as it would reignite inflation and threaten to undermine the current Government. And there is a history to support that argument. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to go to Russia on Sept. 1 and 2, and the United States took action to support the falling yen and provide stability in Asia before the President's visit to China in June.
"I think the reason you haven't seen it get worse is that people are banking on the United States and the G-7 to step up and give more assistance," said Ms. Hunter of Firebird Management. That hope may explain why Russian stocks and bonds bounced off their lows yesterday and why there was a rally in Latin America.
But the crisis has frozen some money. Mark Mobius, the managing director of Templeton Asset Management, moved aggressively into Russia in the last few years through his Templeton Russia Fund, whose net asset value lost 52 percent for the first seven months of the year.
"I didn't buy anything," he said of his strategy since the first wave of the Russian crisis hit in May. "I had a lot of doubts at the time, and anyone who got in at that time was quite brave."
And what is he doing now? "Now we are trying to assess what the next step for Russia is," he said. "Is it going to be a politicial crisis as well as an economic one?"

HEADLINE: Isaac N. P. Stokes, 91, Lawyer During New Deal and U.N. Birth

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Isaac N. P. Stokes, a lawyer who worked on New Deal legislation regulating securities brokerage firms and also helped in the creation of the United Nations and the rebuilding of Europe after World War II, died on Aug. 4 at a retirement home in Hanover, N.H., a son, Thomas, said. He was 91.
In 1934, Mr. Stokes was among many bright young men drawn to Washington by James Landis, one of his Harvard Law School professors, to draft what became the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the basic statute governing Wall Street. The young lawyers and students often slept on cots as they drew up the regulatory blueprint, and some of them, including Mr. Stokes, became lawyers for the new Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 In 1936 he returned to New York to practice law at the firm now known as Debevoise & Plimpton. But his work for the Federal Government would continue. He returned to Washington in the war years, drafting rules for the War Production Board and focusing on the promotion of plain English instead of the stilted language common to regulations.
In 1946, Alger Hiss hired Mr. Stokes for the staff of the United States delegation to the United Nations, where he worked to secure the choice of Manhattan as the headquarters site and to devise the terms of diplomatic immunity for representatives of other countries.
Theodore Kheel, the New York labor lawyer and a neighbor of Mr. Stokes when he lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, said that specifying that Mr. Hiss had once been a patron was illustrative of Mr. Stokes's character. Mr. Hiss was sentenced to prison for perjury in a 1950 espionage case in which, he insisted he had been framed. "He had courage and he did not want to hide anything, did not get embarrassed by a fact that others might have tried to hide, like his being hired by Alger Hiss," who, Mr. Kheel said, "was a respected man then."
Mr. Stokes next worked in the State Department under George F. Kennan on the policy planning staff. President Truman appointed him chief counsel of the Commerce Department in 1948.
The following year, he went to Paris as general counsel of the Mutual Security Agency -- the Marshall Plan. He later became deputy director of the organization, which helped revive European economies from the destructiveness of World War II.
He returned to New York in 1953 and became a founding partner of the Fleischmann Stokes & Hitchcock law firm, which had a clientele of multinational corporations. The firm was later folded into another firm and then dissolved. He retired in 1972 and moved to Jericho, Vt., where he continued to practice law part time and served on two Vermont commissions concerned with land use and water pollution.
Mr. Stokes came from a family long active in social causes and public service. His great-aunt, Caroline Phelps Stokes, was the founder of the Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1911 to help educate blacks and American Indians and to help residents of New York tenements.
Mr. Stokes became a trustee of the fund in 1937 and served as chairman from 1963 until he retired in 1977.
Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes graduated from Yale in 1929 and from Harvard Law School in 1933.
His first wife, Barbara Hoyt Stokes, died in 1965.
He is survived by his second wife, Katrina Roelker Huntington Stokes; three sons, Samuel N., of Silver Spring, Md., Thomas H., of Stockbridge, Mass., and Mitchell P., of Newton, Mass.; two daughters, Janet R. C., of Boston, and Olivia P. Stokes Drier of Belchertown, Mass.; three stepdaughters, Lydia H. Sparrow of Brunswick, Me., Madge H. Cooper of New York and Mary H. Silloway of Mendon, Vt., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Stock and Bond Prices Drop In Russia as Investors Bolt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Stock and bond prices plunged today, jarring Russian hopes that the Government could avert a depletion of its finances and a meltdown of the banking system.
Capping a week of ominous declines, the major blue-chip index dropped as much as 15 percent this morning before the Federal Securities Commission stepped in and halted trading. The market later recouped all but 6.49 percentage points of the loss, but the blue chips now have lost almost a quarter of their value in seven days. 
 Demand for Russian bonds seemed to vanish as yields on some short-term bonds exceeded an astounding 300 percent, assuming anyone wanted to purchase them. Few did.
"The market has ceased to exist, in some ways, as an actual market," said Tom Adshead, co-director of research for United Financial Group in Moscow.
But Russia has seen other terrifying plunges in this decade, and experts differed over whether this one would be fatal, or just one more near thing.
The Government said the panic was psychological, not fiscal, and repeated, as it has in recent days, that it has money to meet its obligations through the fall.
The Central Bank and aides to President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed a suggestion in The Financial Times today by the financier George Soros that the ruble should be devalued, a move that would effectively reduce the nation's debt but inflate prices.
"All the rumors that such documents are being worked out here are just invention and lies," said Irina Y. Yasina, the spokeswoman for the Central Bank.
Prominent amid the furious denials, however, was a more equivocal statement by the Finance Minister, Oleg Vyugin. Mr. Vyugin said Mr. Soros actually urged several measures to support the ruble, one of which was devaluation.
"Devaluation is an idea that should be considered only in a package," he said. "Soros did not call for devaluation as such."
But many private analysts nevertheless predict just that, saying that the Government is losing the struggle against bankruptcy, and that its most likely escapes would be devaluation or a "forced restructuring" of its debt, in which bondholders would simply be handed new repayment schedules with no choice but to accept them.
Either course would amount to a dramatic repudiation of the $22.6 billion rescue plan that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Western leaders assembled last month.
That package, for which Russia promised more coherent and efficient tax and budget policies, was supposed to yank the Government back from near-insolvency.
The failure of the package to give the Russian economy its much needed stability has disappointed Washington. The White House spokesman, Michael McCurry, said, "It is critical that the Russian Government act quickly to restore confidence in their economy, and that is something we have communicated with Russian officials."
The concern in Washington was reflected at meetings that President Clinton had with his economic and national security advisers on Tuesday and Wednesday, and in conference calls that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers both had with Russian officials.
Washington has also conferred with deputy ministers from the Group of Seven major industrial nations to review the options, Mr. McCurry said, but no specific proposals were made for further aid for Russia.
Politically, any proposal to increase aid for Russia would be hugely unpopular in Congress.
The I.M.F package was supposed to cushion private investors and the Russian people from hardship, a goal that now seems more and more remote. Despite redoubled tax-collection efforts and sweeping financial decrees, foreign investors so far have shown little faith that Russia is climbing out of its financial hole. With fewer foreign investors, the ruble has lost value and the Government has had to raise interest rates on bonds higher and higher to attract buyers.
But these developments have sapped the Government's financial health, further eroding confidence and leading still more investors to quit.
Moody's, the bond-rating service, lowered its rating of Russia's foreign bonds from B1 to B2, which is five levels below investment grade, and said the outlook is negative.
What can the Government do to pull out of the tailspin beyond devaluation, default or some other dramatic and painful act? There are no simple answers.
Today's calamity had many causes.
The prime focus today was on a Central Bank announcement on Wednesday evening of new rules to increase bank liquidity and to protect the ruble. One increased the number of banks with direct access to Central Bank credit; a second limited purchases of dollars by some unnamed Russian banks in an attempt to prevent currency speculation.
The rules, which were issued without explanation, underscored what had long been rumored: that some Russian banks are in trouble and that others have already walked away from debts to foreigners and to other Russian banks. Many banks here have borrowed heavily to invest in Government bonds, only to see the value of those investments plummet as rates for newer bonds began to skyrocket.
The second trigger may have been pulled this morning, when The Financial Times printed a letter from Mr. Soros urging an international rescue of the ruble.
That effort should include a ruble devaluation of 15 to 25 percent, Mr. Soros suggested. The call for devaluation made headlines worldwide, and may have galvanized wary investors with holdings in Russian companies that would be hurt by a drop in the ruble's value.
Sure enough, the value of the ruble plunged today, and the Government seemed to confirm the ruble's plight, saying the reserves of hard currency and gold it can use to prop up its currency had dropped by $1.4 billion over the last two weeks, to $17 billion.
The Central Bank's action and Mr. Soros's letter came atop other developments that have made Western investors nervous: the declining price of oil, a staple of the Russian economy; the economic crisis in Japan, and a Government admission that tax collections, while rising, are falling short of stated goals.
Matters were not helped when, on Wednesday, the lower house of Parliament seemed to reject President Yeltsin's call for a special session to enact emergency laws on taxes and the budget.
Mr. Yeltsin has put into effect many of those laws by decree during the Parliament's recess, but the legality of some of those decrees is in doubt.
While everyone agrees that the nation's fiscal situation is grim, the view that the plunge in stock and bond prices is justified by events is hardly unanimous.
A number of experts note that the Government is moving steadily if not always quickly toward fulfilling the terms of the loans offered last month by the I.M.F. and other lenders. And in fact the Government's finances are stable, if hardly robust.
The real crunch may come this winter, when a large amount of debt falls due. The Government must sell new bonds to repay some of the old ones, and it is the dead market for new Russian bonds that has led many investors to conclude that the Government will not be able to raise the money it needs.
"People are afraid the debt situation is not manageable when in fact, by all accounts, it is and will be manageable, at least up to November," said Margot Jacobs, a banking analyst at the United Financial Group in Moscow. "But instead of playing wait-and-see, people seem to be voting with their feet."

HEADLINE: Rare Alliance in the Rockies Strives to Save Open Spaces

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: CLARK, Colo.

 BODY:
In a timeless tableau, Jay Fetcher's Red Angus cattle graze on meadows that stretch down a hidden valley here, cupped on three sides by federally owned forest and wilderness. But 15 miles and a few bends down the Elk River lurks Colorado's modern resort economy in Steamboat Springs: a ski area that sells one million lift tickets every winter, an airport with direct flights to Chicago and Dallas, and a spreading sea of vacation condominiums.
Here and across the Rocky Mountain West, tourism and the second-home industry have spurred a land rush that is carving up the ranch land that composes heart-stopping Western vistas, threatening the very landscape that draws so many people to the Rockies. 
 The pressures are so powerful that they are forging alliances of two longtime adversaries: cattlemen like Jay Fetcher and environmentalists. Together they are adapting a tool long used to preserve open space in the crowded East, land trusts, to save the West's privately owned wide-open spaces by keeping cattle grazing on them.
Many environmental groups have complained that cattle harm fragile Western lands by overgrazing and trampling stream banks, and have sought to limit grazing permits in national forests. But as subdivisions and "ranchettes" replace cattle, the new rallying cries are "Cows, not Condos" and "Herefords, not Highways."
"I don't see it as cows versus the environment anymore," said Marty Zeller, a Denver land conservation consultant who advised Mr. Fetcher's family on protecting its land. "If you are going to be realistic about saving land in the West, you have to interact with the ranching community. In Colorado, if you look at land people want to protect, 90 percent of that land is under agricultural management."
With developers in Steamboat Springs paying 20 times the farm value of land, the Fetchers saved the family ranch by donating the development rights on 1,300 acres to a land trust. In doing so, they cut future estate taxes in half and insured that the land would be used in perpetuity for ranching, without opening their land to public use.
The experience proved so successful that Mr. Fetcher went on to form the nation's first land trust by and for ranchers, the Colorado Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust. The idea of ranchers donating development rights to land trusts managed by fellow ranchers spread like wildfire. In February, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association endorsed conservation easements to protect agricultural land, and, in July, the California Cattlemen's Association set up the Rangeland Trust. The trusts are set up to administer the easements.
Western ranchers in highly coveted mountain valleys realize that new times demand new tools to preserve open spaces and their way of life.
"My dad and his brother paid less for this ranch than I paid for that mower," said Mr. Fetcher, a soft-spoken 50-year-old, nodding to a new piece of haying equipment. "But, at Dad's death, the I.R.S. would come in and say the highest and best use of our land would be 35-acre ranchettes at $7,000 an acre."
If it were not for the trust, much of the land would have be sold.
The Fetchers donated their development rights to the land trust, but the rights can also be sold. And some ranchers prefer to sell their land outright to developers and use the profits as their retirement nest egg. Statistics bear out the joke that the last crop from ranchers approaching retirement will be a subdivision.
In the past two years, Colorado has been losing agricultural land at a rate of 200,000 acres a year. Easements protect only 3 percent of the 10 million mountain acres in private hands. Adding a critical twist, more than half of Colorado's agricultural land is owned by ranchers and farmers who are over 55 years old.
"We are going to see a major intergenerational transfer," said Lynne Sherrod, the executive director of the Cattlemen's Trust and a ranching neighbor of the Fetchers. "Without estate planning, it could really change the face of Colorado."
The change has already come to Steamboat Springs, a town of about 7,000 people that in the past decade lost its John Deere dealership, its fuel and grain cooperative, and a supply store that sold western wear and tack for horses as local ranchers went out of business.
In the summer of 1992, ranchers predicted another blow when Jamie Williams opened an office here of the Nature Conservancy, the conservation group.
"The big fear was that we would come in, buy up the valley, take land out of production and erode the local agricultural community," recalled Mr. Williams, who worked here for five years. "What I found very quickly was that we had a tremendous amount in common with the ranching community. The common ground was the tidal wave of development that was threatening."
Mrs. Sherrod, a fifth-generation Routt County rancher, recalled that many ranchers associated conservationists with tighter Federal restrictions on ranching.
Mr. Williams "spent a lot of time in kitchens drinking coffee; people believed Jamie before they believed his ideas," said Mrs. Sherrod, whose Cattlemen's Land Trust now protects 22,000 acres in Colorado. "I didn't want to see him come. I was just horrified to see him go."
After ranchers and conservationists recognized that they shared a desire to protect open space, they started to sell the idea locally. In Steamboat Springs, which largely lives off its cowboy image, defenders of open space realized that tourists prized ranchers more for producing scenery than for producing food.
In 1993, Colorado State University surveyed summer visitors to the town. About 90 percent of the 400 people who responded said that ranch meadows with wildflowers, birds and grazing cows and horses added to their enjoyment of their vacation. About 80 percent said they enjoyed looking at the hay fields, corrals, ranch buildings and working cowboys. And nearly half of them warned that if ranch land continued to be converted into golf courses and condominiums, they would not return.
"The value of scenery far outproduces the value of the livestock and hay," said C. J. Mucklow, a state agricultural extension agent who worked on the survey.
Realizing that vacationers would not fly from Chicago to see condominiums, Routt County voters in 1996 approved a real estate tax to buy development rights from ranchers. To keep traditional pastures intact, the county also adopted incentives for developers to cluster new houses in one area of a ranch, to avoid chopping the treeless landscape into 35-acre lots.
With $1 million in requests for buying development rights and ranchers vying to sell them, the county now has to choose conservation sites carefully to avoid creating unwanted development.
"It's called beachfront property," Mr. Mucklow said, using real estate jargon for developments next to protected farmland. "Within one month of one easement, a real estate ad came out: 'Next to land conservation easement.' "
Steamboat Springs's fight for open-space conservation is a microcosm of a battle being waged across the Rocky Mountain West. In Colorado, the land in local trusts had grown to 300,000 acres, or about 469 square miles, in 1996 from 140,000 acres, or about 219 square miles, in 1993. And although the land trust strategy may not completely stop the loss of agricultural land, it is a step in the direction of preserving open space.
The number of Colorado counties and municipalities that levy taxes for buying open space or conservation easements has risen to 28 today, from 6 a decade ago. This year the land protection budget of Great Outdoors Colorado, a state-supported trust fund, increased to $22 million, from $9 million last year.
"What we do in the next 10 years in Colorado is going to determine what this state looks like 100 years from now," said Will Shafroth, executive director of the fund.
As some real estate prices rise by 1 percent a month, the fund is gradually shifting from buying land outright to joining with local groups to buy conservation easements.
Land trusts, long a preservation tool in New England, are now growing fastest in the rural West. In Colorado, where the first land trust was formed in the late 1960's, there are 38. In Colorado and Montana, the land protected by conservation easements has doubled in five years.
"It is happening very fast," said John Wilson, managing director of the Montana Land Reliance, the nation's largest local land trust, with 300,000 acres under easement.
In Colorado, preservationists are spurred by rapid population growth. In July, state demographers forecast that Colorado's population would increase by 38 percent, to 5.5 million in the year 2020, from 4 million today.
With millions of baby boomers expected to buy retirement homes in coming years, Colorado's mountain resort counties will probably grow far faster than the state as a whole. Routt County, for example, is forecast to grow by 66 percent, to 29,588 residents in 2020, from 17,860 today.
According to these new forecasts, Gunnison County, home to the Crested Butte ski area, is to grow by 40 percent; Pitkin County, home to Aspen, by 52 percent; Eagle County, home to Vail, by 69 percent; Summit County, home to Copper, Keystone and Breckenridge, by 79 percent; and San Miguel, home to Telluride, by 92 percent.
"You don't come to Colorado, Wyoming or Montana to see another Wal-mart," said Jean Hocker, president of the Land Trust Alliance, a group in Washington that represents 700 of the nation's land trusts.
With 76 percent of metropolitan Denver respondents saying in a local poll this summer that the area was growing too fast, "cows, not condos" is becoming a mainstream call.
In June in Wyoming, radical environmentalists demanding "no more welfare for cowboys" snipped barbed wire in about 150 sections where fences crossed Federal grazing lands. The region's largest selling newspaper, The Denver Post, immediately fired back in an editorial: "What Wyoming eco-terrorists fail to appreciate is that the far-ranging ranches of the Cowboy State insure that some Western land, at least, will be spared from strip malls."

HEADLINE: Holocaust Accord Ends Plan for Sanctions

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
A day after the $1.25 billion settlement between Holocaust survivors and Swiss commercial banks accused of profiting from the Nazi era, officials in several states said that they would drop threatened sanctions against Swiss financial interests, and a major Swiss insurer facing a lawsuit from victims of the Holocaust agreed to honor their outstanding life and property claims.
Officials in New York, California, Pennsylvania and a number of other cities and states had threatened to begin imposing sanctions on Sept. 1, saying they were necessary to press the Swiss because two years of negotiations had not led to a settlement. The State Department had opposed the proposed penalties -- like barring short-term deposits of city and state funds in Swiss banks -- saying such pressure was hardening attitudes in Switzerland and souring relations between the two countries. 
 "We are pleased with the agreement" with the banks, which was announced Wednesday, said the New York City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, who heads a national committee of financial officers who have been monitoring the negotiations. He said they "have unanimously agreed that we will cancel all planned sanctions." Mr. Hevesi spoke at a news conference with the New York State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall.
In California, State Treasurer Matt Fong, who had imposed some sanctions on Swiss banks a year ago, announced that he was lifting all investment sanctions effective immediately. Pennsylvania's Treasurer, Barbara Hafer, said she was also canceling proposed sanctions.
Also yesterday, the Zurich Insurance Company agreed to work with an international commission to help process and settle unpaid claims to Holocaust victims and their heirs, Reuters reported. Along with 15 other European insurers -- including two Swiss companies -- the company is facing a class-action lawsuit in the Federal District Court in Manhattan by Holocaust survivors and their families who say the companies withheld or concealed the value or proceeds of policies sold before 1946.
Jewish organizations and Holocaust survivors generally welcomed the bank settlement as at least partial closure on a painful chapter. "It is a fair settlement," said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. "I'm happy this is over." Jewish organizations took pains to stress that the settlement was neither punishment for the banks nor a reward for survivors.
"It is not a question of a settlement; it is not a question of money," said Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto. "This is a question of morality."
Leo Rechter, 70, who endured the Holocaust as a child and lost his father to it, said that most Holocaust survivors would receive little money. "I think the Swiss could have done much better," he said.
But lawyers for the plaintiffs said the amount roughly corresponded to the amount of Jews' assets that were seized by the Nazis and processed through Swiss banks. Joel Sweet, one of the lawyers, said the settlement could establish an important global precedent. "When commercial actors profit illicitly from political or human-rights abuses, they will be forced to pay," he said.
Under the settlement, the major Swiss commercial banks, Credit Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland, agreed to guarantee payments of $1.25 billion, plus any interest accrued before the payments are made. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, the two banks now represent 85 percent of Switzerland's commercial bank activity in 1945, lawyers for the plaintiffs said.
In return, a class-action lawsuit against the commercial banks in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and a suit in the Northern District in California will be dropped, as will a major suit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in Federal District Court in Washington.
Although Credit Suisse recently purchased another of the Swiss insurers named in the lawsuit, the settlement with the banks specifically did not eliminate the suit against the insurance companies, officials said yesterday, which may have prompted Zurich Insurance Company's decision to cooperate in resolving the claims against it.
Neither the Swiss Government nor the National Bank took part in the negotiations, although evidence indicates the national bank processed most of the gold looted from Jews by the Nazis, and neither is expected to contribute to the settlement.
Mr. Hevesi praised Judge Edward Korman, who several weeks ago began personally overseeing the talks, for "putting parties in a room and apparently not letting them out until there was an agreement."
Officials familiar with the negotiations said as recently as Monday that the two sides were still far apart. Negotiations had broken down in June after the Swiss offered $600 million, a figure the plaintiffs quickly rejected.
But the sanctions deadline was looming and pressure from elected officials and other public figures increasing and finally, on Wednesday afternoon, a settlement was reached.
The money will go, first, to those able to document claims to dormant accounts in Swiss banks, which often denied survivors or their relatives access to funds deposited before the war if they lacked proper documentation. Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, is leading a commission that is attempting to match some 8,000 claims against the dormant accounts.
Morris A. Ratner, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the amount paid out for dormant accounts would prove to be a "small percentage" of the total, since so much evidence on specific claims has been lost or destroyed over the last 50 years.
The rest of the money will be distributed to Holocaust survivors through a mechanism yet to be determined. That money is considered a form of "rough justice," or restitution to those who cannot prove their claims to lost assets, as well as for the profits Swiss banks made from looted gold and art and from loans to the Nazis that were used for the construction of slave-labor camps.
The 10 law firms working on the case can apply to Judge Korman for fees, to be paid from the settlement money.
After the judge gives preliminary approval to the settlement amount, which could happen as early as next week, the Swiss banks have 30 days to make the first payment of $250 million.

HEADLINE: California G.O.P. Senate Nominee Goes From Long Shot to Star

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Less than three months ago, Matt Fong was little known outside California, where he is State Treasurer. Now, Republican heavyweights like Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott regard him as a new best friend.
Since he narrowly won the Republican nomination in June to oppose Senator Barbara Boxer in the fall, Mr. Fong has pulled virtually even with her in the polls, giving Republican leaders new reason to believe they can gain five Senate seats for a filibuster-proof majority of 60. 
 It is an alarming predicament for a Democratic incumbent at a time when the economy is strong and voter dissatisfaction is not the overwhelming issue it was four years ago. Yet the most recent statewide polls show that Ms. Boxer is in for a fight. In May, the latest poll by the Field Institute, a nonpartisan organization, showed that she held only a slim advantage over Mr. Fong, 47 percent to 43 percent, a statistical tie. In late July, a San Francisco Examiner poll found Ms. Boxer leading by just 43 percent to 40 percent.
"Barbara Boxer has the most partisan image of any elected official in California," said Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field poll. "At this stage, it's a yes-or-no vote on her."
In 1992, the so-called "year of the woman" in Washington, Ms. Boxer won a close race over Bruce Herschensohn, with 48 percent of the vote. She has been consistently regarded as one of the most liberal senators and has been a champion of abortion rights and gun control. She is also a strong and steady supporter of President Clinton, and her daughter, Nicole, is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham.
Credentials like that and the possibility Mr. Clinton could be damaged by the Monica S. Lewinsky matter have persuaded Republicans to view Senator Boxer as one of several Democratic incumbents who might be especially vulnerable this year. They are also why Mr. Gingrich, the House Speaker, has traveled to California to appear with Mr. Fong, and other ranking Republicans are scheduled to follow, including Senator Lott, the majority leader.
But Mr. Fong, 44, a lawyer and former Air Force officer, predicts that when Californians start focusing on the elections he will attract support for reasons beyond Ms. Boxer's approval ratings.
He, too, has a well-known name in California politics, not only as Treasurer since 1995, but as the son of March Fong Eu, a Democrat who was elected five times over 24 years as California's Secretary of State. Mrs. Fong Eu's popularity could help him win critical swing voters like Reagan Democrats who live outside the traditional liberal strongholds of Los Angeles and San Francisco.
She could also help Mr. Fong with Asian-Americans, who are about 5 percent of the California electorate and tend to vote Democratic.
Mr. Fong would be the first Chinese-American in the Senate since Hiram L. Fong, who is not related, represented Hawaii from 1959 through 1976, and the first Asian-American senator from California since S. I. Hayakawa served one term through 1982.
"I'm not starting from scratch," Mr. Fong said in an interview, alluding to his mother. "The Fong name has been on the state ballot since 1974, so it's not a new brand name. It's no different than if someone passes down a family drugstore that had a reputation for integrity. My mother had the same reputation for her integrity in public service."
The election in which Mr. Fong won the Republican nomination was California's first open primary, and Asian-American voters played an important role in his slim victory, 22 percent to 20 percent, over Darrell Issa, a wealthy businessman. A poll of voters in San Francisco found that 90 percent of Asian-Americans voted for a Democrat in the primary for governor and almost as many also voted for Mr. Fong.
Claudine Cheng, a former vice chairman of the San Francisco Democratic Committee, referred to a "hostile, anti-Asian political environment," arising from indictments of several Asian-Americans on charges of campaign finance violations. Ms. Cheng said of the city's Asian-Americans: "Most people are inclined to help Matt Fong. It's important to see one of our own do well."
Mr. Fong is counting on his expertise as a fiscal manager, his strong support for the military and his conservative social views to convince voters that the values he holds are closer to the mainstream than those held by Ms. Boxer, whom he describes as a political extremist.
Ms. Boxer points to Mr. Fong's opposition to gun control, campaign finance reform and laws that protect the environment to characterize him as the out-of-touch extremist.
"The biggest threat I face is not Matt Fong; it is but voter apathy," she said today. "But I said even before I knew who my opponent would be that this was going to be a race decided by two to five points. That's the way it always is in California; the state is pretty much evenly divided along party lines. But I think the more I'm compared to him on the issues, the better I'll do."
In any case, Mr. Fong's strategy is to plow ahead with what he calls a common-sense approach to issues, particularly those involving budgets and economics. He said that his fiscal skills, honed by managing the state investment portfolio of $32 billion, would serve the nation well.
"Every morning, I move anywhere from $200 million to $2 billion," he said of his job as treasurer. "You take a look at the challenges facing the country in the short and medium term, like Medicaid and tax reform. As the chief financial officer of the seventh-largest economy in the world, I have a far different perspective than my opponent."
Among his highest priorities, Mr. Fong includes increased spending on the military, a flat-rate income tax and a closer balance between environmental and economic policy.
Conceding that voters are not focusing on main issues, he said he could encounter problems when they do. Unlike Ms. Boxer, 57, a native of Brooklyn who moved to California in 1965, he is not animated on the stump. Walking the grounds of the Stanislaus County Fair in Turlock recently he seldom stopped to greet voters or engage them in conversation. Delivering speeches or talking casually, he sounds more rehearsed than spontaneous.
Campaign aides say he will loosen up soon and flash his personable side. But for now, Mr. Fong does not seem bothered by any stylistic concerns.
"As long as my wife thinks I have charisma, I'm O.K.," he said. "I just want voters to think I'm competent."

F.B.I. Finds Pieces Of Nairobi Bomb Truck
The F.B.I. agent in charge of investigating the bombing of the American Embassy in Nairobi said fragments of the truck that carried the explosives had been found, and that the bureau was piecing together a picture of what happened in the seconds before the bomb went off. A1
 
The remains of 10 Americans killed in Nairobi were flown home, accompanied by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright; President Clinton received the flag-draped coffins at a solemn ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. A10 

After initial surmises that the bomb that exploded outside the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was attached to an embassy-owned water truck, investigators are shifting their attention to other possibilities. A10
 
Congo Rebels Cause Blackout
Rebels knocked out all electrical power to Kinshasa and tightened their hold on a strategic region outside the Congolese capital after seizing the Inga dam, by far Africa's largest hydroelectric generator. A1
 
Russian Markets Halt Trading
Stock and bond prices in Russia plunged, jarring Russian hopes that the Government could avert a depletion of its finances and a meltdown of the banking system. Capping a week of ominous declines, the major blue-chip index dropped as much as 15 percent before the Federal Securities Commission stepped in and halted trading. A1
 
Altering Course on Colombia
The American Government, which had steadfastly refused to finance programs to help Colombia's coca growers switch to legal crops, is now shifting course and agreeing to pay for so-called alternative development under the country's new administration. A2
 
Kosovo's Limited Negotiators
The ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova named a team to negotiate peace with the Serbs that did not have the ingredient that diplomats consider essential to success: representatives of all ethnic Albanian political forces. It lacks any representatives of the rebel army fighting Serbia's rule of Kosovo, meaning its authority to reach agreements is doubtful. A3
 
U.S. Changes Iraq Policy
The Clinton Administration has retreated from its pledge of immediate military punishment if Iraq interferes with arms inspectors. Instead, senior Administration officials said, the act that would bring retaliation from Washington had shifted to Iraq moves to produce weapons of mass destruction or to threaten its neighbors. A4
 
Swiss Bank Boycott Averted
A $1.25 billion settlement between Holocaust survivors and Swiss commercial banks accused of profiting from the Nazi era led officials in several states to cancel sanctions against Swiss financial interests, even though the disbursing of the money will take a long time. A8

Clinton Said to Discuss Acknowledging Sexual Act
President Clinton has discussed with his inner circle a possible strategy of acknowledging to a grand jury on Monday that he had a specific type of sexual encounter with Monica S. Lewinsky, while still maintaining that he told the truth in January when he testified in a deposition that he and Ms. Lewinsky had never had "sexual relations," because of how that term had been defined, senior advisers said. A1
 
Prosecutors briefly questioned several more Secret Services officers before the grand jury investigating the Lewinsky matter. A16
 
Ruling Gives Patients Hearings
A Federal appeals court in California has ruled that Medicare patients are entitled to immediate hearings and other protections when they are denied care by H.M.O.'s. It also said Medicare officials had failed to enforce their own rules and had improperly renewed contracts with H.M.O.'s that violated the rules. A1
 
Young Suspects Sent Home
A judge in Chicago ruled that two boys, ages 7 and 8, who are charged with killing an 11-year-old girl could return home to await trial, but must wear electronic monitoring devices and stay inside 24 hours a day. A12
 
Seven Succumb to Desert Heat
The bodies of seven people were found in Southern California near the Mexican border, apparently victims of the heat as they tried to enter the United States illegally. A12
 
Compromise on Disputed Degas
The relatives of two Holocaust victims reached agreement with a pharmaceutical company heir over ownership of a Degas landscape apparently looted by the Nazis during World War II, in the first such case to be settled in the United States. The Art Institute of Chicago will acquire the work, with both sides receiving credit when it is on display. A17
 
Agents of the State
The City Council in Oakland, Calif., designated the Oakland Marijuana Buyers' Cooperative officers of the city in an effort to shield the group from Federal civil and criminal prosecution. A15
 
Web Site Accused of Deception
The F.T.C. said the Geocities Web site lied when it told two million adult and child subscribers that it would not disclose personal information without permission. A15
 
Air Control Center Inquiry
Federal officials are investigating whether an air traffic control center in Cleveland has routinely hidden evidence of operational errors, in which planes are mistakenly ordered to fly too close to each other, after discovering three such incidents on June 23 that went unreported. A19

$172 Million in U.S. Aid Along Upstate Canals

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: OSWEGO

 BODY:
The Federal Government will provide $172 million in assistance to help revitalize small communities along the state's canal system, officials announced yesterday.
The money will be used to help economic growth, job creation, tourism, housing construction and structural improvements in more than two dozen counties along the state's 524-mile canal network. Andrew Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Dan Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, announced the aid package in Oswego and in Lockport. 
 The assistance is an outgrowth of the New York Recreationway Plan, developed by the state in 1995. The plan is meant to turn the historic Erie Canal and connecting waterways into a major tourism destination that will generate economic development in adjacent communities.

HEADLINE: Too Late to Say 'Extinct' In Ubykh, Eyak or Ona;
Thousands of Languages Are Endangered

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

 BODY:
As the legend goes, when the Turkish sultan first heard of Ubykh, the bizarre-sounding language spoken by Muslims who had emigrated from the northwestern Caucasus in the mid-19th century, he dispatched a servant to learn more.
When the servant returned, he described what a language with 83 consonants and one vowel sounded like by taking out a bag of pebbles and pouring them on the sultan's marble floor. "Listen to these sounds," he said. "Foreigners can gain no greater understanding of Ubykh speech." 
 Today, if people are curious about Ubykh, they can listen to a recording instead of a handful of tumbling stones, but they can't hear it spoken in person. The last Ubykh speaker, Tevfik Esenc, died in Turkey at the age of 88 in 1992.
Ubykh is one of hundreds of languages that are either dead or dying; thousands more are expected to disappear over the next century. For linguists, the growing number of vanishing languages is a looming disaster that threatens to diminish the world's cultural diversity and erase a monumental human achievement. "Languages are more than grammar," Ken Hale, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said. "They are cultures, ways of thinking about ourselves and our surroundings. When we lose one it's like losing the Louvre."
The disappearances are no less alarming, they argue, than the threat the earth's biological diversity faces from industrial pollution and population growth. "Surely we linguists know and the general public can sense that any language is a supreme achievement of a uniquely human collective genius, as divine and endless a mystery as a living organism," Michael Krauss, a linguist at the University of Alaska, has written. "Should we mourn the loss of Eyak," an Alaskan language, "or Ubykh less than the loss of the panda or the California condor?"
According to the latest and most authoritative survey of the world's tongues -- Ethnologue, published in 1996 by the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas -- 336 languages are "nearly extinct," meaning that parents no longer teach them to their children. Among the recent disappearances, say linguists, are Northern Pomo, a Californian Indian language; Sirenik Eskimo; Quinault, spoken by Indians in Washington State; Kasabe, spoken in the Adamawa province of Cameroon, and Ona, spoken in Tierra del Fuego in southern Argentina. Eyak is down to one speaker.
Mr. Krauss brought attention to the erosion of the world's language diversity in 1992, when he predicted that at least half the world's roughly 6,500 languages would become extinct over the next century.
Many languages have already died out, including those of major civilizations, like Sumerian, Assyrian, Babylonian and Latin. But in today's more technologically connected world, that process is hastening. English and a handful of other major languages that increasingly dominate the world are widely seen as passports to education and a brighter economic future.
Roughly half the world speaks one of 10 mega-languages as a primary, or mother, tongue. Mandarin Chinese is spoken by 16 percent of the world's population, followed by English and Spanish at 5 percent each; varieties of Arabic, 4 percent; Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali and Russian, 3 percent each, and French and Japanese, 2 percent each, Ethnologue reports.
Meanwhile, 60 percent of existing languages have 10,000 speakers or fewer, said David Harmon, who analyzed the 'Ethnologue survey and is a member of Terralingua, a society dedicated to language preservation. Languages with so few speakers are highly vulnerable to disruption.
Nancy C. Dorian, a Gaelic languages expert at Bryn Mawr College, said that "when small linguistic communities become economically unviable, for instance, they break up and the language dies out."
For example, after Russia drove the roughly 50,000 Ubykh speakers from their homes on the Black Sea into Turkey in the 1860's, the refugees eventually decided that the dominant Turkish, Abkhaz or Circassian languages would be more useful. Over time they stopped teaching their children their own ferociously difficult tongue.
"From what we know it was simply a decision by the Ubykh elders not to teach Ubykh to the next generation," said George Hewitt, a professor of Caucasian languages at London University. "It seemed more sensible to concentrate on languages they would need. But it was a tragedy all the same because when a language dies, a culture dies with it."
Bert Vaux, an expert on Turkish languages at Harvard University, agreed. "Every language offers a unique insight into the nature of speech and thought," he said. Ubykh, along with other northwestern Caucasian languages, for example, has a unique system of agreement between subject, verb, object and indirect object, Mr. Vaux said. "It shows that humans have a greater cognitive capacity than we thought," he said, "because the average person would never think it possible to keep track of so many agreements within a single sentence."
Nor is cultural diversity the only loss. Luisa Maffi of Terralingua said indigenous languages could play a role in environmental preservation because they often reflect valuable ecological knowledge that enable speakers to preserve their habitats.
Today, Spanish is killing Indian tongues in Latin America while French wipes out languages in its former colonies in Africa. In southeastern Alaska, parents have stopped teaching native languages to children, Nora Marks Dauenhauer and Richard Dauenhauer write in "Endangered Languages: Language Loss and Community Response" (Cambridge University Press, 1998).
English, it turns out, is the biggest language slayer. It was the language of the Industrial Revolution and remains the language of the world's biggest economy and remaining superpower. "It was always in the right place at the right time," said David Crystal, a retired linguistics professor from Reading University in Britain and author of "English as a Global Language" (Cambridge University Press, 1997).
Mr. Crystal estimated that 343 million people speak English as a mother tongue; another 235 million to 350 million speak it well as a second language because they learned it in a country like India, where it has official status. Estimates of those who are learning English as a foreign language vary wildly, from 100 million to one billion. Nonetheless, Mr. Crystal figures that the number of "fluent to reasonably competent"English speakers is 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion, compared with 1.1 billion Chinese speakers.
English seems set to spread even further because it is the most-taught foreign language in more than 100 countries, including Russia, China, Germany, Spain, Egypt and Brazil, sometimes displacing the study of other languages in the process, Mr. Crystal said. In 1996, for example, Algeria replaced French with English as the chief foreign language in its schools.
"It may be," he concluded, "that English, in some form or another, will find itself in the service of the world forever."
As concern grows over the loss of languages, efforts to record and revitalize endangered tongues are intensifying. Before he died, Mr. Esenc, the last Ubykh speaker, allowed linguists to take X-rays of his speech organs while he demonstrated the vocal gymnastics necessary to produce those 83 distinct consonant sounds. He also helped scholars compile an Ubykh dictionary and grammar guide.
In the United States, Congress passed legislation in 1990 and 1992 encouraging the preservation of American Indian languages. And a privately financed Endangered Languages Fund, which awards grants for the preservation and recording of threatened tongues, has been set up at Yale University.
Abroad, Tokyo University has created an International Clearinghouse for Endangered Languages and Unesco is cataloguing languages around the world. British linguists have established a Foundation for Endangered Languages that also provides grants for preservation and documentation.
In Britain and Ireland, minor revivals are under way in such endangered tongues as Breton, Provencal and Welsh, Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Bilingual inhabitants of the Isle of Skye off the western coast of Scotland, for example, are writing English subtitles for Gaelic television programs. In Belfast a group is trying to found an Irish-speaking community by buying houses in the same street. And over 200 people are now fluent in Cornish although the last mother-tongue speaker died at the end of the 18th century.
Ms. Dorian pointed out that the collapse of the Yugoslav federation had strengthened the position of Slovenian by making it the official language of an independent nation, while Croats and Bosnian Muslims are trying to create separate languages for themselves out of the Serbo-Croatian they speak along with Serbs.
In some cases "new" languages are gaining popularity. In Papua New Guinea, Tok Pisin, originally a form of pidgin English, is becoming a language in its own right. Yet as it does, it is replacing some of the country's other 800 languages.
Organizations interested in preserving indigenous languages, including Terralingua and International PEN, which represents writers and translators, want to add a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights -- creating a right to be educated in one's native tongue -- to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that the United Nations adopted in 1948.
But many argue that the disappearance of languages is inevitable. Peter Ladefoged of the University of California at Los Angeles has argued that linguists should record languages before they disappear but not necessarily try to save them. Preserving languages, he said, can impose political and economic costs by weakening unity and encouraging tribalism. It can also absorb scarce resources that might otherwise be used for development. Tanzania, he pointed out, promotes Swahili at the expense of tribal languages in the hope of creating a sense of nationhood in an ethnically diverse country.
The loss of indigenous language and culture can be the price of entering the modern world, Mr. Ladefoged said. He remembered a speaker of Dahalo, an almost extinct Cushitic language in rural Kenya, who smilingly revealed that his sons spoke only Swahili. "He was proud his sons had been to school and knew things he did not. Who am I to say he was wrong?"

HEADLINE: About New York;
A Salesman Who Paid Attention

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
ZARA GRAUER still remembers her first date with Howard Bardach. He stepped aside to let her board a bus, then sat beside her and suggested they share some coffee and conversation. Walking home afterward, he asked her not to walk so fast.
"Don't you feel well?" she replied. 
 "No," he said. "I want it to last longer."
Such sentimentality. It figured, since he fancied himself a ladies' man. Such salesmanship, too, since he was just as likely to approach strangers on the street and ask if they wanted to buy or sell his roach-killing paint, hand warmers or special light bulbs whose rays rivaled "sunshine on a June day."
Those who got beyond the product pitch would learn that Mr. Bardach, 80, had once been a Yale man, a Navy man and the owner of a packaging business. They were also told that he had moved to Hell's Kitchen after one of his sons committed suicide and his wife divorced him. Despite those setbacks, he reinvented himself, convinced that riches still waited for him.
"He came to this neighborhood to get away from it all," said Sylvie Pappis, a friend. "And he did."
Too much so. Starting about a year ago, he grew thin and quiet. He stopped writing the wacky, hyperkinetic letters hawking his products and solutions to the world's ills. He stopped being a salesman. On July 27, he hanged himself. His death seemed as impenetrable as the successes and sorrows of his very life.
"Let's face it," said Roger Starr, a former city official who worked on the Yale Literary Magazine with him and received his bizarre letters over the years, "there's sort of a gap between being eccentric and being insane. I'm not sure what side of that gap he fell on."
His letters and phone calls would make you think he was on the wrong side. What kind of person would call a reporter at 4 A.M. and urgently insist that he leave his ink-stained cocoon to embrace the world of wealth by selling those special light bulbs?
Then again, John Waldo Adams, his best friend, knew him as the only person who ever threw him a birthday party in his 90 years on this earth. The two met around 20 years ago when Mr. Bardach stopped him on the street and tried to sell him a chemical with amazing gunk-removal powers. When he discovered that Mr. Adams was a poet, he volunteered to type up his writings, offering free editorial advice.
"He wanted me to get more fun and laughter into my poems," Mr. Adams said. "I was writing about the condition of the world, the economy, the psychological, the sociological. Sometimes he said it was too serious."
He often stopped by Ms. Pappis's hat shop on West 54th Street, sometimes with lady friends as possible customers. "He had a good eye for colors," she said. "He was always attentive. He wasn't like a lot of men who pass by the store and don't notice. He paid attention."
She suspected something was amiss last year, when he would walk past the store with only a nod. Some of his friends said he had cancer, though he would never talk about what was going on. He always had lunch at a nearby senior center, but the people there knew even less.
"I think he was a tortured soul," said Sharon Beard, who works at the center. "But he carried himself without a scintilla of self-pity. He was a classy man."
While his friends in Hell's Kitchen wondered what was wrong, Ms. Grauer explained simply that he had had an epiphany about a year ago when she fell ill. He took care of her, she said, and grew caring and calmer. But she suspected that he was disappointed by his fizzled business plans.
"I think it must have been difficult when the Yale magazine would arrive and he saw this one was a C.E.O. and that one had a home in Montauk, and he hadn't accomplished," she said. "That's what got to him."
THAT didn't matter to the dreamers and buddies who met him during his last years. They recalled a man whose hard life never diminished the fast talk. To them, he was Howie Bardach, salesman and friend. They only wish he had let them in a little closer a little longer.
"He was essentially a salesman," Ms. Grauer said. "It was like 'Death of a Salesman,' when the wife said, 'Attention must be paid.' I always thought of that because I did pay attention. The first time we sat on the couch, I put a pillow behind him. I don't think anybody had ever done that for him before."

HEADLINE: Russia's Markets Rally as Western Powers Discuss Rescue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Russia's financial markets rallied today after the Kremlin and the major Western powers indicated that they were working on another round of plans to end the nation's economic crisis.
But with banks still shaky and the memory of Thursday's panic still fresh, brokers and analysts said they were not so much optimistic about a solution as relieved that today's markets had not completed the collapse that began the day before. 
 After losing almost 6.5 percent of their value on Thursday, Russian blue-chip stocks regained about 4 percent today. Nine-month Government bonds were yielding about 150 percent, well under the 200-percent-plus yields of Thursday.
President Boris N. Yeltsin, breaking his summer vacation today to inspect a meat-processing factory in the ancient city of Novgorod, insisted that there would be no devaluation of the ruble -- "that's firm and definite."
"That would signify that there was a disaster and that everything was collapsing," he said. "On the contrary, everything is going as it should."
The Kremlin said Mr. Yeltsin had a lengthy telephone conversation with President Clinton this afternoon.
 In Washington, the White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said today that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin did not discuss whether a new aid package from the West would be needed.
 "This was not a phone call about money. It was a phone call about doing the things necessary" to stabilize the struggling economy, Mr. McCurry said.
 "They discussed some of the steps that will be necessary to, over the long term, assure economic stability in Russia," he added.
The banking system, which became the focus of Thursday's panic after it became clear that some major banks were unable to repay major loans, remained solvent, if short of foreign currency. Moscow banks were open today, although many refused to sell their customers dollars. The city's hundreds of hole-in-the-wall currency exchanges were selling dollars, sometimes at exorbitant rates, but many had posted "No dollar" signs by day's end.
The Central Bank was trading currency at the rate of about 6.3 rubles per dollar. But at some currency exchanges, the rate approached 7 rubles per dollar. "It looks as though they avoided a run on the banks, which was the nightmare we were staring at this morning," said Tom Adshead, co-director of research for Moscow's United Financial Group. "The foreign-exchange market dried up. But fortunately, nobody's clamoring for their money."
For the moment, the critical question is whether the banks will do as well next week. Thursday's crisis was rooted in months of speculating by some banks in high-yield Government bonds and currency "forwards" -- contracts to buy or sell currencies at specified future dates. The banks had bet that the ruble would remain stable and that the bond prices would not collapse -- and when their bets soured, they were unable to cover their losses.
More currency contracts will fall due next week, and the ruble's weak status means that some banks may have to absorb large trading losses. As occurred this week, other banks that put up Government bonds as collateral for loans could be asked to produce more money now that the bonds have lost much of their value, a practice known as a margin call.
But Russia's Central Bank has begun pumping money into some of the least liquid banks, and analysts said it was spending still more money to keep the value of the ruble from deteriorating further. That pleased investors, but it is uncertain how long the Central Bank, which has but $17 billion in reserves, can continue without outside help.
Russia's leaders continued to reject calls to devalue the ruble, a move that would reduce the nation's debt, but would also ignite inflation, destroy investors' confidence and provoke a political showdown with Communists and nationalists.
Mr. Yeltsin made a point of noting that he had not even broken his summer vacation to return to Moscow, but instead had directed Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko to press ahead with an overhaul of tax and budget policies that is seen as critical if the Government is to remain solvent.
Mr. Yeltsin also summoned the Communist-controlled lower house of Parliament into emergency session to address the fiscal crisis. Because the Duma has refused to meet, Mr. Yeltsin has been forced to issue a series of legally dubious decrees ordering the measures Mr. Kiriyenko is undertaking.
But today the Communists, apparently struck by the seriousness of the collapse, grudgingly agreed to convene, still insisting that they will have nothing to do with tax increases and other controversial provisions of the plan. Russian officials said that finance ministers of the major Western industrial powers were already talking about how they might mount another loan package or other assistance to steer Russia away from bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Strikes Cost G.M. $1.65 Billion

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation estimated the third-quarter production losses as a result of work stoppages from labor strikes in Flint, Mich., cost it $1.65 billion after taxes, the company said today in a Federal securities filing.
The total includes a loss of $1.3 billion for G.M.'s North American operations and another $350 million for G.M.'s Delphi Automotive Systems unit, the auto maker said in its quarterly report for the second quarter, which was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 In the section reviewing G.M.'s North American operations, the company estimated the strike-related production loss for the third quarter totaled 318,000 vehicles from the start of the quarter until full production resumed.
G.M. said the estimates did not take into account the effect of possible recoveries that may occur through production increases in future periods.

HEADLINE: Conrail Strikers Ordered Back to Work

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 14

 BODY:
A Federal judge ordered 3,400 striking Conrail employees to return to work today just hours after the track maintenance workers walked out, shutting down the freight railroad's operations.
Judge James T. Giles of the Federal District Court here issued the temporary restraining order pending a full hearing Aug. 27 on Conrail's contention that the strike is illegal. 
 The ruling came hours after 3,400 workers walked out over Conrail's use of outside contractors to build tracks in Marysville, Ohio. The union, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, said Conrail had promised in writing not to contract out the work.
The strike shut down all movement by Conrail, the nation's fifth-largest freight rail company. It moves about 7 percent of the nation's freight volume.
The strike also affected some passenger service. Amtrak service was disrupted in western Pennsylvania, Michigan and New York, where four Amtrak trains had to stop short of their destinations because they could not operate on Conrail's tracks, a railroad spokesman said. One train heading from Toronto to New York was stopped in Niagara Falls, N.Y. and two trains heading from the city to Niagara Falls stopped in Schenectady, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Big Brokerage Plans to Build Near Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has signed an agreement to move into a new one-million-square-foot office tower on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, according to real estate executives.
If completed, the deal would represent the latest in a series of expansion moves by the city's big investment houses, whose growth has helped fuel New York City's economic resurgence in the last few years. It also would add another piece to a building boom in the Times Square area driven largely by media and financial companies. 
 After many months of on-again, off-again negotiations, Morgan Stanley signed a letter of intent on Tuesday with the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation to build and occupy a proposed 33-story glass tower on what is now a parking lot and a rare development site in midtown Manhattan, according to the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The site, known as Rockefeller Plaza West, was a victim of the recession in the early 1990's and sat fallow for nine years. But with rents soaring and little vacant space available in midtown, the land has become very valuable, although at least two companies in the last year have tried and failed to come to terms with the owner, the Rockefeller Group, which is a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Estate Company.
The Rockefeller Group's plans for the Seventh Avenue tower are now going through the city's land use review process. According to documents filed with the Planning Commission, the 33-story skyscraper would include an atrium at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 49th Street with an entrance to the subway as well as the vast underground concourse beneath Rockefeller Center to the east.
Morgan Stanley's letter of intent gives the investment bank exclusive rights to complete a deal at Rock West within a specified time, one real estate executive said.
If a final deal is struck this time, the new office tower would be Morgan Stanley's third building in the area and its latest step in creating a corporate campus at the northern end of Times Square. The Rock West site is across the street from Morgan Stanley's building at 750 Seventh Avenue. And both buildings are only a block north of the investment bank's 43-story headquarters at 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets.
Morgan Stanley, like many of the largest investment banks, moved to midtown during the 1970's from lower Manhattan, the city's traditional financial center. In 1995, the investment bank decamped to a newly resurgent Times Square, suddenly rife with financial and media and entertainment companies like Disney, Viacom, Bertelsmann A.G., Proskauer Rose and, soon, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
Morgan Stanley and other major financial institutions are expanding. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs in the securities industry in New York City hit a record of 164,300 in June, surpassing the previous peak of 163,000 for the first time in 11 years. Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch & Company are both scouring the metropolitan area for more office space, while Bear Stearns & Company is building a new headquarters on Madison Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets.
Morgan Stanley declined comment yesterday, as did the company's broker, Colliers ABR. Jonathan D. Green, president of Rockefeller Group Development, was no more forthcoming, nor was his broker, Cushman & Wakefield. But word of the tentative deal, which was shrouded by confidentiality agreements, spread quickly through the real estate industry.
"This continues the trend of large financial companies devouring whatever space is available in the city today," said Howard L. Michaels, chairman of the Carlton Group, a real estate advisory firm. "As the Wall Street boom continues, the space requirements for the investment banks grow ever larger."
In this year's first four months, financial service companies accounted for nearly 11 percent of all commercial leasing in the city, according to a recent report from the office of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
Goldman, Sachs is putting together its own corporate campus downtown, where the investment bank recently leased 660,000 square feet of space at 180 Maiden Lane and 520,000 square feet at 10 Hanover Square. The company, which is based nearby at 85 Broad Street and One New York Plaza, is back in the market looking for more space, according to real estate brokers.
Merrill Lynch, which bought a 780,000-square-foot tower at 222 Broadway last year, is now hunting for a million more square feet and will probably end up finding space in Jersey City, brokers said.
Aside from real estate, Wall Street has fueled budget surpluses for the city and the state and accounted for an astounding 56 percent of the increase in inflation-adjusted earnings in New York City between 1992 and 1997, while representing only 5 percent of the jobs. But financial analysts have warned of the dangers that the city's economy is so dependent on the fortunes of Wall Street.
"While good times on Wall Street pour unprecedented personal and business tax revenue into the city and the state, the flow of income from this single area poses some risks," Mr. McCall said Thursday. "A market downturn, or worse, a broader economic recession, would result in job losses and the loss of a significant source of funds for the city and the state."
Despite a robust stock market and record profits among Wall Street companies, the American and New York Stock Exchanges, the commodity exchanges and the investment banks have demanded hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to remain in the city. Morgan Stanley, which received a $100 million tax subsidy in the early 1990's, is expected to go back to the city for more if a deal is struck at Rock West.
The tower would be something of a victory for Mitsubishi Estate, which lost a billion-dollar investment in the historic Rockefeller Center complex during the recession. The site itself has served as a barometer of the New York real estate market.
Mr. Green began buying the parcels that make up the site at the start of the last real estate boom in 1980. But by the time he had demolished the existing buildings and obtained city approval in 1990 for a 55-story, 1.3 million square foot limestone tower, a recession had devastated the New York real estate market. In 1994, the Rockefeller Group turned it into a parking lot.
Last month, the Rockefeller Group nearly struck a deal with Morgan Stanley for the property, but it ultimately balked at the suggestion of turning over the property to Morgan Stanley's developer, Gerald Hines. According to one executive who knows of the deal, Morgan Stanley returned to the negotiating table recently, agreeing to lease the land for 99 years, pay the Rockefeller Group a development fee and still use Mr. Hines to build the project.

HEADLINE: Canada's Noble Gift

 BODY:
Canada's decision last week to give the Nisga'a Indians control of their ancient tribal lands in British Columbia was an overdue but honorable gesture, born partly of guilt for past injustices and partly from a belief that tribal sovereignty will lead to economic self-sufficiency. But the Government in Ottawa must make sure its trust is not abused. In particular, it must hold the tribe to national laws, especially those protecting the environment, even if that limits what the Indians hope to do.
The United States' experience with Indian sovereignty might be helpful to the Canadians, who in fact have come rather late to the idea -- more than two centuries behind America, which granted self-government to 371 separate tribes between 1778 and 1871. The treaties struck between Congress and the tribes gave the Indians tribal homelands and freedom from state control. But they remained subordinate to the will of Congress, becoming, in effect, nations within a nation, levying their own taxes and enforcing their own laws but always subject to a higher power. 
 This is essentially the same arrangement that the Canadian Government has struck with the Nisga'a tribe. The tribe will be encouraged to engage in forestry, mining, fishing and other activities to sustain its independence. At the same time it will be asked to obey national laws, including strict environmental regulations -- a vital point since the land to which the Nisga'a will be taking title, with its extensive pine forests and pristine streams, is not only visually stunning but also ecologically fragile.
But this "nation-within-a-nation" architecture, however clean it looks on paper, has not prevented conflicts in the United States between tribes and local and state interests. Some of these conflicts involve money -- whether, for example, non-Indians who run businesses on reservations should pay taxes to the tribe or to the state. Many disputes involve the environment.
In New Mexico, for example, the Isleta Pueblo tribe forced the city of Albuquerque to spend $300 million to clean up a nearby river. A Federal court ruled that the Indians were well within their rights under the Federal Clean Water Act. Conversely, the Goshutes, a tribe in central Utah, decided last year to lease part of their reservation as a storage ground for high-level civilian nuclear waste. The Goshutes said they were simply invoking their sovereign powers to make themselves self-sufficient. Their neighbors, quite rightly, were horrified.
Ultimately, this dispute will have to be resolved by the authorities in Washington, which is just where it ought to be settled. As the senior partner in the treaties, the Federal Government must juggle two obligations. One is to protect tribal interests, the other to assert the national interest when tribes overreach. So will it be in Canada, where neighbors of the Nisga'a in British Columbia are already complaining that the deal gives the tribe unfair advantages. Having made the gift of sovereignty, Ottawa must now control its consequences.

HEADLINE: Now It's Grapevines Climbing the Rockies;
Small Wineries Gaining Footholds In Many Unlikely U.S. Locales

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

DATELINE: PALISADE, Colo.

 BODY:
Parker and Mary Carlson have an unpretentious attitude about making and marketing their wine.
"We're not the swirl, sniff and spit crowd," Mr. Carlson said. "Our wines are just meant to be enjoyed. They're light and fruity, easy drinking." 
 Their Carlson Vineyards labels have playful names like Prairie Dog Blush, Tyrannosaurus Red and Gewurzasaurus. And they are made from Colorado grapes. Hundreds of acres of cabernet, merlot, chardonnay and gewurzstraminer are thriving on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
It is a process being repeated in many states without long wine-making traditions.
The number of American wineries doubled to 1,817 between 1980 and 1995, the last year for which data are available, according to the American Vintners Association in Washington. More than half of the new wineries are outside California. Except for Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming, every state has at least one winery. The trade association said New York, Oregon, Washington and Virginia had a combined total of 379 wineries, up from 138 in 1980. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, Texas, Michigan, New Jersey, Indiana and New Mexico each had 20 or more.
But many of those wineries operate on a fine line between a pastime and a small business.
"The wine industry outside of California, Washington, Oregon and New York tends to be a very small, cottage industry, almost a home industry, one step beyond a hobby," said Louis Perdue, who publishes an Internet newsletter called Wine Investment News. "The problem is that they don't make a great deal of wine, and if you don't make a great deal of wine, it's hard to make a great deal of money."
Vic Motto, a partner in Motto, Kryla & Fisher of St. Helena, Calif., which provides consultants and accountants for the wine industry, says vineyards and wineries are capital intensive. A winery that grows its own fruit typically has assets of $4 to $5 for each dollar of annual sales, Mr. Motto said, compared with $1 or less in assets per dollar of sales for a manufacturing company.
 But many small wine makers are motivated primarily by a love of wine and a desire to combine agriculture with an art that has existed for thousands of years.
"There's a certain romance to it," Mr. Motto said. "You're growing some fruit that you're going to convert into a product that has a certain amount of mystique to it and charm."
The winery operations in most states are still dwarfed by California's labels. Eric Sims, an economist with Motto, Kryla, estimated that California wines accounted for 90 to 95 percent of the $16 billion in sales of American-made wines in 1997. Most of the rest came from New York and Washington, he said.
 But Simon Siegl, president of the American Vintners Association, said advances in scientific knowledge had helped spread commercial vineyards into new regions. New tools and techniques include more effective fungicide applications, better water management and improved ways of dealing with severe cold weather, which is not a problem in California's grape-growing regions.
"In years past, the growers just didn't have the tools to win out against nature," Mr. Siegl said. "As more and more research delivers better tools to the wine maker, it's more feasible for wine to be produced in some of these regions."
Colorado's tiny emerging wine industry is an example of how wine making is proliferating throughout the United States.
At 4,700 to 6,400 feet above sea level, the Colorado vineyards are among the highest in the world, but the area's radiant summer days and cool nights are great for grapes, and improved vineyard management techniques are helping to solve problems of long, cold winters.
In 1980, the state had two commercial wineries. Now, there are 21, according to the Colorado Wine Industry Development Board. Five new Colorado wineries received licenses in 1997.
Carlson Vineyards, south of Palisade in the Grand Valley of the Colorado River, is typical of the recent trends.
The winery has three acres of its own vineyard and buys "seven acres' worth" of grapes from other growers in the area, to make about 15,000 gallons of wine a year. Mr. Carlson, 52, said he expected to sell about $350,000 worth of wine this year.
The Carlsons started their winery in 1988. "We were home wine makers for about 10 or 15 years before that, so it's just a hobby that got out of control," Mr. Carlson said.
For the first four years, Mr. Carlson also continued working at his supervisory job at a Coors ceramics plant in nearby Grand Junction. He has taken short wine-making courses at the University of California at Davis, the American mecca of viniculture education, and some of his wines -- including the 1995 Gewurzasaurus -- have won medals in national competitions.
Like other vintners interviewed in the area, Mr. Carlson was reluctant to talk about profits. He said that the winery produced a taxable income, "but it's all going back into the business."
Douglas and Susan Phillips have a cabinet full of medals in the tasting room of their Plum Creek Winery beside U.S. 6 in Palisade. The prize they are most proud of is a gold medal from the 1992 San Francisco Fair for their 1990 Grand Mesa, a blend of merlot and cabernet franc.
Susan Phillips said people at the California competition, whose knowledge of Colorado's fledgling wineries was sketchy at best, were dumbfounded. " 'Who are these guys?' -- that's what they were saying about us," Mrs. Phillips said.
The Phillipses are both lawyers in Denver, three hours over the Rockies from Palisade. But the couple spends more than 40 extended weekends a year working at their winery and 55 acres of vineyards, helped by a dozen full-time employees and as many seasonal workers. They opened the winery in 1984 and Mr. Phillips estimated that they had invested "considerably more than $2 million" in the venture, first breaking even after seven years.
This year, he predicted, total sales of grapes and wine will be $800,000 to $900,000, but he declined to discuss profits or losses for the privately held company.
The Colorado Wine Industry Development Board expects 1998 sales of 79,000 gallons for all micro-vintners in the state, which amounts to less than 1 percent of the Colorado retail wine market, according to John Lowey, the group's executive director. The board's long-term goal is for Colorado wines to win 10 percent of the state's nine-million-gallon market.
Total sales of all wine in the United States increased from 449 million gallons in 1993 to 508 million gallons in 1996, according to the American Vintners Association.
Mr. Siegl, the president of the association, said the improving quality of wines made throughout the country had contributed to the growth of wineries by giving consumers more confidence in what they buy.
"They're getting better and better wine every time they turn around," Mr. Siegl said.
For example, in western Colorado, viniculturists say, a dry climate helps prevent vine disease; intense summer sunlight gives grapes good color and flavor, and low nighttime temperatures promote acid-retention, which is regarded as a key to premium wine making. But potential problems in Colorado include severe winter cold, which can damage vines, and late spring frosts, which can abort the budding process.
The Colorado wine board, which is financed with a small share of state taxes on wine, pays for a research station and experimental vineyard operated near Palisade by Colorado State University. Growers and wine makers say Richard A. Hamman Jr., a viniculturist who operates the research station, has helped improve the area's grape crops and wines.
Mr. Hamman said that many local wines were still mediocre. But he said the industry had the potential to expand in western Colorado, with up to 3,500 acres suitable for vineyards.
"It's not ever going to be a Napa in terms of size," he said. "But the quality -- we can make just as good a grape here as they can in California, for most varieties."
Mr. Hamman has experimented with different varieties of grapevines to find those that adapt well to the Colorado climate, and many do. But no variety resisted a cold wave in February 1989 that dropped temperatures to 23 degrees below zero and damaged most vine tissue above ground level. Colorado produced almost no grapes that year.
In seminars for growers on how to reduce winter damage, he teaches such techniques as reducing water to vines in the late summer to hasten their winter acclimation process and delaying pruning until late in the winter to leave more dormant buds in case some are damaged by winter freezing.
Many growers have installed electric wind machines, huge fans that dissipate low layers of frosty air. And Mr. Hamman is also working on an experimental spray of water, sugar and an acid taken from ground seaweed that can postpone the time when buds pop out, a precaution against late spring frosts.
Richard and Padte Turley operate Colorado's oldest and largest winery. The Turleys bought a fruit farm near Palisade in 1977 and converted orchards to vineyards in 1985. They sold grapes to Colorado Mountain vineyard, a pioneering Colorado winery that was operating in the red. In 1989, they bought the winery from its absentee owners.
"The reason I bought it is they weren't making any money, so they couldn't buy my grapes any more," Mr. Turley said.
Despite the grape crop busts in 1989 and 1991, the Turleys managed to keep the winery alive by importing grapes from California. Now called Colorado Cellars Ltd., its sales have been growing at about 10 percent a year, reaching $630,000 in 1997. The winery makes about 25,000 gallons a year, although Mr. Turley declined to discuss the company's earnings in detail.
One problem Colorado wineries have struggled with is getting Denver-based distributors interested in their wines. Mr. Turley, who worked as a distributor before buying the winery, tackled the problem by hiring a sales manager and buying a van to deliver his wine throughout Colorado. He says Colorado Cellars wines are sold at about 3,500 restaurants and liquor stores, more than half of the licensed outlets in the state.
"We're selling everything we make," he said.

HEADLINE: Religious Groups Mount a Campaign To Support Pact on Global Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The political debate on global warming, long dominated by arguments over science and economics, is spilling over into pulpits and pews as religious organizations speak out about morality, faith and the Kyoto Protocol.
Major church groups in the United States are mounting an unusually broad and active campaign to persuade the Senate to approve the protocol, an international agreement to fight climate change that was negotiated in Japan last year, leaders of the effort say. 
 Many Protestant, Greek Orthodox and Jewish groups, including black churches and some evangelicals, have joined the campaign, although Roman Catholic bishops are still considering their stance on global warming and some of the nation's more conservative Christian groups, like the Southern Baptist Convention, are not participating.
In a letter to President Clinton and the senators, 22 member churches of the National Council of Churches pledged to work for approval of the Kyoto Protocol, calling it "an important move toward protecting God's children and God's creation."
The Kyoto treaty calls on developed countries to make deep cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases like the carbon dioxide that comes from burning fossil fuels, with the United States reducing 1990 levels by 7 percent over the next 10 to 15 years.
The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, the council's general secretary, said the group wanted the climate issue to be "a litmus test for the faith community." Ms. Brown said the churches would demand that the United States lead the way on fighting global warming without requiring actions by the developing world, a condition the Senate has already set.
And in an unusual grass-roots campaign, an interfaith coalition, the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, plans to have members of the clergy and lay lobbyists focus on senators from nine states that stretch from Appalachia across the Midwest.
The states include West Virginia and Michigan, where the coal and auto industries are powerful opponents of the treaty. Some of the region's senators, like Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, both Republicans, are considered especially influential in the climate debate.
In October, the churches will bring together about 100 people in Columbus, Ohio, to coordinate the advocacy work in congregations across the region, organizers say.
"This is two parts ground swell and one part mobilization," said Paul Gorman, the executive director of the religious partnership. "This is really about the future of religious life itself."
Kim Winchell of Freeland, Mich., a medical laboratory technician who coordinates about 32 Michigan Lutheran congregations on environmental issues, said, "I plan to network, network, network and pray a lot."
Susan Harlow of Indianapolis, a seminarian who works with youth groups through the Church of Christ, said she was called to environmental causes during a course in prophetic ministry, which she defined as "speaking the hard truth, speaking out on issues that people would rather not deal with."
The Rev. Christopher Bender of the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church in Morgantown, W.Va., said his efforts on climate change "really have a long way to go."
"Given the fact that we live in West Virginia, the first step is just to get the subject on the table," Father Bender said. "Perhaps over the course of time we can also change hearts and minds."
The campaign on climate issues reflects a determination among churches in the past decade to involve the faithful more directly in matters like the disproportionate effects of pollution on poor people or the need to save endangered species.
When Pope John Paul II delivered his "Ecological Crisis" message in 1989, he said industrial nations could not demand that the third world set restrictive environmental standards without doing so first themselves.
Like other religious leaders, Catholic officials said they viewed global warming as a moral issue with profound importance for the world's poor, who stand to suffer most from disruptions to the climate. But they said it would take time for American bishops to consider where they stand on the treaty's specifics. Two committees are considering the issue.
John Carr, secretary of the department of social development at the United States Catholic Conference, said the bishops "understand there is a lot at stake here, and want to think our way through this."
At times, the convergence of religion and environmentalism has cast secular environmentalists and believers in unfamiliar roles.
At a conference last year in Santa Barbara, Calif., it was hard to say which was more notable: the pronouncement by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Eastern Orthodox Christian leader, that polluting was a sin, or the public apology by Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, for the rejection of religion by his generation of environmentalists.
Some participants said they expected resistance to the injection of morality into the climate debate.
"I don't believe that there is a consensus in the country that it is a moral issue," said Mark Jacobs, director of the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life. The coalition, which brings together 26 national Jewish organizations spanning the spectrum from Reform to Orthodox, is participating in the campaign.
"Many people don't believe we have an obligation to curtail our life style to protect future generations," Mr. Jacobs said.
The discussion in religious circles on global warming can be just as complex as the parallel debates in economic and scientific circles.
"There is considerable debate in the scientific community on the whole issue of global warming, enough to learn that working scientists are not monolithic on the question," said William Merrell, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention. "The convention itself has not taken a position, and in view of the unsettled science, it seems unlikely that we will take such a position."
The National Association of Evangelicals has also largely stayed away from environmental issues, although it is planning a conference to discuss them next March.

HEADLINE: Robert M. Luby, 88, Founder Of Regional Cafeteria Chain

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Robert M. Luby, a restaurateur who had such a down-home devotion to quality and such an accommodating string of unemployed relatives that he helped turn a small Texas cafeteria business into a $500 million chain with more than 200 restaurants in 11 states, died on Thursday at a hospital near his summer home in Colorado Springs. He was 88 and had retired as president of Luby's Cafeterias Inc. in 1971.
To say that Mr. Luby grew up on cafeteria food would be something of an understatement. Within a year after he was born in Mansfield, Mo., in 1910, his father, Harry, an Illinois-born entrepreneur who operated a men's clothing store in Springfield, had made a fateful business trip to Chicago and returned fired by the possibilities of a strange new food establishment he had encountered there. 
 Copying the Chicago operation from its name to its menu he daringly opened the New England Dairy Lunch in Springfield and promptly discovered that people there had been hankering for bargain-priced boiled vegetable dinners served buffet style from a 12-foot counter.
A family operation from the beginning (Mr. Luby's mother, Julia, planned meals and helped cook even with a toddler underfoot), the original short-counter cafeteria was so successful that a second one was opened in Springfield in 1912 and Mr. Luby's father embarked on a novel path of incremental improvements.
Concerned that patrons would resent changes, even those that improved operations, the elder Mr. Luby began the practice of selling one cafeteria, usually retaining a minority interest, while opening a new, improved version in a different town. The result was the creation of what was not so much a chain as a dotted line of a dozen cafeterias stretching from Missouri through Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana.
By the time the family and the family business reached San Antonio in 1927, Harry Luby had done well enough to retire at 39, leaving his teen-age son with a near obsession for the business he had grown up in.
During his high school years Mr. Luby did every facet of cafeteria work from serving food to washing dishes and while studying business administration at the University of Texas in Austin he took a couple of years off to open and operate a cafeteria in Corpus Christi, Tex.
After his graduation in 1934, Mr. Luby indulged in a short burst of wanderlust, opening a cafeteria in San Francisco. The city's Depression-era maritime union problems helped doom the business but not before it had brought Mr. Luby two important assets, an especially satisfied customer named Georgina Wenglein, who became his wife, and her brother, George, who was persuaded to return to Texas with Mr. Luby and join him in the cafeteria business.
By 1940 Mr. Luby had opened several cafeterias in Texas, but after the outbreak of World War II he sold out and joined the Army Air Corps, typically spending his years as an intelligence officer stationed in California and dreaming of creating a chain of cafeterias.
Teaming up with a cousin, Charles R. Johnston, he founded the modern Luby's chain in San Antonio in 1947 and began an expansion using Mr. Wenglein and other relatives as trusted managers.
When he ran out of relatives, Mr. Luby, recruited investor-managers whose 40 percent share of the profits assured that they would be as concerned about quality and efficiency as Mr. Luby was.
Although there were several long-established cafeteria chains in the South, where an appetite for a hearty, home-style meal that doesn't cost an arm and a leg is not considered as declasse as it is elsewhere, Mr. Luby's insistence on quality and attention to detail helped assure a steady expansion.
Initially operated as Cafeterias Inc., the company sold stock to the public in 1973, changed its name to Luby's Cafeterias Inc. in 1981 and gained a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1982, the year Mr. Luby stepped down as chairman of the board.
Since then, as the company he founded continued to flourish and expand (its 231 cafeterias specializing in regional favorites from grits to tamales stretch from Arizona to Florida) Mr. Luby, who became a multimillionaire providing low-cost food that even now averages just above $5 a meal, devoted himself to civic work, travel, hunting and fishing, golf and -- gourmet cooking.
Mr. Luby, twice a widower, is survived by his wife, Kathleen; a daughter from his first marriage, Martha Lahana of Littleton, Colo.; a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rogers of San Antonio, and two stepgrandchildren.

HEADLINE: Boaters' Paradise in the Bronx;
A Marina Thrives Where Warehouses Cast Shadows

SERIES: RITES OF SUMMER: On the Water

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Along a narrow creek that divides a sooty Bronx industrial park from the whooshing traffic on the Hutchinson River Parkway, where the setting sun casts shadows of warehouses and tractor-trailers, exists a seagoing community like no other.
There is Francois Guillet, the weather-beaten owner of this unlikely marina, who speaks English laden with the diction of the French Alps and dreams of retiring here. And Daniel Torrez, a former Greenwich Village shopkeeper who has built an art studio inside a ramshackle houseboat and arranges orchids on the foredeck. And "Uncle Bob," a disabled jail guard who eases his pain with beer and companionship on the deck of his motorboat, the Golden Girl.
What unites them all is a love of the water, and a willingness to see past their immediate surroundings. 
 Where some might be put off by the speeding cars on the parkway -- the nearest lane of traffic cannot be more than 250 feet from the dock -- Mr. Torrez says he tunes out the noise. "Sometimes, at night, there's hardly anyone on the highway, and you can hear the birds," he said.
Besides, the parkway's proximity has its advantages. Directly opposite the marina is a rest stop, with a gas station and a McDonald's. So boaters in need of a refill, or hungry for a hamburger and fries, simply have to paddle a rowboat a few yards across Westchester Creek.
The Bronx, the only borough of New York City that is part of the mainland United States, actually has a wealth of marinas and boaters. In addition to the dozen or so boatyards on City Island, there are several on Eastchester Bay near Throgs Neck, and one hidden away on the Hudson in Riverdale.
Mr. Guillet's 30-slip marina on Westchester Creek, Metro Marine, was built in 1957 by the late Jerry Conroy, a retired tugboat captain, said Mr. Guillet, who bought it from him 11 years ago. Even at the time, the location south of Westchester Square was an odd choice. The path of Westchester Creek was shifted slightly in the 1930's to make way for the parkway. It might have been filled in and paved over then, but for a fuel company that needed to continue receiving oil shipments by barge. So the Army Corps of Engineers dug a new path for the creek along Commerce Avenue, Mr. Guillet said.
Today, oil barges still inch up the waterway once a month or so, twice a week in winter. But over time, despite the growth of an industrial park alongside it, the creek has become more of a refuge than a commercial artery, a sort of maritime version of the community gardens, or casitas, that have sprouted on vacant lots in many neighborhoods in the Bronx.
For years, the marina has drawn police officers, schoolteachers and other working people unable or unwilling to pay the rent at more fashionable boatyards. Some are new boaters, like the criminal lawyer who received his boat, the Bandolero, as payment from a client, though a few have been coming here for more than a decade. A number live nearby, or once did.
Abraham Aviles, a self-employed insurance broker in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx, comes here after work a few days a week to go fishing for the plentiful bluefish and striped bass to be had in Long Island Sound.
"Sometimes I come at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, depending on the tides," he said. "There's nothing better. You get off work, co, the Sunrise Marina on Eastchester Bay, in 1968. His wife, Gail, was the marina's secretary. They were married in 1977.
"Fifteen years ago, boating was good," he said. "It was easier to borrow money from the bank for a boat than a car. I had a waiting list. I had to refuse customers."
So Mr. Guillet bought the marina on Westchester Creek as a low-rent option for his overflow business. (The seasonal rent now is about $800 for a 25-foot boat, less than half what some marinas charge on City Island.) But the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's dropped the bottom out of the boating business, he said. Today, he supplements his scant profits from the two boatyards with his earnings as a barge captain, providing a floating crane that is used in bridge inspections throughout the metropolitan area.
Soon, he says, he will sell the Sunrise Marina. He and his wife are making a home of an old three-story building that overlooks the marina on Westchester Creek. Although his wife, who was raised in the Bronx, says she has been begging to leave the borough for years, Mr. Guillet says they will retire here.
"I love it," he says, his face lighting up through sweat and filth and a full gray beard. "I don't see a building in front of me here. I'm not blocked in. I'm never crowded, like those people who live in those apartment buildings, on top of each other, in New York.
"Nobody wants to buy this," he added. "There's not that much income. It's a way of life -- like a fisherman, or a farmer. Every boat is like a cow, you know? You pull the boats like cows."
As the sun sets, Mr. Guillet takes up a blowtorch and sets to work on the steel frame for his second-story deck. His son, 7-year-old Pierre, fishes for horseshoe crabs under the dock.
At the other end of the boatyard, Mr. Guillet's right-hand-man, the ever-barechested Bonifacio Santos, has ended his day of repairs and maintenance. Mr. Santos, a Spaniard from the Canary Islands who was a dynamiter before coming to the Bronx in 1988, retreats to the trailer where he and his young wife, Tamika, live with their two sons. Their infant, naked in her arms, watches as three young puppies romp among the stray pieces of outboard motors and battered hulls.
Amid all this, the untimely cock-a-doodle-doo of a rooster hunting for food -- its feathers resplendent in red, gold and blue -- hardly seems unusual. Three hungry hens, in fact, plainly ignore it.

HEADLINE: TRACKING BAGHDAD'S ARSENAL: THE DIPLOMACY;
U.S. Urged Arms Monitor to Back Off From Clash With Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The United States and Britain urged Richard Butler, the chairman of the United Nations arms inspectors, not to have a confrontation with Iraq by trying to hold a surprise inspection after Baghdad suspended cooperation with the inspectors earlier this month, senior American and British officials said today.
The officials were responding to a Washington Post report today about private American discussions with Mr. Butler and his decision to drop plans for the inspections. 
 Until Baghdad broke off cooperation with inspectors on Aug. 3, these officials said, they had supported Mr. Butler's plans to hold surprise inspections at two sites that promised new information about Iraq's chemical, biological and missile programs. Mr. Butler had brought the necessary inspectors to Iraq when he arrived on Aug. 2, intending to go ahead with the inspections.
But on Aug. 3, once Iraq broke its February agreement with the Security Council and the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to cooperate fully with the inspectors, the officials said, they did urge caution on Mr. Butler. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright sent word to Mr. Butler that she wished to speak to him. After leaving Baghdad, Mr. Butler traveled to Bahrain, where he could talk to her on a secure line in the American Embassy.
The officials said that they were not eager to rush into a "precipitate confrontation" with Iraq that would focus on Mr. Butler instead of Iraq's breach of its promise to the Security Council and Mr. Annan. Nor did they want another military crisis with Iraq on Baghdad's timetable, before Washington could prepare the political and diplomatic ground.
"A confrontation on the ground in Iraq may prove a point, but it doesn't get you closer to what you want to accomplish, which is to help Unscom do what it needs to do," a senior Administration official said, referring to the United Nations Special Commission on arms inspections. "By keeping the focus on what Iraq has done, which is to suspend inspections, rather than on what Butler does, allows no country on the Security Council to contend, as some have done over the last six months, that Unscom and Butler have provoked Iraq."
At a news conference today, Ms. Albright denied reports that she had been urging Mr. Butler, the chairman of the commission, for months to avoid confrontations with Iraq.
"We have had no change in our policy," said Ms. Albright. "We support Unscom in its inspections and fully support Unscom's right to decide where, when and how it conducts its inspections." She added: "I do not tell Chairman Butler what to do. There should be absolutely no doubt that the United States wants to see Unscom succeed."
She was responding to news reports, also broadcast on NBC Nightly News on Thursday night, that Washington and London had tried, over a period of months, to dissuade Mr. Butler from carrying out surprise inspections in Iraq in order to avoid a new crisis with Baghdad. The reports cited officials concerned that Washington and London were undermining Unscom and arms control, a concern expressed regularly by some Unscom officials.
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, emphasized that although Mr. Butler takes advice from the Security Council, he makes all operational decisions on whether to make an inspection or not.
"That is not our role," Mr. McCurry said. Asked whether American officials had suggested that certain inspections be delayed or stopped, Mr. McCurry said: "We consulted with them about the best way to conduct their mission -- timing, outcomes, best way of achieving their mission. But we don't order them not to conduct missions."
Unscom itself issued a news release saying "the allegations are false." The statement denied that Mr. Butler "has been given or accepted external direction with respect to operational activities" of the commission and said he would "find it invidious were any attempt made to direct his operational decisions or to micromanage the day-to-day work of the Special Commission."
According to the Post account, sometime in mid-July Mr. Butler met with Peter Burleigh, the second-ranking American delegate to the United Nations. Mr. Burleigh read Mr. Butler a list of American questions about the planned raids. While Mr. Burleigh stressed that the decision was Mr. Butler's, he left Mr. Butler, the Post said, "with the plain understanding that the United States did not support his plan."
A senior American official, after having read the guidance Mr. Burleigh read to Mr. Butler, disputed the account, saying that the questions had sought information about what Mr. Butler planned, and that Mr. Burleigh had begun and ended the meeting with a statement of support for Mr. Butler and his work.
Mr. Butler intended to go ahead with the inspections, British, American and United Nations officials said today. It was only after Baghdad "pulled the plug" on Aug. 3 that Washington and London suggested that he avoid new inspections that Baghdad was going to block anyway, and that he take up Iraq's breaking of its promises with the Security Council first.
Mr. Butler then made the tactical decision to pull out the inspectors, the officials insisted. One senior official said that Washington had expected Iraq to pull the plug on Mr. Butler closer to October, when economic sanctions are up for review. One reason, the official suggested, might have been leaks to Baghdad about Mr. Butler's inspection plans.
Today, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the New York Republican chairman of the House International Relations Committee, wrote Ms. Albright to ask for a copy of Mr. Burleigh's talking points, "as well as similar talking points used by other Administration officials," including herself, in talks with Mr. Butler.
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, wrote Mr. Clinton urging him to clarify Iraq policy and reaffirm his commitment to eradicating Iraqi weapons.
The officials insisted that Unscom had been making progress and had held as many as 10 surprise inspections, which included one at Air Force headquarters that produced a document leading to the discovery of Iraq's production of VX nerve gas for missiles, which Iraq had denied. "We have been the most consistent and forceful proponent of Unscom's right to conduct challenge inspections and to have full access when and where it chooses," a senior American official said.
The officials said the burden was now on Mr. Annan and the Security Council to get Iraq to keep its word. "The fault here clearly lies with Baghdad and not with Butler," one official said. "There's only one place to point the finger. It strengthens our hand in the Security Council, it shows the region that Washington is flexible and not eager to strike militarily at Iraq, and it lays the foundation for military action if necessary, while giving Saddam a chance to fold first in the face of a truly united Security Council."

HEADLINE: In July, Industrial Production Fell for2d Consecutive Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Industrial production declined in July for the second consecutive month as manufacturers struggled to overcome sluggish Asian demand and the General Motors strikes cut auto and truck output by 20 percent. Inflation remained tame at the producer level.
The Federal Reserve said today that production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell six-tenths of 1 percent in July, on the heels of a 1.1 percent drop in June. However, excluding the output of automobiles and auto parts, production rose one-tenth of 1 percent last month, in contrast to a decrease of four-tenths of 1 percent in June. 
 Analysts said the decline in total production would probably be short-lived. "In the second half of the year, a less severe Asian impact and an end to the G.M. strike should place production back on a healthy growth path," said Greg Jones, an economist at Briefing.com in Jackson, Wyo.
In a second economic report today, the Labor Department said producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July after having fallen one-tenth of 1 percent in June. Prices were pushed higher last month by the end of sales incentives offered by auto makers and a jump in electricity prices during the nation's recent heat wave. Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
Other indicators released today showed the automobile industry's impact on the economy in recent months. A 3 percent decline in retail stocks of autos during June, when auto companies reported record sales, held business inventories to an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent in the month, the Commerce Department said. In May, there had been no change in the level of inventories.
And the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to 104.5 this month from 105.2 in July.
The strikes, which started June 5 and were settled at the end of July, took an expected toll on industrial production. Production at factories alone fell seven-tenths of 1 percent last month.
Production of durable goods apart from automobiles and parts increased 1.1 percent in July, following a 1.3 percent decline in June. Output of computers and office equipment rose 3.1 percent.
With the walkouts over, manufacturing activity is likely to rebound in August and September. General Motors, the world's largest auto maker, has stepped up production.
"We're going to see a big bounce back as G.M. comes back onstream," said Elliott Platt, chief economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
That does not necessarily mean a return to the robust growth of earlier this year, however. Although the shutdown of most General Motors assembly plants, and the closing of many of their suppliers, was the main reason for the slowdown in industrial production, the output of clothing, chemicals and paper was also sluggish because of weak Asian demand.
The Fed also reported that the plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, fell to 80.5 percent in July from 81.2 percent during June. While the General Mortors strikes accounted for some of the decline, it was also a sign of slack demand and a signal of slower growth ahead, said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers.
That fits the expectation of Federal Reserve policy makers, who meet next week to discuss whether to adjust interest rates. Slower growth would reduce the chance of an acceleration in inflation.
The producer price report raised no inflation warning flags, analysts said. The core producer price rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in July, following an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in June.
The end of sales incentives pushed auto prices up eight-tenths of 1 percent in July. Analysts had expected the increase and dismissed its impact on the economy.
There were some isolated trouble spots in the price report. Energy prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, bolstered by a 1.1 percent gain in residential electric power costs and a gain of four-tenths of 1 percent in the price of residential natural gas.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Yearling Market Booms At Auction at Saratoga

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Aug. 14

 BODY:
Leaders of the troubled racing industry, gathering today for their midsummer Round Table conference here, were greeted by news that at least one market was thriving: the market for young horses.
At the annual Saratoga auction of selected yearlings this week, the average price reached $211,395, a gain of 15 percent over last year. The sales grossed $34 million, a gain of 24 percent over last year. And the highest price paid for a horse this week was $1.7 million for a Storm Cat filly, the fourth-highest price for a filly in the history of the Fasig-Tipton auction house. 
 "Despite whatever jitters there may be in the equities market," said D. G. Van Clief Jr., chairman of Fasig-Tipton, "the market for good thoroughbreds is solid."
The president of the auction house, Walt Robinson, said a gain had been expected. "Right now, our world is good, and the game was here," he said. "I'd hoped for a $200,000 average. I think we had better horses and a better market."
The pricey filly was sold last Tuesday, the opening night of the auction, when the first of the yearlings was led into the sales ring and the auctioneer began prompting bids in the time-honored chant used by old-fashioned tobacco auctioneers. It was apparent that the slump of the early years of the decade was a thing of the past, and that money from England, the Middle East and Japan was still funneling into the market despite economic troubles in many parts of the world. The Storm Cat filly who fetched the week's highest price was bought by Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia.
On closing night, Thursday, nobody surpassed the week's high bid, but a Summer Squall colt out of a Gulch mare brought the session's top price of $835,000. The buyer was Mrs. Milton J. Dance, the seller Lane's End Farm. The underbidder was Rick Pitino, coach of the Boston Celtics, who is active in horse racing.
The horse market began slumping about 10 years ago, when the excesses and record prices of the 1980's were deflated chiefly by changes in the tax laws that adversely affected the breeding business. But as the American economy grew stronger, racing purses grew bigger and foreign money started pouring into the breeding market, notably from Saudi Arabian and Japanese investors seeking to strengthen their bloodstock lines.
The turnaround took hold, gained major momentum in July when the Keeneland sale of select 2-year-olds set records and carried over this week to Saratoga.
 
FINISH LINES
Auntie Mame, a 4-year-old Theatrical filly, won her second straight stakes and her ninth race in 14 starts over all when she took the Glens Falls Handicap by seven lengths. The filly, trained by ANGEL PENNA JR., stalked the leaders into the homestretch, when she made her move. The French filly Yvecrique ran second, Makethemostofit third and Schemozzle, fifth. The winner ran the mile and three-eighths on the turf in 2:13 and paid $4.60 for a $2 bet to win. . . . Nine horses were entered in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar in California on Saturday, all carrying 124 pounds. They do not include Skip Away or Silver Charm, but do include Gentlemen and Puerto Madero, an entry trained by RICHARD MANDELLA, and Free House and Touch Gold, two stars of last year's Triple Crown series.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Treasury Rally Surges Ahead While Stocks Continue Slump

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury rates fell to their lowest level in 30 years yesterday, but the stock market's increasingly painful slide continued.
The drop in yields and the decline in stocks could both be traced to the economic crisis in Asia and the financial turmoil in Russia, and the uncertainty they have fostered among American investors. 
 With yesterday's slump, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks is now down more than 10 percent from its high, the Wall Street definition of a correction. The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology stocks, and the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks have already fallen more than 10 percent. And the Dow Jones industrial average is just points away.
But even the weak performance reflected in these indexes hides the damage in the broader market and the pain that many investors have been feeling. According to Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market are down an average of 35 percent from their 52-week highs. Twenty-five percent of the stocks are down 50 percent or more.
"When you look at the troops instead of the generals, you are in a bear market," said Thomas M. Galvin, Donaldson, Lufkin's chief investment officer and an analyst who expects the market to recover in the fall. "And the question is how long will it persist."
While stocks are tumbling, the Treasury market is rallying, and for some that is not a positive signal. For most of the last three and half years, the bond market and the stock market have moved in the same direction, responding to the positives of low inflation and strong earnings.
"When you see stocks down and bonds up, the message is there is a problem ahead for the economy," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
Stocks have been hurt as the economic drag from Asia reduces the corporate earnings that investors watch so closely. And each new company that now warns of lower earnings, as the Ciena Corporation did yesterday, has a bigger impact.
Asia is also slowing growth here and around the world. In addition, the drop in demand for important commodities like oil and copper is helping keep inflation low. Both of these trends -- and the millions of investors who are looking for a haven for their money -- is helping bonds and is likely to push long-term rates even lower in the months ahead, several analysts said.
"The predominant underlying fundamentals of a slowing world economy and lower inflation are the real drivers that are going to be here next month and the month after that," said Dan Lokoszka, portfolio manager, global fixed income, at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished at 5.54 percent, down from 5.59 percent on Thursday and down from the previous low of 5.58 percent on June 15. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 29/32 , to 99 15/32 . The yield on the 10-year note, which is a benchmark for mortgages, fell to 5.39, from 5.44 on Thursday, but it is still above its low of 5.35 percent on June 15. The interest rate on 30-year mortgages has been below 7 percent for eight weeks.
The trend toward slower growth because of Asia, said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, should keep Federal Reserve policy makers on hold when they meet next week.
Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said he was working on scaling down his growth forecast for the second half of the year. "Big pockets of the world economy are deteriorating around us," he said, adding that the yield on the 30-year bond could now move into a range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent.
In the stock market, the Dow fell 34.50 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 8,425, and is just 20 points away from a 10 percent correction. The Dow had shot up almost 100 points at the opening, in part because of a small rebound in the Russian markets and talks between Russian officials and the United States and other countries about more aid.
In addition, Hong Kong officials announced they had bought stocks to shore up that country's troubled market. Rumors of the announcement, which was made after the market closed, helped send the Hang Seng index up 8.5 percent.
But the Dow lost its gains in the afternoon and would have been down even more except that the stock of J. P. Morgan, which was once again the subject of new takeover speculation, jumped 8.2 percent, adding about 38 points to the Dow.
The S.& P. index dropped 12.16 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,062.75 and is now down 10.4 percent from its high of 1,186.75. The Nasdaq index fell 12.35 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,790.19 and is off 11.1 percent from its high. The Russell index fell 1.04 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 402.79. It is down 18 percent from its high and is off 7.8 percent for the year. The other major indexes are still up for the year: the Dow, 6.5 percent; the S.& P., 9.5 percent, and the Nasdaq, 14 percent.
The question now is will and when the retail investor, who has kept the bull market going in past downturns by buying on the dips, step in again. Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said investors are "having a hard time looking to September," when she thinks that the outlook for earnings and the economy will look much better than it does now.
Asia and the Clinton investigation are "dominating out lives right now," Mr. Galvin said. "Speculation is rampant and the only news is bad news."

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
With Russia facing financial turmoil, Asia sinking deeper into recession, the President fighting for his political life and the stock market swooning, the blindingly bright economic picture of the last couple of years suddenly looks murkier.
What makes things a bit scary is that the economy has already shifted into slower gear, and slowdowns -- which make it harder for businesses and consumers to shrug off random blows -- have a way of turning into recessions. "Things can pile up," said June O'Neill, director of the Congressional Budget Office. "They can unravel as quickly as they materialize." 
 But the economy is not likely to unravel anytime soon. Forecasters are counting on low inflation, falling interest rates and confident consumers to keep growth going in the year's second half. They are taking in stride last month's news about a slide in everything from industrial production to retail sales -- all made worse by the General Motors strike.
In fact, a slowdown, they say, is just what the doctor ordered. "The domestic economy is still very sound," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. "I see it moderating from a robust to a sustainable pace."
The Blue Chip consensus of 50 economic forecasters sees growth just shy of a 2.4 percent annual rate for the second half of the year and more of the same next year. That would not be as heady as the average 4 percent growth rate of last year and earlier this year. But it is considered fast enough to keep unemployment near its 28-year low of 4.5 percent, without being so fast as to intensify inflationary pressures or invite interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
Not a single Blue Chip economist sees a recession beginning in the second half. "Asia has slowed the economy," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, "but its only intrinsic problem is a shortage of workers."
Still, the risks to this essentially benign outlook are numerous and real, economists acknowledge. A disaster in one area or a combination of mini- disasters could darken the economic picture. Apart from bolts from the blue like a military confrontation with Iraq or natural disasters, Asia's woes could worsen sharply, reducing United States exports still further, deepening the downturn in manufacturing and hammering corporate profits.
The political crisis surrounding the Presidency could sap the economy, just as, in some analysts' eyes, Watergate may have deepened and prolonged the severe recession of 1973-75. Finally, a stock market rout could shake consumers' confidence and wreak havoc on household balance sheets, causing spending to collapse and inventories to pile up. In 1990 Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait and surging oil prices frightened consumers badly enough to tip the economy into recession.
Like the special effects in the movie "Armageddon," the nasty hypothetical possibilities are so palpable that it is easy to forget the economy's strengths. Momentum, for example. Sturdy consumer and business spending will probably offset a further deterioration in the trade deficit, a decline already built into most forecasts for the second half. The side effects of the Asian crisis -- the stronger dollar, lower interest rates and cheaper raw materials -- are actually bolstering the purchasing power of American consumers and businesses and lifting the profits of many companies in finance, transportation, services and consumer goods.
Analogies between President Clinton's troubles and Watergate fail to take into account the impact of Richard M. Nixon's economic policies and his bad economic luck, as Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at the American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation, points out. Long before Mr. Nixon resigned the Presidency in August 1974, inflation was spiraling out of control, the dollar was sliding and oil prices were soaring.
While a sudden, sharp stock market decline -- two or three times the 10 percent drop that several indexes have now taken from their recent highs -- would almost certainly affect consumers, there is no reason to believe they would head for the hills, especially since the Federal Reserve would surely push interest rates down to cushion the blow and encourage spending.
Though the fallout from the recently settled G.M. strike has made it hard to see clearly, consumers and businesses are still spending at a steady pace.
Business investment, which surged at a 26 percent annual rate in the year's first half, is bound to slow, but not necessarily to a crawl. Total corporate profits have flattened in recent quarters as companies in such fields as high technology, energy and machinery have seen sharp declines. Still, many companies in the service sector are still enjoying double-digit gains. Overall profit margins remain close to historic highs. Productivity is up nearly 2 percent from a year ago, and wage costs, while drifting higher, show no signs of taking off. Cash flow -- a measure of businesses' ability to finance capital spending -- is strong. "The fundamentals for capital spending are still pretty good," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
Barring a sudden collapse in demand, there is little reason to expect that business will stop replenishing inventories. Stockpiles look fairly lean relative to sales. Much of last winter's big pileup, when inventory accumulation hit a record $91 billion, has already been whittled away.
As with business spending, consumer spending, which spurted at a torrid 6 percent annual rate in the first half, is bound to moderate. But the latest readings from the nation's malls show that sales of big-ticket items other than cars were up smartly in June. Consumers are not stinting on services either; so many consumers are traveling that airlines are once again raising fares, for example.
With consumer net worth $12 trillion higher than just four years ago, courtesy of the stock market, and consumers more willing to use their capital gains than ever before, consumers have been spending virtually everything they make and saving almost nothing. But newfound wealth has not been the main prop of spending; jobs are still plentiful and incomes are rising much faster than inflation.
So far, consumers have not been spooked by the latest stock market gyrations. Confidence, which is close to historic highs, seems to depend more on such factors as inflation, interest rates and, most of all, job growth, says Richard Curtin, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan. To the extent that consumers worry about the Asian crisis, he said, it is because they fear that it will result in layoffs.
Besides, the long run-up in stock prices has dwarfed the recent declines, leaving consumers with strong gains.
"Consumers will impart a degree of stability to the economy that wouldn't be there if they reacted like traders," Mr. Curtin said.
At the end of the day, a lot of economists' confidence in the economy reflects today's low inflation and zero budget deficits, which leave policy makers considerable maneuvering room.
"In a low-inflation environment, you have great flexibility for the Federal Reserve to counter an excessively weak economy," points out Mr. Rippe of Prudential Securities. During the economic slowdown in 1995, for example, the Fed eased three times, and the economy rebounded.

HEADLINE: Cottage Tenants Settle With Developers

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The cottagers are leaving their cottages.
Five elderly tenants who have battled developers' efforts to build a 31-story condominium tower on the site of their Regency-style one-bedroom apartments have agreed to accept a settlement and move out of their Upper East Side enclave by the end of the month. 
 The parties to the settlement have signed a confidentiality agreement, and declined to disclose the amount paid by the developers, a joint venture of Davis & Partners and RFR Holding. But Leslie L. Youngblood, one of the tenants of the so-called Cottages -- a snatch of countryside in the midst of Manhattan, along Third Avenue between 77th and 78th Streets -- called the settlement "sizable."
A year ago, Mr. Youngblood, a 78-year-old retired lieutenant commander in the Navy, said that if the developers wanted to settle, it would take "a lot more money than they think it will."
"And it did," he said Wednesday night.
In April, he had said that if the developers offered a million dollars to each renter, and paid moving expenses, "it would be silly to say I'd never take the money."
"But I'll be perfectly frank," he said the other night. "I don't give a damn how much money they had offered us. None of us would ever have left if our lawyer hadn't told us our chances of stopping this development were almost nil."
While they pack, the legal drama drags on.
Just this week, a judge refused to grant a group of tenants at 177 East 77th Street -- a rental building that overlooks the courtyard of the Cottages and is owned by the same developers -- a temporary restraining order to block development pending the outcome of a lawsuit the group filed this week against the city. The suit seeks to force the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold a public hearing on preserving the Cottages. The commission has brought the matter before its designation committee -- consisting of commissioners and staff members -- five times in three mayoral administrations and has decided each time against holding a hearing.
The 77th Street group and hundreds of supporters, known as the Coalition to Save the Cottages and Garden, are also waiting to see what the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal will do about an application by the developers that would allow them to alter the area of the courtyard garden to build their tower. The tenants are fighting the application, contending that the garden is part of what they pay rent for and that the developers will reduce its size. The developers maintain that they will merely reconfigure the stone paths and greenery.
Though either battle could conceivably stop the project, several of the participants say privately that each effort is a long shot. In his remarks in denying the temporary restraining order, Judge Franklin R. Weissberg told the coalition's lawyer, Richard D. Emery, that he had "a hard row to hoe."
Even Deborah Valcourt, a spokeswoman for the coalition, who lives at 177 East 77th Street, said she had heard that the odds were against stopping construction.
"But, hey, something often comes from the most unlikely places," she said. "Something might come along that changes the whole ball game."
The five cottagers, all rent-regulated tenants paying between $225 and $1,650 a month, are going their separate ways. One, Ruth Berns, 82, has found a one-bedroom co-op apartment and is waiting to be approved by the board, her neighbors said. Another, Elizabeth Pratt Holthusen, 87, has rented a place in the neighborhood. Rue Faris Drew, 76, is still looking. "The prices are horrendous," she said. The developers have offered to put the tenants up in a luxury hotel for 45 days if they have not found new homes by the end of the month.
Mr. Youngblood has picked out a one-bedroom rental in the neighborhood; because it is a sublease in a co-op building, he, too, is awaiting board approval. In the meantime, he is packing up the glossy photograph of himself as a young lieutenant commander just leaving for Korea, as well as the framed photographs of his boats, his friends and his family. He is putting them in square cardboard boxes and piling them along one side of his bed -- the big bed with the ship-motif wallpaper behind it.
To the tenants who agreed to be interviewed, the move is a wrenching one. Each has lived in the unusual enclave -- with its glass-block, vaguely Moderne shopfronts on Third Avenue and its Regency-style mini-villas facing the elaborate private garden in back -- for more than 25 years.
"It's heartbreaking," Ms. Drew said. "To me, the Cottages represents a kind of force field -- it wants to stay as it is. And I realize that my house is part of my identity."
To Mr. Youngblood, who on Wednesday was sporting bold red knee socks and khaki shorts, the move is a traumatic one.
"I feel it like the other ones," he confided over tea in his dining room. "But you know, I'm supposed to be macho. I'm not supposed to cry."

HEADLINE: Chalmers Wylie, G.O.P. Stalwart in House, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Chalmers P. Wylie, who represented Ohio for 26 years in the House and helped to win approval of the Federal bailout of the savings-and-loan industry, died today in Columbus, Ohio. He was 77.
Mr. Wylie had a heart attack while waiting to have a routine eye examination at Ohio State University Medical Center, the center announced. 
 As the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee, Mr. Wylie helped to tailor President Bush's plan to rescue the savings-and-loan industry so it could gain support in the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Although the precise causes and costs are still in doubt, there is widespread agreement that many members of the industry went astray in the 1980's, an era of relaxed regulation and high-flying finance, and plunged into risky investments outside their original mission of providing home mortgages.
When a deep real estate slump, undependable interest rates, hard times in the oil industry and other factors slowed the economy, the savings-and-loan industry was in big trouble, and since its deposits were federally insured it was certain that taxpayers would be left holding the bag. The total cost of the bailout, stretched over many years, has been estimated into the hundreds of billions of dollars.
Mr. Wylie, along with a Republican ally on the Banking Committee, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, helped to win initial financing for the bailout in 1989 and renewed financing for several more years.
Mr. Wylie was able to work with lawmakers of both parties, The Almanac of American Politics said, because he was, basically, "a pleasant man."
He was also, by some standards, a proudly old-fashioned one. In 1984, Mr. Wylie, a Methodist, opposed giving Federal money to the Library of Congress so it could produce a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. The magazine featured "wanton and illicit sex," he said.
Mr. Wylie's district encompassed much of Columbus, including some of its black population, white working-class and rural areas, and the Ohio State neighborhood. Throughout his career, The Almanac of American Politics said in its 1988 edition, Mr. Wylie blended impulses that were "standard Republican" with political instincts that were "entirely practical, not theoretical."
Mr. Wylie was first elected to Congress in 1966, and his re-elections were often landslide victories. His worst showing was in 1990, when he won 59 percent of the vote against a relative unknown.
He strongly supported veterans' benefits, military spending and a law against desecration of the American flag. His stands on issues were dependably heartland Republican.
But a scandal involving the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Ronald Reagan Administration distressed him, and he said so. The scandal involved former Reagan Administration officials who were paid large fees by developers seeking housing funds from H.U.D.
"My visceral reaction is that the fees paid were not appropriate," he said. Official inquiries would prove him right.
Chalmers Wylie was born in Norwich, Ohio, on Nov. 23, 1920. He attended Otterbein College and Ohio State and graduated from Harvard Law School.
Mr. Wylie enlisted in the Army in 1943 and rose to the rank of first lieutenant, serving with the 30th Infantry Division in France, Belgium and Germany. He was awarded a Silver Star for helping to evacuate wounded men from a mine field under enemy fire near the Rhine River in 1945. He was also awarded a Bronze Star, the French Croix de Guerre and the Purple Heart, for being wounded by artillery fire while helping to rescue wounded soldiers.
Before going to Congress, Mr. Wylie was the City Attorney for Columbus, an assistant Ohio attorney general and a member of the State Legislature.
Just before he retired from Congress in 1992, Mr. Wylie was one of more than 350 members who were hurt by disclosures that they had overdrawn their accounts on numerous occasions in the House's private bank. Although the overdrafts were simply covered by the deposits of other members, and there was no loss of taxpayer money, public surveys showed that many people thought erroneously that the offending representatives had "bounced" checks.
Upon his retirement Mr. Wylie said, "There is an ugliness in the House now which does not appeal to me." He practiced law in Columbus until his death.
Surviving are his wife, Marjorie Ann; a son, Bradley, and a daughter, Jacquelyn Poston, both of the Columbus area; three sisters, Ramona Wylie and Georgia Miller, both of Columbus, and Opal Bailey of Florida, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: TRACKING BAGHDAD'S ARSENAL: INSIDE THE ARSENAL: A special report.;
Defector Describes Iraq's Atom Bomb Push

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER and JAMES RISEN 

 BODY:
An Iraqi scientist who defected to the United States has publicly described for the first time the inner workings of Iraq's three-decade effort to build a nuclear bomb.
The scientist, Khidhir Abdul Abas Hamza, said that before he fled Iraq in 1994, he helped train a cadre of young scientists who with other scientists still working together on other projects would be capable of quickly resuming Iraq's atomic weapons program if the United Nations cut back on its inspections and, ultimately, lifted economic sanctions. 
 Dr. Hamza is the highest-ranking scientist ever to defect from Baghdad, and his comments, in nearly 10 hours of interviews, come as a new confrontation is building over whether Baghdad has dismantled its chemical, nuclear and biological programs. Iraq has in recent days refused to cooperate further with United Nations weapons inspectors.
In the interviews, the 59-year old Dr. Hamza, whose defection was an important intelligence coup for the United States that nearly slipped through American fingers because of the Central Intelligence Agency's inattention, drew a chilling picture of life as an Iraqi scientist. He said his colleagues were lavishly rewarded for their successes and tortured by the secret police when they failed to deliver.
He said Iraq's nuclear weapons program was personally directed from its inception 27 years ago by Saddam Hussein, Iraq's leader. It was abetted, he said, by a host of Western companies, which sold Iraq sophisticated equipment as they "winked and laughed" at patently false cover stories.
On the eve of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Dr. Hamza said, Iraq had completed all the research and testing needed for an atomic weapon and was feverishly trying to make at least one crude bomb that would use uranium from its civilian reactors. This effort, Dr. Hamza said, could have produced a bomb in a few months, but it was disrupted by the allied bombing campaign.
Only after the war did American intelligence officials learn that they had grossly underestimated Iraq's nuclear program, which they believed to be 10 years from producing a nuclear bomb. But Dr. Hamza's defection to the United States and his subsequent debriefing by the C.I.A. brought fresh details to light, including these:
Iraq's peaceful nuclear power program, begun 30 years ago, was quickly turned into a cover for the secret bomb program, which went ahead even as Baghdad opened up its research reactors to Western inspection.
*Israel's intensive campaign in the 1970's and 80's to stop Iraq from acquiring a bomb accomplished little. The 1981 Israeli bombing raid that destroyed Iraq's French-built Osirak nuclear reactor prompted President Hussein to drop the pretense of a peaceful atomic effort and to go "full steam" on a covert program to build a bomb.
*Iraq took advantage of this country's open access to valuable scientific information. Dr. Hamza said that as a senior member of Iraq's nuclear program, he spent time at American university libraries studying the latest scientific journals and technical accounts of America's nuclear efforts.
Dr. Hamza, who intelligence officials said had been resettled here by the C.I.A., said he was speaking out now because he was frustrated that Mr. Hussein is still obstructing international inspections and deceiving the West. American officials said they did not authorize or encourage Dr. Hamza to speak publicly, but they have confirmed many elements of his account.
Until now, Dr. Hamza's defection has been a closely guarded secret. A 1995 article in The Sunday Times of London and a 1997 book by Andrew and Leslie Cockburn included detailed accounts of his alleged kidnapping and assassination by secret Iraqi agents.
In fact, his escape from Iraq is a remarkable spy yarn that almost went awry. According to former and current intelligence officials, the C.I.A. initially rebuffed Dr. Hamza's appeals to defect to the United States. He spent a year in Libya before the agency realized its mistake and agreed to resettle him and rescue his family from their home in downtown Baghdad.
 
Nuclear Ambitions
He Helped Start Secret Arms Program
Born in southern Iraq in a family of Shiite Muslims, Dr. Hamza graduated from Baghdad University and studied physics in the early 1960's at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Florida State University. After teaching briefly at Florida State and a small college in Georgia, Dr. Hamza returned home in 1970.
He became chairman of the physics department of Iraq's tiny nuclear research center outside Baghdad, and was approached a year later by two envoys from Mr. Hussein, then Iraq's Vice President but already its de facto ruler.
He said they had asked him to help start a secret nuclear weapons program under the cover of an expanded civilian atomic energy program. Dr. Hamza said that though he had reservations about building a nuclear bomb, he was enticed by the promise of extra money and stature as well as the possibility that the civilian program might benefit.
A round of recent public hangings in Baghdad, he said, underscored the dangers of refusing such a request.
In 1972, Dr. Hamza submitted to Mr. Hussein Iraq's first comprehensive plan for developing nuclear weapons -- naming it the "Hussein plan." "We didn't know then that Saddam hated his father and his father's name," Dr. Hamza sheepishly recalled.
The plan was quickly adopted, although Mr. Hussein rejected Dr. Hamza's ambitious proposals for a separate nuclear city and lavish benefits for its scientists. The Iraqi leader, he said, "thought that a separate atomic city would be too tempting a target for Iraq's enemies."
At first, Dr. Hamza dealt with the leader through intermediaries. But in 1973, he finally met his boss -- a volcanic encounter. During a visit to the nuclear center, Mr. Hussein berated Dr. Hamza, his chief planner, in front of his colleagues for failing to use frames to display photographs of famous scientists on the office wall.
"The man was basically illiterate," Dr. Hamza said of Mr. Hussein. "But here he was complaining about our insufficient respect for great minds. I knew what he was doing: Saddam had to establish his authority by putting the man who had made the plan in his place."
Mr. Hussein tightened his grip over the growing nuclear program in 1974, Dr. Hamza said, secretly naming himself chairman of the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission -- a fact that Iraq has denied to United Nations inspectors. He also began controlling every aspect of the scientists' lives, ordering them to divorce foreign wives and marry Iraqi women, while forcing them to report any contact with foreigners.
Scientists ignored such orders at their peril. In January 1980, Mr. Hussein had Iraq's most senior nuclear scientist, Jaafar D. Jaafar , jailed and tortured until he agreed to work on an enrichment program that would separate uranium particles and make bomb-grade fuel. "Jaafar was so badly beaten that he still jumps out of his chair at the slightest scare," Dr. Hamza said.
 
Help From Abroad
Easy Purchases From Several Nations
Dr. Hamza said he found it surprisingly easy to negotiate nuclear cooperation agreements with the former Soviet Union, India, Brazil, France and others to buy nuclear technology that could be used for bombs under peaceful cover. "If you go with the money and some brains, it's easy to acquire the stuff," he said.
Among other things, Iraq bought a French reactor and an Italian fuel reprocessing facility, an I.B.M. mainframe computer from the United States, and machine tools to make centrifuge components from the Swiss. In 1987 it almost bought for between $110 million and $120 million a complete foundry to forge uranium and other bomb-related components from Leybold and Degussa, two West German companies.
Dr. Hamza, who monitored the negotiations in Germany from a room next door to the meeting, said the companies had offered to supply not only the foundry, but for $200 million, a complete installation that they promised could be built within months.
He said Mr. Hussein rejected the tempting offer mainly because he feared that such a large deal involving highly sensitive equipment would have tipped off Western intelligence that Iraq was transferring its bomb effort to a new site, known as Al Atheer.
"But we were astonished to see that the companies were actually helping us find cover stories for some of the equipment we needed," Dr. Hamza recalled.
Dr. Jorg Streitferdt, in-house counsel for Degussa, A.G., based in Frankfurt, Germany, which owned Leybold at the time, said the companies did sell some equipment that ended up in Iraq's nuclear program, and were later subjected to a series of investigations, including a criminal inquiry by Germany.
He noted that the Degussa was exonerated on the charges of selling Iraq vacuum furnaces largely because West Germany did not require export licenses at that time for such sales. Though the Degussa executives suspected that Iraq might use the equipment for military purposes given the ongoing Iran-Iraq war, he added, they did not know that Iraq wanted it for a nuclear program.
"DeGussa and Leybold did not know what the equipment was for," Dr. Streitferdt said. "The whole world did not know what Iraq was about to do. We have learned our lesson and now have very tough internal controls on our exports."
Years before Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait turned the country into an international pariah, many of its nuclear-related purchases were made with the blessing of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' atomic energy monitors. The agency assumed that Iraq was amassing the technical know-how for a peaceful power program, and did little to investigate. The inspectors, Dr. Hamza said, never asked even basic questions, "like why an oil-rich country like ours wanted nuclear power?"
Hans F. Meyer, the spokesman for the I.A.E.A., denied that the agency had ignored warning signs that Iraq was trying to build a bomb. "Our inspections were very tough," he said "but under the rules of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we were only permitted to inspect the facilities that Iraq had declared."
Despite such easy purchases, Dr. Hamza said, the program was beset by almost constant setbacks -- the mysterious killings of senior Iraqi nuclear scientists traveling in Europe, corruption, technical blunders and vicious bureaucratic feuds among Iraq's scientists seeking to generate bomb-grade enriched uranium. But Mr. Hussein had an uncanny knack for turning such crises into opportunities, he said.
After Israel bombed Iraq's reactor in 1981, the Iraqi leader created the first completely independent, clandestine weapons program, most of which remained hidden from Western inspectors for nearly a decade. Liberated from having to march in lock step with its peaceful cover, the nuclear weapons program's staff grew from 400 to 7,000, Dr. Hamza said. And its budget soared.
At a time when Iraq's bloody war with Iran was draining the country's resources, nuclear scientists were insulated from the war's economic ravages and given as much as $150 million a month for the program, Dr. Hamza said.
 
Incomplete Results
Nuclear Scientists Beaten and Tortured
The Iraqi scientists were expected to produce results, and in one crucial aspect of the program, they had little to show. Despite years of effort, they had failed to produce the enriched uranium that is an essential ingredient in an atomic weapon.
When Hussein Kamel, President Hussein's ambitious son-in-law, took over the the nuclear program in 1987, Dr. Hamza said he helped him unmask a team of scientists who were falsely claiming success in enriching uranium.
Dr. Hamza was immediately named Iraq's director of weapons programs. "I went to the palace" he said, and "emerged with a new car and the title of a director general."
He said Hussein Kamel had ordered him to find a nuclear bomb trigger while other scientists pursued at least five different methods of separating uranium to make bomb-grade fuel. Dr. Hamza said that he had purchased a trigger in Poland, which did not work well, but that other Iraqi scientists developed a workable trigger in Iraq.
American intelligence officials knew little of the Iraqi effort, in part because the enrichment program relied on a technique abandoned by the United States after World War II's Manhattan Project some 40 years earlier. "They never put two and two together," Dr. Hamza said.
But the enrichment program was still slow to pay off, and Hussein Kamel grew restless. The inevitable result was the onset of beatings and torture for the scientists.
"Hussein Kamel used to send scientists who displeased him to the torture center in Al Taji," Dr. Hamza recounted. "You couldn't survive more than two weeks there." A director general of one Iraqi nuclear program was beaten so badly that "he couldn't come to work for a week."
Shortly before the 1991 gulf war, Hussein Kamel started a crash program to develop a bomb. "Kamel was crazy, but he managed to produce in a month things that would normally take a year," Dr. Hamza said. "Fear works well."
In December 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Dr. Hamza said, he asked to retire from the program. But he was told that he could do so only if he agreed to stay on as a senior adviser and help train Iraq's new generation of bomb-makers.
He left an important legacy. According to Dr. Hamza, the program had perfected two methods for enriching uranium, and each could have produced enough material to make a bomb as early as a year or two.
Dr. Hamza witnessed the intensive American and allied bombing campaign in the gulf war and was stunned at how little the Americans and their allies knew about Iraq's program. More than half of Iraq's major nuclear installations, most notably the sprawling Atheer complex, the program's busy new weapons center, were left largely untouched by the bombing raids.
Ultimately, Dr. Hamza's long-running bureaucratic feud with another leading bomb scientist, the terror of working inside the Iraqi police state and finally the killing of colleagues in the secret program convinced him to flee.
The final straw came when the body of Adil Fayadh, one of Iraq's chief nuclear procurement officers, was found near Dr. Hamza's farm. "He had a farm next to mine," he said. "They killed him and put him in the ditch on his farm. It got me very worried. It had to be Iraqi intelligence. That night, about two dozen people came to my house, pale-faced and worried. They didn't know what was going to happen."
Dr. Hamza defected soon after, and he continues to anxiously follow the Iraqi nuclear program from afar. He insisted that Mr. Hussein remains determined to reconstitute the chemical, biological and nuclear programs in which he invested so much. "Without these props, he would lose power," he said.

Finance Chief Confirms Steps To Aid Markets In Hong Kong

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 14

 BODY:
After days of speculative attacks on Hong Kong's currency, the government confirmed today that it had intervened to shore up the stock and futures markets.
Sir Donald Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong, said the government took the rare step of dipping into its reserves to buy shares and futures contracts because it thought currency traders were improperly manipulating the territory's financial markets to make "speedy profits." 
 "We do not tolerate attempts by speculators to manipulate our interest rates," a grim-faced Sir Donald said as he stood next to the chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, at a news conference here.
The monetary authority waded into the market to buy Hong Kong dollars late last week and earlier this week. But the government refused to characterize those moves as an intervention, saying instead that the government was merely raising local currency to finance a temporary budget deficit.
Today's action, which was announced after the stock market closed, is far more aggressive than merely buying dollars. Rumors of the intervention galvanized the market, which had been battered by heavy losses all week. The Hang Seng index rebounded 564.27 points, or 8.5 percent, to 7,224.69 -- its ninth-biggest point gain in history. The index had dropped about 16 percent since the end of July.
In addition to the government's purchases, rumors arose today that local companies with ties to the government were also buying shares to further prop up the Hang Seng.
Hong Kong's action underscores that after several weeks in which the foundering Japanese yen commanded the attention of Asia's markets currency trading is turning into a blood sport elsewhere in the region.
Using remarkably blunt language, Sir Donald accused traders of employing "a whole host of improper measures" to undermine the Hong Kong dollar. He said they had spread "vicious rumors" that Hong Kong was going to break its exchange rate, which is linked to the United States dollar; that China was about to devalue its currency, the yuan, and that Hong Kong's banks were unstable.
Sir Donald also opened the door to future intervention, though he cautioned that it would only occur in "exceptional circumstances."
Although the government's move rescued the Hang Seng from one of its most dismal weeks in recent memory, several analysts said the underlying reasons for Hong Kong's economic woes remained.
"The weak yen is clearly the fundamental driver, and it is growing weaker by the day because of domestic developments," said Jan Lee, the chief economist at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation here. "The Japanese authorities lack the political will to deliver the necessary changes."
 In New York Friday, the Japanese yen lost a bit of ground, trading at 146.35 yen to the dollar, down from 145.16 yen on Thursday.
Japan's Nikkei index turned in a similarly lackluster performance, declining 258.09 points, or 1.7 percent, to 15,123.93.
Some analysts also said they were troubled by the government's bellicose tone, which they said could erode the confidence of investors in Hong Kong. They noted that inflammatory remarks about currency traders by Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahatir Mohamed, had alarmed many investors.
"It is legitimate to wage war against speculators in a calculated manner," said Miron Mushkat, a strategist at Indocam Asia here. "But Hong Kong is turning this into something of a jihad against the speculators."
Beyond the issue of tough talk, some analysts said they feared that Hong Kong might be unable to maintain its commitment to a linked exchange rate when the Japanese yen is spiraling downward and virtually all of its neighbors have already deeply devalued their currencies.
Under Hong Kong's monetary system, known as a currency board, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the United States dollar at a ratio of 7.8 to 1. When traders sell the currency in large volumes, the board can act to raise interbank interest rates, forcing down asset prices and eventually making the Hong Kong dollar attractive to investors.
The trouble with such a system is that the Government must be prepared to tolerate painful spikes in interest rates, which can strangle credit and hobble economic growth. Hong Kong is already limping through its worst downturn since World War II, with an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent and a 2.8 percent contraction in its gross domestic product in the first quarter.
"The politicians are absolutely committed to the exchange rate, but at what cost?" Mr. Lee asked. "At the cost of a very significant deflation in Hong Kong -- far more than what I believe people are willing to tolerate."
Previous efforts to defend the Hong Kong dollar have resulted in sharp drops in property prices and on the stock exchange, which is largely driven by real estate industry values.
By last Wednesday, after several days of intense selling of the Hong Kong dollar, the Hang Seng index was trading at a five-year low.
Sir Donald said today that the attacks on the Hong Kong dollar were designed to force a chain reaction of soaring interest rates and swooning stock prices. He said the same hedge funds that speculated against the dollar accumulated short positions in the shares of Hong Kong companies. When those stocks plunged, he said, the hedge funds stood to profit.
"The market is vulnerable to manipulation and has recently showed signs of becoming one of the main reasons of speculators attacking the Hong Kong dollar," Sir Donald said.
By engineering a rally in share prices, the government hopes to inflict heavy losses on the hedge funds -- a punishment it thinks will dissuade them from speculating on the currency in the future.
Still, analysts said Hong Kong would remain vulnerable to speculative attacks as long as its currency traded higher than those of its neighbors. Moreover, the gap between Hong Kong and other Asian countries seems likely to widen rather than narrow. The Japanese yen continues to weaken, and despite China's protestations, many analysts think it will eventually devalue the yuan.
Indeed, a Hong Kong brokerage firm released a report on Thursday predicting that China would devalue the currency at the end of the year. The firm, Indosuez W. I. Carr Securities, said Beijing would feel compelled to take such action in order to keep its economic reform program on track.
"If this were just a temporary crisis, you could just plug the gap for a year or so and get back to the reform process later," said Michael Taylor, an economist at Indosuez W. I. Carr Securities. "But it isn't."

HEADLINE: The Age of Reasons

BYLINE: By Jeff MacGregor; David C. McCourt is the chairman of RCN Corporation, a telecommunications and Internet company.

 BODY:
Language and technology march on. Even the excuse, once only a feeble handmaiden to reason, has been reconfigured to suit the new imperatives of our work-a-day postmodern age, Excuse-management techniques have lately taken our nation's capital by storm. In the "old" Washington, some misbehavior, personal or political, was too often explained away with one hackeneyed cliche after another - "I was drunk" being the formerly popular catchall.
 
 Now though, if reports of the tortuous maneuverings of the President's legal team are true and the legal team are true and the legal definition of "sexual relations" is being rewritten as we speak, we have learned the many benefits of a more refined and complex excuse strategy.
 Here is the well-lighted Wiggle Room of the Bland Corporation Think Tank, linguists, scholars, philosophers and theologians have been working overtime to provide the general public with their own updated set of plausible and judicious excuses for everyday misbehavior. Failed excuses from earlier in the decade are offered for comparison:
 Example #1: When stopped by the highway patrol for speeding.
 New Excuse: "Insofar as speed is defined as a function of distance traveled divided by the time it takes to do so; and insofar as all perceived times and distances are perforce relative in the Einsteinian paradigm of a saddle-shaped time/space continuum, who is to say just how fast any of us is really traveling, Officer?"
 Old Excuse: "I couldn't see the speedometer over this giant margarita."
 Example #2: When confronted by a teacher for failing to turn in homework.
 New Excuse: "Perhaps Thomas Wolfe said it best when he wrote, 'You can't go home again.' Thus, unable to return 'home' (defining 'home' here as a hypothetical sociological construct wherein persons related by blood or simply by a commonality of intention or a shared need or imperatives of personal economy), I was unable to perform any work there."
 Old Excuse: "It was two-for-one night at the National Press Club."
 Example #3: When apprehended for shoplifting.
 New Excuse: "The ongoing constitutional arguments in re the nature and definition of 'personal property,' especially those lately undertaken in the many nascent Emerging Democracies around the globe, might well lead one down a series of discursive cul-de-sacs as to the precise relation of the idea 'yours' to the idea 'mine.' Therefore, except in the few remaining Socialist outposts where property qua property is by assumption 'ours,' I can only assert that since ownership is a vague middle ground viz. a market economy as driven by the personal betterment of both buyer and seller, that I be allowed to return these to the rack they may or may not have come from in the first place."
 Old Excuse: "Hey! How'd these get in my purse?"
 Example #4: When the family pet has an accident on the living room rug.
 New Excuse: "Woof woof woof woof, woof woof, woof: woof woof. (Woof woof.) Woof woof woof. Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof."
 Old Excuse: "Woof."
 Example #5: When forgetting to buy milk.
 New Excuse: "That I 'forget' presumes a level of cognitive assonance between us by which it was a prioriunderstood that a transaction was to take place wherein 'milk' (skim, whole, 1 percent, 2 percent, or of an unspecified nature) was to be purchased and then brought here for disbursement into various pre-or unprepared foodstuffs. That these instructions were implied rather than explicit abrogates, de facto, any responsibility on my part for the absence of milk in this grocery bag."
 Old Excuse: "Don't we still have some Kahlua?"

TOWARDS A NEW MUSEUM
 By Victoria Newhouse.
 Illustrated. 288 pp. New York:
 The Monacelli Press. Paper, $45. 
 IN each of the last three decades 200 new art museums opened in this country. In Europe, where the pace is no less frantic, public investment in them is vast; they are used as engines of economic growth and urban renewal -- spectacularly just now in Helsinki and Bilbao, Spain. Many have no plans for a permanent collection; the museums exist before art is found for them. In Europe, as in America, they have taken over all kinds of unused structures built for other purposes, primarily empty industrial sites; in fact, some of the new ones are built to look like industrial sites. Most of the large new public museums encompass mixed media in some form, and a few seem bent on compressing World's Fairs inside their walls. The Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, more familiarly the Beaubourg -- which houses many arts and much technology and commerce in what looks like a gas cracking facility -- was meant to regenerate a neighborhood, but the 8 million people visiting it every year have transformed it into the new center of Paris, reorienting the commercial structure and movement patterns of the city. Its lesson of museum power has not been lost on other cities around the world.
In "Towards a New Museum," Victoria Newhouse points out that in the 19th and early 20th centuries museums were conceived as temples of a new humanist religion. As they push toward ever greater popularity, they return to an older form, the 17th-century "cabinets of curiosities" that were the first museums -- collections of art, books, technology and natural wonders that challenged visitors to make their own discoveries. The cabinet of curiosities inspired the industrial fairs of the 19th century, from which modern theme parks take a lead, and now museums are borrowing ideas from theme parks.
Newhouse seems amused by a remark of the Italian architect Renzo Piano -- one of the designers of the Beaubourg, who is now turning the mammoth old Fiat factory in Turin, complete with its fabulous rooftop test track, into a cultural circus -- that the pursuit of popularity by museum designers could lead to the "profanation" of art. (He said that before anyone even knew that one of the giant hotel casinos now rising in Las Vegas will contain its own museum because, its developer says, people expect art as part of their total entertainment package.) Piano's word comes from old Roman religion, meaning a violation of a sacred precinct, as when the poet Horace, borrowing ritual temple rhetoric, proclaims: "Odi profanum vulgus" (I abominate pollution by the uninitiated). Now there is the authentic voice of an ancient hierarch.
Victoria Newhouse is no hierarch, although she has the social and professional qualifications to be one. She is on the side of the mold-breaking architects whose work seduces mobs to throng their buildings, if not always to enjoy the art. For her, the guides to the future are Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim in New York; the Beaubourg, by Piano and Richard Rogers; and Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim. She also thinks the computer can be a popular gallery without limits for the exploration of art, the ultimate cabinet of curiosities.
"Towards a New Museum" is intended, she says, for architects; trustees, members, directors and creators of museums; "and, of course, their vastly expanding audience." I would reverse that order; for the general reader it is a comprehensive and friendly book. A researcher might find most of the information here in other publications, but having it brought together and ordered to support an argument gives it coherence, and the position and career of the writer give it authority. Newhouse established the Architectural History Foundation, and she has written about architecture for years in journals and magazines. She has insights into artists, architects, trustees and directors that few journalists could match, and she writes about them with rare candor, taking the reader into her confidence. As she makes judgments she defines her standards and lets us feel her passion for good building; so, reading her appraisals of museums, we come to know her mind and to appreciate how searing a quiet expression of disapproval can be, or how exalting a word of praise. The book is so intimate and unpretentious that its richness in history and the history of ideas comes as a surprise.
What trustees and directors must understand, Newhouse demonstrates, is that architecture is art, and a museum's architecture is part of the art experience. Too few of them do understand, but the reader begins to in her chapters on renovations of some famous museums. Additions can glorify existing institutions; her best examples are a new, separate Rafael Moneo wing of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and Louis Kahn's gallery at Yale University. Readers will find little comfort but great illumination in her mournful discussions of the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim in New York, and in the acid treatment of I. M. Pei's pyramid entry to the Louvre. In fact, Pei, Richard Meier and Mario Botta come in for some rough handling altogether.
Wright's Guggenheim can be saved anytime the trustees find the guts to pulverize the slab glued to it in 1992 and then to use it the way it was meant to be used. The Met and MOMA are more serious cases -- casualties, Newhouse suggests, of the ignorance, willfulness or weakness of trustees and directors. "A seemingly unlimited willingness to satisfy donor demands" for separate galleries has helped turn the Met into a dizzying maze of caves, and MOMA's refusal to admit that the age of the Modern is over leaves the architect of its renovation with an order to design a building for . . . who knows what? In that respect even Meier is let off the hook an inch or two for his design of the new Getty in Los Angeles. The trustees wanted only the most extravagant excrescence possible on the southern California mountains (I once heard one of them mention John Winthrop's "city upon a hill" and found his innocence touching; he can have had no inkling of the judgment Winthrop would call down from God on the Getty, or its founder); Meier's real clients were competing officers of divisions of the all-purpose Getty Trust.
Clarity of purpose is all in this game, and a smart client is an architect's best blessing. So, some of the most enchanting buildings in this volume are private galleries, those that house a single collection, and artists' museums -- especially the Menil Collection and the Cy Twombly Museum in Houston; the private Goetz Collection in Munich, designed by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron; and a small studio and gallery nearby, built for the sculptor Beate Schubert, that glows with beauty. The range of what Newhouse presents is enormous and enlightening, from Claes Oldenburg's Mouse Museum, which will raise a smile, to the Olympian galleries created by the artist Donald Judd in massive former military sheds in Marfa, Tex., which leave one simply dumbfounded.
Most of the artists she quotes have a healthy wariness of museums unless the museums happen to be their own studios. There are exceptions, like Frank Stella, who designed four museums for cities in Europe. The space given them indicates that Newhouse rather likes them, but Stella's plans and maquettes tell me a lot about why none were built. It was the rebellion of the artists that led museums to lofts and other experimental venues in the first place. Some of them suggest a limited life span for any given museum. Others reject special places for art altogether, preferring to try to turn the environment that surrounds their art into art -- which is pretty much what Newhouse wants architects to do.
All this only suggests the wealth of "Towards a New Museum." But this fine collection of ideas, questions, critiques and inspirations never bewilders or exhausts the reader. And the large number of artists, architects and critics Newhouse draws into the discussion is never distracting; her clarity of purpose is exemplary. So is the book's design; pictures, plans and drawings are filled with ideas not repeated in words. Reading through these pages is to be engaged in a provocative conversation with passionate, very intelligent people.

 WE ARE WHAT WE EAT
 Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans.

NO FOREIGN FOOD
 The American Diet in Time and Place.
 By Richard Pillsbury.
 262 pp. Boulder, Colo.:
 Westview Press. Paper, $19.95. 
 LIKE language, cuisine changes as you try to define it. Food preferences shift constantly, depending on what makes people feel most comfortable and what they can afford. America's diet, rooted less firmly than most in common traditions -- at least in traditions that don't turn out to be myths of recent creation -- rarely stands still long enough for anyone to draw its portrait. Two new books try.
Donna R. Gabaccia, a professor of American history at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, seems to wish that the many groups that settled the United States had taken better care to preserve their food as a way of preserving their identities. This is well-explored territory, and it takes almost half of "We Are What We Eat" for Gabaccia to state her theme: "With immigrants, Americans and ethnic foods regularly crossing over ethnic boundaries by the turn of the 20th century, the confrontation of values represented by America's many cultures of eating seemed inevitable." We expect to see heated clashes and passionate adherence to quaint "foodways." Instead Gabaccia recounts, with scolding dismay, the inevitable watering down of the few ethnic foods that found widespread acceptance and offers little idea of how these foods could possibly have maintained their purity -- even among the groups that originally ate them.
Those groups were eagerly assimilating into the larger culture and rejecting their own cuisine, even as the non-ethnic-owned companies the author so mistrusts were denaturing it. Gabaccia spends much of the book explaining how dishes that began by differentiating the people who cooked and ate them were dulled in order to appeal to the masses. "Ethnic foods," she writes, with her penchant for pointing out the obvious, "often lose their ethnic labels, their 'authenticity' and -- critics argue -- their taste once they are mass produced by large corporations. It happened to hot dogs, beer, egg rolls and bagels; it is happening right now to pizza, salsa, hummus and sushi."
One would hardly expect otherwise in such a heterogeneous country. Gabaccia does not suggest how one ethnic group could have been persuaded to appreciate genuine renditions of the unfamiliar foods of another. And she hardly notes the growing taste for "Mexican" and "Caribbean" dishes far hotter and more extreme than the originals. Ethnic foods do not only become bland when America adopts them. They become coarsened and distorted too. Subtlety is lost when industry rather than individual cooks prepare dishes, using mass-produced rather than home-grown ingredients, and flavors are exaggerated to compensate. The author seems unaware of this, and she also largely ignores the current ransacking of ethnic repertories for potentially curative foods.
In a rare sharp moment, Gabaccia notes that "new ethnics" are trying to "recapture through food and eating the closeness of a bygone era, when families always ate a home-cooked, mother-served, meal and spent holidays together." The way to do this would be to reverse the national restlessness and stay in one place with parents and cousins. But rather than invest the time and emotion necessary to reproduce the "close-knit familiar world" they miss, these roots-seekers -- "consumers to their American core" -- try to "re-create the past by buying it" in the form of cookbooks and dinners at community festivals.
Too bad the author ended, rather than began, with these ironies. One wishes, too, that she had gone much farther with her brief discussion of what various immigrants thought they were saying about themselves by their choice of foods; dietary climbing and slumming, as her few provocative examples show, is nothing new. Unfortunately, most of "We Are What We Eat" jumps confusingly from place to place, group to group and decade to decade without connective threads. It's also difficult to have complete confidence in someone who describes knishes as "crispy square potato pies."
Richard Pillsbury likes cooking, tasting and thinking about food. A professor of geography at Georgia State University (and no relation to the food manufacturer), he also knows a great deal about the economic and demographic trends that underlie food preferences, and he has written a far more persuasive and complete picture of the American diet. "No Foreign Food" is also a good deal more readable. Although there is much overlap with "We Are What We Eat," Pillsbury's book is less concerned with ethnic interchange than with how migration and the economy have shaped the American diet, region by region. His discussion is realistic, succinct and contemporary. In asides, for instance, Pillsbury corrects the notion that some American foods are timeless -- like cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving (a relatively modern invention of Ocean Spray) and biscuits, which became "a Southern staple" only as wheat flour "came into economic reach of the majority of the population, probably in the early 20th century." He is especially strong, and refreshingly open-minded, about the unstoppable rise of fast food; his agenda is less politicized and his style more direct.
Pillsbury manages a clear-eyed tolerance that seems to elude Gabaccia. He is less alarmed by the promiscuous mingling of cuisines and the Americanization of formerly distinct foods, which, however bastardized, have allowed people "unfamiliar with and fearful of 'foreign' cuisines to be a little more adventuresome." If some regional favorites have become endangered, it is because the home cooks who once made them could afford to try something new. The dishes that bored them and symbolized poverty have now become the province of roots-seekers (even if the roots are not theirs) who turn out gumbos "more authentic than the real thing ever was."
The American culinary interchange goes on with every new arrival and every population shift. Pillsbury is sanguine. "Ultimately," he writes, "the vitality and power of the nation's all-embracing culture has meant that there can be no foreign food." Perhaps the most useful attitude is simple curiosity about what's on the next guy's plate.

 BODY:

Trail Fever: Spin Doctors, Rented Strangers, and Thumb Wrestlers on the Road to the White House
 By Michael Lewis. Vintage, $14. 
 In reporting on the 1996 Presidential campaign, the author details the nearly farcical demands of politics in the television age and discovers more wisdom and bravery among those at the bottom of the political food chain than at the top. The result is "deeper, funnier and more edifying" than the usual insider account of life on the hustings, Phil Gailey said in the Book Review last year.
 
Reality and Dreams
By Muriel Spark. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
A hopelessly spoiled film director is tempted to play God, with ruinous results -- not for him but for his extended "family." Dame Muriel Spark, through the voice of her all-knowing narrator, is "as relentlessly observant of human habits and unguarded moments as she has ever been," Penelope Fitzgerald wrote here last year. An earlier novel, The Girls of Slender Means (New Directions, $10.95), follows the escapades of a varied group of young women living at a ladies' hostel in London after the Allied victory in Europe. In 1963 our reviewer, Virgilia Peterson, praised the author's "absolute pitch in dialogue, her economy of style and her sedulous avoidance of sentiment."
 
News of a Kidnapping
By Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
Translated by Edith Grossman. Penguin, $13.95.
The 1982 Nobel laureate in literature chronicles the brazen series of crimes committed by Pablo Escobar's Colombian cocaine cartel as it sought to undermine efforts to extradite Escobar and his fellow drug lords to the United States. Last year our reviewer, Robert Stone, said the author had "a quick eye for the illuminating detail and a capacity for assembling fact."
 
Tumble Home: A Novella and Short Stories
By Amy Hempel. Scribner, $10.
This slender collection features minimalist stories about parenthood, death and breakups, written as if assembled from fragments of conversation. "Hempel writes with an effortless wit . . . showing us the larger shapes of our lives by capturing their most fleeting and fragmentary moments," Elizabeth Gleick wrote here in 1997.
 
The Twentieth Century: A People's History
By Howard Zinn. Harper Perennial, $15.
In this abridged version of "A People's History of the United States" (1980), which has been updated into the Clinton years, a scholar takes sides with the losers, the downtrodden and the underdogs, arguing that too much history is written from the point of view of governments and elites. In his review of the original, Eric Foner found the approach to be limited, but said "Zinn writes with an enthusiasm rarely encountered in the leaden prose of academic history." The same publisher has reissued The American Century: Varieties of Culture in Modern Times, by Norman F. Cantor ($16), a sprawling guided tour of the century that was first published in 1988 and has also been revised and updated. In managing to cram in just about every notable trend, event and discipline, this is an "opinionated, idiosyncratic and thoroughly entertaining" survey, Hal Goodman said here last year.
 
Carson Valley
By Bill Barich. Vintage Contemporaries, $14.
Set against the shifting economic landscape of the wine country of northern California, this love story centers on a troubled young woman who returns from New York and has an affair with the manager of her father's vineyard. In 1997 our reviewer, Linda Gray Sexton, admired the author's "easy grace" and "elegant sleight of hand."
 
The Lady Who Liked Clean Rest Rooms:
The Chronicle of One of the Strangest Stories Ever to Be
Rumoured About Around New York
By J. P. Donleavy. St. Martin's Griffin, $9.95.
Jocelyn Guenevere Marchantiere Jones, a fresh-mouthed 43-year-old Scarsdale matron and Daughter of the Confederacy, finds herself slipping down the social ladder after her husband deserts her for a bit of "fresh flesh." Her travails make for a "rich, ribald and touching creation," Nina Sonenberg wrote here last year.
 
No<heart>l Coward: A Biography
By Philip Hoare. University of Chicago, $18.
Drawing on both careful research and gossip, the author maintains that the public image of Noel Coward as a languid hedonist was a fiction -- the actor, playwright, songwriter and world-class wit was driven by an intense passion for fame. "One of the many merits of . . . Hoare's book is to remind us of the man's self-discipline, his rigorous professionalism and his courage," Miranda Seymour wrote here in 1996. In Ghost of a Chance: A Memoir, by Peter Duchin with Charles Michener (Random House, $16.95), the last society bandleader tells the bizarre story of how he was left by his father, the bandleader Eddy Duchin, to be raised under the privileged wing of Averell Harriman. In 1996 our reviewer, George W. S. Trow, called this a "brave and stylish" book.
 
The Calcutta Chromosome:
A Novel of Fevers, Delirium & Discovery
By Amitav Ghosh. Bard/Avon, $6.99.
This mazelike thriller about weird science projects and global mind control begins when a computer programmer in 21st-century Manhattan stumbles onto the damaged ID card of a former colleague who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Last year our reviewer, James Saynor, called this "a finely carved mystery." Scott Veale

HEADLINE: The Beige And The Black

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind is the Washington editor of Harper's magazine and a columnist for The New Leader.

 BODY:
Just when you think you're ready for 21st-century America, it changes on you yet again. A few years ago, predictions that whites would eventually become a minority group in the United States galvanized the multicultural left -- and horrified the nativist right. More recently, news of the growing number of mixed-race Americans has inspired the political center with a vision of a true racial melting pot, one in which white and black alike will blend into a universal brown. But a closer look at demographic trends suggests that neither of these futures -- a nonwhite majority, a uniformly beige society -- will very likely come to pass. Instead, shifting patterns of racial intermarriage suggest that the next century may see the replacement of the historic white-black dichotomy in America with a troubling new division, one between beige and black.
Racial intermarriage has long been a source of anxiety in America. After World War II, Senator Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi defended white supremacy in a book titled "Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization." Like other racists of his era, Bilbo believed that an inevitable result of dismantling segregation would be the amalgamation of the races through intermarriage. He was right: since the U.S. Supreme Court, in Loving v. Virginia (1967), struck down the last antimiscegenation laws of the states, marriage across racial lines has grown at a remarkable rate. 
 Between 1960 and 1990, interracial marriages in this country skyrocketed by more than 800 percent. Roughly 1 in 25 American married couples today are interracial. In fact, there are at least three million children of mixed-race parentage in the United States -- and this figure doesn't even include the millions of Hispanic mestizos and black Americans who have European and Indian ancestors. Perhaps the best-known multiracial American is Tiger Woods, who has described himself as Cablinasian: a mix of Caucasian, black, Native American and Asian.
Oddly, the U.S. Census Bureau has yet to account properly for the presence of mixed-race Americans. As a result, many of its projections are off target. For example, the bureau has famously predicted that in 2050, whites will make up 52.7 percent of the U.S. population. (In 1990, it was 75.7 percent.) Hispanics will account for 21.1 percent of the population; blacks, 15 percent, and Asians, 10.1 percent. Presumably, 2050 will be white America's last stand. But this projection is dubious, because it assumes that for the next half-century there will be absolutely no intermarriage among the four major conventionally defined racial groups in the United States: whites, blacks, Hispanics and Asians. Each group is supposed to somehow expand -- or decline -- in hermetic isolation.
But according to an analysis of the 1990 U.S. Census data for persons ages 25-34 by Reynolds Farley, a demographer with the Russell Sage Foundation, 31.6 percent of native-born Hispanic husbands and 31.4 percent of native-born Hispanic wives had white spouses. The figures were even higher for Asians: 36 percent for native-born Asian husbands and 45.2 percent for native-born Asian wives. (In fact, Asian wives were as likely to marry white Americans as they were to marry Asian-Americans.) The highest intermarriage rates are those of American Indians. Majorities of American Indian men (52.9 percent) and American Indian women (53.9 percent) married whites rather than American Indians (40.3 percent and 37.2 percent, respectively). And these figures, which themselves document the creolization of America, undoubtedly understate the extent of racial intermarriage that the 2000 Census will reveal.
Of course intermarriage rates vary by region. White men in California in 1990 were more than six times as likely as Midwestern white men to marry outside their race. Overall, interracial marriages are more than twice as common in California (1 in 10 new couples) as in the rest of the country (1 in 25). According to the magazine Interrace, San Jose, San Diego and Oakland are among the Top 10 cities for interracial couples. America's racial complexion, then, will change more quickly on the coasts than in the heartland.
Nevertheless, the overall increase in intermarriage means that both multicultural liberals and nativist conservatives have misunderstood the major demographic trends in this country. There is not going to be a nonwhite majority in the 21st century. Rather, there is going to be a mostly white mixed-race majority. The only way to stop this is to force all Hispanic and Asian-Americans from now on to marry within their officially defined groups. And that is not going to happen.
Thus, the old duality between whites and nonwhites is finally breaking down. But don't cheer just yet. For what seems to be emerging in the United States is a new dichotomy between blacks and nonblacks. Increasingly, whites, Asians and Hispanics are creating a broad community from which black Americans may be excluded.
Disparities in interracial marriages underline this problem. Black-white marriages have risen from a reported 51,000 in 1960 (when they were still illegal in many states) to 311,000 in 1997. Marriages between white men and black women, though still uncommon, rose from 27,000 in 1980 to 122,000 in 1995. Although black out-marriage rates have risen, they remain much lower than out-marriage rates for Hispanics, Asians and American Indians. For the 25-34 age group, only 8 percent of black men marry outside their race. Less than 4 percent of black women do so.
While many blacks frown upon marriage by blacks to members of other groups -- such relationships are viewed by some as disloyal -- it seems very unlikely that such conservative attitudes are more pronounced among black Americans than among whites or Hispanic or Asian immigrants. The major cause of low black out-marriage rates may well be anti-black prejudice -- the most enduring feature of the eroding American caste system. Furthermore, antiblack prejudice is often picked up by immigrants, when it is not brought with them from their countries of origin.
In the past, the existence of an untouchable caste of blacks may have made it easier for Anglo-Americans to fuse with more recent European immigrants in an all-encompassing white community. Without blacks as a common other, the differences between Anglo-Americans, German-Americans, Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans might have seemed much more important. Could this be occurring again? A Knight-Ridder poll taken in May 1997 showed that while respondents were generally comfortable with intermarriage, a full 3 in 10 respondents opposed marriage between blacks and whites.
In the 21st century, then, the U.S. population is not likely to be crisply divided among whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians. Nor is it likely to be split two ways, between whites and nonwhites. Rather, we are most likely to see something more complicated: a white-Asian-Hispanic melting-pot majority -- a hard-to-differentiate group of beige Americans -- offset by a minority consisting of blacks who have been left out of the melting pot once again.
The political implications of this new racial landscape have not yet been considered. On the positive side, the melting away of racial barriers between Asians, Latinos and whites will prevent a complete Balkanization of American society into tiny ethnic groups. On the negative side, the division between an enormous, mixed-race majority and a black minority might be equally unhealthy. The new mixed-race majority, even if it were predominantly European in ancestry, probably would not be moved by appeals to white guilt. Some of the new multiracial Americans might disingenuously invoke an Asian or Hispanic grandparent to include themselves among the victims rather than the victimizers. Nor would black Americans find many partners for a rainbow coalition politics, except perhaps among recent immigrants.
One political response to a beige-and-black America might be a movement to institutionalize binationalism. In Canada, Anglophones and Francophones have been declared the country's two founding nations. Blacks, as a quasi-permanent minority, might insist upon a status different from that of voluntary immigrants who merge with the majority in a few generations. Such compromises, however, are difficult to maintain. If most immigrants blend into one of the two founding nations -- the Anglophone majority in Canada, the mixed-race majority in the U.S. -- then working out a stable modus vivendi between the expanding community and the shrinking community becomes almost impossible.
The other possibility is that black Americans will, in time, participate in the melting pot at rates comparable with other groups. Such a result cannot and should not be the aim of public policy -- how can you legislate romance? -- but it may be an incidental result of greater social mobility and economic equality. The evidence suggests that the association of people as equals erodes even the oldest and deepest prejudice in American life.
According to the 1990 census, white men 25-34 in the U.S. military were 2.3 times as likely to marry nonwhite women as civilians. And white women in the same age group who served in the military in the 1980's were seven times as likely as their civilian counterparts to have black husbands. Indeed, for all groups except for Asian men, military service makes out-marriage much more likely. The reason for this is clear: the U.S. military is the most integrated institution in American society because it is the most egalitarian and meritocratic. It is also -- not coincidentally -- the least libertarian and least tolerant of subcultural diversity. It may be that in the nation as a whole, as in the military, the integration of individuals can be achieved only at the price of the sacrifice of lesser differences to a powerful common identity.
In the end, racial intermarriage is a result, not a cause, of racial integration. Racial integration, in turn, is a result of social equality. The civil rights revolution abolished racial segregation by law, but not racial segregation by class. Ending racial segregation by class might -- just might -- bring about an end to race itself in America. It is certainly worth a try.

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM; TODD S. PURDUM is the chief of the Los Angeles bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
HUMANS have lived in what is now California for at least 7,000 years, and the land they live on was formed over a few million years of geologic time. But modern California -- the boisterous, roiling, polyglot place of dreams that so fills the American imagination -- was born on the morning of Jan. 24, 1848, at a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.
"This day some kind of mettle was found in the tail race that looks like goald," Henry Bigler, a Mormon worker at the mill, wrote in his diary. And from the moment that Bigler's boss, an itinerant carpenter named James Marshall, found two tiny nuggets, the first one about half the size and shape of a pea, in the water channel of the mill owned by John Sutter, nothing was ever the same. 
 Within a few years, more than a quarter million migrants from all over the world had come to seek their fortune, and though much of the boom went bust within a decade and population centers moved west and south, the settlers never really stopped coming. Today, the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in Coloma, a tiny village 50 miles east of Sacramento, readily recaptures the excitement of Marshall's find, with a reconstruction of the mill -- now run by electricity -- and a small museum with blown-up reproductions of Bigler's journal and other documents. It is as good a place as any to begin a sesquicentennial tour of the territory that made California the Golden State.
The patient -- or the merely romantic -- can still pan for placer, or particle, gold along the riverbank with wide, flat pans available at shops throughout the region, and the weary can swim in the Sierra-fed stream at a small campground across the way from the mill site. But Coloma is only the chronological starting point for visiting a region that, like the Cotswolds or Tuscan hill towns, best yields its treasures to unhurried exploration.
Stretching for more than 300 miles along California Route 49, the Golden Chain Highway, the Gold Country today is a collection of well-preserved Victorian frontier towns, historic museums, pristine parks and rivers for hikes and whitewater rafting -- and even a growing wine country -- all within easy reach of the grander splendors of Lake Tahoe and Yosemite National Park.
On a recent long weekend, my wife, Dee Dee, and I barreled north from Los Angeles in our own private stagecoach, a trusty Ford Explorer, racing across the vast agricultural expanse of the Great Central Valley into the rolling foothills northeast of Fresno. We drove almost the whole of Highway 49 over three and a half days, but confined our official wanderings to the northern half of the territory, the stretch from the town of Angels Camp north to Nevada City, with frequent stops in between.
It was in Angels Camp, in Calaveras County, that a young prospector with a literary bent first heard the tale of a celebrated jumping frog. A monument across the street from the old Angels Hotel on Main Street commemorates Mark Twain's inspiration, and an annual May Jumping Frog Jubilee at the county fairgrounds draws competitors from all over to re-enact the legend. Just south of town, atop a rise called Jackass Hill, a well-marked road off Highway 49 leads to a reconstructed cabin that may or may not be where Twain wrote the story that helped begin his career.
A short drive east on Route 4 lies the picturesque town of Murphys, where we stayed on an earlier trip to the region, with its old Main Street shaded by giant elms and locusts and looking unchanged from its heyday. There, the Murphys Historic Hotel, which once played host to Twain, Ulysses S. Grant, J. P. Morgan and others, still functions, and though guidebooks often cite its charm, it seemed a bit musty to us, and a steak and salad dinner in its restaurant was only passable. A far better redoubt is the Dunbar House 1880 bed-and-breakfast, a white frame Italianate cottage lovingly restored by Bob and Barbara Costa, who serve a delicious breakfast of home-baked goods in a peaceful garden.
Route 4, which heads up into the Sierras and in summer can be a delightful back-country route to Tahoe, with cattle wandering across the road in the high reaches of Ebbetts Pass, is a diverting detour, with at least one truly spectacular sight: the Calaveras Big Trees State Park. This stand of giant sequoias has neither the tallest nor the most-visited examples of this tree, but in the 1850's they were the first to be discovered by white settlers and for a time thought to be the only such specimens in the world. There are two groves in the park, one in the north with 150 trees, easily accessible from a parking lot; the other, in the south, with more than 1,000 trees, is reachable only by an easy milelong walk through an old-growth forest.
Back on Highway 49, the road continues north to the pretty, unspoiled town of Sutter Creek, named for the Swiss emigre whose sawmill started it all, but whose own efforts at mining here ended in dismal failure. A local merchant named Leland Stanford was luckier: he took a share of a nearby mine as payment for a customer's debt, and it ultimately became the basis of a fortune in railroading that propelled Stanford to the governorship and to the founding of Stanford University.
Now, Sutter Creek's Main Street is abuzz with a four-block stretch of gift shops, bed-and-breakfasts and antiques shops, and is home to what may be the finest luncheonette in North America, the Chatterbox Cafe. Sharing the name of Garrison Keillor's fictional restaurant but founded in 1946, long before "Lake Wobegon" was invented, it was taken over in 1991 by Mike Gill and his wife, Michele, longtime Keillor fans from the Los Angeles area who spied it on a visit and couldn't resist the name. It serves breakfast and lunch only, slowly, has just 14 stools and 5 tables, closes at 3 P.M. (4 P.M. weekends) and is practically perfect.
Mrs. Gill presides over an old-fashioned soda fountain that still pumps out syrup and seltzer in separate streams, requiring hand-dashing with a long spoon over crushed ice. In the kitchen, Mr. Gill grills fresh-made hamburgers on homemade buns with skinny, hand-cut fries from a bin of russet potatoes that juts out into the only passage to the tiny, immaculate bathroom. The waitresses are agreeably jaded and lippy, and virtually everything is homemade, from the iced tea to the cinnamon buns and biscuits, and after a lunch of two "Prospector" burgers (with thick locally smoked bacon and Jarlsberg cheese), and fresh blackberry and coconut-cream pie, we rolled out the door in a state of purest bliss.
Stuffed and sleepy after our indulgence, where did we go next? To a wine-tasting, of course, in the no-nonsense metal barn of Domaine de la Terre Rouge, just outside the haunting remains of Fiddletown, near Plymouth, in neighboring Amador County. Along with Calaveras and El Dorado Counties, Amador constitutes a growing local wine-producing region that dates back at least to the 1860's, when some of the immigrants -- Basques and Italians, for example -- brought grape cuttings with them; today it makes award-winning zinfandels, syrahs and other varietals.
IN fact, the growing conditions are not unlike the long, hot days of Provence, and Terre Rouge specializes in Rhone varietals like grenache, syrah and mourvedre. We were inspired to visit after tasting its Vin Gris d'Amador, a delightfully crisp dry rose. The winery is owned by Bill Easton and Jane O'Riordan, former wine merchants in Berkeley. The afternoon we visited, a friendly, though not especially knowledgeable, employee happily poured a half-dozen samples, and we went home with a case and a half.
Eager to make our Friday night's destination in Nevada City, we sped up the road, breezing through famous towns like Placerville (originally named Hangtown, for its rough justice), where my great-great-grandfather sought his fortune in vain in the Gold Rush but saw the money-making potential of the dry-goods business and returned to rural Illinois where he eventually opened a store of his own.
Having made our reservations on short notice for a crowded summer weekend, we had little choice of accommodations in Nevada City, a picture-book Old West town whose main thoroughfare, Broad Street, rises sharply up a steep hill. We stayed at a bed-and-breakfast called The Parsonage, and it was adequate, but we envied the inviting look of another, Grandmere's, in a sprawling house just up the street that was full that weekend, and decided it would be the preferred destination on our next trip.
Nevada City is best seen by walking its hilly streets, and there is plenty to see, from the small brick Nevada Theater, at 401 Broad Street, which dates from 1865 and is the oldest operating theater in the state, to the National Hotel, at 211 Broad, said to be the oldest continuously operating hotel west of the Rockies, with a broad upstairs porch. The Nevada County Historical Society Museum in Firehouse No. 1, at 214 Main Street, has a charming collection of old photographs and pioneer relics.
But by far the most interesting attraction in the area -- and one of the most compelling in all of the Gold Country -- is the Empire Mine State Historic Park down the road in nearby Grass Valley. This splendid 800-acre park is the site of the state's oldest, richest hard-rock gold mine, which operated from 1850 to 1956, when the price of gold made mining unprofitable. Here visitors can see what a big industrial business mining became after the era of the early 49ers, when technology made it possible to dig deep into underground quartz deposits, out of which gold was then laboriously "stamped" with giant smashing machines. We spent a fascinating half-day here, with an enthusiastic and articulate state park ranger as our guide, peering down a shaft of the abandoned mine. The mine, stretching 11,000 feet below ground, contains 367 miles of shafts, most of which are now flooded with groundwater.
There are plans for a ride that would carry visitors through part of the underground labyrinth, but even a tour of the mineyard is enough to sense the hardship of the miners, most of them emigres from the tin and copper mines of Cornwall, England. They brought with them their beloved meat pie, the pastie, which is still a staple in Grass Valley.
Just outside the mineyard, in a class juxtaposition worthy of Shavian drama, a gate leads to the lushly landscaped grounds and stone-and-brick cottage of the Bourn family, which owned the mine for much of its life. The family stayed here in Gilded Age luxury during their periodic visits to the mine, ensconced in gardens and a grove of trees but, even so, unable to escape the round-the-clock pounding of the giant stamping machines. Today there are tours and perpetual quiet.
After a quick lunch of delicious hot pasties at Mrs. Dubblebee's in Grass Valley, we headed off to Coloma, and then to a refreshing dip in the canyons of the North and Middle Forks of the American River at the Auburn State Recreation Area just east of Auburn on Route 49.
On Sunday, we wandered the winding streets of Nevada City, and then took one last stroll through natural beauty in the South Yuba River State Park at Bridgeport, a quick drive north of town on Pleasant Valley Road off Highway 49. Bridgeport is home to a beautiful 252-foot covered wooden bridge from 1862, one of the longest single-span covered bridges in the country, and offers a series of hikes and swimming holes in cool pools set back from the bubbling rapids of the South Fork of the Yuba River.
As we paddled from boulder to boulder in the soothing stream, we could feel the powerful tug of the current and couldn't help wondering if it still carried flecks of treasure. Reluctantly, we dried off with spare T-shirts and turned south to Sacramento for the long drive home down Interstate 5, the Golden State Freeway.
 
The Falklands connection
 As improbable as it sounds, the sesquicentennial of the California Gold Rush is also being commemorated in the Falkland Islands, the isolated and windswept British archipelago situated about 300 miles northeast of Cape Horn in the South Atlantic.
 The vast human migration to California set off by the discovery of gold affected even the remote Falklands. While a grand total of eight ships from the East Coast of the United States visited San Francisco in 1848, one year later nearly 800 vessels cleared Eastern ports bound for the Golden Gate, virtually all of them by way of Cape Horn. Given its location near the Horn, Stanley -- the Falklands' tiny capital and principal harbor -- was an important stop for repairs and provisioning, and the port's economy boomed.
 But Stanley apparently was not the port
of choice for 19th-century shipowners and captains. The few local companies able
to handle ship repairs charged such
excessive rates that it often made more sense to sell a damaged vessel for use as a storage hulk, jetty head or source of building materials.
 Despite its bad name among mariners, Stanley continued to serve ships until
the demise of the Cape Horn route, which followed the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914.
 Today maritime historians consider the Falklands the world's largest graveyard of 19th-century ships, and one of the most evocative reminders of the Gold Rush -- the sole survivor of the 1849 flotilla that converged on San Francisco -- is to be found at Goose Green, an hour and a half from Stanley over a fairly rocky road. Now just a partly submerged hull, preserved largely because of the sub-Antarctic cold and a protective seaward dock, the Vicar of Bray made its 1849 trip to San Francisco from the west coast of South America. The ship carried a cargo of mercury, an important ingredient in the processing of gold, and as soon as it dropped anchor the crew deserted and headed for the "diggins" in the Sierra foothills.
 The Vicar escaped the fate of much of the flotilla -- landfill in the bay for an expanding city -- because the captain was able to hire new hands at $80 a month, up from $10 just a few weeks earlier. The ship sailed for about 30 more years, part of that time on the London-Falklands route, and eventually became a coal hulk, or floating warehouse, at Goose Green.
 Given the Falklands' present population of 2,500 -- "barely enough to provide a good parade, never mind a crowd," according to John Fowler, the manager of the Falkland Islands Tourist Board -- the Gold Rush celebration will be decidedly low key. The principal public act of commemoration will be the issue of a special set of four postage stamps, including two that depict the Vicar of Bray and Stanley harbor in 1849. An American tour operator, Tread Lightly, (800) 643-0060, is organizing a two-week Gold Rush Days group tour to the Falklands in December 1999 that will be accompanied by Nicholas Dean, an authority on the islands' maritime history.

An Even Exchange

BYLINE: By Karla Kuban; Karla Kuban is author of the novel "Marchlands."

 BODY:
At first glance, Taos, N.M., seemed to be heaven on earth. I moved there because it's beautiful: celery-sage-covered mesas, peach orchards, verdant pastures, mountain meadows full of clematis and fairy slippers, howling coyotes, the Rio Grande abundant with cutthroat trout.
My third week there I ran into a friend at the post office, and we walked next door to Dori's for coffee. When he warned me I should be careful in Taos -- lock my bike, bolt my doors, don't walk alone at night -- I was surprised. For all its beauty, he said, raising an eyebrow, Taos was a dark little place. 
 Taos has three major cultural communities -- Pueblo Indian, Hispanic and Anglo -- and has a high unemployment rate, 15 percent. When I went to the post office, our postal clerk handed my bundled mail to me. "Look at that," he said, glancing at a Taos News headline: "Teen Receives Skull Fracture in Fight on Bent Street." I had seen many headlines like it describing stabbing deaths, rapes, assaults with crowbars and other violent crimes. "That's sad," he continued. "That's sorry."
In 1997 Taos County police dispatchers received more than 16,000 calls. Nineteen local police officers, 13 New Mexico State Police officers and 18 Taos County sheriff's department officers serve a county of 28,000 inhabitants.
The newspaper had been reporting a peeping Tom for months, and a man was finally arrested. I learned he was one of the crew workers in my yard. He had knocked on my door and asked for my key so he could repair the balcony over the weekend while I was out of town. "How did you know I was going out of town?" I asked. He said he forgot.
A female friend and I went out for breakfast. I told her I was feeling unsafe. She pulled a .38 special out of her backpack and laid it on the table. I didn't feel that unsafe, I told her. Get one, she said. I couldn't. I was terrified of guns.
As I was riding my horse on a back road, four boys in a low rider pulled up, jeering and launching beer bottles over their car. The one on the passenger side, a kid, maybe 12, told me they could make me get off my horse and go with them. He pointed a finger at me and pulled the trigger. Blam, he mouthed.
I knew that violence was rarely random and without warning. Yet, at night, alone in my house, I began to worry. I could get a dog. I could take a course in self-defense.
I asked another friend whether I should buy a gun. He had one, he said. His former wife carried a short-barrelled .357 in her purse. Almost every woman he knew in Taos carried a gun.
At the post office I saw the kid from the low rider who had fired his finger at me. He was with a tiny woman who might have been his mother, and I was unafraid of him there. As he walked by I grabbed his arm. Hello, I said through clenched teeth. He stared vacantly into my eyes. He didn't ask, How do I know you; never mind, Did I scare you? I wanted to slap him for pointing a finger at me and pretending to shoot.
While crime around the country was decreasing, I realized I had chosen to live in a place where I felt more fearful than I ever had. I had made the wrong decision in moving there.
I went to the Wild West Trading Company, where Mike asked, "May I help you?" I filled out the Brady Bill form in case, down the road, he could help me.
A friend called to tell me that at 3 A.M. she woke to gunshots under her window, and when police arrived they found six bullet holes in the adobe wall of her house.
A few weeks later I went back to the gun store and saw Mike. I looked at several kinds of guns and within an hour I brought my new .357 home, three-fingering it gingerly by the butt of the stock as if it were dirty business, contaminated or unsanitary, the way I might have lifted a dead mouse by its tail and tossed it into the garbage.
Considering that my father is a gun collector and that I grew up with Remington, Ruger and Merkel rifles, Super Blackhawk .44 magnums, a Colt pistol and a Mossberg shotgun, to name a few, you would think I'd rest easy with a gun in my bedside drawer. But I knew that if someone broke into my house and I pulled out my gun, I had to shoot to kill. If I couldn't, I might die. Everything falls under headings: safety and fear, tranquillity and distress, darkness and light. Our every move is defined by antipodal forces. A gun's components bear contradictions: coldness and heat, pull giving way to push, a deafening blast followed by silence. My fear had shifted. In buying a gun I had exchanged one fear for another, perhaps even elevated it. But I could live with that.

HEADLINE: ART;
Lost in the Glow Of the Man at Her Side

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
THE history of 20th-century art has had more than its share of female artists whose achievements have been overshadowed by the art of their better-known male companions. The list includes Sonia Delaunay, Lee Krasner, Frida Kahlo, Helen Torr, Marguerite Zorach and Anni Albers. Georgia O'Keeffe is one of the few exempted from this category, largely because her husband, the photographer Alfred Steiglitz, worked tirelessly on her behalf.
Of course, the importance of the male halves in the relationships varies a lot, as demonstrated simply by reciting, in parallel order, the names of the men attached to the women listed above: Robert Delaunay, Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera, Arthur Dove, William Zorach and Josef Albers. But in comparison, the work of their female companions has received proportionately far less attention. One almost suspects some unwritten (or should we say unconscious?) agreement that a closer look at the women's art would be too threatening to the significance of their significant others. 
 But what is threatened is not so much an individual artist's stature as our understanding of artistic invention, and our tendency to view it as the province of a single artist rather than something shared and by definition collaborative. Lee Krasner, for example, is not equal in stature or importance to Jackson Pollock, and no amount of historical research will make her so. But her work deserves examination, and its quality, especially early on, strongly suggests that she had a role in Pollock's development -- that it would not have been the same without her.
It may be fine for Picasso to have identified Braque as "ma femme" during the early years of Cubism; it is less so for artists, or the art historians who tend their flames, to identify the women who really were their wives as artistic partners. But no artist is an island -- be he, or she, a movie director, composer or painter.
Which brings us to "Gabriele Munter: The Expressionist Years, 1903-1920," an exhibition of 70 paintings, drawings and prints at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond through Sept. 20. Even for students and knowledgeable admirers of 20th-century art, Munter (1877-1962) is little more than an elusive presence in the annals of German Expressionism. For decades she has been mentioned in these histories, when mentioned at all, as pupil and companion of the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. Such citings can't be avoided: with Kandinsky, Munter was one of the founding members of the Blaue Reiter group in 1911. But she did much more than that.
This show was organized by Reinhold Heller, a professor of art history at the University of Chicago, for the Milwaukee Art Museum, which has the largest group of works by Munter, 11 in all, outside Germany. Showing roughly a third of Munter's output during the period under scrutiny and none of her later paintings, the exhibition cannot be considered definitive. Still, it presents enough work -- much of it being seen in this country for the first time -- to verify that Munter and her art deserve far more attention than they have received. Backing this conclusion is Mr. Heller's catalogue text, which draws on Munter's letters and journals as well as on interviews from the late 1940's and 50's. It gives the first detailed account in English of her life, artistic development and relationship with Kandinsky.
The relationship seems to have been fairly tumultuous, punctuated by passionate times together, by separations crisscrossed with letters that often involved lengthy discussions of art, and finally by recriminations and betrayal. Munter and Kandinsky, 11 years her senior and married, met and fell in love in 1902, when Munter, determined to be an artist and dissatisfied with her training, enrolled in Kandinsky's drawing class at the experimental, short-lived Phalanx School in Munich. It was just about the only place in Germany where women could study art alongside men, the alternative being a dilettantish "ladies' art academy."
Over the next 11 years they often worked side by side and openly lived together. Kandinsky taught her, already a skilled draftsman, to draw in a quick, loose shorthand style -- as the prints and drawings in this exhibition strikingly attest -- and to translate this approach into painting. He praised her natural talent and innate vision and encouraged her to try this or that method or medium. But he was not above pettiness, reacting jealously if she wrote of interest in another artist's work (Picasso's, for example); complaining that their stressful situation, which made Munter something of a social outcast, was just as hard on him; and condescendingly patting her on the head, as when he suggested in a letter from 1903 that woodcuts might be "much too much for the small, poor (lazy) Ella."
They spent 14 crucial months (May 1907 to June 1908) together in and around Paris, working on prints and absorbing the ideas of the Parisian avant-garde, especially the work of van Gogh, Gauguin, the Fauves and Matisse. But when World War I forced Kandinsky back to Russia and he finally obtained a divorce, he married another woman. Munter spent most of the war waiting for him in Scandinavia. She did not learn of the marriage until after 1921, when Kandinsky sent a lawyer to collect paintings of his in her possession. Of such a saga, one can only say: screenwriters, start your laptops.
It would be nice to report that the show in Richmond will knock your socks off. It won't, but it will peel them off gradually and surreptitiously. Munter was, quietly and forcefully, a terrific artist -- a superb draftsman, inventive colorist and daring manipulator of paint and pictorial space, thanks to an innately casual, confident touch. Her tendency to simplify reality into economical, nearly abstract components is in step with her artistically momentous times, and sometimes a little ahead of them.
Especially riveting here are a series of small, radiant landscapes made in Murnau during the summer of 1908, in which she builds upon the tenets of Fauvism by concocting more unusual, discordant colors and broadening the often stippled brushwork that the Fauves carried over from Impressionism. The resulting bold shapes, which are really little autonomous slabs of paint, grant her extraordinary colors full voice.
In "The Murnau Moors" of 1908, for example, the landscape progresses through fields of light yellow-green, turquoise and peach to mountains of electric blue and then violet, finishing with a sky of more, but softer, light green and yellow. These hues are dramatized by small, framing intervals of darker, more traditional colors, greens and browns in quick, fat strokes that indicate trees and low-lying hills.
In her paintings of the village of Murnau, Munter's colors become even more electric, in part because the actual facades were painted different colors, but also because their contiguous planes, windows and shutters gave her more options for contrasts within a more restricted space.
One reason, beyond her sex, that Munter is only now beginning to receive her due may be that she doesn't entirely fit the German Expressionist profile. The people in her portraits rarely seem troubled or anxious; only occasionally does a landscape seem at all threatening, as in the uncharacteristically drab, barren terrain that isolates the single dwelling in "The Green House, Murnau" of 1911.
Even so, Munter's natural artistic inclinations -- her emphasis on color, direct paint handling and distortions of reality -- may have contributed to the style's development. Without reproducing any visual evidence, Mr. Heller argues as much, asserting that in August 1908, Kandinsky and Munter, along with the Russian painter Alexei Jawlensky, worked together closely in Murnau developing a new way of painting. He claims that no one artist was dominant and that their works were sometimes indistinguishable. In other words, a three-person version of Picasso and Braque.
But Munter's work fits in at several other locations on the map of early 20th-century modernism. She remained far more within the orbit of the French styles, especially Fauvism, that influenced all the German Expressionists. For her, Fauvism was not simply a jumping-off point for a more rhetorical mode, be it Kirchner's bitter social satire or Kandinsky's dynamic rumblings. Instead she built directly upon it, extending it as other French artists, most notably Matisse, were doing.
Like Matisse, Munter painted for the sake of painting, for the pleasure of recording her perceptions of the visible world in such a way that the colors and forms on the canvas took precedence, but without obliterating that world. And like Matisse, she envisioned art as an extremely intelligent armchair that soothed but also stimulated.
In particular, Munter's "Still Life, Yellow" and "Still Life, Red" of 1909, with their blunt compositions, bright dominant colors and black outlines, are startlingly close to Matisse's work at the time. She seems not so much to be borrowing from Matisse as to be paralleling his exploration while using other inspirations, especially the children's art that she began to collect around 1908.
BEYOND the French affinities, Munter's ability to imbue her images with a singular personality, through color and paint handling, also relates to certain American painters of the same period, especially Marsden Hartley, who visited her in Munich in 1913, Arthur Dove and to some extent O'Keeffe. Interestingly enough, Mr. Heller cites a journey to Texas to visit American relatives in 1898-99 as a formative influence on Munter, who photographed the landscape.
Munter was one of several European and American painters who continued to narrow the gap between method and meaning that the Impressionists had begun to close. Her paintings told the story of their own making with directness and honesty in a way that Kandinsky's large early abstractions, for all their influential all-overness, never mustered. Subsequent painting has made extensive use of both approaches.
This exhibition and its catalogue may raise more questions than they answer, but the questions are fascinating and raise equally fascinating larger ones about the nature of originality and the collaborative nature of all creativity. In the meantime, show and text also open a very specific field of inquiry for other art historians and curators concerning Gabriele Munter's art, her role in the development of Kandinsky's art and her contribution to the modernist enterprise. Munter could be the last artist's helpmate of the 20th century to be recognized in her own right; and she may be one of the most significant.

With Occupancy High, Hotel Industry Adds Rooms

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
SEIZING the moment while the state's lodging industry prospers, developers are scrambling to bring new rooms to the market.
Occupancy rates are high and room rates are rising. And with construction financing available and the cost of building a new hotel close to, or on par with, the cost of buying an existing one developers see this as a good time to build. Existing hotels are also expanding, industry analysts say. 
 The state now has 518 hotels with 67,523 rooms and 12 hotels with 1,480 rooms are to be added over the next 18 months, according to CB Richard Ellis, the national commercial brokerage, which tracks the hotel industry. Some 22 more hotels with a total of 3,541 rooms are planned.
Most of the new construction is all-suite, extended-stay and limited-service hotels. But now the economic stage has been set for a rise in the development of full-service hotels, for which there is a shortage of supply and an increase in demand, said Gregg Delany, vice president of the Lodging & Hospitality Services Group at the brokerage's Manhattan office.
The new hotels are sprouting up or being planned along highways and near office centers. They also are close to transportation hubs like Newark International Airport and in resorts like Atlantic City, where the number of casino hotel rooms, now at 9,177, will nearly triple over the next three years.
Among the factors stoking the activity, industry analysts said, are a favorable economic climate, the influx of companies expanding within or relocating to the state and the corresponding spate of development of office space. In turn, business travel is healthy, said Joseph A. Simonetta, executive vice president of the Hotel and Motel Association in Trenton, adding that tourism in the state has increased.
Manhattan's tight lodging market is also affecting New Jersey, especially close-in areas from the Secaucus Meadowlands to Newark, said John A. Fox, senior vice president at PKF, a hotel and real estate consulting firm in Manhattan. "It's not just a spilling over of demand, but a rate play as well," Mr. Fox said, adding that for Manhattan firms looking for more favorable rates New Jersey is an option.
Over the last 12 months ending in June the occupancy rate in New Jersey hotels was 70.9 percent, relatively unchanged for the same period in 1997, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. Nationally, the rate was 64.3 percent. At the same time the daily room rate in New Jersey hotels rose to $89.04 from $84.03; in the nation it was $77.14, up from $73.31.
But Mr. Delany of CB Commercial pointed out that while occupancy and room rates for limited-service hotels are flattening because of the increase in supply, the rates for full-service hotels, buoyed by the lack of building, are rising. As a result, he said, "we expect to see more development" in this sector.
The next one to two years present a sanguine picture for New Jersey's hotel market. But Mr. Simonetta, of the state hotel association, said one wrinkle that could hamper its continued health is a bill that would expand the hotel occupancy tax law to permit all municipalities to impose the levy. Currently, only select cities may impose a tax, which is up to 6 percent for those communities.
THE bill, now in two committees in the State Assembly, would permit all other municipalities to levy a room tax of up to 2 percent on hotels with more than 100 rooms. Half the money collected would go to increase tourism and "provide advertising for hotels," said State Assemblyman Anthony Impreveduto, Democrat from Secaucus, who is the bill's sponsor.
The other half would go to municipalities to maintain and improve police, fire and emergency services since "hotels bring people into a community and put a strain" on those services, Mr. Impreveduto said. He said he was hopeful that the bill would pass by the end of the current legislative session.
Meanwhile, construction continues. One hot spot is the Hudson River waterfront, where 10 hotels are in various stages of development or planning. In Jersey City, where there are millions of square feet of occupied offices on the waterfront, one has opened, three are scheduled for construction within the next 18 months and two are under discussion.
The first hotel in seven years along the entire 18-mile shoreline opened last month in Jersey City at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Sixth Street, one block from the river's edge.
The 199-suite Club Hotel & Suites by Doubletree was developed by Hartz Mountain Industries, based in Secaucus, and Garden State Development of Jersey City. Room rates range from $149 to $189 a night at the hotel, the newest of six divisions owned by Promus Hotel Corporation of Memphis.
Near the Club Hotel, at the corner of Second and Hudson Streets, the Candlewood Hotel Company of Wichita, Kan., is to break ground in two weeks on a 213-room Candlewood Suites extended-stay hotel. And at the huge Newport mixed-used project at the waterfront's northern end, plans are advancing for a Marriott Courtyard Hotel, with 189 rooms plus 11 suites. Occupancy is expected in September 1999.
Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in Cranford, is moving forward with plans for a full-service hotel on a pier.
The hotel, with up to 250 rooms, will be part of the Harborside office complex Mack-Cali owns.
"We see a need for a hotel with conference and meeting rooms, which the area does not now have and for which there is sufficient demand," said Mitchell Hersh, president of Mack-Cali. He said construction is to start next year.
Among the other hotel projects elsewhere along the waterfront is the expansion of the 242-room Ramada Inn Suites Hotel at the 62-acre Lincoln Harbor mixed-used complex in Weehawken, a Hartz project. The company is expanding the hotel by 108 rooms.
Farther north in the community, Roseland Property Company of Roseland with Arcorp Properties of Weehawken is proposing a 300-room full-service hotel as part of an office complex to rise next to the ferry terminal there, which is to be expanded.
AND in Edgewater, the local Starwood Heller L.L.C. has a hotel on the drawing board as part of a residential, retail and entertainment development it plans to build at the river's edge. The hotel may have as many as 250 rooms.
"New York is underserved and there is a big shortage of hotel rooms in the riverfront area now," said Gene Heller, the company's president. "That's not to say the situation will be the same in three years," he added, noting that what it comes down to is "who can create a better product."
Suburban markets, with large pools of corporate tenants, are also getting their share of activity. Homestead Village of Atlanta entered the New Jersey marketplace last year as part of a national expansion program and is developing three extended-stay hotels in the state. The hotels, two with 140 rooms, the other with 141, are rising near established business corridors along Route 10 East in Whippany, Hoover Way in Woodbridge and Route 3 and the New Jersey Turnpike in the East Rutherford portion of the Meadowlands. Room rates at the hotel, which will open late this year or next year, have not been set.
"We look to see where corporations are locating their big back-office facilities and the north and central part of New Jersey has a growing number of them so they were obvious places to put the hotels," said Stephen N. Benjamin, vice president of development for Homestead.
That is also the strategy of Prime Hospitality Corporation of Fairfield. It is building a 128-room AmeriSuites hotel, its short-stay concept, on Route 4 in Fair Lawn, which is centrally located in relation to corporate centers in Bergen County and close to Manhattan, said David A. Simon, chief executive of Prime. It is set to open in January; rates will range from $90 to $100 a night on average.
Prime also is planning another such hotel in Edison as well as a Homegate Studio & Suites hotel, its extended-stay division, along the Route 1 business corridor in West Windsor, where it already has an AmeriSuites.
Mr. Simon said that while he was optimistic about the market because "the economy is moving forward, new offices are being built and there is demand for hotel rooms," he was also cautious. With all the hotels planned "we have to see" how deep the demand is, he said.

HEADLINE: Providing Places to Work, Places to Live

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
BACK in Trinidad, a half century ago, Ortner Murray "never dreamed" that some day he might actually own property.
The only real estate Mr. Murray knew anything about then were the acres that he and his 11 brothers and sisters worked alongside their father, a sharecropper, urging bananas, coconuts and corn from earth entitled to an English landlord. 
 Now, because of an innovative program called Storeworks that tries to bolster the fortunes of less-than-affluent New York City neighborhoods, Mr. Murray is about to double the size of his sportswear business in Queens, and, to boot, become the landlord of several rental apartments.
"I wouldn't say we were poor," Mr. Murray, now 60, said in rose-tinted recollection of his boyhood days, working the fields with a machete and living in a spare house by a rutted, rural road. "We were happy with what we had, wearing worn shirts," he said. "My mother kept us clean."
These days, Mr. Murray and his son, Gerard, 31, ship 20,000 crisp new T-shirts a year, as well as jeans, jackets, shorts and socks -- most emblazoned with their self-designed logo, "School of Hard Knocks" -- to distributors as far-flung as Japan, Germany, England and the Netherlands.
And soon, thanks to potent doses of support from New York City and a not-for-profit group, the Murrays will expand their business in a mixed-use commercial and residential building along an increasingly bustling stretch of Northern Boulevard in Corona.
"This is gold for me, owning properties back to back on this boulevard here," Mr. Murray said. "This is for my son, and he knows it."
The Murrays, owners of Von's Sportswear at 106-11 Northern Boulevard, will soon take over 106-13, the building next door, with commercial space below and apartments above, that has been vacant for 34 years. They, along with 30 other prospective property buyers, are the first beneficiaries of Storeworks, a program created by Neighborhood Housing Services, the not-for-profit group, in partnership with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
The program allows small-business people and first-time home buyers to take title to deserted, ramshackle buildings in struggling neighborhoods by offering low purchase prices, favorable mortgage rates and, in particular, a city subsidy covering the difference between the purchase price and the cost of a complete rehabilitation -- a "gut rehab," in real estate parlance.
Storeworks, based on another, more extensive program called Homeworks that is operated by the city and eight not-for-profit groups, seeks to take advantage of the current real estate boom in many areas in hopes of seeing the opportunities filter out, even into the poorest sections of the city. It is, to be sure, a small start -- with only 40 buildings in the initial phase, 31 of which have been purchased by individuals, so far -- while hundreds of abandoned, so-called "in rem," buildings are still held by the city after foreclosure because previous owners failed to pay taxes.
But it comes at a time when signs of vitality are apparent in once-desolate neighborhoods. Crime is down. Rents are up, evidence of opportunity for some and -- with $700 to $900 for a two-bedroom apartment no longer uncommon -- a harsh squeeze for others.
Main thoroughfares are cleaner, though many side streets and vacant lots remain littered and rubble-strewn. The bricked-up buildings of the South Bronx, including those that not too long ago bore cartoonish decals pretending to be real windows, are slowly coming back on line. In East New York and Brownsville, Brooklyn -- still shadowed, of course, by phalanxes of public-housing towers -- affordable-housing groups are building new homes and private investors are renovating old ones, so that whole blocks resonate with the clang and clatter of construction.
According to Department of Housing Preservation and Development statistics, there are currently 2,232 buildings containing 19,084 apartments held in rem by the city. The department had no breakdown, however, for how many of those buildings are of the mixed-use type targeted by the Storeworks program.
Storeworks, as it grows, said Richard T. Roberts, the commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, could be "one of the linchpins" in the city's efforts to "revitalize communities by renovating properties and returning them to the private sector.
"That creates," he said, "a platform not only for the properties themselves, but also for adjacent buildings. These properties become a catalyst. When a city-owned building is rehabbed, the adjacent owner feels an initiative to upgrade as well, attracting other investment, and helping to create a real environment for stability."
The underlying concept, said Francine Justa, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services, "is to target an area with as many resources, human and capital, as possible. And if it works well, we'll do more of them across the city -- house by house, block by block."
A key component of the strategy, Dr. Justa said, is a study course for the fledgling landlords. "It builds people's capacity to help themselves," she said, "kind of an insurance. If you go to our home-maintenance training programs and learn how to install dry wall, understand BX cable, learn carpentry and plumbing, it's insurance for your investment."
GILBERT WOODFORD has already had hands-on experience as a landlord, and at 73, is about to give it another try. In fact, Mr. Woodford has a variety of experience: merchant mariner, postal worker, freight handler for the New York Central Railroad, taxi owner and, currently, bus driver for special-education children.
It was in the 70's that Mr. Woodford first became a landlord. "I had a couple of apartment houses, 16-family," he said, sitting in his minibus outside the three-story building at 524 Sutter Avenue in East New York that he is buying through Storeworks.
As he spoke, workers carried debris from the now-cavernous commercial space of the gutted building -- across from a weeded lot and down the block from the storefront Roca de Salvacio Church -- leaving only bare beams and rafters eerily lit by a string of bulbs.
"Did that for 15 years," Mr. Woodford said of being a landlord. "Had enough trouble with tenants."
Then why try again? "I'm 22 years older than my wife, Clara," he said. "So I'm trying to create some income for when I'm gone." The Woodfords plan to open a laundromat in the commercial space on Sutter Avenue. "We love cleanliness," Mr. Woodford said. "She believes laundry should be done correctly."
Observing that the neighborhood "has come back a great deal," Mr. Woodford said, "As people come in, they're going to have to get their clothes cleaned." The Woodfords do not intend to live in the building right away, "but I intend to be around," he said. "And having experience, I know you've got to get good tenants." He expects to charge "$750, $800" in rent for the two apartments.
"When I got into real estate they were practically giving these buildings away -- $65,000 for a 16-family building," he said. The purchase price for the Sutter Avenue building is $135,000, with a 5 percent down payment of $6,750 on a 7.875 percent, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The gut rehab on the building, paid for by the city, is costing $261,148.
"The city realizes that in the failure of these neighborhoods is the failure to collect taxes," Mr. Woodford said.
Peter Robbins, project manager for Storeworks, said the city sells the properties to Neighborhood Housing Services for $1 each. It has, so far, allocated $4 million to rehabilitate the first 40 buildings -- 31 in Brooklyn, nine in Queens.
"The old procedure was to auction off abandoned properties, and what you had was a bunch of starry-eyed entrepreneurs who thought they could make a killing buying cheap and doing an inexpensive rehab," Mr. Robbins said. "What they encountered was buildings in far worse shape than they imagined. So they couldn't rehab because they didn't have the cash, and the banks wouldn't lend because the rehab cost exceeded the property's market value. These guys would stop paying taxes, and the city had to take the building back again."
The Storeworks program is designed to find buyers who have a stake in the community, and it includes a mechanism to deter those trying to turn a quick profit -- requiring those who do to pay off substantial portions of the rehabilitation costs. And the program favors buyers who will either live or set up businesses in their building.
Denise George and Phillip Ashby, soon to be neighbors, fit that double bill. They will both live and work next door to each other -- she at 710, he at 712 Washington Avenue -- in two of three adjacent buildings that Storeworks has acquired at the corner of a hopefully appropriately named street, Prospect Place, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
As Mr. Robbins pointed out: "The commercial strip is dense and dynamic south of Prospect Place, and we hope to bring that vitality to the other half of Washington Avenue. We're lucky we got three buildings together, because people will see that a lot of money is being invested here."
Ms. George, 30, an office manager with an architecture firm, is paying $180,000 for a building with 800 square feet of commercial space on the first floor, will live upstairs in one two-bedroom apartment and rent the other for "$700, $800." She plans to open a financial counseling business downstairs.
"It's my first time in business for myself, and as a first-time homeowner," she said. "It's a huge step, a little scary, but also a new-found opportunity." The rehab is costing $234,000.
MR. ASHBY, 29, a Fire Department paramedic, is also paying $180,000. He, along with a cousin, plans to relocate their currently home-based Internet business, New York City Web Corporation -- "we publish Web pages" -- to the renovated ground floor, and move in upstairs.
"It's a stepping stone that affords me the opportunity to have a commercial storefront and to market the way companies my size would, but without the overhead," Mr. Ashby said. "I won't have to deal with the exorbitant rent of a commercial space these days, being that I own the building."
Mr. Ashby estimated the market rate for the building at $380,000, "and a commercial mortgage would be incredibly difficult because you'd be putting down 25 percent up front." Under Storeworks, the down payment is 3 percent, or $5,400, with the rate on the 30-year mortgage at 7.875 percent.
It was in January 1997 that Mr. Robbins and other staff members at Storeworks began "windshield tours" of neighborhoods, stopping to knock on doors and talking to merchants, in search of the first 40 buildings.
After advertising for potential buyers in daily and weekly newspapers, the organization received about 500 applications. "They had to be city residents to qualify, and they had to qualify for a mortgage," Mr. Robbins said. "We asked everyone to send in documents, reams of paper, tax returns, bank statements, pay stubs."
Of the 500 initial applicants, about 125 completed the process and were deemed qualified. And on Aug. 6, 1997, a lottery was held to pick 40 finalists. Those 40 were then ranked according to criteria established by the city, giving priority to residents of the communities where the buildings were situated and, particularly, to those who live or operate businesses in the building. "Of those, 31 have signed on the dotted line," Mr. Robbins said.
Two types of mortgages are available to would-be buyers.
One is a Federal Housing Administration-insured loan offered through the Bank of New York that is usually limited to residential transactions. "If you are a first-time home buyer and you intend to occupy either the residential or the commercial space," Mr. Robbins said, "you can qualify for a 3 percent down payment. If you are not a first-time home buyer but still intend to occupy the property, the down payment is 5 percent."
The rate for that 30-year loan is 7.875 percent, "which is phenomenal as far as commercial buildings are concerned," Mr. Robbins said. Typically, commercial loans for the type of properties in the program have 15-year terms at 9.5 percent, with 30 to 40 percent down, depending on the financial condition of the borrower.
For an investor who will not occupy space in the building, the same loan program requires 15 percent down and the same rate and term.
Because the Bank of New York loan is government-insured, it carries rigorous underwriting standards and is document-intensive. "Often we have people conducting small, cash businesses who don't show enough income to qualify," Mr. Robbins said. "We didn't want to exclude those people we felt would have the best use for the property."
And so a second type of loan, not federally insured, was arranged through the Greenpoint Bank Community Development Corporation. "It's a no-doc loan," Mr. Robbins said -- no documents. "All they verify is the availability of the down payment; they don't check income." For that loan, the term is 15 years, the rate is 9.375 percent and the down payment, 20 percent.
To discourage "flipping" -- buying and selling for a quick profit -- the city places a non-interest-bearing second mortgage on the property in the amount of the rehab cost. If the buyer sells within three years, 100 percent of the profit goes to pay down that second mortgage. If the property is sold between years 4 and 25, the lesser of 50 percent of the profit or the balance of the second mortgage is due to the city from the owner.
As a compensating benefit, the city provides a real estate tax abatement. For the first 10 years, the building is taxed at its pre-rehabbed assessed value. For years 11 through 20, the assessed value increases by 1/10th of the difference between its pre-rehab and post-rehab value. So, at the end of 20 years, it will be taxed at full value.
"My personal read of these two subsidy mechanisms is that they make the building more affordable to people with lower incomes, because their annual expenses are reduced by the tax abatement," Mr. Robbins said.
ALL of which sounded like a real good deal to Michael Tate and his family in Brownsville, Brooklyn -- his wife, Wanda; his father, Bill Carr, and his three daughters, Asia, 17, Miasia, 9, and Nigeria, 4 -- all of whom pitch in to keep the family businesses going, particularly when Mr. Tate is shoveling coal into the furnace at nearby P. S. 150.
"He shovels 400 tons of coal a season, and has the hands to prove it," Mr. Carr said of his son. "Just look at those hands."
For 15 years, the family has operated Touch of Beauty, renting a storefront at 107 Belmont Street, where the sign says: "Curls, Dry Press, Neighborhood Florist, Funeral Designs, Balloons, Fruit Baskets."
It started as a beauty salon, but over the years diversified.
"I do everything," Mrs. Tate said, "hair stylist, barber, nail technician, body waxing, gift baskets, corsages."
"I go to Sarah J. Hale High School in downtown Brooklyn," said Asia. "In college, I'm going to learn chemistry so I can make my own product -- stuff to strengthen the nails. Since I was 11, I was passing rollers to mom, washing towels, being the go-fer."
Mr. Carr, the grandfather, works with flowers. "I do bleeding hearts for funerals," he said.
The family had been renting the store for $700. "The landlord stopped paying taxes," Mr. Tate said. "And when H.P.D. took over, the rent decreased to $500. But it was month-to-month; they wouldn't give us a long-term lease."
Then one day, Mrs. Tate said, "Peter Robbins paid a visit and told us about the program."
"And the lottery," Mr. Carr piped in.
Diversification was about to become expansion.
After winning the lottery, the Tates paid $125,000 for 107 Belmont, with a 3 percent down payment of $3,750. And last November, in anticipation of the $216,643 rehabilitation, they moved their business to a nearby store -- "next to the check cashing place, which is booming," said Mr. Tate, "near a laundry, a cleaner, a bank, a bus stop."
So, come October, there will be two Touches of Beauty in the neighborhood.
"We see this as a double opportunity," Mr. Tate said. "We come from this neighborhood. We've seen it coming up. Now we see ourselves going from nothing, a hole in the wall, to like the establishment of a mansion.
"I feel victorious."

HEADLINE: Filling the Need for More Tee Time

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
IN the early 90's, with the shade-tobacco business lagging, Kip Shepard and his three sisters and brother began to wonder if there might be better ways to use the family's 162-acre spread in South Windsor. "It had been a family-owned tobacco farm since the 1800's," Mr. Shepard said, "but we felt there must be some other way to derive revenue from our property."
The thought of building houses came up, but was quickly dismissed as an option, Mr. Shepard said. "For one thing, we wanted to preserve the open space and yet build equity," he said. 
 So what to do? "None of us is a golfer, but I knew that it was hard to get a tee time in the area because the golf courses were all overcrowded," Mr. Shepard said. "And I suggested that we build a golf course on the farm, and the rest of the family agreed."
So it was that a 6,580-yard 18-hole golf course, named Topstone for a onetime wholesale tobacco customer in Bridgeport, was built and then opened for business last summer on the site. Not too far away, in the town of Ellington, the last 9 holes of a new 18-hole course named Rolling Meadows opened on June 27 on what had been first a tobacco farm and then a dairy farm.
Using farm land for golf course development would seem to be at least one way of alleviating the overcrowding of courses in at least some parts of the state. But it is hardly feasible in some areas, like Fairfield County, where open space is at a premium and where tee times have been getting scarcer every year during the past decade.
Expansion of existing courses is another partial solution, but only when sufficient land is available. That is the case at the town-owned 18-hole Smith-Richardson course in Fairfield, where another 9 holes are scheduled to be built next year. This year, an additional nine holes are being added to several other courses in the state, including Quarry Ridge in Portland, the Stonington Country Club in Stonington, the Harbor Ridge Golf Club in Wallingford, Tashua Knolls in Trumbull and the Black Ledge Country Club in Hebron.
Though the second nine holes of Rolling Meadows only opened two months ago, John Gale said that he and his five siblings may add another nine holes in the near future. "We're doing very well and I can seen where there could be a need for another nine," he said. "And we have the space. Eventually, we'll also open a driving range."
Part of the Gale farm, which has been owned by the family since 1923, is still used for farming. "Two of my brothers, Andrew and Phillip, still grow corn and alfalfa on about 100 acres," John Gale said. "And my sister, Anne, keeps the books for the golf course and even helps mow the grass."
After most of the tobacco farm, including about a dozen buildings, was leveled during the 1938 hurricane, the Gale family switched to dairy farming. Then, in 1973, John Gale invested in the Cedar Knobs Golf Club in Somers, which is north of Hartford. "After that, I began thinking about possibly converting our farm to a golf course," Mr. Gale said. "I felt we had to diversify. Then in 1989, which was five years before our Dad died, I told him about my thoughts and he said, 'John, go ahead and do it.' "
Did all of his five siblings agree? "Well, not exactly," Mr. Gale said with a laugh. "It's hard to get six brothers and sisters to agree on something, but they finally came around." Ultimately, the course was designed by a Maine golf course architect, Al Zikorus, who also did some of the design on Topstone in South Windsor before he died a few years ago.
Although about 25 acres of farmland had to be cleared before the Rolling Meadows course could be built, scores of trees were planted, both for esthetic reasons and to separate fairways, Mr. Gale said.
By contrast, before work began on the Topstone course, hundreds of trees had to removed from an area that covered about 40 percent of the projected course, said Joseph Kelley, a part owner of Topstone. "We also had to take down about 12 tobacco sheds," said Mr. Kelley, who owns three golf clubs in Portland and was asked to become involved in the project because of his expertise.
Both new golf clubs, while privately operated, are open to the public at nominal fees. At Rolling Meadows, greens fees are $23 on weekdays and $25 on weekends and holidays, while at Topstone they are $27 on weekdays and $29 on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Nine-hole rates are also available, along with special rates for younger and older players. Rolling Meadows also offers season-long membership rates. Both clubs have clubhouses that include pro shops, restaurants and bars.
While Topstone and Rolling Meadows have been built and are already getting a considerable amount of use, and more than a half-dozen other courses are being expanded, plans are afoot to build about six more courses in Connecticut, which now has nearly 200 private and public courses overall.
Most of the projected courses would be the centerpieces of housing developments being planned. But so far, only one, Pistol Creek, which is scheduled to be built on 165 acres of private land in Middletown, has received all of the necessary approvals. Other projected sites for new courses are in Trumbull, East Haddam, Bolton, Guilford, Milford, Branford, Litchfield, New Milford and Harwinton.
Almost as many other proposed courses have either been turned down or delayed because of opposition from several sources, usually on environmental or conservation grounds, or both.
When voters in Bloomfield, by a 3-to-1 margin, approved a plan last November to borrow $6.9 million to build an 18-hole course on state-owned land, it appeared that the town would get its first public golf course. What made the deal all the more enticing was that the course designer, Peter Dye, had agreed to the job for only a $1 as a favor to a friend who lives in the town.
But then the Department of Environmental Protection vetoed the plan on environmental grounds.
"We're not so silly that we would have gone as far as we did if we had not received encouragement from the D.E.P.," said Ross Hollander, the chairman of the Bloomfield Economic Development Commission, and a proponent of the golf course proposal. "But then all of a sudden, the state administration became committed to the preservation of open space. They said that by building a golf course, it would interfere with hunting and general use of the space, when in fact no one goes in there now."
Mr. Hollander, who is a member of the Tumble Brook Country Club, the only course in Bloomfield, said proponents of a public course "are on track for another parcel," but declined to say where it was.
In Easton, a proposal to build a public golf course and about 100 luxury houses on 735 acres of property owned by the Bridgeport Hydraulic water company also fell through when the Aspetuck Land Trust, a conservation organization, exercised its right of first refusal.
The Land Trust then joined with the Audubon Society, the Nature Conservancy and the state to buy the property for open space at a cost of $12.4 million, of which the state will pay $6 million out of a $160 million fund set aside for the purchase of open space.
"The Governor's position is clear," said Dean Pagani, the press secretary for Gov. John G. Rowland. "He wants all of the land to be preserved for open space."
In Easton, as in some other cases involving efforts to use open space for golf courses, proponents contend that golf courses both preserve open space -- and, in the process, often beautify it -- and provide a recreational outlet for town residents. Further, they note, towns receive tax revenues from golf courses, both public and private.
Sean Garrity, the head professional and manager of the town-owned Smith-Richardson Golf Course in Fairfield, said it was becoming increasingly difficult to build new courses, or even to expand existing courses, "because of opposition from conservationists and preservationists."
"There are a lot of obstructionists out there, and it's becoming more political," said Mr. Garrity while adding that Smith-Richardson was adding nine more holes to handle an overflow of golfers. "It couldn't be busier than it is," he said.
With more young people becoming involved in golf -- many of them black and Hispanic, who've been drawn to the game by the success of the 22-year-old professional golf star, Tiger Woods -- another problem has arisen, namely, the availability of tee times on public golf courses, most of which are already overloaded.
"One of the solutions could be three-hole golf courses, where young people could at least be able to get out and play a bit," said Del Kinney, the executive director of the Connecticut State Golf Association, the governing body for amateur golf.
Or individuals can go out and build their own golf courses. That is precisely what Mike and Sally Donovan, a couple in their 30's with no golf construction expertise whatsoever, did in the town of Putnam over the last few years.
Mainly because Mr. Donovan, a landscaper, was having a hard time getting tee times at a course in Thompson, about 20 miles from Putnam -- plus the fact that he and his wife, a former school teacher, were looking for a new business venture -- they decided to borrow money from a relative and purchase 500 acres of mostly wooded property in the town that was available at a very reasonable rate.
On their own, over a three-year period, the Donovans -- after poring over materials on golf course design and construction -- proceeded to build an attractive, and challenging, 18-hole course in rural eastern Connecticut.
"People who ask who built the course still don't believe us when I tell them that Mike and I did," said Mrs. Donovan who often operated a bulldozer with her daughter, Bethany, strapped to her back. "But we did, all by ourselves, with help from the loggers who had to take down thousands of trees and from some family members during the summertime. The trouble is, we've been so busy running the course" -- the Putnam Country Club -- "that we rarely get a chance to play ourselves."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Of Endangered Lives, Real Heroes

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
WHEN it stays put, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater produces plays, in English and Spanish, in its own space on West 47th Street in Manhattan. Since 1969, two plays a year, with Equity actors, have been seen at the troupe's home theater at top ticket price of $20. But that's indoors, and not in summer.
This month, the company's main stage takes second billing to all manner of makeshift platforms and scaffolding, and the company, not necessarily with professional actors, truly travels. In motion, it remains true to its beginnings and its mission: "to bring theater to the people," in the words of its founder, director and producer, Miriam Colon. 
 Now in the midst of its 32d tour of parks, playgrounds, parking lots and streets, mostly in New York City, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater is staging "The Beautiful Soul of Don Damian," a dramatization of five stories by Juan Bosch, briefly president of the Dominican Republic in the early 60's. He has also been a prolific writer whose oeuvre includes novels, novellas, histories and political tracts, published from 1925 to 1987. The tour visits Danbury and Bridgeport this week. Performances are in Spanish, but a synopsis in English is provided.
Before a preview performance on Tuesday at Highbridge Park in upper Manhattan, teen-agers were breezing by on in-line skates or bicycles. Some were just hanging out; others were throwing basketballs and footballs. Children were spinning yo-yos and toddlers sliding and climbing on new play gear.
Shirts were not required; hats were O.K. Speakers blared combia, merengue, gaga and Afro-Latin music. Such was the real people's prelude to "The Beautiful Soul of Don Damian."
For the 75-minute performance, electrical equipment, costumes and sets had been transported on a single truck. Eight actors darted behind the roll-out stage for their off-the-rack costume changes. People sitting on folding chairs, resting on blankets or just leaning against trees watched Mr. Bosch's five stories being played out against fold-out scenery.
The short plays are about landowners and country folk, abandoned houses and erupting fires, endangered lives, horrific creatures and real heroes. In "Two Pesos' Worth of Water," one of his most popular stories, "the encounter between a woman's profound faith in divine justice and the brutal forces of nature" are depicted, in the words of the synopsis.
Ms. Colon's considerable acting credentials include stage appearances as Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" for the New York Shakespeare Festival and in the lead role of Federico Garcia Lorca's "House of Bernarda Alba" at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. Her many films include "Scarface" with Al Pacino and in "One-Eyed Jacks" with Marlon Brando; she has just returned from filming a version of the Oedipus story set in Colombia.
Of the theater's street productions, she said: "They are very self-contained. The action is extracted and choreographed around a non-literal set.
"The important thing is the basic stuff: economy, enunciation, interpretation, passion. We are telling stories we want everybody to hear and to feel, and our narrator is the guide."
The opening performances in Manhattan were held during Dominican Heritage Week, which ends today. "Bosch is a major patriarch in the history of the Dominican Republic who writes about the destiny of his people," Ms. Colon added. "None are of his stature and relevance. And this is our first Dominican work."
This is the company's first time in Connecticut, "We need to have the pride of giving theater away for free," Ms. Colon said.
The company's home on 47th Street is just five blocks north and one block west of the New Amsterdam, home of "The Lion King" (top ticket $75 to $85) and the Ford Center for the Performing Arts (up to $135 for V.I.P. suite tickets to "Ragtime").
"It's appalling that people cannot afford so much of the theater that surrounds us in New York," she said. "We cannot be part of the spectacles for hundreds of thousands of tourists. So we create our own."
 
"The Beautiful Soul of Don Damian" is to be performed on Wednesday at 6:30 P.M. at the City Center Band Shell on Danbury Green in Danbury and on Aug. 29 at 5 P.M. in the parking lot at Aspira of Connecticut Community Center, State Street and Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport. Information: (212) 354-1293.

HEADLINE: Can Baseball Shake Off a City's Economic Woes?

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
DR. ROB ZIKAROS said he was at a game earlier this year at Yankee Stadium, where he has box seats along the first baseline, when he overheard some fans in the seats behind him talking about the Bridgeport Bluefish. They had gone to a game at the Bluefish's new stadium, Harbor Yard in Bridgeport's South End, and had enjoyed it.
That made Dr. Zikaros, a physician who grew up in Bridgeport, practices there, and lives in Trumbull, the town immediately to the north, decide to attend a Bluefish game. On his way into the Harbor Yard stadium on a balmy evening with his father, John, and two young children, Matt and Jill, he summed up what seems to be the consensus about the team and its city. 
 "It's a comeback story," he said. Indeed, the Bluefish won that night, recovering first place in the Atlantic League with a 3 to 2 victory over the Newburgh, N.Y., Black Diamonds, and secured a spot in the league play-offs in September.
The Bluefish had been the center of the buzz in Bridgeport even before the city's mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, threw out the first ball in April. The plucky team seems to have single-handedly shaken off all of the city's decades of defeat and disappointment and ushered in a feeling of optimism.
Behind the talk, rife with baseball metaphors, is something more complicated, said Michael Freimuth, Bridgeport's Director of Planning and Economic Development. The Bluefish are a symbol and a focal point for public attention, he said, but the real cause for the optimism is the sudden blossoming of years of economic development efforts, fed by significant sums of local and state government seed money.
"The spring's been wound for a couple of years, and it's just sprung," Mr. Freimuth said.
New commercial projects, like wildlife emerging from winter hibernation into the spring sunshine, have proliferated so much as to leave some disoriented.
"It's frightening," said Paul Timpanelli, executive director of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council. "We have concerns about the capacity to manage all these projects simultaneously and have them continue expeditiously."
Mr. Timpanelli said there are discussions behind the scenes about quickly beefing up the city's staff of business development professionals to prevent this sudden boom from stalling. "Mike Freimuth can't do it all himself," he said.
Still, the Bluefish are the center of the whirlwind. From Mr. Freimuth's perspective, the quick and cooperative manner that the new team was established and its ballpark built, seemingly overnight in a moribund part of the city at the edge of its downtown business district, drew the attention of out-of-town developers to all that was happening in Bridgeport.
"It kind of woke people up, and now other projects in the city are being noticed,"
"There's a lot of people out there who are making the connection," said Jack McGregor, one of the owners of the Bluefish. Mr. McGregor and his wife, Mary Jane Foster, own a development company, Bridgeport Waterfront Investors. "We struggled for two or three years to get outside developers to look seriously at Bridgeport, but now we're on the receiving end of two or three calls a month."
The location of the Harbor Yard stadium is fortuitous. It is prominently visible from the Port Jefferson ferry, Interstate 95 and Conrail commuter trains that pass a few dozen yards from the outfield wall.
"I've had over a hundred people tell me directly they've seen the ballpark from the train," Mr. McGregor said. "They say, 'I saw it and I had to come by. I couldn't resist.' "
It is clear that baseball fans find the Bluefish a draw. Few of them, even those like Dr. Zikaros who do business in Bridgeport, bothered to visit its downtown in the past. But Charlie Dowd, the Bluefish's general manager, said neighboring restaurants have noticed an increase in business since the team began to play, and some have even extended their hours.
"It was an undesirable area," said Mike Mineo, a Stratford resident, who said his trip to Harbor Yard with a group of friends and relatives was his first into downtown Bridgeport in a long while.
"It's tremendously improved the spirit of the Bridgeport area," said David DeGrood, a retired Bridgeport schoolteacher who also lives in Stratford. He hadn't thought it would have as much of an effect as it has, he added.
Even Mr. Ganim's mother, who the mayor said "couldn't tell a foul ball from a line drive," has become an enthusiastic fan. On opening day, she said she only wanted to stay long enough to watch her son throw out the first ball, but instead stayed for the whole game. She's gone back for three more games, he said.
Early in the season, average attendance at the games ranged between 3,000 and 4,000, but by early July it had swollen to nearly 5,000, nearly filling the 5,300-seat stadium to capacity. Mr. McGregor said he expects that to be the average attendance for the second half of the season that will end on Labor Day.
For Mr. Freimuth, the team is emblematic of Bridgeport's new growth surge. "It puts the name of the city across the chest of somebody rooting to win," he said. But, he noted, it is hardly the whole story.
He said the memory of the city's failure to gain approval of a casino three years ago has faded, and along with it the resignation to an economic slump.
More conventional development projects gradually gathered momentum. A moribund downtown mall was converted to house Housatonic Community-Technical College. Fairfield County's state police barracks was moved to Bridgeport. A new ferry terminal was built, and a combination bus and train station is in the works.
Industrial property in the city's West End was redeveloped, and important new truck routes are being built linking parts of the East Side and downtown. Several large retail stores opened, and more are being built. Most of these developments were done wholly or partly with millions of dollars of state and local grants and loans.
Mr. Ganim noted that a $900 million development of the Steel Point property on the east side of Bridgeport Harbor is progressing. "That's nothing to sneeze at," he said.
Mr. McGregor said he expects to announce two new projects by the end of the year, one of them rumored to be a skating rink complex.
The opening of the Bluefish's baseball season corresponded with the start of the construction season as well as the release of much of the public financing that had been in the pipeline for years, Mr. Freimuth said.
He acknowledged Mr. Timpanelli's concern over the ability of the city government to manage the new growth. "We're working 100-hour weeks right now," he said. "That's very taxing on the staff."
To address this, the City Council recently authorized the hiring of two new development officers, and he and other city officials are putting together plans for a Development Management Division that will be independent of his department.
But he was more than happy to cheer on the Bluefish, both as a fan and as an economic development official. "I think the city needed a good old-fashioned serving of apple pie," he said.

HEADLINE: Youths See Summer Jobs As Training For the Future

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN a job market with strikingly low unemployment, many high school and college students in Westchester have been busily at work filling vacancies in a variety of job categories this summer. Like Andre Williams, 15, a busboy in Mount Vernon; Toni Susi, 16, an aspiring actress in Yorktown; Vincent Straface, 21, a peace officer in Rye, and Manoj Cheriyan, 19, a lab technician in Valhalla, they have been trying on part of their future for size.
Because he hopes to become a restaurateur someday, Andre is working in a Mount Vernon delicatessen, responsible for everything from preparing cookie trays to washing dishes. Recently he savored the rewards of his hard work (the job pays $5.15 an hour) by opening a savings account, buying two CD's and getting his fall wardrobe in order. 
 In Yorktown, Toni hit the boards this summer, playing the lead role in "Hello, Dolly!" at the Yorktown Theater Workshop and following in at least one of the footsteps of her idol, Barbra Streisand. "She's my absolute ideal!" the aspiring young actress and singer said. But except for the proceeds from an occasional baby-sitting job, there was no money to go in the bank, although as she said, "In my own way, I'm investing in the future."
At Playland Park in Rye, Mr. Straface, a student at Westchester County Community College who is majoring in criminal justice, was sworn in as a public safety park ranger for Westchester in June. Packing a pistol and wearing the uniform of the County Police, he sets out every afternoon to maintain peace and order in the popular summer amusement park. For $8.50 an hour, his duties include breaking up fights and arresting those who commit petty larceny on the county's property.
A former summer lifeguard at a county pool in White Plains and an emergency medical technician with the Harrison Volunteer Ambulance Squad, he was honored by the county last year as a hero for saving the life of a drowning 3-year-old. "Now that boy is growing up to be the man he was meant to be," said a proud Mr. Straface, who will enter a police academy in Albany this fall.
And in Valhalla, at the county's Department of Labs and Research, Mr. Cheriyan, a student at New York University from Croton-on-Hudson who is majoring in biochemistry, has been watching tuberculosis cultures grow. Like many other teen-agers, he is using the summer to get a leg up on his future.
"Some of my friends are tending bar or working in a grocery store, but I wanted to get first-hand experience in my field," he said. "This is better than selling shoes." His hourly earnings: $6.10.
Some of Westchester's students sought employment through a Federal program for the economically disadvantaged. Others found jobs with the county or in the private sector. Whatever summer endeavor they chose, most have forsaken just hanging out at a pool for a taste of the nitty-gritty world of work. With unemployment rates low and the economy robust, it has been a profitable season for many.
It has not, however, been a good year in the New York City region for teen-agers who wanted jobs in the private sector, some employment specialists reported.
"For most, it has actually been quite difficult in that respect," said Marilyn K. Shea, a regional administrator for the United States Department of Labor. "I don't know any teens who have had much of a choice of jobs." Contrary to what some labor reports have indicated in other parts of the United States, summer jobs for youths are hard come by in the area surrounding New York City, and Westchester is no exception, she said.
Westchester's unemployment rate was 3.6 percent in June, the latest month for which figures are available. "That's way below the national average of 4.7 percent," saidJohn L. Wieting, regional commissioner for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics in Manhattan. But even though the hot United States economy was showing some signs of cooling down, it was only by a few degrees, he said.
In New York, among the state's 62 counties, only 7 had a lower jobless rate, with the lowest -- 2.9 percent -- reported in Putnam.
In many places, those kinds of rock-bottom unemployment figures have meant that youth unemployment is at its lowest point in a decade. In South Carolina, for example, any 16-year-old who wants a job can find one, labor officials reported.
And while overall unemployment dropped and retailing promised more entry-level, temporary and part-time jobs in the New York region, Mr. Wieting said, many of those jobs were going to older workers who want or need to stay in the work force and to women with families seeking flexible schedules. Typically, those kinds of jobs are found in restaurants, laundry and dry-cleaning establishments and in places offering amusement and recreation
At The Westchester mall in White Plains, Stephen Haney, an assistant marketing administrator, said retailers were indeed seeking "a more mature, reliable" work force and eschewing teen-agers who typically did not espouse a strong work ethic.
At the Galleria at White Plains, another major shopping center, it was a similar story. Stores catering to a young crowd, however, have hired young salespeople to match the clientele, opening some private sector retailing jobs to teen-agers, Paula Kelliher, a marketing director there, said.
And at the County Office of Employment and Training in White Plains, which oversees Federal funds for employing economically disadvantaged youths, Joanne Clementoni, a program administrator, confirmed that only some high school and college students were landing private-sector jobs, "I don't know too many 14-, 15- or 16-year-olds who found that kind of employment," she said.
Younger teen-agers, however, may have a chance at those positions now, because college students are returning to their studies. Susan Welling, an assistant director for employment in the county's Personnel Office, said summer hiring for teen-agers was opening again this summer. Playland Park is seeking ticket-takers, ride operators and cashiers, and lifeguards are a hot commodity at county pools and beaches. Lifeguards in the private sector, at private beaches and condominium complexes are also in demand.
Meanwhile, there is a growing worry that the Federal program for economically disadvantaged students like Andre Williams may be at risk. To qualify for the program, a student's family cannot earn more than $20,620 a year. "In a sense, they're punished if the family earns more," said Marlene Furtick, executive director of the Youth Bureau in Mount Vernon, where 155 teen-agers have found jobs at City Hall, Mount Vernon Hospital, neighborhood health centers and Y camps.
Countywide, the program -- known as the Job Training Partnership Act -- serves students 14 to 21. Ms. Clementoni, the program administrator at the county's Office of Employment and Training, said that economically disadvantaged students, who are mostly from minority groups, "traditionally lose precious academic ground over the summer" while other students from middle- and upper-income groups experience enriched summers at camps or through traveling.
Whites also fare better in the job market, according to labor statistics: whites overall have an unemployment rate of about 4.0 percent compared with blacks at 8.2 percent and Hispanic workers at 7.6 percent.
Those figures notwithstanding, the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives recently debated the merits of the 40-year-old jobs program for disadvantaged youths and recommended ending it in light of the robust economy.
Ms. Shea, the regional administrator for the Department of Labor, lamented that "$71 million nationwide will be zeroed out."
She said the program helps coordinate both job and academic skills for economically disadvantaged students who were also statistically in danger of dropping out of school and remaining unemployed.

HEADLINE: Office Market Booms in Strong Economy

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
AS a rising tide raises all boats, a strong economy lifts the entire Westchester office market.
"Almost 1.4 million square feet of office space was leased in the county during the first six months of this year, which is a 43 percent increase over the first half of 1997," said Michael A. Klein, who, as executive director of Insignia/ESG, oversees commercial real estate activity in Westchester and Fairfield Counties. 
 Insignia/ESG, one of the largest commercial real estate services company in the United States, provides services for a property portfolio of more than 165 million square feet nationwide.
"The Westchester office market is reaping the benefits of a strong regional economy and significant expansion by local businesses," Mr. Klein observed. "What's more, the market's strength is broad based, a far cry from the 80's when large corporate tenants such as I.B.M., AT&T and Nynex dominated the market. In the late 80's when those major tenants started cutting back and pulling out, the office market was hit with a serious downturn."
By contrast, today's leasing activity is being generated by a diverse group of small to midsize companies in a cross section of businesses. Represented are those in the financial services industry, telecommunications, software designers and health care providers. On the average, leases are for 10,000 to 16,000 square feet, and the mix of tenants is balanced, Mr. Klein reported.
Although much of the first part of the year's market activity involved companies moving or expanding within the county, Westchester also continues to attract companies from Fairfield and Manhattan, Mr. Klein added. "When you realize Class A space in Manhattan is now commanding $50 a square foot with Class A space in lower Fairfield at $35-$37, Westchester's going rate for Class A space, $25 a square foot, is a bargain," he said. "Take the largest lease transaction in the county so far this year: Starwood Hotels and Resorts 77,000-square-foot, three-year lease at 777 Westchester Avenue in White Plains. Starwood searched for suitable space in Fairfield and Manhattan before deciding to consolidate its Phoenix, Chicago, Seattle and Manhattan operations in the former Tambrands headquarters in White Plains."
The second-largest lease transaction this year within Westchester was the Lillian Vernon Corporation's move from New Rochelle into new headquarters of 65,000 square feet at 1 Theall Road in Rye.
"The timing was right for the company to upgrade," Mr. Klein said. "Lillian Vernon moved from Class B minus and C plus space in New Rochelle to Class A space, vacated by C.V.S in the Melville Building in Rye."
Other lease transactions include Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York's 55,343-square-foot expansion at 3 Skyline Drive in Hawthorne, Abitibi Consolidated Sales Corporation's 37,237-square-foot lease at 4 Gannett Drive in White Plains, Castle Oil's 35,000-square-foot renewal at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue in Harrison and Roper Starch Worldwide's 30,000-square-foot lease, also at 500 Mamaroneck Avenue.
"Although there was a nice number of these large-lease transactions, the market is still dominated by small deals," Mr. Klein said. "In fact, nearly 50 percent of all the space leased during the first six months was for transactions totaling 10,000 square feet or less with 69 percent of all space leased for 20,000 square feet or less."
Mr. Klein said that four of the five market areas reported an increase in occupied space. "Even downtown White Plains, the county's central business district, which has had high vacancy rates due to the return to the market of large blocks of space, saw its vacancy rate fall 4.4 percentage points to 26.5 percent," he said.
Westchester's largest market area, Westchester East, which includes Harrison, Purchase, Rye and eastern White Plains, was also its busiest during the first half of the year. Approximately 623,000 square feet of space was leased, up 79 percent from last year.
Overall, the county's midyear vacancy rate was 14.2 percent down almost 3 percentage points from midyear 1997, Mr. Klein said, adding that the county's average asking price for Class A & B space -- $22.46 a square foot -- rose $1.56 a square foot from last year's level.
As for new office construction, Mr. Klein said it was "almost nonexistent."
"I doubt that there will be any significant speculative office building until rents rise to the $28-to-$30-per square-foot level, which would make new construction feasible," he said.
Yet in Goldens Bridge, site work has begun on a 313,930- square-foot corporate office park consisting of two four-story office buildings connected by a main entrance lobby along Route 22, reported David J. Friedman, Northeast regional vice president of the Louis Dreyfus Property Group based in Stamford.
Louis Dreyfus Property Group is a subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus & Company, a family-owned business, founded in 1851 in Paris. The Property Group was formed in 1970 and owns and manages more than 2.5 million square feet of office space in North America and Europe and plans to develop and additional 2.5 million square feet.
"Our Stamford office, which serves Westchester and the Northeast, was opened in 1982 just at the time of major consolidations in the office market," Mr. Freidman said. "So we bided our time until the market turned around, and now we are back on track planning to develop several major corporate office projects in Fairfield and Westchester Counties totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet."
Goldens Bridge, one of the few speculative new office park projects approved for construction in Westchester, will not be completed until a major tenant signs a lease for 40 percent of the space. "We are in serious discussions with a possible tenant now," Mr. Friedman said, adding that site work is under way at the 58-acre property.
Sutton Park North, a 99,000-square-foot corporate office building in Valhalla, the first of three buildings to be built on the site owned and managed by the Dreyfus Property Group, is almost 100 percent leased, Mr. Friedman said. "Only 4,500 square feet remain," he said. "We've found that the demand for quality space is strong."
The prospective tenants are equally divided between Westchester and Manhattan who are interested in leasing space in two additional buildings planned for Sutton park, totaling 300,000 square feet.
Sutton Park North, named "The Office Building of the Year" for the Middle Atlantic Region by a trade group, the Building Owners and Managers Association, has features like an exterior of Italian granite panels framed by continuous gray glass windows and a vaulted glass-enclosed atrium.
"The two additional buildings will be equally handsome," Mr. Friedman said. "By building on a smaller portion of the land and putting much of the parking underground, we are able to preserve a larger percentage of the 30-acre wooded site in its natural state."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Dominican Tales, Acted With Pride

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
WHEN it stays put, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater produces plays, in English and Spanish, in its own space on West 47th Street in Manhattan. Since 1969, two plays a year, with Equity actors, have been seen at the troupe's home theater at a top ticket price of $20. But that's indoors, and not in summer.
This month, the company's main stage takes second billing to all manner of makeshift platforms and scaffolding, and the company, not necessarily with professional actors, truly travels. In motion, it remains true to its beginnings and its mission: "to bring theater to the people," in the words of its founder, director and producer, Miriam Colon.
Now in the midst of its 32d tour of parks, playgrounds, parking lots and streets, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater is staging "The Beautiful Soul of Don Damian," a dramatization of five stories by Juan Bosch. Briefly the president of the Dominican Republic in the early 1960's, he is also a prolific writer of novels, novellas, histories and political tracts, published from 1925 to 1987. The tour visits New Jersey this week for three free performances in Spanish, with an English synopsis provided.
Before a preview on Tuesday at Highbridge Park in upper Manhattan, teen-agers were breezing by on in-line skates or bicycles. Some were just hanging out; others were throwing basketballs and footballs. Children were spinning yo-yos and toddlers sliding and climbing on new play equipment. Speakers blared combia, merengue, gaga and Afro-Latin music. Such was the real people's prelude to "The Beautiful Soul of Don Damian."
For the 75-minute performance, electrical equipment, costumes and sets had been transported on a single truck. Eight actors darted behind the roll-out stage for their off-the-rack costume changes. People sitting on folding chairs, resting on blankets or just leaning against trees watched Mr. Bosch's five stories being played out against fold-out scenery.
The short plays are about landowners and peasants, abandoned houses and erupting fires, endangered lives, horrific creatures and real heroes. In "Two Pesos' Worth of Water," the synopsis says, "the encounter between a woman's profound faith in divine justice and the brutal forces of nature" are depicted.
Ms. Colon's considerable acting credentials include stage appearances as Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" for the New York Shakespeare Festival and in the lead role of Garcia Lorca's "House of Bernarda Alba" at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. Her many films include "Scarface" and in "One-Eyed Jacks"; she has just returned from filming a version of the Oedipus story set in Colombia.
Of the theater's street productions, she said: "The important thing is the basic stuff: economy, enunciation, interpretation, passion. We are telling stories we want everybody to hear and to feel."
The opening performances in Manhattan were held during Dominican Heritage Week, which ends today. "Bosch is a major patriarch in the history of the Dominican Republic who writes about the destiny of his people," Ms. Colon added. "None are of his stature and relevance. And this is our first Dominican work."
The company's home in Manhattan just five blocks north and one block west of the New Amsterdam, home of "The Lion King" (top ticket $75 to $85) and the Ford Center for the Performing Arts (up to $135 for V.I.P. suite tickets to "Ragtime").
"We need to have the pride of giving theater away for free," Ms. Colon said. "It's appalling that people cannot afford so much of the theater that surrounds us in New York," she said. "We cannot be part of the spectacles for hundreds of thousands of tourists. So we create our own."
 
THE BEAUTIFUL SOUL OF DON DAMIAN
Puerto Rican Traveling Theater
Tomorrow at 2:30 P.M. at the St. Columba Neighborhood Club Playground, 25 Pennsylvania Avenue, Newark; Tuesday at 1 P.M. at the Rosario Focus Square, New Jersey Transit Plaza, Broad Street and Lackawanna Avenue, Newark; Friday at 7 P.M. at the South Jersey Performing Arts Center, State Street between Fourth and Fifth Streets, North Camden.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
How a Man of Many Firsts Isn't Done Collecting Them

BYLINE: By James Dao; James Dao reports from Washington for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK

 BODY:
It is not often that a politician will look out of place at his own event. But there was Representative Robert Menendez last week, hands in his pockets and a slightly distracted look on his face, standing practically in the audience at a ceremony dedicating a pavilion -- to him.
But when it came time for the three-term Democrat to speak, the absent-minded gaze behind the owlish glasses became focused. The hands emerged from their pockets, chopping the air. And the voice, always silky, turned as forceful as an evangelist on Sunday. 
 "At a time when many anti-poverty agencies withered on the vine, this agency continued to grow," he told the audience gathered at the North Hudson Community Action Corporation, a group he has helped build with Federal funds. "It shows what government can do."
He has had much practice at this.
It has been 25 years since Mr. Menendez, the son of a Cuban immigrant carpenter and his seamstress wife, stepped precociously onto Union City's rollicking political stage.
Mr. Menendez was just a freshman at St. Peter's College when he helped organize a movement that brought Union City its first elected school board, ending years of mayoral control. At the tender age of 20, Mr. Menendez was elected to that original board.
It would be just the first of many firsts. In 1986, he was the first Cuban American elected mayor of Union City, bucking the entrenched machine. In 1987, he became the first Cuban American in the New Jersey Legislature. And in 1992, he was the first Cuban American from New Jersey elected to Congress.
Now, Mr. Menendez, 44, is looking to move up again. He has entered the race for the fourth-ranking position in the House Democratic leadership, vice chairman of the Democratic conference, a position many politicians in Washington think he will win.
But to people who know him, Mr. Menendez's leadership campaign is just the prelude to his real goal: a Senate seat. Mr. Menendez does not deny it.
"If he decides to retire," Mr. Menendez said of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, whose term expires in 2000, "that is something I would seriously pursue."
But to win a statewide race, many politicians say, Mr. Menendez must prove that he can appeal to more than Hispanic voters. And that is where holding a prominent role in the House leadership could help.
"It gives him greater visibility on the main issues of the day," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Camden who is a friend of Mr. Menendez.
Mr. Menendez chafes at the notion that his appeal is mainly restricted to Hispanic voters, bitterly recalling an early campaign where an opponent tried to portray him, as he puts it, "as someone who wore a sombrero, smoked a cigar and couldn't command the language."
As a state legislator, he says, he wrote legislation that spurred the use of fiber optics technology. And in Congress, he has worked at keeping New Jersey's seaports competitive by speeding dredging permits and expanding economic development programs.
"For the most part," he said, "our issues are broad based."
Still, Mr. Menendez has clearly spent much of his time in Congress championing Hispanic causes. He is one of Capitol Hill's most outspoken critics of the Castro regime, and has vehemently opposed any efforts by the Clinton Administration to loosen trade restrictions on Cuba.
He also was the leading defender of Representative Loretta L. Sanchez, a California Democrat whose narrow victory over Robert Dornan in 1996 was hotly disputed by Republicans.
Mr. Menendez must also overcome the image that he was elected largely because he is Hispanic. His district was drawn in 1992 to favor a Hispanic candidate, stretching from the Little Havanas in West New York and Union City, where he still lives with his wife and two children, through New Jersey's rumpled but immigrant-rich seaport towns: Jersey City, Elizabeth and Perth Amboy.
"Sixty-eight percent of the voters here are not Hispanic," he said. "You have to appeal to a wide cross section of people to win here."
And win he does. In 1994, he took more than 70 percent of the vote; in 1996 he got nearly 80 percent. Indeed, his lack of serious competition this year will enable him to spend much of his $1.5 million campaign war chest helping Congressional Democrats around the country facing tight races -- a sure way to build support for his leadership race.
As he worked the crowd at the North Hudson Community Action Corporation last week, Mr. Menendez did what good politicians do, promising to meet with local officials and posing for photographs with elderly patients, all the while shifting fluidly between Spanish and English.
"We want to welcome you when you are strong, healthy and at the top of your career," Michael A. Leggiero, the agency's executive director, told him.
Mr. Leggiero paused, perhaps for comic effect. "Well, not quite at the top of your career," he added.

What Drought? The Sun Is Shining On Shore Towns

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:
Farmers may call a string of rainless days a disaster, but for those who profit from tourism at the Jersey Shore, that is a formula for a bountiful season.
A spot check of shore areas and attractions shows that most are booming, though not across the board. 
 Steel Pier in Atlantic City and to the Ocean City Family Go Cart Park, for example, report that attendance is up about 10 percent over last year, said Anthony Catanoso, whose family owns the two amusement parks, as well as two others in New Jersey. The family's amusement business in Seaside Heights also is thriving, boosted in part by a temporary MTV studio on the boardwalk that has drawn thousands of young people to the beach, Mr. Catanoso said. But at his Dinosaur Beach in Wildwood, attendance has fallen off.
"In most places we are doing well, but not everywhere," Mr. Catanoso said. "Maybe the Canadian dollar is hurting Wildwood."
The exchange rate for Canadian money has been dropping against the United States dollar. That makes vacations in the United States more costly for Canadians, who make up a significant part of the tourist trade at East Coast resorts.
"If you want Canada geese, we have lots of them, but as far as Canadians are concerned, we have had lots of cancellations," said Diane Wieland, director of the tourism department for Cape May County. Canadians usually account for 25 percent of summer business in the county, but this year make up only 10 percent, she said.
But other factors may make up for the loss. "July was kind of spotty," Ms. Wieland said, "but August and September look like they are going to be spectacular. Gas prices are down, the economy is good, people seem to have more vacation time and the weather has been gorgeous."
Atlantic City casinos reported a 4.5 percent jump in winnings this July over last, reflecting in part the number of people going to beaches, said Alan C. Marcus, a lobbyist for the three Donald Trump casinos.
On Long Beach Island, inquiries about rentals are up, according to Jim Joeriman, manager of Prudential Zack, Realtors in Ship Bottom, though the number of actual rentals is down because the pool of rental properties has been shrinking.
Merchants in Ocean County report seeing more day trippers and fewer overnight or weeklong visitors, according to Jeanne DiPaola, executive director of the Southern Ocean County Chamber of Commerce. But she said that this summer of good weather has left the towns and business people with little to complain about.
Long Beach Township beach badge sales were down the first part of the summer, but "in August the money has been rolling in for daily, weekly and even seasonal badges," said Don Myers, a beach supervisor, "so it looks great for the rest of the season."
And with five weekends in August and Labor Day not falling until Sept. 7, the visions of big profits shine like the summer sun. "But don't let anyone kid you," said Mr. Myers. "A lot depends on the weather."

HEADLINE: IN BRIEF;
Housing Grants

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
Westchester has received three grants from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to improve services to low- and moderate-income households, County Executive Andrew J. Spano said last week.
Westchester's award consists of $6.6 million for its Community Development Block Grant program, $1.4 million for what is known as the Home program and $234,000 for an Emergency Shelter Grant program. 
 "This $8.2 million commitment from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is a welcome contribution to improving the overall quality of life for much of the county's population," Mr. Spano said.
The County Executive said that the community development funds will support new recreation, business and health services for the elderly. The home grant will increase the county's affordable housing inventory for homeowners and renters and "go a long way in meeting my goal of adding 5,000 additional housing units over the next four years," he added. And the Emergency Shelter Grant will provide rent subsidies for 90 families and offer eviction-prevention counseling, job training for domestic violence victims, safety training for children in shelters and literacy courses for homeless adults.
The block grant funds will be distributed to municipalities and non-profit agencies to improve parks and expand or rehabilitate youth centers and senior centers, among other things.
"These grants provide the county with the resources to improve living and quality-of-life conditions for two key segments of our county's community," Mr. Spano said. "By improving their lot, we improve the county as a whole."

AMONG many Internet enthusiasts, especially students, mentioning the Internet and regulation in the same breath is unwise. Veins swell, faces redden and someone announces, in effect: "Regulation would ruin it! We'll fight it!"
If they do, the bell for the first round is likely to sound on Sept. 30, the Clinton Administration's deadline for transferring the authority to register Internet addresses and domain classifications from its present, benign overseer, Network Solutions Inc. of Reston, Va., to a nonprofit international group. 
 What group? Accountable to whom? With what, if any, enforcement powers?
The answers to these questions will determine much of the Internet's future regulatory course. The history of radio, the century's first electronic wonder, offers clues: As the Internet's closest analog in economic, technological, cultural and psychological impact, it seems an almost perfect mirror image.
Before Marconi patented his "wireless telegraph" in 1896, instant communication was wire-bound to the capital-intensive and then largely nonegalitarian telegraph and telephone. Marconi's first trans-Atlantic transmission -- the letter "S" in 1901 -- portended not only military, commercial and maritime revolutions but, as Popular Mechanics magazine put it, "a new epoch in the interchange of information."
For the first time, communications could bind the globe into one, and anyone to anyone else within wireless range. Along with commercial enterprises, a subculture of amateur ham radio operators sprang up, nurtured by mail-order catalogues, technical magazines, wireless-oriented pulp fiction and the coast-to-coast Radio Relay League. No one needed a license then -- it was nirvana.
Not for long, however. Soon, Morse-code chatter overwhelmed limited frequencies. In 1907, wireless activity by amateurs garbled communications between the Great White Fleet of the United States and its home port. Some hams intercepted and disseminated proprietary commercial messages. Others transmitted fake military orders, bogus distress signals and false weather and navigation data. In 1912, amid confusion over the fate of the Titanic, one ham operator spread misinformation that resulted in an erroneous headline in The New York Evening Sun: "All Saved From Titanic After Collision."
Does all this bring to mind Internet gossip columns and today's system-busting, virus-spreading computer hackers?
 NOR is William H. Gates of Microsoft the first of a breed. Marconi initially insisted on leasing, not selling, his equipment and prohibited its use to communicate with anyone else's.
In fact, in 1903, the Kaiser's brother found himself incommunicado on a yacht in the mid-Atlantic with a German-made wireless. Spurred by Marconi's wireless snub of its royal family, Germany convened a handful of members of the International Telegraph Union. By 1906, protocols were adopted mandating wireless units on large passenger liners, making SOS the standard distress call and implementing other safety measures.
American interests resisted, but amid mounting signal interference, deceptive transmissions and other problems, Congress incorporated the protocols into the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 and the more comprehensive Radio Act of 1912. These measures required licensing by the Commerce Department of all transmitters (then virtually automatic upon application); separate radio spectrums for government, maritime and amateur use; confidentiality of messages and assigned wavelengths, transmitter power and transmission hours. Receivers remained unlicensed.
In short, the medium needed regulation to expand.
When voice and music broadcasting burst on the scene in the 1920's, the sequence recurred: a flood of transmitters (licensing had remained pro forma), growing signal interference, swelling complaints, pleas to preserve "self-regulation", expedients like the voluntary rotation of some stations' broadcasting hours and, finally, a series of conferences convened by Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover.
These culminated in a new radio law in 1927, which created a regulatory rubric under the Federal Radio Commission (forerunner of the Federal Communications Commission). Since then, newer technologies like broadcast and cable television, FM radio, satellite relays and digital transmissions have continually roiled the regulatory waters, resulting in deregulation of the medium that started it all -- radio.
Arguably, radio's early history foretells the Internet's regulatory future. No medium is an island, and certain communications issues are universal: privacy, copyrights, defamation, pornography, fraud, commercialism, anti-trust and parents' prerogatives over what passes home portals.
Stay tuned for many years.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Social Security, Chilean Style;
Pensioners Quiver As Markets Fall

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
OTTO VON BISMARCK, Germany's "Iron Chancellor," started a worldwide revolution when he created the first state-run social security system in 1883. No one seriously challenged that model until another man of iron will, Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile, installed the first privatized pension system here 98 years later, in 1981.
Today a lot of conservatives are proclaiming that a century of increasing government responsibility for social welfare is over in the West, and aging populations and dropping birth rates will make pay-as-you-go social security impossible to sustain even in the United States. 
 So they are looking at the Chilean solution: privately managed, individually owned retirement accounts based on the compounded magic of stocks and bonds, as a replacement.
But before Pinochet replaces Bismarck in any pantheon of jackbooted social reformers, his new model must first survive a test: the contagion spreading from Asia's deepening economic crisis, which is shaking Chile harder than almost any other country in Latin America.
In 12 months, Chile's stock market has lost more than 25 percent in dollar terms, largely in response to faltering exports to Asia and falling copper prices tied to Japan's economic slowdown. Some analysts fear that a deep recession will replace years of steady growth.
Although supporters of the Chilean pension system point out that the diversified portfolios in Chile's retirement accounts have eased the losses, pensioners and workers are lining up in the offices of pension management companies with questions fraught with doubt. Simply put, privatization has proven no panacea for the insecurities people feel when thinking about retirement.
"You are forcing me to acquire risk that I may not want," said Luis Felipe Jimenez, an economist for the United Nations, paraphrasing the fears. Andres Uthoff, another United Nations economist, added, "It will take a generation to see if this will work or not."
Still, the international response to the Chilean model has been bullish. Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay adopted some form of Chile's system over the last five years, and a similar system is working its way through Poland's parliament.
In Washington, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, as well as conservatives who include a former Reagan Administration economist, Martin Feldstein, have praised the Chilean experiment as a model for boosting national savings, stimulating economic growth and securing the futures of the elderly. Even a few liberals, notably Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, have said the United States should consider some privatization of Social Security.
"This is a megatrend," said Jose Pinera, who designed the Chilean pension system as General Pinochet's Secretary of Labor and Social Security. "The pay-as-you-go system is like the Titanic going directly toward the iceberg of an aging population and declining fertility rates. Fortunately there is Chilean ship of individual private accounts nearby."
But before jumping ship, policy makers can look at Chile's model as a lesson in what a privatized pension system can and cannot do.
Chile's plan requires those who entered the work force after 1981 to automatically put 10 percent or more of their wages into an individual retirement account, which is not taxed until withdrawal. (Older workers had the option of remaining in the traditional social security system). The amount of pension due upon retirement depends on the amount a worker accumulates, along with the investment returns earned by whichever one of 14 private pension fund companies the worker selects to manage the account. The portfolios are regulated and the returns monitored by the Government.
Once retired, a worker can put the accumulated capital into an annuity provided by a life insurance company. Or the funds may remain in the retirement account, from which regular withdrawals can be made. A basic guarantee remains: those who have not accumulated a minimum pension receive a Government allowance that can be considerably below the poverty line.
Critics point out that workers must pay high management fees to funds that, because of regulation, offer little choice in investments. Nevertheless, in their early years, the funds were a smashing success.
More than 90 percent of the workers who had a choice opted for the new system. The funds accumulated $30 billion by 1997, delivering a stunning 12 percent average annual return in the first 15 years. The savings rate blossomed from single digits to 25 percent of gross domestic product, helping to fuel a rapid expansion in the securities markets.
The winning streak has faltered in recent years, however. The average returns for the pension funds declined from an 18 percent gain in 1994 to a 2.5 percent loss in 1995, followed by gains of 3.5 percent in 1996 and 4.7 percent in 1997.
 
An Exit Strategy
Over the last 12 months, the average fund is down about 5 percent -- not bad, considering the plunge in the Chilean stock market. But the reason for the modest losses is instructive: The pension funds have been dumping Chilean stocks. They have reduced their exposure in the local stock exchange from over 30 percent four years ago to under 20 percent today, while acquiring more conservative fixed-income investments and foreign stocks. One effect is that the funds have effectively helped drive down the same stock market they once drove up. And the market swings have prompted some workers to put off retirement.
This illustrates one of the risks that critics of privatization are fond of pointing out: Linking social security and the securities markets may spread wealth in boom times, but it can multiply the intensity and effects of a recession as well.
How accurate a gauge the Chilean experience -- both good and not so good -- can be for the United States is not quite clear. No one, for example, seriously believes that the same system adopted under a dictatorship in a developing country of 15 million people would be so easily adopted or regulated in a country as wealthy, large, complex and politically voluble as the United States.
Meanwhile, Chileans are learning the downside of a system tied to fluctuating markets. "I may seem calm on the outside, but my stomach is churning," said Fabian Moraga, a 33-year-old computer technician. He has accumulate $10,000 in his pension account over 10 years. But with a chronically sick child at home, Mr. Moraga said, any risk frightens him. "I don't know what will happen tomorrow with these stock markets," he says.
Mr. Pinera, the Chilean system's designer, has a response to that kind of fear: It's all part of accepting individual responsibility. "I can bet you 10 to 1," he said, "that the average annual rate of return for the funds over the next 45 years will not be negative after 17 years of 11.5 percent returns."
Mr. Pinera may well be right about the odds. But what Mr. Moraga wants is a sure thing.

HEADLINE: STORM CLOUDS OVER WALL STREET: THE FORECASTER;
A Bear Sees the Return Of 'the Reality Principle'

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
MICHAEL METZ is relieved that the stock market has retreated more than 10 percent from the dizzying heights of mid-July.
If the remarkable bull run had continued, stocks would have just had that much further to fall and would have caused greater havoc than they are now, said Mr. Metz, one of the market's leading bears. 
 "I think the reality principle is coming back to Wall Street," Mr. Metz said last Wednesday at the CIBC Oppenheimer Corporation's headquarters in the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan..
"The reality is that Asia is not a passing fancy," he said. "The idea, which was the consensus going into the summer -- that you would have a resumption of 10 percent or 12 percent earnings gains in the second half of the year -- is disappearing."
Mr. Metz, a managing director in CIBC Oppenheimer's equity research department, said he expected cash to outperform the main indexes over the next 18 months.
Such predictions are not new for Mr. Metz, 69. He has been calling stocks overpriced for four years. But he is not a perennial bear. He advocated aggressively buying stocks during the gulf war in 1991.
He also advocated buying stocks in 1982, the dawn of the longest bull market in history. "Stocks were as cheap as mud then," he recalled.
Mr. Metz also wryly acknowledges his forecasting errors. "I have been wrong about the direction of the market," he said. "But I still think it has been overvalued."
A frequent pundit in print and on television, Mr. Metz has his critics and defenders.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, the chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company and a leading bull, criticized Mr. Metz -- with whom he has sparred often -- as being overly pessimistic, particularly on oil and commodity prices in the early and mid-1990's, and on the prospects for American productivity improvements. "Michael has been a bit of an alarmist about certain things," Mr. Battipaglia said.
But Mr. Metz also has his defenders. "Michael Metz has been victimized by the bull market," said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "He's the 'yes, but' guy in a gee-whiz world. I am certain when all this is over, he will be seen as more of a prophet than a fool."
Mr. Metz said he did not think the market's latest gyrations presaged a financial Armageddon. But he painted an alarming picture about the collapse in oil prices, which has been caused partly by reduced demand from Asia.
"If oil prices stay at $12 a barrel for the next six or nine months, you can say goodbye to the house of Saud, to Yeltsin, to Mexico, to Venezuela and to Indonesia," he said. "If you think oil prices are going to stay here for the next six to nine months, my advice is to sell everything. Because you're going to be in a period of unspeakable political instability around the world."
Mr. Metz suggested that United States policy-makers should put pressure on friendly oil-producers like Norway, Britain and Mexico to cut production and bolster prices.
Given his pessimistic views, it is not surprising that Mr. Metz warns investors to be conservative, accrue cash, pay down debts and selectively acquire beaten-down stocks like semiconductor companies and undervalued second-tier stocks in the United States and Asia. "Hong Kong hotel chains are selling at a huge discount to book," he said. "There probably won't be another hotel built in Hong Kong for 10 years."
He also sees bargains in some energy stocks. "I'd look at a lot of middle-tier exploration and development companies, and particularly those in North America. I was thinking of things like Pennzoil, maybe Swift Energy, Apache, Burlington Resources."
At the same time, Mr. Metz said he was more convinced than ever that the market has been in the grips of the bear since April, when the vast population of stocks began to slide, eventually pulling bigger stocks along with it this month.
"You have got an overcrowded, overinvested universe of market participants against a background where the so-called fundamentals are deteriorating," he said.
He ridiculed Wall Street analysts who expect corporate earnings growth to continue at unprecedented levels for years. "If you think about it, if you extrapolate on that, you're going to have earnings higher than revenues at some point. And that's not going to happen."
Mr. Metz was Oppenheimer's investment strategist for more than seven years until April. "Right at the peak," as he put it.
As for talk in the market that CIBC Oppenheimer was eager to replace Mr. Metz with a more bullish strategist, Mr. Metz said, "It's an interesting observation, but in any case, I was wrong" about the market. CIBC Oppenheimer has not yet named a new strategist to replace Mr. Metz.
The huge run-up in the stock market reflects a fundamental change in the people who are investing, Mr. Metz said. Americans who once put savings in banks now plow it into mutual funds and 401(k) plans, lured by higher rates of return. Such a shift, he said, "creates enormous vulnerability for the economy."
It has given rise to some misleading canards, too, in Mr. Metz's view. "People talk about the baby boomers saving more," he said. "It happens not to be true. What's happened is that the American householder has depended mostly on appreciation in the stock market to do his savings for him."
So, does Mr. Metz feel vindicated now that the market finally seems to be retreating? "No," Mr. Metz said, but he recalled John Maynard Keynes's warning about the foolishness of trying to impose "a rational structure on an irrational institution," like the stock market. "Every once in a while," Mr. Metz said, "it's wonderful when it seems to be more rational."

HEADLINE: STORM CLOUDS OVER WALL STREET: THE UPPER EAST SIDE;
On the East Side, A Market Blowout Is Just a Breeze

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
THERE are many prisms through which to view the state of the economy. Stock prices are the current fixation, of course. But there are also consumer confidence figures, the long bond perhaps. And then there is dinner.
Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque 2000 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said he sold more filets of halibut, chocolate souffles and creme brulees last week than he has in many, many months. At neighboring Daniel, this summer has been the season of the $5,000 bottle of wine. Elaine's, the famous local watering hole, has been selling filet mignon and martinis smartly every night. 
 Correction? Up here, that could mean: "Please recheck the bill. You forgot to add my goat cheese tart."
"Sometimes I have the impression when the market is bad people just want to eat more," Mr. Maccioni said. "In the last couple of days, I have been really focusing on this issue, and I have to tell you that I have seen more people drinking and eating than ever before. Maybe they just want to be good sports."
Maybe, market experts would say, they've lost their minds. Gurus and analysts aplenty contend that something has changed. That reality is finally throwing its wet blanket onto a market long fueled by euphoria. That with the Dow Jones industrial average down 9.8 percent from its peak just a month ago, the good times are over.
But on the Upper East Side -- where people think nothing of doing their entire grocery shopping at the gourmet market on the corner, where 28-year-old market mavens call nine-room apartments with walk-in humidors their bachelor pads, where the goings-on along Wall Street are watched with the same intense interest usually reserved for one's loved ones -- sentiment remained strong last week that the good times are now.
"You still see all the signs of a bull market on the Upper East Side," said Nicole Gresham Perry, a stockbroker who lives in the East 80's with her husband, George Perry, a specialist in commercial real estate deals. "You still need a reservation to get in the local hamburger joint, and the limos from Wall Street are lined up outside it every night."
Not that people aren't watching the market's movements closely. Some of the selling that has knocked stocks off their heights emanated from this neighborhood, as profits were converted into real estate holdings or, more often, plain green cash.
But the much-talked-about wealth effect -- the translation of money made on paper to money spent on stuff -- appears to be on an almost giddy high, as if New York's aristocrats subconsciously believe that spending in and of itself can help prevent a further, more serious, market correction.
"Even as the market dived, the business here has been phenomenal," said Christopher Dziadosz, manager of Eagles Antiques on Madison Avenue at 83d Street, as he leaned back into a wildly expensive leather chair. It thrilled him, certainly, to sell dozens of antique end tables and imported decorative pillows in the dead of summer. But he acknowledged that he was also somewhat frightened.
"We never see this kind of money coming in this time of year," Mr. Dziadosz said. "I'm perplexed. If people are skittish, why are they throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars at me?"
 ECONOMISTS warn that the stalling of the bull market cannot help but take a toll, eventually, on consumer spending. Indeed, with more people than ever owning stocks, many experts say a big drop would hurt the economy more now than in the past. And if so, New York's economy -- in which Wall Street has become the biggest force -- will feel the pain.
Merchants certainly recognize the connection.
"People have to feel rich," said Mr. Dziadosz, who recently sold a $45,000 English table the day it arrived in his store -- about three months and a day faster than he had expected. "There is an emotional tie. Sometimes a person isn't feeling great one day and they decide not to redecorate their apartment, and then their daughter marries a nice guy and suddenly they feel happy and come in and buy, buy, buy."
Remember the 1920's, when everyone was partying before the infamous fall? Or what about all those ill-timed real estate purchases in early 1987? If people uptown are reflecting on the past, it does not seem to scare them. In any event, stocks have not yet fallen enough for average Americans, let alone the East Side's upper crust, to be panicking.
"Nineteen eighty-seven was a real eye-opener to people," said James Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "They learned that the market can have very sharp drops but recover so dramatically that the average investor now views a market drop as a buying opportunity. I think it will take a lot, a very large correction, to really shake people up."
Of dozens of people working or living on the Upper East Side who were interviewed last week, most said they were leaving their money just where it was -- or even picking up some beaten-down stocks. "What I am doing is staying put," said Diane Terman Felenstein, a public relations executive who also runs a women's investment club. "I sold after the '87 crash. Then I wept. All those companies came back. So now I am in for the long haul."
Laurence Leeds, who manages money at Buckingham Research Group and lives on Fifth Avenue, shares his neighbors' views. "This is no time for panic," he said. "Most people have gotten some cash or bought some bonds, but I don't think anyone is running out of the market. They are going to reinvest at a lower price." He is giving similar advice to his clients.
 STILL others say they have no reason to worry about the market's volatility.
"Business is wonderful," said Selda Chender, an interior designer. As for stocks, Ms. Chender said she avoids all equities. "I lost too much money," she said. In 1987? "No, dear," she replied. "In 1974."
Peter Elliot, who owns women's and men's clothing stores bearing his name on Madison Avenue, said he could judge what was happening in the economy by which store had better sales.
"A woman shops when she's happy, she shops when she's sad, she shops when she's mad, she shops when she's glad," said Mr. Elliot, holding court from a wooden chair in his women's store. "When men are sad, they drink themselves into a stupor. That is probably why the men's business over the last week and a half dropped dramatically and the women's business has been phenomenal."
For those who have lived through decades of bull and bear markets, a swift and sharp correction off a giant base can seem almost inconsequential.
"You have to be practical and believe in capitalism," said Arthur E. Crumlish, a salesman for a high-end printing concern who lives off Park Avenue with his wife, Gabrielle, a schoolteacher.
Mr. Crumlish, 60, said he learned long ago not to liquidate stocks in a panic, not to spend all his investment profits, and to believe that a bear market is like an unwelcome guest who will ultimately agree to leave.
"You have to try and hope you're in a situation where you're assured of a basic existence," he said. "I always wanted to be so successful that you'd have to call me at the beach right now. But the important thing is that we've raised the kids and sent them all to college. I feel optimistic about the future."
You have to call the beach to reach plenty of other East Siders this time of year.
"People are definitely taking money out of the market and are buying houses out here," said Andrea Ackerman, managing partner of the Southampton office of Dunemere Associates Real Estate, which serves a large Upper East Side clientele. Ms. Ackerman said her record-breaking summer included sales in East Hampton of a small cottage for $5 million and a luxury home for $12.5 million -- neither of them on the water.
"There is not the kind of negotiating on the asking price that there used to be," she said. "Chances are if someone comes down 10 percent, that is about it."
In Manhattan, the story is much the same. "Over the last year, a lot of people have taken money out of the market and bought their dream house," said Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of Corcoran Group, the broker for 40 percent of the Upper East Side's luxury apartments. "Earlier, the market was our foe, because people were making so much money they felt it would be too expensive to get out," fearful they would miss out on further gains.
Are people the slightest bit nervous? "I am finding that our clients are talking concerned but not acting concerned," Ms. Corcoran said.
What gives economists, retailers, manufacturers and other participants in the American economy the jitters, of course, is the prospect that the affluent may start to act on their concerns. And at least some have.
"I've already reined in spending," said Ann Rapp, an art dealer who was out shopping along Madison Avenue the other day. "In the last few months, I've been cutting back on restaurants -- not that I can't still get a table at Mortimer's -- but I am cutting back. On clothes too, definitely. You've got to be ready."
Signs of incipient inflation could send the stock market into a steep plunge -- and the economy with it. Formal gauges of the cost of living remain in check. But the Upper East Side has its own measures, and, again, they involve food.
Cemal Tezean, who has been selling fruit on the corner of Third Avenue and 84th Street for three years, notes an annoying connection between market drops and the price of cherries, grapes and plums. "Stock market down, fruit prices up!" he declaimed. "Last week, I get a box of grapes for $20; this week, same box $28." Shoppers paid $1.25 a bunch, compared with $1 the previous week. "Customers complain," Mr. Tezean, 38, said.
Still, there are some people on the East Side who don't give the financial markets the first thought.
"I hear the bond guys crying," said Elaine Kaufman, owner of Elaine's, the Second Avenue restaurant favored by novelists, journalists and Woody Allen. "The writers aren't affected by it; they go on writing and just don't care. The small business owners keep going. The computer geniuses don't care. These people are just going on with their lives."

Monopoly: Nuclear Power Version

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
STATES around the country are breaking up utility monopolies, hoping to create a competitive marketplace for electricity. But that does not mean the monopolies are disappearing; some may just be turning sideways, moving away from vertical operations that controlled coal mines, power stations and meters and toward a horizontal business that manages huge groups of generating stations. Leading the turn, some experts predict, will be nuclear power.
Deregulation has attracted suitors for the generating stations and created an opportunity to operate them almost like McDonald's franchises. Big regional utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric, Duke Power Company and Entergy have set up affiliates that build or buy generating stations far from their home territory. 
 Two nuclear power plants in Maine and Pennsylvania have recently been cast out into the cold by owners facing deregulation and they have tried to market themselves like middle-aged managers laid off in corporate downsizing.
 
Small Consortiums
 "They will end up owned by people who can run them efficiently and do well, not by all these mom-and-pop utilities," said one utility shopper, Richard H. Bornemann, a former vice president of United Illuminating, an electric company in southern Connecticut that is part owner of several nuclear plants.
Few people think of a company running nuclear reactors as a "mom and pop" operation. But one of Mr. Bornemann's partners, Shelby T. Brewer, a top executive of Combustion Engineering when that company was an independent reactor manufacturer, predicted that the industry would become so consolidated in a few years that only two or three companies -- not scores of them -- would be running the remaining reactors in the country.
Making the right decision about old reactors is important to consumers' bills. In the 1970's and 1980's the utility industry wasted tens of billions of dollars on more than 100 reactors that were later abandoned before completion because they were uneconomical. It spent tens of billions completing others that should not have built. Now the industry must decide which plants can continue to operate efficiently and at low risk.
The idea of assembling reactors into chains is rather stunning. In the late 1950's tiny utilities banded together to tackle the giant new nuclear technology and the "Yankee" system began. The 26-year-old Maine Yankee reactor in Wiscasset has eight owners; ownership of Vermont Yankee, Connecticut Yankee and Yankee Rowe in Massachusetts was also shared. Now giant conglomerates want to manage strings of tiny reactors.
Mr. Bornemann and Dr. Brewer, together with Timothy E. Smith, a former industry lobbyist, made a bid late last month for Maine Yankee, which has been on the market two years. The three said they would run it as a "merchant" plant, selling its power to whomever wanted it that hour, that week or that month, like a taxi in a field previously served only by private cars. Many companies have built merchant plants that run on natural gas or coal. No one is likely to build a nuclear plant, but existing reactors could be sold by utilities and become merchant plants.
Their bid came too late. The consortium that owns the plant recently hired Stone & Webster, which built it, to tear it down.
Dr. Brewer's prediction might have sounded outlandish years ago. But last month the first-ever sale of an operating reactor was completed; the undamaged twin of the Three Mile Island reactor that melted down near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979, was bought by Amerigen, a consortium of Philadelphia Electric and British Energy.
But it will have competition. "We've said for a number of years we'd like to be an operator," said Cyril Guerrera, a spokesman for Entergy, which is based in New Orleans and supplied Maine Yankee's most recent managers. It already owns five reactors, and Entergy recently said it wanted to buy reactors, or at least shares in them. Deregulation enables the companies to collect some of their losses from their customers, and may spur them to sell cheap, partly because the cost of decommissioning reactors is huge.
 
Consolidation
 Analysts have long criticized the American nuclear program for having too many companies, each running too few plants to get any economies of scale or skill. Now the programs seem to face the kind of consolidation that has transformed everything from grocery stores to cable television companies. However it occurs, consolidation could be good for consumers, say people inside the industry.
But Roger Fontes, the assistant general manager at the Northern California Power Agency, which represents 15 small utilities that buy their power wholesale, disagreed. When one company owns most of the generation in an area, he said, "prices will reflect the owners desires more than the market demand."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Blacks Crunch the Numbers;
Figuring Out Hispanic Influence

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN seven years, according to the Census Bureau, blacks will no longer be the nation's largest minority group, for the first time since the Federal Government began keeping an official count of the population.
As the country hurtles toward this demographic Rubicon, the ascendancy of Hispanic people as the leading minority, in terms of their share of the population, is generating a range of reaction among experts on the country's racial dynamic. Some are fearful, sensing a lessening of black influence and an increase in tension as many black and Hispanic Americans compete to move up the economic ladder. Some are optimistic that strong alliances can be formed on issues like education, affirmative action and reform of Social Security. 
 Others argue that blacks will continue to set the pace with regard to the racial climate. Still others suggest that this dynamic depends not only on the increased Hispanicpopulation and whether the large proportion of it who are aliens -- legal and illegal -- become citizens and vote, but also on the rate of intermarriage with whites.
 
Less Strident
"This is a major demographic shift that's going to hit and it will have some significant political ramifications," said Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization that studies racial issues.
Among some liberals and some conservatives, there is surprising agreement that the burgeoning Hispanic population and the fast-growing Asian population -- both of which are much more diverse and perhaps less strident on racial matters than are blacks -- will alter racial dialogue that, as Jim Sleeper, author of "Liberal Racism" (Viking, 1997) said, has been dominated by "whites or blacks who have been locked in a kind of psychic and physical embrace for the last 300 years."
One liberal black civil rights leader, who asked not to be identified, said that as a result of the increase in the Hispanic and Asian populations "the emergence of class interests has the potential to be as significant to the next century as race was in this one."
For all the talk of solidarity of people of color -- in part, because both groups are disproportionately poor -- their interests often diverge. According to exit polls conducted by The Los Angeles Times, 47 percent of black voters in California supported a 1994 ballot initiative to restrict benefits to illegal aliens and 48 percent backed another voter initiative this year to curtail bilingual education severely. The two groups have also squabbled over control and jobs at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Hospital in Los Angeles, access to public housing in Chicago and political power in South Florida.
 
Often Allies
 If the Democrats hold on to the White House, a flash point may loom in the coming years over the next vacancy on the Supreme Court. In the wake of the retirement or death of a justice, Hispanic leaders will likely press for the appointment of the country's first Hispanic justice. That demand may put them at odds with blacks who feel poorly represented by Justice Clarence Thomas and want a more liberal black justice on the Court.
But the newspaper's poll also showed that 74 percent of California's blacks and 76 percent of its Hispanic citizens voted against a ballot measure that ended affirmative action in state hiring, contracting and public university admissions. And both groups are jointly fighting Republicans, who want to prevent the Census Bureau from using modern statistical methods for a more accurate count in the 2000 Census, which would probably increase minority numbers.
"The hope is that we can now begin to form alliances and it need not be a zero sum game," said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization.
The changing racial dynamic may also depend on another phenomenon. In the 1990 Census, 31.4 percent of Hispanic women who were married reported that their husband was non-Hispanic, with the overwhelming majority of these spouses being non-Hispanic whites.
In contrast, only 6.3 percent of black women who were married had husbands of another racial group. The census data underrepresents the black intermarriage rate since it is based on the woman's choice of partner and demographers note that black men marry white women in greater numbers than black women marry white men.
Still, it is clear that Hispanic people are far more likely to marry outside their ethnic group than blacks are. No one knows what this high rate of intermarriage between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites portends. The children of such unions could just as easily identify with the larger Anglo society as with disadvantaged "people of color," making the notion of solidarity with blacks either a reality or a pipe dream depending on which way they go.
"They could end up being honorary whites," said Ronald Walters, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. "We could end up with a situation like they had in South Africa or Brazil."

HEADLINE: What War Looks Like Now

BYLINE: By Robert M. Gates; Robert M. Gates, a career intelligence officer, served on the National Security Council staff under four Presidents and was Director of Central Intelligence under President George Bush.

 BODY:
After the bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the bombing of the World Trade Center, and the bombings in Riyadh and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1995 and 1996, Americans must face the reality that more such attacks are inevitable, perhaps using weapons of even more terrifying power.
Strengthening protection of our embassies and other official sites is important, and Americans owe it to our fellow citizens who represent us abroad to give this effort priority. But our people and our Government must accept another reality: as potential official American targets are "hardened," terrorists will simply turn to non-official soft targets -- businesses, schools, tourists and so on. We can perhaps channel the threat away from the United States Government, but not away from Americans. 
 So, what then is to be done about terrorism? There is certainly no shortage of opinions on this score. Some of the advice is wise counsel, and some of it is nonsense. I would count as nonsense suggestions from various quarters in recent days that we lift the ban on assassinating our enemies.
How, in this most politically open society in the world, can anyone consider choosing a weapon against which we are the most vulnerable in the world? There are other reasons not to go down this path, from the mundane (when last we tried assassinations, in the late 1950's and early 1960's, we didn't seem to be very good at it) to the philosophical (the assassin's bullet seems a singularly inappropriate instrument of foreign policy for the world's greatest democracy).
More realistically, and helpfully, there have been a number of suggestions for improvements in intelligence and law enforcement counterterrorism capabilities. No doubt, some ideas in these arenas have merit, and more resources certainly can be used to pay for reward money, improved clandestine human intelligence, and so on.
But, in truth, Americans can take pride in already existing C.I.A. and F.B.I. counterterrorism capabilities. Indeed, there have been important pre-emptive and law enforcement strikes against terrorists over the past 15 years.
No, the great deficiency in American counterterrorism efforts in the summer of 1998 is not strictures against assassination, nor inadequacies in intelligence and law enforcement. The deficiency is political and strategic. It is in the perpetuation of myth and deception and spin by both the executive and legislative branches of our government, by both political parties, who seem unable to level with the American people.
Here are some realities the Government does not acknowledge. Most of our counterterrorism successes are against loners (like the gunman who killed two people outside the C.I.A.'s headquarters in 1993) or against foot soldiers of larger terrorist organizations.
Our failures -- for example, to get the Pan Am 103 bombers out of Libya to stand trial, or to get more information out of the Saudi Government about the 1995 and 1996 bombings -- are the result of conscious but unspoken Government decisions about political priorities.
To get the Pan Am 103 bombers out of Libya would require an ultimatum to the Libyan Government that the two be turned over to a court in England or Scotland within a short time or our military would, step by step, day by day, turn Libya's military establishment and then its oil industry into a smoldering ruin. Of course, we would be alone, acting unilaterally, and in the face of near-unanimous international obloquy.
Getting the Saudis to tell us what they probably know about foreign responsibility for the bombings in Riyadh and Dhahran would require playing very high economic, political and security cards -- a massive use of leverage -- that would have longlasting and negative consequences for the American-Saudi relationship and our presence in the Persian Gulf. In both cases, our Government, perhaps wisely, has chosen not to act in such a blunt manner.
So, the first reality about our counterterrorism policy is that we face conflicting national priorities. The politically difficult and, indeed, unspeakable issue is whether the level of American casualties from terrorism is acceptable to our Government compared with the political, security and economic consequences of a far more militant approach to dealing with terrorism.
Another unacknowledged and unpleasant reality is that a more militant approach toward terrorism would, in virtually all cases, require us to act violently and alone. No other power will join us in a crusade against terrorism -- in fact, some "friendly" governments protect their countries against terrorism by cutting deals with the groups, allowing them operational freedom.
No political or economic sanctions would work. Only violence. Only alone. And only if we can figure out how and against whom to retaliate.
A third reality is that retributive violence, no matter how massive, almost inevitably begets more violence against us in response. Conventional wisdom holds that President Ronald Reagan's attack on Libya in 1986 chastened Muammar el-Qaddafi and essentially ended Libyan terrorism.
Not true. Many experts believe that the Libyan bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988 was, in fact, in retaliation for the 1986 bombing attack on Libya, and that there were probably other acts of Libyan terrorism after 1986.
There is no quick, clean or conclusive end to retribution against terrorists. The war is the quintessential "long, twilight struggle," with limited casualties on the terrorists' side, occasional appalling casualties on our side, and countless victims caught in between, as we have seen in Africa.
The painful question facing the American people and the American Government today -- as in the mid-1980's -- is whether to make a war against terrorism our highest priority in foreign policy. A war in which broader American political, economic and security interests would be sacrificed to our own jihad, or holy war, against terrorists.
This, then, brings us to the final reality of how Americans must respond to terrorist acts as we have seen in Saudi Arabia, Kenya and Tanzania. We will never prevent all -- or even most -- such acts. In the world of real choices, we can protect ourselves better. We can bring some terrorists to justice. But, above all, we can pursue policies and strategies that in the long term weaken terrorism's roots.
We can pursue a peace in the Middle East that does not kowtow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's obstructionism and betrayal of Yitzhak Rabin's legacy. We can carefully pursue a nascent dialogue with President Mohammad Khatami of Iran and not play into the hands of his militant domestic adversaries (who may see terrorism against us as hitting two birds with one stone).
We can promote human rights and political freedom in the Middle East as we did in the Soviet Union and try to do now in Asia. We can use force against the sponsors of terrorism, whether governments or groups, or, in the case of individuals, we can arrest and try them to show that our reach is, in fact, as long as our memory. And to show that those who send would-be martyrs to attack us do themselves invite martyrdom -- or American jail.
This mix of force and diplomacy, this reliance on patience and planning, the painful realization of more casualties to come, is not satisfying emotionally. It does not quench the thirst for revenge or justice; it does not offer beguilingly simple answers to complex problems and difficult choices. In reality, though, it is the only sustainable course.
But even this approach to dealing with terrorism cannot be sustained absent a broader American strategy for dealing with the world beyond our borders. No successful counterterrorism strategy is possible unless our leaders accept that the United States cannot insulate itself from the rest of humankind, cannot treat the rest of the world as a part-time interest or a political football, and cannot abdicate the responsibilities and costs and sacrifices of global leadership.
Republicans and Democrats alike must stop hiding behind public opinion polls that purport to show that Americans don't like foreign commitments, especially those possibly involving sacrifice. Americans in this century rarely have enthusiastically accepted international commitments.
It has required courageous and farsighted leadership in Washington -- above all from the President, but with Congressional support -- to persuade Americans of the need to lead and to protect our interests around the world, even knowing that the cost in blood and treasure may at times be high. Such leadership has been sadly lacking in recent years at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Terrorism against Americans will be a fixture of our world for a long time. Real leadership in Washington would help Americans understand the realities of this protracted war and the importance of consistent American leadership and involvement in a world caught up in revolutionary change.
Real leadership -- Republican and Democratic -- would speak honestly to the American people, without spin or cant or partisanship, about the realities of a world we dominate but do not control.

BIG OIL
A British Amoco
In the biggest foreign takeover ever of an American company, British Petroleum announced that it would buy Amoco (the name once stood for American Oil Company) for $48.2 billion, eclipsing Daimler-Benz's $40.5 billion deal for Chrysler. The agreement, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, would create the world's third-largest multinational oil company in net income, after Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. The combination is expected to create a formidable competitor. B.P. is known for its skill at finding oil in the North Sea and elsewhere around the world, while Amoco's strength is in refining its products into oil and chemicals and distributing them to consumers. (Article, page 10.)
 
BELL ATLANTIC
Score One for Workers
Proclaiming victory, 73,000 members of the Communications Workers of America ended a two-day strike and returned to work at Bell Atlantic. The company, which serves telephone customers from Maine to Virginia, agreed to guarantee job security to its union workers -- even in digital technologies only now being developed. Experts in labor relations called it a significant union victory. Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University, said workers in other industries were likely to be inspired by Bell Atlantic's agreement to phase out a nonunion customer service operation in Virginia. 

STOCKS
Global Tremors
No man is an island, as John Donne observed, and neither is any market. Stocks were battered on Wall Street and in Western Europe as investors -- particularly big institutional traders -- worried about the worldwide effects on corporate earnings of Asia's financial crises, the Japanese yen's tumble to an eight-year low and Russia's ravaged markets. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,4TK.TK, down TK.TK for the week, and with small-company stocks hit even harder, the Nasdaq index ended at 1,8TK.TK, down TK.TK.
 
GEOCITIES
Going Public, Keeping Private
Investors clamored to buy the stock of Geocities, which gives its two million members their own pages on the World Wide Web to display pictures of their offspring, their pets or whatever strikes their fancy -- a business on which it has not proved it can make money. It went public on Tuesday at $17, and the shares more than doubled that day to close at $37.3125. But two days later, the company ran afoul of the Federal Trade Commission. In the Government's first Internet-privacy enforcement action, the commission said Geocities had lied when it told subscribers, both adults and children, that it would not disclose personal information it collected from them. Settling the matter without admitting wrongdoing, Geocities posted a new privacy statement explaining how it uses the information it collects. The stock ended the week at $ TK.TKK.
 
THE ECONOMY
G.M. Strikes Take a Toll
The productivity of American workers fell in the second quarter at an annual rate of 0.2 percent after surging at a rate of 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year. The drop, the first in three years, was attributed to the effects of Asia's economic crisis and to U.A.W. strikes that virtually shut down General Motors plants for up to two months. Those strikes also depressed retail sales, which the Commerce Department said fell 0.4 percent in July. Excluding automobiles, sales rose for the sixth time in seven months.
 
DROUGHT
A Ravaged Cotton Crop
Texans and Oklahomans like to refer to their part of the world as God's country. After a 100-degree summer and drought that has cracked the red clay soil, a visitor could be forgiven for thinking its patronage resides elsewhere. Much of the cotton crop has been burned up, and livestock has been liquidated. Texas officials estimate that the drought will cost farmers and ranchers $1.8 billion and will drain $4.9 billion from the state's economy. Dennis Howard, Oklahoma's Agriculture Commissioner, said, "The ag dollar goes around Main Street six, seven, eight times, but it's not going around now, because it's not there." Nationally, the Agriculture Department said, the cotton crop will be down 24 percent from last year. If there is a silver lining for the two states, it is that their economies are far more diversified and industrial than they were during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's.
 
H.M.O.'s
Mismanaged Care?
Federal investigators reported that health maintenance organizations have billed the Government for administrative costs related to their private customers, bringing them more than $1 billion a year in overpayments from the Medicare trust fund. . . . In New York, the State Insurance Department asked Oxford Health Plans to increase its reserves for its New York plan by $152 million to insure that it could pay claims over the next year. The company reported a loss of $507.6 million for the second quarter. . . . United Healthcare's $5.5 billion acquisition of its rival, Humana, collapsed after the value of United's stock fell $2.9 billion earlier this month.
 
FORD
Lower Prices for '99
Ford Motor, the No. 2 auto maker, announced that it would cut prices across the board for the first time in more than 30 years. The decrease, which will affect 1999 model cars and trucks, averages 0.3 percent, or about $61, from comparably equipped 1998 models. But the prices of Ford's highest-volume cars, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, will fall by $1,000 to $1,800.
 
LIVENT
Brouhaha on Broadway
Creativity is a big asset to a Broadway producer -- but creative accounting is not. Livent Inc., the producer of "Ragtime" and "Show Boat," said an internal investigation had found serious accounting problems involving millions of dollars. The company, now led by Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood power broker, said its financial results would almost certainly have to be restated, and after an emergency board meeting in Toronto, it suspended Garth H. Drabinsky, the impresario who built the company and serves as chief creative director. Two executives said he kept two sets of books to conceal extravagant spending. He denied it.

HEADLINE: STORM CLOUDS OVER WALL STREET: THE OVERVIEW;
A Break in the Clouds, Or More Storms Ahead?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
LAST FALL, when the stock market fell more than 10 percent below its high for the first time since 1990, the reason was clear. Currency devaluations in Asia had aroused fears that falling export prices would hurt the profits of companies in the United States.
Ten months later, stock prices have again fallen 10 percent, from a higher peak, and the downturn can again be traced in part to worries about the Asian malaise. 
 But there are significant differences to the most recent decline -- a decline that has some people on Wall Street thinking that the bull market's long run has finally ended.
Last fall, analysts worried about a slowdown in corporate profits. Now they see dozens of companies actually reporting earnings shortfalls. One by one, historical yardsticks used to value stocks have toppled old records, leaving few measures by which this is not the most expensive market ever.
And though the broad market indexes have declined 10 percent, thousands of stocks are 20 percent or more below their peaks.
Not all the signs are so foreboding.
The employment boom has continued with little, if any, upward pressure on wages. Banks appear to be well-capitalized against possible losses in Asia and have little exposure to troubled markets in Eastern Europe. Though corporate profits are growing more slowly than in recent years, they are growing. Some of Wall Street's most astute investors say that means stock prices should end the year well above their current levels.
Trying to pin the cause of the recent decline on any single factor is as impossible as determining where the market is headed next. But it might be useful to review just what has all of Wall Street so upset.
Herewith, a survey of key factors in the recent turmoil, as well as some thoughts about outside factors that could send the market scrambling. EDWARD WYATT

A History Lesson: For Major Indexes, A Long Way to Doom

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
For years, both the returns generated by stocks and the valuations that investors assigned to them have vastly exceeded levels experienced throughout market history. Some argue that outsized valuations are simply a result of a new era of investing in which the old rules no longer apply. These folks are happy to pay 200 times earnings for America Online.
For the rest of us here on planet Earth, a little dose of reality now comes from the market watchers at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. They have collected data back to 1926 on two indexes: the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's industrials (not the S.& P. 500-stock index). 
 Let's begin with where we are now, based on two common measures: price-earnings ratios and average dividend yield, or the amount of dividends paid by the companies in the group divided by the total price of those companies' stocks.
As of Friday, the Dow stood at 8,425. It carried a p/e ratio of 21, and dividends paid by the stocks in the Dow group yielded an average 1.75 percent. The S.& P. industrials closed the week at 1,252.60. Its price-earnings ratio was 29; its dividend yield, 1.35 percent.
Over 72 years, the median p/e ratio on the Dow has been 15.3. How far off that median are we now? For the Dow to return to that valuation level, it would have to drop 37 percent, to 5,291. The median dividend yield on the Dow has historically been 4.3 percent, more than double what it is now. For dividend yield valuations to revert to their median, the Dow would have to fall to 3,353, or 60 percent below its Friday close.
If the S.& P. industrials reverted to the historical norm as measured by p/e, this index would lose about half its value, falling to 634. If measured by dividend yield, the index would collapse to 445, a fall of 64 percent.
Obviously, market experts don't think the averages will plunge to levels anywhere near their historical medians. And with most Americans certain that the stock market is the best place to put their money, continued demand for equities could keep their prices in the stratosphere.
The Leuthold Group has compiled another set of numbers that goes back to 1957 and includes only those periods when inflation was low. If the Dow Jones industrials were to trade at the median p/e ratio during periods of low inflation, it would fall to 5,972, a decline of 29 percent. The S.& P. industrials would have to drop 37 percent, to 788.
The old rules may indeed no longer apply to our brave new market. Still, it is better to know what history has to say than to ignore it. GRETCHEN MORGENSON

Currencies: A Global Drama: As the Yen Turns

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
"Now is the time to assess risks and rewards," said Mark Mobius, the managing director of Templeton Asset Management. As he headed off to Moscow this weekend, the list of risks was getting longer.
That list -- headed by the weakening Japanese yen, the threat of a currency devaluation by China, the possibility of a Russian devaluation and a deepening of the Asian economic crisis -- helped send stocks lower around the world last week and dampened the outlook. 
 Investors are fleeing emerging markets, where the spillover from either a Chinese or a Russian devaluation would hit hardest. Brazilian stocks dropped 6.2 percent last week. Mexican stocks fell 6.8 percent, and the peso hit a record low against the dollar.
American investors do not think the piling on of bad news has yet knocked the legs out from under the bull market. Many analysts, while predicting volatility ahead, say they think the combination of low inflation and resilient domestic growth will prevent that from happening. In Europe, the outlook is also still positive.
But the threats all but insure that the market volatility that was rampant last week -- the Dow Jones industrial average down 112 points on Tuesday, up 90 points on Wednesday, down 93 points on Thursday and down 34 points on Friday -- will continue.
The yen remains the biggest risk. It is the barometer of Japan's ability to turn around its own economy and, in turn, help all of Asia back on its feet. It is Asia's drag on corporate earnings that is disturbing investors in the United States and in Europe.
In the minds of many investors, the yen has also become the lever that could force the Chinese to devalue. So, as the yen falls, that threat looms larger.
After such a tumultuous week of bad news and short spells of relief, investors might begin to wonder if things could begin to unravel. Around the world, most stock markets are under pressure, as are many economies. Can the United States and its allies prop up Russia yet again? Can the Japanese Government get its act together? Is China playing politics, or is a devaluation ultimately in the cards?
That kind of uncertainty could unnerve the bulls. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

The Economy: Signs of Health And Rays of Hope

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
With the 1990's economic expansion poised to enter the record books as the longest ever in peacetime, it is shifting gears from the heady pace of the last two years to a more sedate one. Whatever negatives may be at work, the economy may well be a stabilizing, not destabilizing, influence for financial markets.
To be sure, the downshifting is a bit scary. Anytime the economy slows sharply, it becomes more vulnerable to outside shocks -- from a military confrontation with Iraq to impeachment proceedings against the President to a stock market dive. This time, investors are focusing on the implications of slower growth for profits. 
 But the slowdown was inevitable. Did anyone really believe that the economy, already having achieved the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years, could keep barreling along indefinitely? And a deceleration is just as likely to keep the expansion alive as it is to kill it off. If the Asian crisis had not come along to cool the economy, the Federal Reserve would probably have raised interest rates -- and it could easily, as in the past, have raised them too much.
The economy is healthier than it has been in decades. Compare 1998 with 1989, when inflation was picking up and the Fed was raising interest rates. The savings and loan crisis was in full bloom. Federal deficits stretched to the horizon. Consumers were up to their eyeballs in debt.
Now, government, banks and consumers are in better financial shape, inflation is low, interest rates are falling and the dollar is gaining strength. The recession in Asia, serious as it is, isn't likely to pull the United States down, too. The world's big economies, as the last 20 years have shown, aren't that synchronized. More important, the domestic side of the American economy, which accounts for 85 percent of economic activity, still has real momentum.
Consumers and home buyers, particularly, are apt to keep spending, even if at a more moderate pace. Jobs are plentiful, incomes are rising smartly after inflation and taxes, and total household net worth is up $12 trillion from just four years ago. No wonder consumers' spirits remain so upbeat. Businesses still have the means to add to inventories and invest in new technology. Cash flow is ample. Wage pressures remain moderate. Labor costs are creeping up a bit faster, but productivity is growing at a good clip, despite the dip during the General Motors strike. There is also the added bonus of cheaper energy and raw materials.
In short, if something comes along to knock the stock market down, chances are it won't be the economy. SYLVIA NASAR

Other Bombs: Any Big Surprise Can Bring On a Bear

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
If investors can be blithe in good times, they can be squeamish in bad. Especially when the market is trying to decide which way to go, outside events are often the shock that sets off a bear market. It happened in 1973, when the worst postwar bear market coincided with the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 also sent the market into a spiral.
And this year? Prepare for the unexpected. Any sharp negative surprise in world affairs -- whether an earthquake in Japan that shakes any remaining hope for an early recovery there or a setback in European plans for a unified currency that topples the Continent's high-priced markets -- could be the catalyst for a prolonged slump here. 
 Stock strategists see a few such hairpin turns ahead that will test investors' ability to stay the course. Here are two of them:
THE BOMB -- The Millennium Bomb, that is, also known as Y2K. Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities, has been warning that companies and governments are still a long way from meeting the challenge of updating computers to solve the year-2000 problems.
More to the point, the potential for the issue to unnerve market investors is growing.
Merrill Lynch & Company recently disclosed that it would spend $375 million repairing its own computer systems, $100 million more than anticipated. As other companies come to grips with the costs, Mr. Yardeni says, investors will receive a slew of unpleasant earnings surprises that could sap confidence in the market.
"I don't think Y2K is in the market at all," Mr. Yardeni said. "In this kind of market, people are looking for risk and uncertainty. One of the biggest threats to earnings is the year 2000."
THE PRESIDENT -- The stock market has learned to live with White House scandals, which have grown more serious in tandem with one of the greatest bull markets in history. But Bill Dinning, a Merrill Lynch strategist, thinks that such instability is not merely inside-the-beltway intrigue but gets more important the farther one goes from Washington.
That is because President Clinton is the linchpin for $56 billion in loans to 59 emerging markets from the International Monetary Fund. Some of those loans are lifelines to countries like South Korea, Thailand and Russia that are struggling to forestall economic meltdowns. If Mr. Clinton resigned, or saw his authority further weakened by enduring investigations and sharp Republican victories in coming elections, the political underpinnings of those loans could collapse, he said.
"The U.S. has played a significant role with the bailouts," Mr. Dinning said. "If the President is paralyzed by political and legal problems, people will have less faith that these economic adjustments are going to work."
Given that the United States has been a bastion of stability for the world, that is the kind of surprise of which bear markets could be made. JOSEPH KAHN

A Long-Horizon Mantra, With a Chorus of 'Diversify'

BYLINE: By DAWN GILBERTSON

 BODY:
In light of the market's recent declines, The New York Times interviewed three families with differing investment philosophies to see what, if any, adjustments they were making. The Times also asked certified financial planners to review the portfolios and, if needed, make recommendations. The results suggest that investors have convinced themselves that sticking with stocks is the conservative thing to do.
 
Close to Their Goal, Regardless
 Alan and Vicki Schechter of Dix Hills, N.Y., were vacationing in Lake Louise, Alberta, when the Dow swooned 299 points on Aug. 4. Hearing the news, Mr. Schechter, 51, chief financial officer at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, called in to check his accounts. 
 "He got aggravated," said Ms. Schechter, 49, a librarian at Frank P. Long Intermediate School in Bellport, N.Y.
"It just lasted for a second," her husband responded. "The scenery was too pretty."
Nothing could have mellowed Mr. Schechter during the market meltdown 11 years ago. Though he preaches the gospel of buying on dips, his reaction to the October 1987 crash was to sell -- a lot. "I really regretted doing it," he recalled.
So despite the latest downturn, which was much less severe, the Schechters are not changing their investment mix, which they call conservative.
Each has an employer-sponsored retirement plan, invested mainly in Fidelity Investment funds like Fidelity Fund, Equity-Income II and Growth and Income. They also have a brokerage account with about nine stocks, including Microsoft, I.B.M. and Pfizer; index funds, and a tax-exempt money-market fund.
Mr. Schechter said he might use some of those cash reserves to buy more shares of stocks he owns that are off their highs.
With their two children finished with school, the couple's main objective is financial independence. Given their aggressive saving -- the two have contributed 10 percent of their annual salaries over the last 30 years to their retirement plans -- and the market's great run, Mr. Schechter thinks they are close to their goal, regardless what the market does in the short term.
Reviewing the Schechters' portfolio, George Toth, a certified financial planner at Chestnut Investment Advisory in Erdenheim, Pa., said the couple did a "great job" of accumulating assets through disciplined investing. But he was concerned that they might have too much money in large stocks and large-stock mutual funds, both of which track the market and put them at more risk than they might realize. For diversification, he suggested putting about 15 percent of their retirement money in a convertible bond fund -- at least temporarily.
Mr. Toth also said the Schechters needed to figure out their downside risk and set price targets for their stocks and funds -- and to get out if those targets were hit.
Mr. Schechter dismissed the recommendation to diversify ("The economy was built on these large, well-capitalized companies") and added that he didn't need to set price floors because he's a long-term holder. "Over a 5-to-10-year period, I think they're all going to rise." DAWN GILBERTSON

HEADLINE: Mild and Merciful San Francisco a Magnet for the Homeless

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
To many people who live here and to the millions who visit each year, San Francisco is a jewel of American cities for its beauty, culture and quirkiness. For entirely different reasons, a rising number of homeless people also find it ideal.
In many respects, San Francisco may be the best haven in America for the homeless. The weather is consistently mild. City welfare benefits are larger than those available in most other places -- by more than $100 a month in some cases -- and have no cutoff time. 
 Further, as one of the nation's last bastions of liberalism, San Francisco offers an unusually wide array of free services for the poor through public and private programs that help with housing, medical needs, child care, job training and substance abuse treatment.
"We're humanistic," Mayor Willie L. Brown said in a recent interview.
But for all the efforts here to address the complexities of homelessness, people who work with San Francisco's poor say their programs cannot be stretched to cover the number of people who need them. The experts contend that the city's long history of tolerance, individual benefits of $345 a month and support programs serve as a magnet for homeless people at a time when the city cannot meet the demand for affordable housing and housing costs over all have become the highest of any city in the country.
"We're still losing ground," said Will Lightbourne, executive director of the Department of Human Services. "It's a supply issue, and we're not a nation-state. People are free to move here."
By some estimates, the number of homeless here has increased to 16,000 people on any given night, almost twice the number of a decade ago, and experts say many of them have mental disorders, physical disabilities and diseases like AIDS.
Surveys by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy group for the poor, have found that only New York and Los Angeles, the largest cities in the country, have more homeless people than San Francisco, which was the 13th largest city in 1996, with a population of 735,315, according to the Census Bureau.
Complicating matters here are economic forces that are pushing even more people into homelessness. San Francisco is a small place, less than 50 square miles with water on three sides. Many neighborhoods are changing, with new shops and restaurants helping to drive up residential rental costs. In a city where the vacancy rate seldom exceeds 1 percent, one-bedroom apartments even in working-class neighborhoods can rent for $1,000 a month.
At the same time, building owners who once used Federal grants to subsidize rents for low-income people are converting their properties into expensive units for sale or rent. Maggie Donahue, director of the city's housing and homeless programs, said San Francisco had 12,000 single-room units, less than half the number of a decade ago.
"This has become a yuppie town, where it seems like gentrification is a citywide program," said Paul Boden of the Coalition on Homelessness, which creates low-income housing here. "It wasn't that long ago you could still find flophouses where people could stay for $50 a week. Now, they're not there."
Ms. Donahue and other city officials do not necessarily disagree with Mr. Boden. They say the city and nonprofit groups are doing everything possible to meet the demands of the homeless.
In recent years, the city government has worked with many private groups and with the Federal Government to create more housing for low-income people. Just this week, the city broke ground on the first of three developments that will provide affordable housing -- 331 apartments -- and more projects are planned.
And Mr. Lightbourne said that the city was doing more to address the causes of homelessness, with new job-training programs, and plans to create three single-occupancy hotels for people with chronic disabilities.
That scarcely puts a dent in the city's overall needs. Ron Sonenshine, spokesman for the city's public housing agency, said the current stock of 6,100 units accommodated 25,000 people, but with a low vacancy rate, some of the 14,000 people on waiting lists could wait eight years.
Mayor Brown, who has drawn sharp criticism for police crackdowns that swept homeless people out of encampments in Golden Gate Park, conceded that governments at all levels were not doing enough to help the homeless and working poor.
But recognizing that he must satisfy different constituencies, including business leaders who depend upon revenues from tourism, he defended the city's current approach. He said that the supply of shelter beds was adequate and that aggressive enforcement of laws that keep the homeless from sleeping in public places was appropriate.
The Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, which runs one of the city's largest homeless centers with 43 programs serving 5,000 people a day, predicted that problems facing the city would get worse without more money and housing units. Criticizing the city for relying too much on private agencies, he said, "Nobody has any real grip on what to do."
For many of San Francisco's homeless, no amount of effort is likely to make much of a difference. Ronald Greenspane, director of Community Awareness and Treatment Services, a nonprofit group that specializes in helping homeless people suffering with substance abuse problems, AIDS and mental disorders, said many homeless people say they simply do not want the help that is offered.
Conducting informal interviews of about 500 people served by his group, Mr. Greenspane said he estimated that as many as 70 percent of homeless people were substance abusers, as many as 40 percent had a mental disorder and more than a third of them had been living in San Francisco for five years or longer.
"A good number of them," he said, "don't want to have a thing to do with anyone."
The homeless have become an indelible part of the city's landscape, along with the well-to-do residents and the tourists.
Sad-faced panhandlers seem to be everywhere, many with a story or hand-scribbled sign that speaks of dire need or misfortune. Most accept rejections of their requests for money without question. But many others persist, following pedestrians.
Trevor Hailey, who has given walking tours of the Castro district for the last nine years, said that in recent years, panhandlers had become "incredibly more demanding with in-your-face tactics." Some business owners in the neighborhood, she said, have begun displaying signs urging residents to give money to service providers, rather than the panhandlers. "The merchants even provide the envelope to mail in a donation," Ms. Hailey said.
In many ways, the scenes here are reminiscent of New York City a decade ago, when some streets were so crowded with the homeless that only the more creative panhandlers succeeded. But advocates here are less fearful that Mr. Brown or a successor might respond as aggressively as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has in New York. Mr. Giuliani's "quality of life" campaign has pushed the homeless to the margins of the city and into other boroughs.
The police here might sweep downtown doorways and Golden Gate Park now and then to roust homeless people sleeping there. But in a city with so many open arms and deep pockets, they are not likely to go far.

HEADLINE: The World: Hardscrabble;
Where the Hunger Season Is Part of Life

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
IN parts and pockets of Africa, there is an extra season every year. It is called the hunger season. That is when, said Martha Carey of Doctors Without Borders, "people forage for food -- they strip wild plants, they dig for fish in mud flats." In the Sudan, it is the hunger season and they are slaughtering their cows. "Cows are their last insurance policy," she said. "They cannot be replaced. After that, they have nothing."
The world's attention has been focused on Africa lately because of the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and because of the extreme suffering of the Sudanese, who are again on the run from yet another cycle of war between a Muslim north and a traditionalist and Christian south. But a million other stories of deprivation and intractable hunger just a notch less severe never get told because they are so common. 
 The Rev. David Guzman, a Roman Catholic priest from Colombia who is a missionary in Africa, was riding the subway in New York recently when he saw passengers looking at newspaper pictures from the Sudan and expressing shock. "Oh, my God," he said. "If only they could have seen the place where I am."
The place where he lives and works is a barren stretch of northern Kenya where, in the hunger season, people slit the throats of cattle to draw enough blood to drink to sustain life. Then they carefully heal the wound to save the cow, the most important of capital goods, for the next crisis.
"The Government sometimes gives them maize," Father Guzman said, but never enough. "There is no electricity, no water supply, no rivers, no hills, no food. This is a semi-arid place and you cannot cultivate crops. The people are always sick. The health center is 300 kilometers away and there are no cars, no buses."
 
A Lonely Errand
 Father Guzman was on a lonely errand in New York, trying to get small donations for water pumps and maybe a used ambulance. He toured Catholic parishes after being shooed away by the church hierarchy because the list of supplicants for official help is already too long. In small churches, he tells his story of official indifference, tribal warfare, natural disasters, relentless diseases and other blows. "Just when you think you are getting somewhere, more bad things come," is how he describes it.
The statistics tell the story. Of the 45 countries at the bottom of the Human Development Index, a people-centered measure of progress published annually by the United Nations Development Program, 35 are African. Only Africa's Mediterranean fringe and the southern tip of the continent escape the category. Elsewhere, life expectancy hovers between 40 and 50 years, sometimes lower. Half or fewer of the people in this vast area of disadvantage have access to health care, clean water or toilets. Daily caloric intake is a third or more below that of Mexico or China.
Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, found in 1997 that while the world average of deaths among children below age 5 was 89 in 1,000 births, the African average was 174 per 1,000. The children who survive have to fend off pneumonia, tuberculosis, malaria and now AIDS. Immunization rates for childhood diseases are often low in sub-Saharan Africa, Unicef reported. Only South Asia, led by India, has more childhood malnutrition.
It does not have to be that way, and was not always so, said Thelma Awori, director for Africa of the United Nations Development Program. Mrs. Awori, taking a long look back and searching for lessons that could help in planning for a better future, is concentrating on Africa's people rather than its problems.
"When independence came to Africa, people had a lot of hope about what governments would do," she said.
"At that time governments themselves were hopeful about what they could do. Then we got into the 70's and the 80's -- the times of structural adjustment -- when they had to shift their thinking. Governments found they really could not do all they thought they could do. And then people's hopes were more or less dashed."
Structural adjustment, a policy developed by international lending organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, demanded that countries living beyond their means reduce spending on public projects and cut subsidies that often kept the cost of living down in poor nations.
"I remember in Uganda in the 60's, we had strong community development," she said. "Women knew how to feed their children. They were taught how to wash their dishes. They were taught to make tablecloths even though some people said, 'We have no tables.' And now?"
In the same villages, Mrs. Awori said, she sees women unable to feed their babies. Elsewhere, schooling has declined as tens of thousands of children flee civil wars.
 
Slipping Back
 In general, Africa is slipping back. Even where there is no conflict, governments forced to make choices about what to cut from their budgets often safeguard the official "fat" and slice away the "soft" projects like literacy programs, agricultural extension services and adult education. "The people are on their own again," Mrs. Awori said.
"Our argument with most governments is, 'Why don't you cut the military spending?' " she said.
What has been lost is rapport between governments and the people, Mrs. Awori said. Her agency is trying to rebuild that, but from the bottom up, with grants to nongovernmental organizations and local authorities.
"Our local development fund goes straight to grassroots government," she said. "The local authorities learn how to take charge, they learn how to account for money. They learn how to plan. They learn how to link themselves up with the communities. That's very important."
Depending too much on outside help means focusing on where people fail, she added. "We are teaching people to use their own assets."
Mrs. Awori also channels money and other support to women's groups like the fast-growing Movement of African Women, founded by a member of Zambia's Parliament, Inonge Lewanika.
Millions of African women have been set back by bad governance. Tens of thousands have had to run from ethnic warfare and have suffered rape and the brutal deaths of children, husbands and other family members. Some are now saying they want to help put an end to this perpetual horror and they are building computer networks to reach each other.
"I have had to run," Mrs. Awori said. "It is a very, very humiliating experience. You are just running, You don't know where you are running to. You could be running into the person who is going to kill you."
 
'Laughingstock'
 In material terms, Africa is rich in resources, richer than many Asian countries. But wealth and the political power out of which it grows are rarely shared equally.
"We have monumental problems," said Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Botswana's representative at the United Nations. "Sometimes we are seen as the laughingstock of humanity. But we can be an organized community, vast as the continent is, different as the cultures are."
Mr. Legwaila points to the experience of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community. A number of its members, including Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are similar to nations like Russia, Peru and Turkey in human development terms.
S.A.D.C. has a system of assigning areas of development to member nations. Livestock and drought research is done by Botswana, fisheries by Malawi, food security by Zimbabwe, water resources by Lesotho and so on. Experts in these nations carry out studies and share information. Grain stocks are stored regionally against shortages.
"The S.A.D.C. arrangement is unique in Africa," Mr. Legwaila said.
But its success also rests on peace, democracy and stability, he added, attributes not found in many other regions of the continent.
"Peace -- that is all that is required of Africa," Mr. Legwaila said. "My country is almost permanently drought-stricken, but because there is so much peace, so much democracy -- and the Government is one of the most incorruptible on the continent -- no one has ever died from starvation."

HEADLINE: Swiss Are Relieved, but Sour, Over Banks' Holocaust Accord

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The front page of a leading Swiss newspaper on Friday capsulized the country's ambivalent response to the accord this week aimed at settling Holocaust-era claims.
A political cartoon showed a reproduction of a Swiss bank payment slip that listed $1.25 billion to be paid to "The World Jewish Congress, New York." The square for writing in payment details said, "Ah, yes: pardon from Jewish people." 
 An adjacent editorial in the newspaper, Le Temps, bore the headline "Bargaining and Politics." The French word "marchandage" in the headline can also carry the connotation of haggling.
The words and imagery highlighted the mix of relief and victimization that the Swiss feel over the announcement Wednesday of a settlement after more than two years of testy relations between Jewish organizations, American politicians and Switzerland.
The agreement -- signed by Switzerland's two largest banks, the Union Bank of Switzerland AG and the Credit Suisse Group -- appears to stave off serious damage to Switzerland's important banking sector, which has been accused of profiting from dealings with the Nazis and from the bank accounts of Jews killed in the Holocaust. Their refusal to settle had prompted widespread threats of boycotts of Swiss banks.
But many Swiss feel it is too late to undo the damage that the dispute has done to the country's image. In news media commentary around the country, the word "blackmail" often cropped up, even in articles favoring the accord.
A national opinion poll taken immediately after the agreement was announced found support from a slender plurality. Of the 611 people surveyed, 42.2 percent approved the plan while 37.8 percent registered disapproval. Twenty percent said they had no opinion.
"Many people have the feeling that it was not the search for truth, but more a search for money," said Pascal Couchepin, the Minister for the Economy. "We were not accustomed to this kind of exploration of our history."
Moreover, the question of exactly who will pay the $1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors seemed to ignite real worry. Many Swiss, particularly those who lived through World War II, view any use of taxpayer money for this purpose as an unacceptable admission of wartime wrongdoing. This belief is combined with the fact that Switzerland is now climbing out of its most serious recession in decades, and has budget problems.
Mr. Couchepin said that "there is no reason for the Swiss Government to pay anything." He said that a report from a Government commission on Switzerland's dealings with the Nazis "showed we did what was possible in the hard times of the war."
The Swiss National Bank, which has been singled out as a major buyer of looted gold from Nazi Germany, was not part of the accord and has not yet taken a position. Its spokesman, Werner Abegg, said that the bank's governing body would have to review the accord.
Reflecting the simmering resentment here, even enthusiasts of the settlement peppered their remarks with comments about the accord's amount, and the tactics used to get it.
Lily Nabholz, a member of Parliament, said the amount was "quite surprising because it is hard for the average person to understand how the small amounts uncovered in the dormant accounts suddenly turned into $1.25 billion."
"There is a lot of explaining to do," she said in a telephone interview.

HEADLINE: Town on Shaky Ground Is Seeing a Turnaround

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif.

 BODY:
Postcard views of snow-covered peaks, sparkling lakes and emerald pine forests surround this resort town 7,800 feet up in the Eastern Sierra. But to the dismay of residents, when the nation's attention is drawn to their town next to the Mammoth Mountain ski resort, it most often focuses on what is going on underground.
The town of about 5,000 people sits in the Long Valley Caldera, a 20-mile-long volcanic basin. After four magnitude 6 earthquakes struck the area in 1980, geologists found that new inflows of magma miles underground had caused a bulge in the caldera surface, which sometimes signals a volcanic eruption. 
 The result for years afterward: news reports that residents complain exaggerated the risk of an eruption and that damaged the town's economy and real estate values.
"The news media has just devastated this community," said Rodger Guffey, who has owned a Mammoth Lakes restaurant for 28 years. "If somebody makes a statement, they just use the half that says we're going to blow up."
Recently things have turned around, in part because of the resurgence of the Southern California economy. In addition, the Intrawest Corporation, a resort developer, bought 52 percent of Mammoth Mountain Ski Area along with real estate in the town and has plans for $350 million in projects here.
"They did a lot of looking into everything," said an Intrawest spokeswoman, Pam Murphy. "They didn't see it as a big risk at all."
Intrawest and others are investing despite the fact that the town continues to be rocked by earthquakes so often that a television station broadcasts a daily earthquake report.
Last November, the area was rattled by a swarm of earthquakes centered inside the caldera, including almost a thousand in a single day. That and other swarms that have struck are related to the volcanic unrest, according to the United States Geological Survey.
Christopher Farrar, a Geological Survey hydrologist studying volcanic phenomena here, said, "If you had a large earthquake, it could cause a ground fracture of considerable size and open a pathway that could allow magma to come to the surface."
The agency's scientists said that the area around Mammoth Lakes and around the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest were the two places in the continental United States most likely to produce a volcanic eruption. But they cannot predict when an eruption will happen or how severe it might be.
"The upshot is that the odds of something happening in any given year are roughly one in a few hundred," said David P. Hill, a Geological Survey seismologist. "It's typical of the geologic hazards of living on the West Coast."
But because there has never been a serious injury or even much damage from the earthquakes here, and because the last volcanic eruption in the area occurred 250 years ago, most residents feel secure.
"People are willing to gamble quite a bit on the 99 percent chance that something is going to go their way," Mr. Farrar said. "But the more years that go by with periods of increased activity and no eruption, pretty soon you're going to get to the point where the earth system is ready to produce an eruption, and that's what will happen."
That is the kind of talk that angers many residents, who are far more fearful of renewed damage to the economy from media attention.
Mayor Kirk Stapp of Mammoth Lakes said: "Some people in Mammoth are absolutely hysterical about defending the town. They're very hostile -- some people's livelihood is at stake and they become very emotional and very angry."
Their cause has not been helped by a series of strong earthquakes since June, including two of magnitude 5.3. And in recent years, a new problem has seeped up through the ground. In about a hundred acres at the base of Mammoth Mountain, carbon dioxide gas released by underground magma has emerged and collected in soil, killing swaths of pine trees. The gas can collect at high concentrations in depressions in dirt or snow in that area, and can be dangerous to anyone breathing below ground or snow level, Mr. Farrar said.

HEADLINE: United Way Reports Gifts Are Up 4.7%

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The 1,300 local United Ways raised $3.4 billion last year, a 4.7 percent increase over the $3.25 billion raised in 1996 and the second year in a row that giving to the nation's largest private financer of social services charities has increased significantly faster than the rate of inflation.
"We're making real gains that show confidence in United Way," Betty Stanley Beene, president of United Way of America in Alexandria, Va., said on Thursday. United Way plans to release the figures officially on Monday. 
 Despite the increases last year and in 1996, when the value of gifts is adjusted for inflation, donations are still 7.6 percent below the $3.68 billion donated in 1991. In 1992, the president of United Way of America, William V. Aramony, was dismissed and later imprisoned for embezzling charitable money.
Among large United Ways only one, the United Way of New York City, has not reported the results of the fund-raising drives that ended on June 30. Officials could not be reached late Friday or Saturday morning, but the organization has not posted any new information about its campaign on its Web site since April. An official said last month that donations appeared to be running 8 percent ahead of the previous year. Inflation grew at a rate of about 1 percent in 1997.
Among the 75 largest United Ways, which raise $10 million or more annually, the largest increases in giving were reported by Austin, Tex., up 25 percent to $10 million; Charlotte, N.C., up 21.5 percent to $26.5 million; Miami, up 20.5 percent to $32.8 million, and Wilmington, Del., up 17.6 percent to $25.4 million.
Only two of the largest United Ways, in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Honolulu, reported declines, both of nearly 5 percent. And donations rose by less than the rate of inflation at only six others -- White Plains and Buffalo in New York; Cleveland and Dayton in Ohio; Jacksonville, Fla., and Richmond.
The increase in Delaware is significant because donations fell sharply in the middle of the decade when that United Way embraced donor option, in which supporters can designate which charities receive money deducted from their paychecks.
The turnaround last year came after the United Way in Delaware kept the donor option but stopped promoting it, and instead focused on its role of providing operating support for crucial agencies like Boys and Girls Clubs.
Despite the national growth, United Way lagged behind the growth in donations to all charities last year.
The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel in New York last month estimated that overall giving increased by more than 6 percent to $143.5 billion last year. The rise was led by an increase of more than 10 percent, to $13.4 billion, in grants made by foundations, whose assets have swelled in the longstanding bull market.
Giving by individuals last year increased nearly 6 percent to slightly more than $109 billion, virtually identical to the growth in individual donations in 1996. While United Ways trailed behind this increase, they did much better than charities in the arts, culture and humanities, which saw a 3 percent decline in donations, according to Giving USA.
Historically the poorest Americans have been the most generous, donating a share of their incomes that is twice as large as that given by the middle class and the wealthy. Donations to churches, synagogues and mosques account for most of the giving by the poor. But preliminary data from 1996 income tax returns, from an economic model and from United Way's analysis of donations suggest that giving by the affluent is rising, while donations by those who earn modest incomes are declining.
Per capita giving by individuals who do not itemize deductions on their tax returns is slowly declining, according to an annual report by Independent Sector, an association of more than 1,000 foundations, corporate giving programs and large charities.
Giving USA, published by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, said that individuals who itemize deductions on their tax returns took 12.4 percent more charitable deductions in 1996, the latest year for which preliminary data are available, than in 1995. This means income tax deductions for charitable giving grew nearly twice as fast as overall giving.
Ms. Beene said that gifts of $1,000 or more rose nearly 19 percent and now account for nearly one-fifth of United Way donations.

HEADLINE: Ballpark and Shops Among Options for a Gateway to Staten Island

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
A rubble-strewn, overgrown Staten Island rail yard with postcard views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline could become an attraction itself under plans announced yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani said the city had agreed to pay $13 million for 52 acres next to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal, and was considering development that could include a minor-league baseball diamond, an entertainment complex, restaurants and stores, or some mix of those. 
 The Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, said the purchase would put a more inviting face on the area, which residents consider the gateway to Staten Island.
"A lot of this stuff had been going to rack and ruin," Mr. Molinari said. "This represents a new day for Staten Island. This will have an enormous positive impact for Staten Island in the 21st century."
Mr. Giuliani said that 18 million people pass through the ferry terminal each year, making the area "one of the primary tourist and commuter points in the entire country."
The Mayor wore a polo shirt as he spoke next to a rusty iron fence on a sidewalk overlooking the property, which is at St. George, near Borough Hall, in the area Staten Islanders call their downtown.
"Behind me is a view that is priceless -- it's a view that is known all over the world," he said. "I've photographed this view myself, so I know how inspiring it can be."
City officials said they had not decided how they would use the land, but Mr. Giuliani said a ballpark would be one of the best options.
"Someone can see if they can hit home runs between the World Trade Center towers," he joked. "I can't think of anything better than hitting home runs to Wall Street."
Another possible use would be additional space for two museums now planned for the site: a national museum planned by lighthouse preservation groups, and a cultural center. The city is likely to continue offering parking for now, and might make some parking permanent.
The city's Economic Development Corporation is buying the land from CSX Realty Development, a subsidiary of CSX Corporation, the transportation giant. The city has 90 days to finalize the offer, which must be approved by the CSX board.
City officials said the land, which runs 3,000 feet along Upper New York Bay, was first used as a rail yard near the turn of the century, a use that continued into the 1960's. Now, part of it is a 1,000-space commuter parking lot and the rest is covered with scrap and scrub.
"Whatever we do will be a tremendous improvement over what's there," said Charles Millard, president of the development agency.
Mr. Giuliani said the $13 million price was a good deal for the city, since CSX had a contract to sell the land 10 years ago for $18.5 million, although the deal did not go through. He said CSX was now collecting $750,000 a year in parking fees from the property, and had planned to double that to $1.5 million with the opening of two museums nearby.
Mr. Molinari said he was relieved since in the past, developers and the city had considered using the land for apartments, a homeless shelter or a jail.
About half the property, which sits just north of the ferry terminal, is under water. The city also might renovate the docks and shorefront.
A ballpark would be a flashback for the neighborhood: An American Association team, the New York Metropolitans, and a National League team, the Giants, played there for three years ending in 1889.

HEADLINE: Blitz on Sex Outlets

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Judges in Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx grant requests from the Giuliani administration to padlock strip clubs and adult video stores immediately. But judges in Manhattan and Queens, confronted with nearly identical requests, refuse and instead hold lengthy hearings.
The contradictory responses are, in part, the result of the novel and aggressive legal tactics the Giuliani administration is using to close sex shops under its new zoning law. 
 To supporters, the tactics are producing the first concrete results in decades of efforts to remove sex shops from residential neighborhoods. To critics, however, the crackdown is the latest example of an administration's penchant for using heavy-handed, publicity-driven tactics to bully opponents into submission.
With seven judges in five boroughs wrestling with 19 requests from the city to close sex shops, a series of seemingly contradictory rulings regarding the new law could emerge over the next several weeks. And final judgments from state and Federal appeals courts on whether the enforcement tactics are legal -- as well as on sex shops' efforts to stay in business by limiting adult entertainment to less than 40 percent of their floor space -- are not expected for a year or more.
But in the short term, the Giuliani administration, by peppering the courts with requests to close sex shops, has created the image of a mayor succeeding where others have failed since the 1960's.
The Giuliani administration's zoning law restricting adult entertainment mirrors sex-shop regulations in other cities. But what is unusual, critics say, is the combative way in which the Mayor is trying to close the shops.
City officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the Mayor is bypassing the usual method for closing a business illegally operating in a residential area. Typically, in a process that can take months, city officials first issue a notice of violation to the business owner. Hearings are then held and a business can be ordered to move or find a way to comply with the law.
But in shutting the sex shops, the Giuliani administration is using a legal procedure usually reserved for closing crack houses and brothels. Requesting the padlockings under the city's nuisance abatement law, city lawyers, when challenged, argue that the sex shops should be immediately closed because they represent a threat to the public "health, safety and welfare."
So far, the strategy is working. The city has won 11 immediate padlockings in 19 requests since the law took effect July 22. The denials have come from judges in Manhattan and Queens, Stephen G. Crane and Steven W. Fisher, who ruled that a zoning violation does not necessarily warrant immediately closing a business. Both have held hearings before deciding whether to padlock.
Lawyers for the sex shops say the long-running businesses are no threat to public welfare and the administration is being autocratic.
"To do it this way is really Gestapo-like tactics," said Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex shops affected by the new law.
But Steven M. Fishner, the Mayor's criminal justice coordinator, said the shops do pose a threat to public welfare by inhibiting economic growth and reducing the quality of life in residential neighborhoods. The businesses are free to move to manufacturing areas where they are allowed to operate under the new law, he said.
"We do have a strategy and it is an aggressive strategy," he said. "But everything we're doing is being done in full compliance with the law."
Lawyers for the sex shops also complained that the city was filing its requests for immediate padlockings with no warning. They said judges in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island were granting the requests when lawyers for the sex shops were not even present to defend them.
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, contended that the city is now focusing on strip clubs in counties where judges are most likely to issue immediate padlock orders for publicity reasons. Since the two judges in Manhattan and Queens turned down requests for immediate closings, six of the last seven requests have been in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island.
"I think it's orchestrated," he said. "The whole push is gauged toward getting headlines to give the impression that he's closing them down."
Mr. Fahringer said that since he asked judges not to issue immediate padlock orders against his clients without his being present, the city has not tried to padlock any of them.
But Mr. Fishner denied that the city was tailoring its padlocking requests. "It will become apparent over time that we are not selecting any counties or avoiding any counties," Mr. Fishner said.
Lawyers for the strip clubs also complained that the city is using any means it can find to close the clubs. After Judge Fisher turned down the city's request for an immediate padlocking of Wiggles strip club in Rego Park, Queens, on July 31, the city produced a two-month-old affidavit from a police officer who said that a dancer in the club solicited him. On Aug. 6, the judge cited the assertion of criminal activity as grounds for padlocking Wiggles.
Michael Schill, a New York University law professor, said the city has the right to aggressively enforce a zoning law that has withstood nearly three years of challenges on its constitutionality.
"My sense is that the city feels that having an enforcement action against one business is not going to lead to everyone pulling down the shutters and giving up," he said. "And they're probably right."
The Mayor's opponents concede that even if his tactics are later overturned by higher courts, he is in a win-win situation. Owners of padlocked businesses may eventually give up, stop waiting for victory on appeal and move to manufacturing zones as permitted under the new law. The short-term closings, they said, will also play well with the Republican audiences the Mayor will address around the country in the next few weeks.

Armchair Sailors on the Seven Seas

BYLINE: By PETER C. T. ELSWORTH 

 BODY:
Size has gradually become the guiding principle in commercial and naval shipbuilding. Take the $450 million Grand Princess, which made her maiden voyage in May. She is the world's most expensive cruise ship and the largest in sheer tonnage. In silhouette, though, she looks like a Dustbuster. And the Jahre Viking, an oil tanker that is the world's largest ship, is little more than a gigantic steel box with an engine astern. Time has brought high technology: Warships no longer need oarsmen or a set of sails but a stable platform for aircraft. No mean economies of scale here, the ships below perhaps plead a case for the days of yore, when grace and wind ruled the seas. PETER C. T. ELSWORTH

GRAPHIC: Illustrations/Chart:
VIKING LONG BOAT -- 75 feet
The Gokstad ship was powered by 32 oarsmen and a sail. Such vessels were sailed by the Vikings as far as North America and southern Europe in the 10th and 11th centuries.
 
AMERICA'S CUP YACHT -- 75 feet
The Formula One of modern racing yachts, it has a mast of 110 feet, can sail over 20 knots (23 miles an hour), and costs about $5 million.
 
MAYFLOWER -- 115 feet
The small English galleon brought 102 pilgrims from England to the coast of America in 1620.
 
ROMAN TRIREME -- 125 feet
The Roman galley was powered by a combination of oars (144 oarsmen) and sail and armed with a battering ram and soldiers that boarded enemy craft.
 
SANTA MARIA -- 125 feet
A Portuguese carrack that served as Columbus's flagship for his voyage to the West Indies in 1492.
 
H.M.S. VICTORY -- 227 feet 3,500 tons
Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar. Launched in 1765, it exemplified the three-decked, three-masted, first-rate ship of the line (so named because naval battles were fought as duels between lines of ships firing broadsides; a first rater had over 100 guns).
 
FRANCE II -- 426 feet 8,000 tons
One of the largest sailing ships ever built. Launched in 1911, she had two auxilliary engines and was one of the last of her kind.
 
R.M.S. TITANIC -- 883 feet 60,000 tons
The world's most infamous unsinkable liner, it sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.
U.S.S. MISSOURI -- 887 feet 58,000 tons
Launched in 1944, the Mighty Mo was the last of the Iowa-class World War II battleships. The surrender of Japan was signed on its deck on Sept. 2, 1945.
 
GRAND PRINCESS -- 935 feet 109,000 tons
The floating resort accomodates 2,600 passengers and features a nine-hole putting course, a casino whose ceiling mimics the changing sky, a theater and tennis courts. The Grand Princess is similar in design to Carnival's Ecstasy (856 feet, 70,367 tons), which caught fire last month off the coast of Florida.
 
QUEEN ELIZABETH 2 -- 963 feet -- 70,327 tons
Launched in 1967, the QE2 is the successor to the famed Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, which made the weekly run from Southampton, England, to New York City through the 1950's.
 
U.S.S. HARRY S. TRUMAN -- 1,096 feet 97,000 tons
Launched in 1997 and commissioned last month by President Clinton, the Truman is the Navy's newest aircraft carrier. The nuclear-powered vessel can carry 90 aircraft and a combined crew of over 5,000.
 
SOVEREIGN MAERSK -- 1,138 feet 50,110 tons (empty) 154,323 tons (fully loaded)
Launched earlier this year, the Sovereign is the world's largest container ship (95 feet longer than the Regina Maersk, which visited New York Harbor last month). Maersk, a Danish shipping company, has ordered eight more ships like the Sovereign, which carries 6,600 truck-sized containers and can travel at 25 knots.
 
JAHRE VIKING -- 1,504 feet 214,793 tons (empty) 714,247 tons (fully loaded)
Launched in 1979, the Norwegian Ultra Large Crude Carrier (U.L.C.C.) is the world's largest ship, capable of carrying over 500,000 tons of crude oil. Such behemoths fell out of favor with the decline in oil demand in the 1980's, but new ones have been ordered recently for trade in the Middle East. The only American facility capable of accomodating a U.L.C.C. is a deep-water terminal off Louisiana.

HEADLINE: Health Clubs Consolidate as Membership Grows

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Spurred by the rising popularity of health clubs among people more interested in improving cardiovascular fitness than parading toned pecs, two companies are aggressively expanding in the New York City area. With investment dollars pouring into the industry, scores of independent gyms and smaller chains are likely to be absorbed by major chains over the next few years.
One fast-growing company, Town Sports International, the owner of New York Sports Clubs, acquired 18 gyms in the area in recent weeks -- 6 of them this month -- and is building or planning to build 7 more. The company, which is based in Manhattan and is the largest owner of gyms in the city, now has 59 clubs in the area and 17 others throughout the Northeast. 
 Bally Total Fitness, the nation's largest chain, runs 37 clubs in the area and will soon open 7 more.
The company plans to build a dozen clubs in the area within two years, part of a national strategy that calls for adding 22 new clubs and buying 25 more each year, said Lee S. Hillman, the company's president.
The rapid expansion of these companies comes at a time when growing numbers of mom and pop operations and less-successful smaller chains across the country are eagerly seizing their first opportunity to sell.
The industry is so fragmented that only about a third of the nation's 13,799 commercial health clubs are owned by companies with 2 or more clubs, according to analysts. (Even Bally has only 325.)
"Smaller operators have been waiting for years for the opportunity to sell out," said Naomi R. Talish, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Until now, she said, "there was no one out there with the capital to buy them."
Unlike other industries undergoing consolidation, the $9 billion health club business is not considered "mature," meaning that there appears to be plenty of room for growth.
Club membership nationwide has increased sharply in recent years -- to 22.4 million in 1997 from 13.8 million in 1987, according to American Sports Data of Hartsdale, N.Y., a company that specializes in sports and fitness research. But those figures represent only a fraction of the potential market, analysts say.
Health clubs are more popular in urban areas -- where the major chains are concentrating their expansion drives -- but in the New York area, only 1.6 million people are members, about 11.2 percent of the population.
With the mountain of research emphasizing the health benefits of exercise, including a 1996 report by the Surgeon General, club operators say they believe that membership will continue to grow as more people are recruited from what they euphemistically refer to as the "deconditioned" market.
Health clubs used to draw primarily from the 20-something age group, but today, the members' average age is 35, said Cathy Masterson McNeil, a spokeswoman for the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, based in Boston. Last year, 8.5 million people ages 35 to 54 belonged to health clubs, an increase of 103.3 percent over the 1987 figure. And the clubs had 2.7 million members age 55 or older, an increase of 123.5 percent over the same period.
Some older club members began working out years ago and have continued to stay fit, said Harvey Lauer, the president of American Sports Data. But others have been lured by the development of effective low-impact activities that are easy on the joints, he said. "I think there has been a general elevation of fitness consciousness," Mr. Lauer said.
Reflecting that heightened consciousness, Adele Bacon, 78, goes to the David Barton Gym on the Upper East Side four times a week. Joining a gym with so many younger members made her feel awkward at first, she said, but she quickly adjusted.
"There are a couple of people who walk around like prima donnas," Mrs. Bacon said. But most people, she said, go to work out. "They're not here for a fashion show." Indeed, at many gyms, form-fitting leotards and tights are far less prevalent than loose track pants and baggy T-shirts.
The health club industry has also caught the eye of investors, because it has dropped some of its questionable business practices. The days when operators made their money by signing up members who could be counted on as no-shows are largely over.
"They realized it was a very shortsighted strategy," said Vincent Zinno, the editor of Club Industry magazine, a trade publication. "They were not growing their business doing that. It was like selling a newspaper subscription to people who can't read."
Only two companies, Bally and Sports Club Company, which owns the luxurious Reebok Sports Club New York (with an initiation fee of $1,100 and monthly dues of $150), are publicly traded. But several other companies, including Town Sports International, are expected to go public soon.
With Reebok Sports Club New York at the wealthier end of the clientele spectrum and muscle gyms at the other, Town Sports has positioned itself in the middle, drawing college-educated people between 25 and 40 who earn more than $50,000 a year, said Mark Smith, the company's chairman and chief executive. Members who wish to travel freely among various clubs pay $76 a month, he said, and can cancel with 30 days' notice.
To finance its expansion, Town Sports raised $100 million from the bond market.
Although some of its clubs are equipped with pools and racquetball courts, the company is focusing on machines like treadmills and stair climbers and popular activities like weight training and spinning, a high-intensity workout using a stationary bicycle.
Mr. Smith's company is buying clubs from people like Christian Pacifico, who entered the business in 1991, eventually becoming the co-owner of Gold's Gym franchises on Staten Island and in Brooklyn and Fort Lee, N.J., employing a total of 150 people.
This year Mr. Pacifico decided it was time to sell because it was getting harder to compete for employees and to keep updating equipment.
"There's only so much a small business can do," said Mr. Pacifico, who now works for Bally as an area manager. "We were losing employees."
At Bally, part of the strategy is to diversify its membership. Known for operating at the lower end of the market, the company recently opened a slightly more high-end health club in Manhattan's financial district and is upgrading several others in midtown. Fees range from $25 to $45 a month at the typical Bally clubs, and from $49 to $69 a month at the fancier ones, called Bally Sports Clubs.
As the industry grows, club operators will inevitably be more conscious of the bottom line, said Paul Roukis, an analyst at Schroder & Company. But he said that the corporations would benefit from economies of scale in marketing and acquiring equipment and that consumers were not likely to feel that pennies were being pinched because of consolidation.
"On the contrary," Mr. Roukis said, "it's going to give people a lot more."
But Dr. Gary M. Prince, a chiropractor who owns Prescriptive Fitness, an independent club on West 54th Street that charges its members $60 a month, said that consolidation would deprive consumers of the personal touch and hands-on management he is able to offer.
"We're the local bar on the corner, where everyone knows your name," he said.

HEADLINE: Still Living With '68

BYLINE: By Mark Lilla; Mark Lilla is an associate professor of politics at New York University and the editor, most recently, of New French Thought: Political Philosophy.

 BODY:
August was the cruelest month. after the tet offensive and the escalation of the Vietnam War in early 1968, after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and then riots and looting in several major cities, Americans ended the summer watching the Democratic Party implode at its Chicago convention while policemen beat demonstrators on the streets outside. The country seemed to be coming unglued.
Or was it the whole Western world? The situation in Europe certainly made it seem so. In the spring, universities in Madrid and Rome were closed after clashes between students and police, while in West Germany the leader of the largest student organization was shot, setting off arson attacks by a newly formed terrorist group called the Red Army Faction. The following month, a student strike at a suburban university outside Paris metamorphosed into the now famous "events of May," which began with marches and the occupation of buildings and ended with barricades, Molotov cocktails, hand-to-hand street combat and a general strike that brought the French economy to its knees. 
 In the summer of '68 it seemed safe to assume that America and Western Europe were undergoing the same "revolution," a word that came easily to the lips back then. But within a few years it became obvious that very different dramas were being played out on the two continents. After a brief but significant flirtation with armed violence on the fringes of the "60's movement," the American left began to turn its attention from strictly political issues, like segregation and imperialism, to new cultural ones, like feminism. As the war in Vietnam de-escalated, a cultural war that is still with us began at home.
In Europe, however, it was the political repercussions of '68 that remained most significant over the next decade. French students and intellectuals made a fetish of Chairman Mao and genuflected before it, while German and Italian terrorists kidnapped, "kneecapped" and murdered leading figures in business and government. The coldblooded execution of the former Prime Minister Aldo Moro by the Italian Red Brigades on the 10th anniversary of May '68 was only the most spectacular of these attacks, which lasted into the 1980's.
Given these violent political contestations, you might expect passions about the 60's to run higher in Europe today than in the politically stable United States. Instead, the tumult has disappeared: the 60's are over in Europe. This past spring, the 30th anniversary of May '68 was calmly commemorated across the continent without bloodshed -- indeed, without significant controversy. Conferences were held, television specials were broadcast, day-by-day chronicles of the events appeared in the newspapers and hundreds of books (more than 80 in France alone) were printed. Yet as the French newspaper Le Monde reported, the anniversary was a publishing disaster. It appears there was neither enough nostalgia for, nor rage against, the 60's revolution to induce the French to read about it -- especially the young, for whom it is ancient history.
This indifference is common today, though not because Europe has returned to some pre-'68 slumber. It is simply that Europeans have made their peace with the revolution's successes and failures. Unlike the United States, where pro- and anti-'68 factions continue to militate in the worlds of academia, journalism and politics, Europe has comfortably entered a post-'68 age.
Which raises the question: Why haven't we? Why do the American 60's, whose political conflicts no longer rage in our streets, continue to rage in our heads?
What distinguishes the American and European 60's is less the nature of the political and cultural changes that eventually took place than the spirit in which they were pursued. Was the revolution, as Europeans seemed to believe, essentially about bringing an end to an old political order that also supported a stifling bourgeois culture? Or was it, as Americans appeared to think, about extending the reach of a noble if imperfectly realized political ideal into every corner of cultural life?
The European 60's were politically contentious from the start, for reasons that lie in a half-century of ideological polarization. Until World War II, much of the continent looked not much different from the Europe of the 19th century: it was rural, religious, socially conservative and, especially in German-speaking territories, admiring of military virtues. This was the traditional home of the European right. The European left, on the other hand, was centered in the rapidly growing cities and divided between Communists and Social Democrats. These forces polarized European politics in the decades leading up to the Second World War, and most observers expected the continent to fall back into this pattern at its conclusion.
Yet in the three decades following the war, a social transformation began that would eventually turn over the tired soil that had nourished hostile political relations in Europe for so long. Its causes were fundamentally economic and military: 30 years of unprecedented growth in production and public investment under the American nuclear umbrella. As the bounty arrived, the centuries-long divide between urban and rural mentalities that underlay the right-left split began to close up. Villages across Europe were depopulated and, through television, people who remained behind began to take part, at least from a distance, in the life of the capitals. As working-class families acquired more consumer goods, the distinctions between classes came to depend more on taste than on buying power. This is not to say that postwar Europe became a classless continent, simply that traditional social divisions were being replaced by more complex ones -- the most significant new one being generational.
At bottom, "catching up" was what the European 60's were all about. Although Western Europe managed to get on the liberal-democratic rails remarkably fast in the 20 years after the war, its ideological frame of reference was still that of the polarized prewar era. The new Christian Democratic parties were, to be sure, nothing like the old right, yet neither were they committed to the modernization of social institutions. The Communists came out of the war strengthened by their (often exaggerated) role in resisting Fascism, but their language of "class struggle" and "leading role of the party" rang hollow. While European workers continued to give their ballots to the Communists, with their wallets they -- and especially their children -- were voting for consumer capitalism. Out of this gap between the reality of postwar European society and its prewar ideologies a new political force was born. Because it appealed to so many of the traditional symbols of the European left -- and even radicalized them, replacing class struggle with generational struggle, Marx and Lenin with Mao and Che, "socialism in one country" with worldwide peasant revolution -- it stood to reason that it was taken to be a "new" left. But, in fact, it was not essentially a revitalized left but a third force that helped to extinguish an established European left that could trace its lineage back to 1917 and even to 1789. Its new demands for hedonistic fulfillment and individual self-expression had nothing to do with Marxism, as the nervous Communist parties of Europe understood perfectly well. And its skepticism toward the experiences of real existing socialism was such that disenchantment with the entire revolutionary tradition was bound to set in.
And it did. The first shock came in 1972 with the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic Games by the Palestinian Black September group. Suddenly it seemed that the celebration of terrorism and unconditional support of third-world struggles by the most radical of the '68ers had, at least indirectly, sanctioned the death of Jews again in Europe. Then in 1974 Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag Archipelago" appeared, convincing many younger intellectuals on the left, especially in France, of the necessary connection between Communism and totalitarian repression. The fall of Saigon brought the heartbreaking flight of the boat people; there was the Cambodian genocide, and in 1979 a "people's revolution" in Iran brought to power a reactionary religious clique that repressed secular intellectuals, women and homosexuals.
Because the European left took seriously the possibility of Communism and third-world revolution, in the end it was forced to reckon with their historical records. And while this was happening, the leftist dogma that real reform was impossible within "formal" democracy was proving to be a myth. Socialist parties came to power in Portugal and France, then in Italy and Spain. The German new left, which had been Europe's most intransigent, progressively made its peace with parliamentary democracy. This political "normalization" of the European left was accompanied by an intellectual "normalization," and by the mid-80's the radical newspapers founded in the wake of the 60's agitation -- Liberation in Paris, La Repubblica in Rome, Die Tageszeitung in Berlin -- had become perfectly conventional publications. Thus, when perestroika began and as the regimes of the East Bloc started to crumble on the bicentennary of the French Revolution, the European left had already divested itself of its holdings in the enterprise that had been founded in Russia in 1917. It was now clear to almost everyone that a 50-year tradition of thinking and living politics had come to a close. And with it ended the political dreams of '68.
This dramatic story of the European left's political maturation, of revolutionary promise and betrayal, of illusions embraced and lost, was not the story that unfolded in the United States. And the reason for this is quite simple: the fate of the Communist idea, and even of the French revolutionary tradition, had virtually no significance for American '68ers. Politically speaking, they were, and by and large still are, provincials. While European radicals like Regis Debray spent the 60's in the jungles of South America spreading the revolutionary gospel, students in the U.S. stayed on campus and demanded that America "come home." Home was where its heart was, even when it foolishly denounced "Amerika."
What these '68ers originally demanded was that America fulfill its own democratic promise, not that it take up a new revolutionary mission. The temple of the American democratic ideal had to be cleansed. A ritual cleansing began with the civil rights movement and resistance to the war, and was finished once Richard Nixon resigned and the troops came home. Yet it was these very successes that fed the American left's passion for greater purification, for an extension of the '68 spirit from the strictly political sphere to the whole of American culture.
Aspects of American life that hitherto had been spared the exacting scrutiny of pure democratic principles -- family, marriage, the regulation of morals, the authority of law, even the authority of learning -- now seemed somehow suspect, if not illegitimate. For the '68ers, it was perfectly obvious that the struggle begun in the streets of Selma and Chicago's Grant Park should be followed by new campaigns in the classrooms and bedrooms of America. The line between politics and culture looked absurd to them for the simple reason that they did not take the democratic idea to be a merely political principle. It was, so to speak, an existential one that deserved to be applied to every aspect of our lives.
This existential character of the American democratic faith has been noted by alert European observers of our country ever since Tocqueville and Mrs. Trollope began writing about us in the 19th century. They immediately notice two things: that democracy in America is considered not just a set of institutions and principles but a way of life and that it is promoted with a unique sort of passion. We Americans have trouble entertaining the notion that there might be aspects of life -- let alone whole parts of the globe -- where it cannot or should not apply. To suggest this might be the case is to risk being burned by the fire of democratic passion.
The American Founders had a strong sense of the passions to which democratic politics is subject, which is why they placed such a high value on moderating and canalizing them in the system of government they fashioned. What they did not anticipate was that the American conception of democracy would become an existential one progressively chipping away at the distinction between politics and culture that they took for granted. Nor did they imagine that once democratic political passions spilled over into the morally and psychologically fragile sphere of culture, they would be more difficult to moderate and their damage more difficult to repair.
It is little wonder that since the 60's we have become such a "sensitive" nation, in every sense of the term, for we have extended the democratic project into extremely intimate areas of life: sexual identity, marital relations, authority in the family and moral education, not to mention the eternal complications of race and ethnicity. This conception of democracy as an all-encompassing way of life is utterly foreign to European society, in large part because its own past, like that of most human cultures, was aristocratic and hierarchical. Europeans have therefore been somewhat anxious about this trans-Atlantic difference, wondering whether America is exceptional or merely more advanced in fashioning a democratic culture destined to spread across the globe. Whatever one's views on these speculations, the Europeans are right to think that American democratic passions are still unique in the world. Although democracy is becoming more widely recognized abroad as a political value, there is still only one nation on earth that takes it to be an existential one.
Which is not to say that European culture has not been transformed since the 60's, in many ways following the American democratic example. There has been something of a continental cultural revolution, though it has been carried out much more slowly than our own and without our red-hot passion. The list of legal reforms stemming from the 60's is long and familiar: the legalization of abortion, the near abolition of censorship, guarantees of sexual equality in the workplace, the decriminalization of homosexual activity, the parity of husbands and wives before the law and the loosening of parents' statutory authority over their children. Informal changes in cultural mores also took place after '68, as life became more relaxed and flexible in the workplace and the home. And, not surprisingly, many of the dispiriting repercussions of the 60's that we have experienced have also followed this transformation in Europe, including increased divorce and illegitimacy rates, the decline in public civility, drug problems and violent youth crimes.
Yet after the shock of '68 and the flood of accumulated cultural demands it unleashed, the institution of these reforms in Europe met with general social consensus, mostly because of unspoken agreement about the limits to cultural democratization. European feminists have won many victories over recent decades without taking on the joyless militancy of American feminism, without questioning the naturalness of family or upsetting the psychologically delicate ritual of seduction. European schools that used to be strictly hierarchical and indifferent to laggards have become more attentive to students' needs. The curriculum, however, remains much as it was 30 years ago, and there are no agonizing debates about making it "representative." In short, cultural issues Americans instinctively frame in terms of nonnegotiable democratic principles have been treated in Europe through an informal balancing of those principles with other, nonpolitical ones.
Indeed, because the modernization of post-'68 European culture was not brought about through the sort of messianic moral crusade that has been so divisive in America, in certain ways its reforms have gone further than our own, and with fewer untoward effects. As the '68 anniversary was marked in France this spring, there were calm public debates about two measures that would be unthinkable in the United States even today. One would require that half of each political party's candidates for office be women; the other would establish a legal framework for recognizing homosexual couples.
In short, despite the extreme political violence of the 60's, there has been no post-'68 "culture war" in Europe. And the culture warriors so familiar to us -- aging '68 professors promoting the Glorious Revolution, agitated conservative journalists portraying America as Gomorrah -- are nowhere to be found.
All revolutions inevitably face the same crisis: how to bring themselves to a close. This is because revolutionary success depends on stirring up passions that subsequently prove difficult to cool. With modern revolutions such passions are even more difficult to calm because they are accompanied by revolutions in ideas, which have a way of digging in their heels and resisting retirement after they have been overtaken by events. To the extent that the European 60's revolution was driven by an idea, it was an old conception of political revolution that had been born in 1789, revived in 1917 and began collapsing after World War II under the weight of a new social reality and its own evident failures around the globe. The 60's were about the end of this tradition in Europe, and perhaps that is why they are finally over. European culture has been, and continues to be, reformed in light of that experience, but not in the shadow of the revolutionary ideal.
The American 60's were also about an idea, though not about burying it. For better or worse, our cultural revolution has now entered the pantheon of victories for the American democratic project and there it will remain, flanked on one side by the abolition of slavery and segregation and on the other by an empty altar reserved for heroes of the next campaign. Americans today see the 60's as continuing a native tradition, not as departing from it, and in this respect our revolution was more conservative than the European one. It does not, at least in public perception, represent a break in our history.
Yet the reason this revolution continues to haunt us is that by breaking down the last fences between democratic politics and culture, it entered unexplored territory. And there it has begun to lose its bearings and cause some harm -- to our families, our schools, our cultural institutions, our public life and, indeed, to our psychological well-being. These harms are real, not the figment of the conservative imagination. But they are virtually impossible for pro- and anti-'68 partisans to consider dispassionately, so strong is the grip of the democratic idea on us all. Even American conservatives today can find no compelling democratic reason to question the extension of the democratic principle to the realms of morals, sex, family and education, which means they can find no reason at all.
In this sense, our 60's are over, too: we are all '68ers now. And that is our problem. We are anxious about the America the '68 revolution has bequeathed us, but we avoid thinking too deeply about it, fearing, perhaps with good reason, that our faith -- our all-encompassing democratic faith -- might not stand the test.

HEADLINE: A Utopia Awakens and Shakes Itself;
Chautauqua, Once a Cultural Haven for Religion Teachers, Survives

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

DATELINE: CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y.

 BODY:
In 1899, after the philosopher William James visited Chautauqua, the combination arts festival and resort here in southwestern New York, he wrote that he was "spellbound by the charm and ease of everything, by the middle-class paradise, without a victim, without a blot, without a tear." But James said he was astonished on entering "the dark and wicked world again, to catch myself quite unexpectedly and involuntarily saying: 'Ouf! what a relief! Now for something primordial and savage.' "
Indeed, Chautauqua, founded in 1874 by Lewis Miller, an Akron, Ohio, inventor, and father-in-law of Thomas Edison, and John Heyl Vincent, a Methodist minister, as a summer school for Sunday-school teachers, is a utopian community of 7,500 summer residents seemingly devoted to the highest ideals of the spirit and the intellect. Nestled on 750 acres on the shores of Lake Chautauqua, the Chautauqua Institution is a place of pastel-colored Victorian cottages with filigreed trim and gardens coordinated with pink and white flowers. Children ride their bikes without fear of cars. And sometimes it does seem a little like Truman Burbank's artificial hometown of Seahaven in the Jim Carrey movie "The Truman Show." 
 But in its heyday in the 19th century, Chautauqua was one of the most important cultural institutions of its time, with an incalculable effect on the dissemination of education and culture in the United States, particularly for women, who had little access to higher education. Today, after exhausting its original mission, Chautauqua, almost incredibly, has carried on, averting financial crises, and prospering.
Four sitting American Presidents have visited Chautauqua, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who gave his "I hate war speech" in the amphitheater in 1936. President Clinton prepared for his debate with Robert Dole here in 1996. And George Gershwin composed his Concerto in F in one of the practice shacks in 1925.
Still, as it gears up for its 125th anniversary celebration next year, Chautauqua is undergoing a profound self-examination, asking how it can broaden its anachronistic population of mostly white, older and prosperous Americans so that it can remain true to its fundamental mission: serious debate about contemporary issues in an atmosphere of cultural vitality.
"We're asking ourselves a lot of important questions about our future," said Dr. Daniel L. Bratton, Chautauqua's president and a Methodist minister. "We're using the anniversary as a time to bring these issues to a head."
But what exactly is Chautauqua? "Even Chautauquans have difficulty explaining Chautauqua," said Joan Fox, the director of public information. Chautauqua is a nonprofit institution, not too different from a giant co-op. Most of the common ground is owned by the Chautauqua Foundation. The 1,100 houses are privately owned, some of them by eighth-generation Chautauquans. The institution operates on a budget of some $14 million a year with a year-round staff of about 90, which in the summer grows to 1,500 people. It is governed by a 24-member board of trustees.
The Chautauqua Institution has its own daily newspaper, The Chautauquan, its own symphony orchestra, conservatory theater, opera company, ballet company. A total of 8,000 students attend its schools of music, ballet, opera, theater, visual arts. At the center of Chautauqua life is the 10:45 A.M. lecture in the 5,000-seat amphitheater, with the summer divided into subject weeks. This summer's topics have included "Ethics: Teaching Virtue, Educating for Character" and "The Road to Educational Excellence."
Cultural events are open to outsiders, and over the course of a summer about 142,000 people visit. There is a children's school and day camps, called the Boys' and Girls' Clubs. Chautauqua has its own security force, which has little to do but rebuke teen-agers who pour soapsuds in the fountains. There is a 158-room wooden hotel, the Athenaeum, built in 1881, also run by the institution.
Chautauqua has its own deeply ingrained rituals, Old First Night Day, for instance, its annual birthday celebration, and Recognition Day, when members of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, one of the oldest continuous book clubs in the country, graduate, each class with its own motto, emblem and officers. Those who read extra books can join the Guild of the Seven Seals.
"Chautauqua is kind of the memory of America," said Jeffrey Simpson, whose family has been coming here for 88 years, and whose book "Chautauqua," will be published next year by Harry N. Abrams. "One of the reasons it was so successful is that it reflected a small-town America many Americans were moving away from. We know from Sinclair Lewis that small towns could be culturally arid places. But because of its transitory nature, Chautauqua could be the perfect small town. It reflected that wonderful American curiosity, that omnivorous interest in information, and it is contained in this picture-perfect place."
On a recent Saturday, there was a Catholic Mass in the Chapel of the Good Shepherd and Jewish Services in the Hurlbut Church, followed by bridge instruction in the Women's Clubhouse and an Alumni Association "Great American Picnic." Bard O'Neill, director of Middle East Studies at the National War College, was lecturing on Islamic fundamentalism to a group in the Hall of Philosophy, built to resemble the Parthenon.
Every 15 minutes or so, the bells in the campanile of the Miller Bell Tower chimed, sometimes pealing out hymns. Down by the lake, children played not far from Palestine Park, a contour model of the Holy Land, with a pond representing the Dead Sea, and a trickle of water the River Jordan. At McKnight Hall there was a School of Music voice master class, while at the Chautauqua Center for the Visual Arts there was a demonstration, "Making an Adirondack Twig Basket." Later, there was another Mass in the Hall of Philosophy, and a choir rehearsal for Sunday services.
Religion is fundamental to Chautauqua, although many residents do not attend church. Most Chautauquans are Christian, and about 20 percent are Jewish.
"There is an inarticulated awareness of the sacred and the holy in the whole community because of the natural surroundings and because of the created human beauty," said Ross Mackenzie, director of the department of religion. "Civil discourse, friendship, dance, music, all of these are expressions of human created beauty. They all give us an awareness of the holy."
 
'The Heart' Of the Movement
Although Chautauqua was originally founded with a religious purpose, its major influence has been secular, primarily through the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, formed in 1878. The circle has been called "the heart of the Chautauqua movement." Members were required to read books from a list with the aid of study guides. In the first 20 years, 10,000 local reading circles were formed, a quarter of them in villages of less than 500. There were circles in prisons and country stores.
By 1918, more than half a million people had taken the Chautauqua correspondence course. "This permeation of American life through its smallest units is perhaps the most significant social fact about Chautauqua," said Arthur E. Bestor Jr., Chautauqua's president from 1915 to 1944. Today there are few local reading circles left, and the movement continues today mainly at the summer institution, with each "class" required to read 12 books in four years. There were 127 graduates this year.
In 1883, Chautauqua was chartered as a university and remained one for 12 years, until other universities began offering summer courses. By the end of the 19th century, Chautauqua was, Russell Lynes, the historian, wrote, "a cultural phenomenon with some of the sweep and force of a tidal wave." There were about 300 independent or loosely affiliated chautauquas. Traveling chautauquas, or "tent chautauquas," provided forums for famous speakers like William Jennings Bryan, who once gave 50 lectures in 28 days on the circuit.
With the advent of talking pictures and cars, which enabled people to travel to find culture, the traveling chautauquas began to decline. Today there are about 28 loosely affiliated local chautauquas, including one in Lakeside, Ohio, on Lake Erie, and the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association in New Jersey.
In 1933, Chautauqua went into receivership. Money was raised by deeding back the houses, which had been rented, to members for 20 percent of their assessed value.
By the 1970's, Chautauqua seemed to be going into a decline. Attendance was lagging; the buildings were in disrepair, and it was having a hard time meeting its budget. Richard Miller, a Milwaukee lawyer, and great-grandson of Lewis Miller, became chairman of the Chautauqua board.
He began an aggressive fund-raising campaign and built up the endowment. The old buildings were repaired. Today, Chautauqua has an endowment of about $40 million with another $50 million in promised bequests from its wealthy members.
But today's typical Chautauquan is no longer a Sunday school teacher, or a public-school teacher, but is over 50 and a wealthy professional. Houses can cost up to $1 million.
Trying to Attract
Younger Poeple
"The concern is that some of the people who make it interesting -- like professors -- can't afford to keep coming," said Twig Branch, a fourth-generation Chautauquan, who is an insurance agent. "We business people are really boring," he added with a laugh.
Chautauqua is also struggling to attract younger people, and indeed there has been an increase in the number of children on "the Grounds." It is also trying to attract a more diverse population. For one thing, in order to get foundation support, it needs diversity.
"There is a rapidly expanding black middle class, and they haven't discovered it," said Dr. Bratton, the president of Chautauqua. "Everybody, including blacks, likes to have people like them around," he said. "The absence of a critical mass makes it a longer task."
Most people believe that diversity will develop. "This is a time of growth," said Alfreda L. Irwin, 85, the institution's official historian, whose family has been coming to Chautauqua for six generations. "Learning is a sport here. Dr. Vincent and his son, George, said we needed to stay close to the movements of society.
"Because the society is diverse, we aim to be like society. Chautauqua is very open and would like to have all sorts of people come here and participate. I think it will happen, just naturally."

HEADLINE: Strikes Raise Key Issues Of How Bells Can Compete

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
The stock of the Bell Atlantic Corporation has lost 11.8 percent of its value since Aug. 3, when the 73,000 of its employees who are represented by the Communications Workers of America authorized the union to call the strike that began the next weekend.
Over the same period, shares of the other four local Bell telephone companies -- each with their own big union contingents -- have declined by an average of 3.8 percent. While three of them -- Ameritech, BellSouth and SBC Communications -- have signed new labor contracts since last spring, about 34,000 union workers at U S West walked off the job early Sunday after failing to reach an accord over contract issues that include a new performance-based pay structure. 
 It was not surprising that Bell Atlantic's shareholders showed signs of being spooked before the strike. More intriguing was that investors showed no sign of relief even after workers returned to their jobs last Tuesday after a two-day walkout. The company's stock remained essentially flat for the rest of the week, closing at $41.125 on Friday, down $1.8125. Nor, with U S West's labor situation unsettled, have the shares of the other Bells rebounded.
In light of the stock market's broad downturn, of course, there may be no need to read labor implications into the dip of the Bell shares. But strikes, or even the threat of them, raise important questions about the Bells' ability to compete in the $200 billion telecommunications industry -- a business where they will try to move beyond conventional local service to offer long-distance and Internet services.
Significantly, a key victory for the communications workers at Bell Atlantic was the union's securing rights to install and maintain sophisticated new data networks, limiting the company's ability to use lower-paid nonunion labor for such work.
Heading into this future marketplace, where few of their rivals are unionized, the Bells will carry a significant labor legacy. According to the Communications Workers of America, overall union representation, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, at each of the five Bells is an average of 60.7 percent of the work force. Meanwhile, among the companies with which the Bells will be competing -- alternative local carriers, long-distance companies, Internet service providers and cable companies -- only the AT&T Corporation has a large union work force.
All of this raises key questions. Do their large proportions of union workers put the Bells at a long-term disadvantage in a brutally competitive market where almost all of the other players use mostly nonunion labor? And even if labor costs end up representing only a fraction of the Bells' business costs, will the need to negotiate new ways of operating with a big union hamper the companies' ability to move nimbly in a fast-changing environment?
Bell Atlantic executives refused to discuss these matters last week. But the issues seem unlikely to go away. True, labor issues will probably not be the defining factor in the fate of the regional Bells over the next few years. More influential will be technological change, regulatory shifts and corporate takeovers. And as Frank J. Governali, the head telecommunications analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, pointed out, good, creative management can almost always trump potentially problematic labor questions. But that management burden will undoubtedly be higher on the leaders of the Bells than on their counterparts.
And it cannot help but be an issue for the big corporate customers who will have an expanding choice of service providers. In awarding contracts, how do they factor in the potential costs of a strike like Bell Atlantic's, in which installations and repairs were simply not performed. Corporate communications managers might ponder: This time the strike was only two days, but what if next time it's two weeks? Or two months? Or four months, as with the Nynex Corporation in 1989?
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, said that his union's power actually provided a competitive advantage to the unionized communications companies because they offer customers a more knowledgeable, better trained work force. "All the empirical evidence indicates that the best continuous education programs for workers are in union shops," Mr. Bahr said last week.
In an interview before the U S West strike began, Jerry W. Brown, a company spokesman, said that the union provided an efficient way for management to communicate goals and strategies to its workers. Yet, he also said that the main sticking point in the talks was the company's plan to link more of a worker's pay to performance -- which, of course, tends to be the way pay is set in nonunion workplaces.
Such sticking points can only grow more important as competition heats up in the industry, in the view of Eric Strumingher, a telecommunications analyst at Paine Webber.
"Short term, what's going to happen over the next three years, I don't think labor's a major issue," Mr. Strumingher said. "But on a longer-term issue, and once the marketplace stabilizes and everything evens out a bit, then we will get down to who has a low operating cost structure. The Bells are going to have some questions to answer."

HEADLINE: Beyond Boosterism in the Alley;
New York's Web Industry May Be Outgrowing Its Image

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
The restless clan of chic geeks and entrepreneurs who populate New York's new media industry may not be anywhere near as rich as their West Coast counterparts. But in the pages of Jason McCabe Calacanis's monthly Silicon Alley Reporter, they emerge far more glamorous.
"The industry here is driven by people," Mr. Calacanis, 27, lectured a magazine job applicant recently over breakfast at Balthazar's. "On the West Coast there are a handful of celebrities -- Bill Gates, Larry Ellison," Mr. Calacanis said, referring to the chairman of the world's two largest software companies. "Those people are boring. They don't take good pictures." 
 Mr. Calacanis's irreverence is either refreshing or hopelessly sophomoric, depending on one's point of view. Yet his shameless boosterism of Silicon Alley -- New York's downtown multimedia hub -- has helped create the aura of community and even home-team spirit for a disparate group of colleagues and competitors who otherwise might have little more in common than being located in Manhattan and trying to find some sort of profitable business on the World Wide Web.
Certainly Mr. Calacanis's application of celebrity journalism to the world of New York new media has earned him a certain measure of success. In less than two years the Silicon Alley Reporter has grown from a few photocopied sheets to 116 glossy pages, on the strength of advertising sales and revenue from the periodic industry conferences Mr. Calacanis has organized like last month's "Rising Tide Summit," which attracted more than 200 registrants who paid $500 each to attend.
And yet, there is a growing sense in some quarters that the community identity that Silicon Alley Reporter has worked so hard to sell may no longer be the way many members of that community want to see themselves -- or be seen by the larger business world.
Although there are some holdouts, notably the on-line magazines Feed and Word, increasingly, the definition of "new media" in New York seems to be moving away from artsy, underfunded Web sites like Stim, a Prodigy pop-culture project that fell by the wayside, or the interactive soap opera The East Village. The new media seem to be maturing instead into on-line extensions of the old-line Manhattan media -- whether in advertising, marketing, publishing or broadcasting.
And as venture-capitalized start-ups evolve into I.P.O.-financed corporations, some industry executives are concerned that Mr. Calacanis' unflagging promotion of an image evoking artists' lofts and SoHo may be at odds with the businesslike demeanor that will play well in boardrooms and on Wall Street.
"He is a hypester in an industry that could do with less hype," said Kyle Shannon, co-founder of Agency.com. The company's major shareholder is the giant advertising holding company the Omnicom Group, which, through a series of acquisitions, has become the largest agency devoted to creating advertising on the Internet. "There are two Silicon Alleys -- the one where people go to the parties and the one where people actually do the work," Mr. Shannon said.
To be sure, many of the citizens of Silicon Alley are not yet ready to go completely corporate -- to stop dressing in black or bleaching their hair blonde or, among the men, raising goatees.
"We have to work very hard to balance the kind of accountability we have to have now with the creative risk-taking that brought us to where we are," said Nicholas Butterworth, president of Sonicnet, an Internet broadcaster acquired last year by the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc.
"We have to move to new office space, and I'm scared," said Mr. Butterworth, whose company has been located in a loft. "One of the terrible and great things about Sonicnet is we have no walls. What happens if we put up walls?"
Mr. Butterworth said he reads the Silicon Alley Reporter because Mr. Calacanis, a former gossip columnist from Brooklyn, manages to tell it mostly like it is. "Is it balanced? No. It's partisan. But it delivers the goods."
Few would fault Mr. Calacanis for not speaking his mind -- although he seems to save his rants for subjects beyond the borders of downtown Manhattan. Born of a new-media column that he was writing for Paper magazine, the first issue of Silicon Alley Reporter carried the headline "Microsoft Alienates Alley." And in his daily E-mail feed last week, Mr. Calacanis' critiqued Texas-based Zapata's Internet acquisition strategy as "over-simplistic 1995 thinking."
Other characteristic fixtures of Mr. Calacanis's magazine include a controversial map that highlights a revolving -- some say random -- bunch of new media firms below 57th Street. Then there's the monthly feature labeled "Digital Dim Sum: They lead the charmed life so you don't have to," which presents paparazzi-style photographs of aspiring Silicon Alley business leaders.
"Jason's challenge will be to figure out what his focus is as the industry fragments into its logical genres," said Josh Harris, co-founder of the online research firm Jupiter Communications and now chief executive of an Internet television venture. "I look at my contemporaries and we've all been through the war and we all know it's never going to be the same. It's like after my freshman year, it's time to leave the dorm."
At last month's conference, for instance, some attendees grumbled at the hour devoted to interviewing the Belgian anarchist who won notoriety earlier this year by throwing a cream pie in the face of Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
"Jason doesn't represent Silicon Alley," said one attendee, who insisted on anonymity because he didn't want to risk retribution in print. "This is someone who is busy being flip and glib when the industry is really about serious people who are running serious businesses."
But such criticism may also belie a certain defensiveness about the industry's lingering immaturity, even as it struggles through adolescence.
"What people try to avoid saying about Jason, and it's not really about Jason but about the industry in New York, is that it's small-time," said Michael Wolff, the newly appointed media columnist for New York magazine and author of "Burn Rate," (Simon and Schuster, 1998) a book about the rise and fall of his own New York new media company. "The point about New York is we have not had a defining business here," Mr. Wolff said.
The Alley's derivative nickname first caught on in 1995, with the explosion of Web and the conviction that its "content" -- the techie catch-all for magazines, newspapers, music, movies, TV, advertising and various vaguely defined interactive stuff -- would be produced in the world's media capital. But of all of those things, only advertising has shown a propensity to make money on the Web. Moreover, the truly successful Web content -- at least this month -- appears to be the information tools or "portals" aggregated by major search engines like Yahoo, Excite and Snap, which are all located on the West Coast.
Still, New York partisans are quick to point to the initial public offering of Doubleclick, an advertising services firm, which went public last winter at $17 a share and closed Friday at $43. City officials cite a survey conducted by Coopers & Lybrand that shows that by mid-1997, the number of new media jobs and companies had doubled to 105,771 and 4,881, respectively, in a mere 18 months.
And on Friday, shares of 24/7, another Web advertising firm, rose 45 percent to close at $20.25 in its first day of trading. Two more New York companies, The Globe, an on-line community Web site and Earthweb, an interactive services firm, also recently announced their intention to go public.
By most accounts, the disadvantage of being across the continent from Sand Hill Road where Silicon Valley's venture capitalists hold court is not as sharp as it once was, as East Coast investors like Flatiron Partners take up some of the slack.
Yet, in the insular new media community, the fact that Joanne Wilson, wife of a Flatiron partner, Fred Wilson, sells advertising for the Silicon Alley Reporter has raised eyebrows in some circles.
Mr. Calacanis denies critics' contention that the companies Mr. Wilson invests in get special editorial consideration.
A black belt in karate who put himself through Fordham University repairing electronic equipment, Mr. Calacanis makes no pretense to vaunted journalistic objectivity. "It's no secret I'm a fan of this industry," he said. "We write about every failure. We cover it. We don't obsess over it."
After graduating with a degree in psychology, Mr. Calacanis landed a job in technical support for the Sony Corporation's legal department. A habitual hustler, he managed to talk his way into a ride on the corporate jet to chat about the Internet with Sony's then-president, Michael P. Schulhof.
A project for America Online that he developed after leaving Sony did not take off, but in the winter of 1996, Mr. Calacanis took the modest sum America Online paid him for his efforts and started Silicon Alley Reporter, which he initially wrote, produced and distributed almost entirely himself.
Now, with a staff of eight helping him put out the magazine, Mr. Calacanis is growing up and branching out. Forsaking neighborhood loyalties for the prospect of a new market, he has been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles lately and has begun running a "Digital Coast Reporter" insert in the magazine, appropriating the appellation a group of Southern California new-media entrepreneurs recently bestowed on the region.
Back home, meanwhile, to compete with a local on-line news service, @NY, Mr. Calacanis recently started a daily E-mail news feed.
And he has entered into a partnership with Gordon Gould, 28, who has put more than $100,000 into the magazine -- its first investment. On behalf of the magazine, Mr. Gould also organized a conference last month at the New York Historical Society, where Palm Pilot-toting new-media executives dined on sushi and were invited to think beyond their business concerns to the social implications of the Web and related media.
David Bunnell, a West Coast technology publishing veteran who attended the conference, said he came away bullish on the New York new-media enclave and on The Silicon Alley Reporter.
"What good magazines do is identify some kind of audience and provide the members of that audience with a sense of membership and belonging; and they've done that remarkably well," said Mr. Bunnell, who runs the trade publication Upside. "What they lack in resources they make up for in enthusiasm."
And as with the industry Mr. Calacanis covers, maturity shows signs of tempering raw enthusiasm One evening last week, dressed in black with sunglasses atop his head, Mr. Calcanis made an appearance at a SoHo courtyard party held by the Web ad-tracking company I-Traffic. Six months ago he might have been carrying a camera to snap the faces of his favorite entrepreneurs and their hangers-on. But this time he said there would be no party report in his magazine.
"I have other things to do; I have to write an analysis of the Ticketmaster-City Search deal," he said, referring to last week's announcement of a West Coast new-media merger. "I have to get the daily out. I have work to do."

HEADLINE: DuPont May Be Seeking Sale of Conoco

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The DuPont Company, which in May announced plans to sell the public 20 percent of its Conoco Inc. oil subsidiary, may now be looking to sell all of Conoco.
DuPont declined to comment on a report yesterday in a London newspaper that the French oil company Elf Aquitaine wants to buy Conoco for $24 billion, but analysts said a sale to Elf or another middle-size petroleum company would make strategic sense for DuPont. 
 The article in the London newspaper, The Financial Mail, which said Elf was preparing an offer that would include swapping some assets with DuPont, said other oil companies were also looking at Conoco, the ninth-largest oil company in the United States. The report, citing an unidentified industry official, did not name any other potential bidders.
The report comes less than a week after British Petroleum P.L.C. said it would buy Amoco for $48.2 billion in stock and cash, setting off speculation that more middle-size oil companies may merge so they can hold down costs in an era of cheap oil and compete with the biggest of the oil giants, Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell. British Petroleum acquired Standard of Ohio in 1987.
Catherine Durand, an Elf Aquitaine spokeswoman reached at her home in Paris, said the company would not comment on "stock exchange speculation."
Susan Gaffney, a DuPont spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on the report. But nothing in DuPont's planned initial public offering of Conoco shares would preclude an outright sale of the company, she said.
In May, DuPont announced that it would make an initial public offering for 20 percent of Conoco as part of its strategy to rely less on its cyclical petrochemicals business. Instead, DuPont wants to concentrate more on development of genetically engineered products to generate future growth and existing products, such as speciality chemicals, that it believes are less subject to wide swings in demand and price.
DuPont, which has been expected to hold a so-called road show for potential Conoco investors next month, said in May the I.P.O. was a step toward divesting itself of Conoco.
Conoco was acquired in 1981 to insure DuPont a steady supply of oil as a feed stock for its chemicals business in an era of rapidly rising oil prices and high inflation. Now, with oil selling at a fraction of the inflation-adjusted price in 1981 and exploration of offshore fields requiring massive capital investments, owning an oil company is no longer attractive to DuPont.
If it sold all or part of Conoco, whether for cash outright or through a public offering, DuPont would be liable for billions of dollars in capital gains taxes. So an offer that allows for a tax-free exchange of assets -- as Elf is reportedly proposing -- would be especially attractive, said Theodore S. Semegran, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman.
Elf is the majority owner of Sanofi, a large French pharmaceutical company, and it makes perfumes under such brand names as Oscar de la Renta and Fendi. If these or other assets were swapped for part of Conoco, the deal could be structured to reduce DuPont's capital gains taxes.
"They have to make a decision about whether they will get a greater total return by starting with an I.P.O. and then spinning Conoco off or by selling it outright," Mr. Semegran said. "An offer that would help them avoid some fairly significant capital gains taxes would be attractive."
He said Conoco was worth between $22 billion and $23 billion, slightly less than the price Elf is reportedly willing to pay.
Conoco has developed large tracts of oil in the North Sea, Indonesia and, recently, off the West Coast of Africa. Conoco also has large refineries and a chain of retail gas stations in the United States. In early 1995 the company tried to arrange a deal to develop two oil fields in Iran. But that deal fell apart because of opposition by the Bronfman family, which at the time held the controlling stake in DuPont, but has since sold its stake and invested in MCA, the Hollywood entertainment company.
Elf also has fields in the North Sea which, if combined with Conoco's, could potentially allow for lower-cost operations there.

HEADLINE: King Hussein Gives His Brother Some Powers

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 16

 BODY:
King Hussein, who is undergoing cancer treatment in the United States, has given his brother and heir to the throne the power to shuffle the Government, officials said today.
The move was made public as the Government has come under increasing criticism in recent weeks. It has been accused of negligence in allowing Amman's water system to become polluted and for fudging economic statistics to hide the extent of Jordan's recession. 
 The King issued the decree from his hospital bed in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., a Government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The move gives 51-year-old Crown Prince Hassan, who is acting as regent in the absence of the King, more constitutional powers.
Another official said King Hussein had barred Prince Hassan from shuffling the Government in a decree issued in late July, when he left for the United States. He deleted that reference in the new decree, the official said. Neither decree was made public.

HEADLINE: In America;
Clinton's Own Web

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Headlines are calling it the moment of truth. We'll see.
Presidential candidate Bill Clinton went on the "60 Minutes" program right after the Super Bowl in late January 1992 to clear up the Gennifer Flowers mess. The idea was to tell the truth, to be straight with the American people, and thus save his damaged candidacy. Here's what happened. With more than 30 million viewers looking on, and with Hillary Clinton at his side, he lied. 
 It worked. The Flowers story, replete with taped conversations between Ms. Flowers and Mr. Clinton, was so sordid the press was uncomfortable with it and the public soon grew sick of it. When Mr. Clinton came in second in the New Hampshire primary in February, he dubbed himself "the comeback kid."
Within weeks of the "60 Minutes" appearance, Mr. Clinton was facing new questions about how he had avoided the draft during the war in Vietnam. He didn't want to be seen as a draft dodger. If he won the nomination, he would be facing George Bush, who had a strong record of service in World War II. So, as he so often does, Mr. Clinton gave the truth the slip.
Had he received a draft notice or not? Did he escape simply by virtue of a high number in the draft lottery or had he pulled strings? Was he a committed anti-war activist willing to pay a price for sticking by his principles, or just a coward willing to let others fight and perhaps die in his place?
Who knew? The candidate told so many stories, crafted so many evasive answers, came up with so many lame excuses that he gave everybody a headache. The public got tired of the matter and the story went away.
It took Mr. Clinton years to come up with the classic "I didn't inhale" response to questions about marijuana. He danced around that issue like Fred Astaire, saying he hadn't broken this law, or violated that statute. We've gotten used to it. It's as if the idea of a straight answer to a difficult question is completely alien to the man.
Now he is going before a Federal grand jury in an effort to salvage what remains of his Presidency. Just about every question he'll be asked will be tough. The danger is that he has woven so many lies he'll be trapped in his own insidious web.
The issue at the moment is not about impeachment. The Republicans have neither the clout nor the inclination, based on what is now known, to remove Mr. Clinton from office. Rather than fiddling with the dangerously unpredictable bomb of impeachment, the Trent Lotts, Newt Gingriches and Orrin Hatches of the world would much rather see the President, the hope of so many Democrats, sitting humiliated in the White House through the year 2000.
The real issue is the President's relationship with the American people. Mr. Clinton's poll numbers may be high but the nation's sense of trust in its President is collapsing. He lied about Gennifer Flowers. He seems to have lied about Monica Lewinsky. Why would it not be plausible to believe he lied about Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey? Or, for that matter, about delicate foreign policy issues, or legislative deal-making, or favors granted to fund-raisers?
Mr. Clinton's strength in the polls, I think, is the result of an economy that is going well, the contemptible qualities of so many of his enemies, the reluctance of a large number of Americans to turn even more power over to the ideologues in the Republican Party, and certain personal qualities that have long benefited Mr. Clinton -- his charm, intelligence, good looks, work ethic, resilience and toughness.
None of this will matter if he lies to the grand jury, or if he looks the public in the eye and lies again about that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.
Mr. Clinton is getting advice, solicited and unsolicited, from many quarters. Most of his longtime advisers and close friends are urging him, directly or indirectly, to tell the full truth to the grand jury and the public.
Is he capable of telling the truth when the going gets tough? Who knows. If it turns out he's not, the last two years of his already damaged Presidency won't be worth much. At some point the public will lose its patience, even with Bill Clinton.

HEADLINE: The Day After In Ulster Town: Now 'It's Back'

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: OMAGH, Northern Ireland, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The day after the deadliest paramilitary attack in 29 years of sectarian violence in this British province, dozens of people sat blank-faced or weeping this afternoon at a community center set up as a command post to find people still missing.
The attack, at the height of downtown shopping on Saturday, killed 28 people and wounded more than 200. It stunned Omagh, which is mostly Roman Catholic, and the rest of this predominantly Protestant province. 
 "One day I was watching the bombs against America in Africa," said Michael MacAnespae, a 54-year-old mushroom farmer. "We thought all that was behind us here. But suddenly it's back on your own doorstep."
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the police and political leaders, both Protestant and Catholic, said it appeared to have been the work of a group calling itself the Real I.R.A., a splinter group of the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republican Army. The I.R.A. itself has been observing a cease-fire for 13 months.
Both Catholics, who constitute 70 percent of the population of the town, and Protestants were killed in the blast on Saturday.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain interrupted a vacation in France to fly here this morning. The Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Bertie Ahern, went to Belfast tonight to discuss ways of combating the splinter group.
The object of the attack was clearly to disrupt or destroy the peace agreement reached by leaders of Protestants and Catholics and overwhelmingly approved in May referendums in both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, to the south.
The police had unwittingly herded a crowd of people toward the bomb because of a misleading telephone warning.
Among those who died abruptly at 3:10 P.M. Saturday, was Brenda Logue, described as an ordinary teen-ager full of laughter and hope. Her blood spilled on the pavement of Market Street, along with the others killed and wounded by the 500-pound car bomb.
Friends and relatives said she seemed happy on Saturday morning as she came in from the countryside to this usually calm. well-scrubbed town in the hills of central Ulster. After days of mist and rain, the sun had come out.
Brenda Logue and her mother, Mary, strolled by the floats and exhibits of the annual town festival. They went into a household goods shop on Market Street that was full of weekend shoppers. She left the shop while her mother stayed inside, putting her in the way of the bomb, while her mother was slightly wounded but survived.
Brenda, 17, had a job prospect on a mushroom farm, and she was a good Gaelic football player. She was, her friends and relatives said, looking forward to life.
"She has a sense of humor, " said Mr. MacAnespae, who had offered her a job on his farm. "She was bubbly." Mr. MacAnespae, a local council member of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A. political wing, said he could not understand the attack, apparently by a Catholic group.
"They say they want to unite Ireland," he said. "Is this the way to unite Ireland? It may have been the way long ago, but that way has been tried and it failed."
Sinn Fein, and every other party and church, has condemned the attack.
At the information center, people scanned a bulletin board for new postings identifying the dead and the wounded. Most declined politely to talk to reporters, shaking their heads and lowering their eyes.
Brenda's uncle, Michael Logue, 28, an unemployed salesman, left Brenda's parents and went into a men's room, where he broke into unrestrained weeping. "Just a teen-ager," he said. "I saw it on TV. It's just like Beirut."
The others who died included Mary Grimes, 65, her daughter Avril Monaghan, 30 -- who was pregnant with twins -- and her granddaughter, Maura, who lived in outlying towns and were visiting Omagh to shop.
A mother of four buying a school uniform for her youngest girl was also killed, as well as three boys from the Irish Republic traveling with a 12-year-old Spanish student as part of an exchange program, and the 24-year-old teacher leading them.
The Spanish exchange students had been studying English for a month in Donegal, in the northwest corner of the Irish Republic. They made a day trip across the border with some Irish students to visit the Ulster-American Folk Park near Omagh, and some decided afterward to shop in town. Eleven members of the group were among those wounded.
The police said those who died in the bombing included 14 women, 5 men and 7 children, with two others not yet identified.
Of the 220 people wounded in Omagh, about 100 remained in hospitals across Northern Ireland on Sunday, including 11 people in critical condition.
"All of our patients will be disfigured in some way," Dr. Laurence Rocke, a surgeon at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, told The Associated Press, speaking of the wounded being treated there. "Some will be disabled very severely, and some may not survive." .
Outside County Tyrone Hospital, where many of the wounded were treated, two prominent political enemies stood together in the heavy rain in a show of unity. Seamus Mallon is the Catholic deputy leader of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, which is to carry out the peace agreement. He said terrorism would not destroy the assembly, which is to give Catholics more political power. Ken Maginnis, a leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, agreed.

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SITE AN A-BOMB PLANT, U.S. AGENCIES SAY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
United States intelligence agencies have detected a huge secret underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear weapons program, according to officials who have been briefed on the intelligence information.
The finding has alarmed officials at the White House and the Pentagon, who fear that it may be an effort to break out of a four-year-old agreement in which North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in Western aid. 
 The finding also follows a string of provocations by the North, including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion of a small North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off the South Korean coast this year.
The North has said in recent months that the United States is reneging on its side of the agreement because Congress has failed to authorize tens of millions of dollars in fuel shipments for the North. The shipments are the main American contribution to a $6 billion program, under which South Korea, Japan and other nations are supposed to finance a major electric energy program as a quid pro quo for the North's abandonment of its ambitions to develop nuclear arms.
A senior Administration official said the North had not yet technically violated that accord, called the Agreed Framework, because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant that would convert nuclear waste into bomb-grade plutonium. The accord explicitly bars that activity.
But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge work site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where, until the 1994 accord, the North is believed to have created enough plutonium to build six or more bombs. Thousands of North Korean workers are swarming around the new site, burrowing into the mountainside, American officials said.
Other intelligence, which the officials would not describe, led the Administration in recent weeks to warn important members of Congress and the South Korean Government in classified briefings that they believed that the North intended to build a new reactor and reprocessing center under the mountain. Intelligence estimates of how long it would take to complete the project have ranged from two to six years, depending in part on how much outside help is received.
South Korean officials have played down the finding, officials said, because they fear undermining President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" toward North Korea, an effort to reopen aid and dialogue with the Stalinist Government in Pyongyang.
When Mr. Kim went to Washington in the spring he urged President Clinton to drop sanctions against the North that date from the end of the Korean War. But the new finding makes it far less likely that the United States will ease up on the North.
"It's a very, very serious development," said one American official, who as with the others insisted on anonymity, "to say nothing of incredibly stupid, because it endangers both the nuclear accord and humanitarian aid."
Other officials said they were clearly concerned that Congress was now less likely than ever to finance the fuel oil. If Congress refuses to fulfill the American commitment, the officials fear, that would, in turn, give the North an excuse to abandon the nuclear pact officially and, perhaps, to expel inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency who are at Yongbyon. The North has prohibited inspectors from examining sites outside Yongbyon.
At a meeting this week between North Korean officials and the American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, Charles Kartman, the United States is expected to demand that the North stop all work at the new site. It is not clear whether the North already knows that its activity has been detected.
As always in matters involving North Korea, it is virtually impossible to divine the country's real intentions.
It is possible, officials say, that the mysterious North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, is trying to rebuild a nuclear program that the West stopped in 1994. Mr. Kim may also be hoping to bolster his standing with the North Korean military. This may be a particularly critical time to placate the right wing, because Mr. Kim is expected, next month, to be given all of the titles held by his father, Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder.
The elder Mr. Kim died in July 1994, just weeks after having defused the confrontation with the United States by telling former President Jimmy Carter that he was willing to trade away the nuclear program in return for Western aid.
Another possibility is that Kim Jong Il is intending to trade away the new nuclear complex the way his father traded away the last one -- if he can extract a high enough price. American officials note that building a nuclear reactor underground is an enormously difficult technical task for any country, much less one that is starving as a result of economic collapse, drought and floods.
"Is this a nuclear breakout, a hedge, a bargaining chip?" asked Joseph Nye, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "It's hard to know."
Mr. Nye worked extensively on the North Korean nuclear issue at the Central Intelligence Agency and as a top Pentagon official in the first term of the Clinton Administration.
Mr. Nye noted that in 1993, as the United States was confronting North Korea over its efforts to reprocess nuclear waste into plutonium, the intelligence community was deeply divided on the question of whether the North wanted a bomb or was simply playing for aid. "The majority said the North would never give up the bomb, but a deal was struck," he said.
But it is not necessarily certain that the country would follow the same pattern today, he and other experts warn. In the four years since the agreement was reached, the North has grown far weaker, both economically and militarily.
"The danger is that the weaker they become the less willing they are to bargain," he said. "While that may seem counterintuitive, the North Koreans usually get tougher as they get cornered. In cultural terms, they may be more willing to accept risks in a situation of desperation."
As a result a number of experts and former officials, along with many inside the Administration, are warning that the United States should once again be alert to the possibility that the North could strike out across the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.
In recent years the United States, which has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea, has gradually increased its defensive posture, including new antimissile and antimortar artillery intended to suppress an attack on Seoul, which is within 30 miles of the border.
But the North has also improved its ability to inflict a tremendous -- if short-lived -- artillery attack on the South Korean capital.

HEADLINE: Clinton and the Court of Public Opinion

BYLINE: By Andrew Kohut 

 BODY:
No matter what President Clinton says to the grand jury today, public reaction will have a lot to do with how the Monica Lewinsky matter ultimately turns out.
So far the American people have protected their President to an extraordinary extent. To the surprise of most of the chattering class, Mr. Clinton's job approval ratings actually increased in the weeks after the allegations first surfaced in late January. And they have remained high, even as most Americans, according to opinion polls, have come to believe that he had some sort of sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and lied to them about it. While the President's personal image has suffered, the public has consistently held the view that this is a private matter, not one of policy and not one of great importance to the country. 
 But the degree of comfort the President can take in public opinion as he testifies is not so clear. As we've seen, this public has been highly unpredictable. Mr. Clinton has already defied the experts. The percentage of people saying that he should be impeached and removed from office, if it turns out that he did not tell the truth, has fallen from 50 percent in February to 29 percent last week, according to a Pew Research Center nationwide survey, even as the belief that he has lied about the matter rose from 49 percent to 70 percent!
The President's advisers may see these numbers as proof that he will weather this crisis, no matter what. But the public's unexpected reaction so far should ring warning bells that its views should not be taken for granted, even when its course seems clear. Popular thinking could take yet another unexpected turn, should the President change his story.
While most polls have found respondents saying that would gratefully accept an apology from the President and forgive him any transgressions, they could change their minds, if and when confronted with reality rather than a pollster's subjunctive question. Indeed it is not unusual for real-world reaction to be different from that of "concept tests" (remember the New Coke?). Anger that the President has dragged the country through a distracting seven months when he could have confessed much sooner might be the response if it turns out that he changes his story. Reaction might be the same should Mr. Clinton adamantly stick to his account, only to be contradicted by the DNA testing of Ms. Lewinsky's dress.
In any case, the odds are that people will initially continue to support the President, because that is what they have said they would do if he changed his story. But the reaction might be different in the longer term.
In the last "he said, she said" melodrama, the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, polling found strong support for his Supreme Court confirmation despite Anita Hill's dramatic televised accusations. But the public reaction subsequently changed in a relatively short time. One year later, the public looked back and was deeply divided as to whether Mr. Thomas should have been confirmed.
A similar delayed effect could reverse initial opinion today with regard to Mr. Clinton. If the economy and bull market begin to sour, the public could eventually condemn the President for a scandal that diverted Washington's attention while the nation's prosperity withered away. Other delayed reactions might have a greater impact on the Congressional election, for example, or on Vice President Al Gore's political future.
Whatever the course of public opinion on the President and his problems, only a decent interval of time will give some idea of the real reactions. For now beware of the blizzard of overnight and instant surveys headed our way. Unless the President shocks the nation -- a tall order in this environment -- polls may be taken and reported before the average American has had enough time to mull this one over. People will make up their minds on their own schedule.

HEADLINE: At U.S. Open, Food's No Game;
Organizers Hope Return Of Caterer Will Sate Fans

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
These days, as New York City prepares to serve up the last Grand Slam tournament of the year, are tennis die-hards focused on whether Patrick Rafter can defend his title? Are they rooting for Pete Sampras to retrieve his No. 1 ranking? Do they worry whether Martina Hingis can hold off the Williams sisters yet again?
Not exactly. 
 This is the United States Open at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, the most star-powered fortnight in all of sports. And naturally, New York's tennis mavens are obsessed with the menu.
"You cannot believe the incredible preoccupation with the food at the Open," said the comedian Alan King, who has attended the tournament since the 1950's and said that the cuisine has become "just about as legendary as the tennis."
Thanks to some stunning culinary volleys recently, courtside gourmets will be studying the menu with new urgency at this year's Open, which begins Aug. 31. Last year, when the newly renovated National Tennis Center made its debut with much fanfare, there were howls of protest over slow service and the price of pizza. The caterer, Sportservice Corporation of Buffalo, resigned in February after completing only two years of its seven-year contract.
So the United States Tennis Association brought back Restaurant Associates, the street-smart New York food provider that served the Open from 1976 to 1995, introducing courtside delicacies ranging from quiche to panini and baguettes.
Then, in spring, Restaurant Associates -- creator of some of New York's most popular restaurants, including the Four Seasons and the Brasserie -- was acquired by a British concern that is the world's largest food-service company, Compass Group P.L.C. And suddenly, the Open became the first public test of this new multinational corporate pairing.
"Open food" has been a subject of compulsive scrutiny since Restaurant Associates introduced quiche Lorraine in 1978.
Hard-breathing news bulletins on such introductions as tamarillo fruit and ciabatta bread, as well as on the price of pizza, have been one of the longest-running cliches of the coverage of the Open. "When they don't have any interesting matches to show, the TV crews always feel they have to do reports on the food," said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting concern in Manhattan that bears his name.
And Restaurant Associates "will be under the microscope because they're coming back," he added. "People think the food service last year stank, so there will be a lot of questions: is the food good again? Is it being served on time at parties and in the suites? Has R.A. been affected by the acquisition? And what about the cost?"
These days, the food crews are slaving round the clock at the National Tennis Center, under fierce pressure to prepare for the assault of the expected 550,000 visitors over 14 days who will buy $12 million worth of food. Restaurant Associates is putting 1,300 hourly workers on the front line, and bringing in 200 managers.
By the end of the tourney, tennisdom is expected to go through 40,000 pounds of hot dogs, 50,000 pounds of hamburgers, 3 tons of shrimp, 2,000 gallons of tomato sauce, 12,000 cases of Evian water, 15,000 baguettes and 15 tons of french fries.
"It is like the biggest opening of the biggest show you can imagine," said Nick Valenti, chief executive of Restaurant Associates. "You have to stay focused or you'll be overcome."
While most spectators' perception of the cuisine is shaped by hamburgers and pizza slices, the ultimate judgments are made by corporations that have parties for hundreds in their hospitality suites or entertain clients in the restaurants and private boxes.
"The stadium restaurants have to look permanent and feel permanent, and then you shut them down in two weeks after satisfying the most demanding audience in the world," Mr. Valenti said.
This year the operations include the 5 restaurants, 35 concession stands and the Food Village stands as well as the 90 luxury suites and the dining operations for the Open staff, the umpires, the news media and more than 600 players.
"You go all over the place to 42 different matches and you always walk past a food court," said Mr. King. "They get you coming and going."
Complicating the job for Restaurant Associates is the unpredictability of the demand for food, which "ebbs and flows every day due to the matchups, the scores and the weather," Mr. Valenti said.
In the past, summer brownouts have shut off the electronic registers. A near-tornado tore down food tents. Hundred-degree days have tested soda inventory and 50-degree nights have challenged hot-coffee delivery. "When the temperature goes above 90 degrees, we sell no food," said Joe Polidoro, the company's vice president for special events. "It's just water, soda and beer."
 Mr. Knapp, the consultant, said the Open is always a food gamble because "all you need is one or two rain days and your profit is gone."
That sentiment was echoed by Michael J. Bailey, president and chief executive of the North American subsidiary of Compass, the new corporate parent of Restaurant Associates. "The risks are always great at sporting events, the uncertainties many," he said. "But of course, customers aren't interested in the problems of organizing the event, they just want a good sandwich."
The stakes are high for Compass, the dominant force in the lucrative European event-catering and stadium-service industry, which acquired Restaurant Associates to move into the concession market in the United States. "R.A. will allow us to seriously bid for more museums, performing arts centers and sports groups nationwide," Mr. Bailey said.
Also under pressure is the tennis association, which was stung last September by corporate displeasure. "Some people had a bad time last year," acknowledged Suzanne Maguire, who supervises food-service operations for the association. "I hope they'll give us a chance and give Restaurant Associates a chance."
Thus far, corporations are pleased. Recently, Restaurant Associates held a tasting for suiteholders and corporate-hospitality planners. "The presentations were beautiful and the choices were smart," said Rosemarie Salvatore, a coordinator of the Open suite for Arthur Andersen, the accounting and consulting firm.
"People want to be eating light in summertime," she said. "Last year they had hot food in chafing dishes, all wrong for the season."
"It was such a shame -- the stadium was gorgeous but the food was lacking, disorganized and everything was last-minute," she said. "So many people had food delivered late, and didn't get what they wanted."
The hiring of Sportservice in 1996 generated seismic waves of food-world gossip thanks to the fame of the restaurant companies involved. The Buffalo caterer took as its local subcontractors two of the biggest names in New York's food firmament: the Joseph Baum & Michael Whiteman Company in Manhattan, a restaurant management group, and Glorious Food, the upscale caterer for society, celebrities and art galleries.
But in March, Sportservice exercised the exit clause in its contract. "We are in business to make money and, unfortunately, the way our contract with the U.S.T.A. was structured, that simply wasn't possible," said Nancy Parker, president of Sportservice.
Indeed, that was the reason Restaurant Associates decided in 1995 against accepting a stringent contract offered by the tennis association.
Analysts said Sportservice did not click in part because it had no local pool of experienced, motivated troops to fight the battle of the Open. This year, as in the past, Restaurant Associates has turned to the neighborhood work force "that it has recruited for decades in Flushing, Forest Hills, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights," said Kristin Kurtz, whose job it has been this summer to hire waiters, kitchen workers, bartenders and others.
Ms. Kurtz is a member of that little-known talent pool. As a 15-year-old from Glendale, Queens, 11 years ago, she started out scooping ice cream at the Open. Her mother, Jeanne, started working for the Open as a substitute for her mother, Eileen Sadler.
"It's really a family thing," Ms. Kurtz said. It can be lucrative, too: many of the employees earn $100 to $300 a day or more; in two weeks college students can earn spending money for the whole school year.
At the Open, high food prices "seem outrageous, but they're about the same at Madison Square Garden or at stadiums," said Marlie Buehler, a tennis pro at the Manhattan Plaza Racquet Club.
But it's a captive audience. "You go all over the place to 42 different matches and you always walk past a food court," Mr. King said. "They get you coming and going."
Now that Restaurant Associates is back, Mr. Valenti is promising aficionados better food at a lower price. Slices of pizza will be $4.25 instead of $5; at $3.25, the all-beef frankfurter on caraway bun with Grey Poupon mustard will be 25 cents cheaper than its less-distinguished predecessor last year, and ham and Brie on a baguette will be a dollar cheaper, at $7.50, than last year's more ho-hum ham and Swiss.
Restaurant Associates has also tried to reinvent the menu at the concession stands, adding fajitas and cheese quesadillas, bowls of steamed rice with exotic toppings, as well as ficelles, 12-inch-long baguettes filled with everything from bresaola (sliced aged beef) to grana padana cheese.
Prices will also be lower for the luxury suites; and entrees at Aces, the Asian-accented seafood restaurant, will cost $19 to $32, a decrease of $1 to $11 from last year.
Despite this price-cutting, Mr. Knapp said that Restaurant Associates could make a profit thanks to its "operating efficiencies and the economies of scale they have."
Mr. Valenti has no intention of losing money. "This may be a high-profile event, but it certainly can't be a loss leader," he said.
But for now his troops are focused less on profit, or loss, than on doing battle. "This year Yogi Berra is our philosopher," Mr. Valenti said. "It ain't over till it's over."

HEADLINE: Medicaid Rolls Have Declined In Last 3 Years

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
In a trend that has alarmed health care providers, the number of poor people enrolled in Medicaid in New York State has been declining for the last three years.
While the strong economy may account for some of the drop, many analysts say the decline is, in part, a side effect of the overhaul of the nation's welfare system in late 1996, legislation that was intended to move recipients into the work force. 
 When Congress drafted the overhaul, it took pains to spell out that people no longer entitled to welfare, particularly children, would continue to be eligible for Medicaid, the Federal and state health benefits program created more than 30 years ago for the very poor and the very sick. But in practice, health care analysts contend, people who have been removed from welfare or discouraged from applying in the first place have also been swept from the Medicaid rolls.
In New York State, whose efforts at reforming welfare were taking shape before the Federal overhaul began, the number of poor people enrolled in Medicaid declined 26 percent, to 1.28 million, between January 1995 and January 1998, according to analysts at the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit philanthropic and medical research organization based in Manhattan.
The magnitude of the drop is a matter of debate, because of growth in other, overlapping Medicaid categories, like disabled adults and the "medically needy," whose high medical expenses offset their higher income. State officials, taking into account some of those categories, put the decline in the number of poor Medicaid recipients at closer to 17.5 percent.
But whatever the figure, health care providers and analysts are increasingly alarmed by the trend, which they say reflects an emerging national pattern.
"The very group that is eligible for Medicaid and not getting it are the kids who have the highest rates of asthma, anemia and every imaginable health care problem," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of community pediatrics for Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He added: "They are suffering without the treatment they need because they have no insurance. Our concern is that these kids are now at enormous risk."
Officials estimate that 4.5 million children in New York State are eligible for Medicaid but are not enrolled.
Nobody can say for sure why Medicaid enrollment has fallen, but analysts offer many reasons. The most optimistic is that in a stronger economy, more people are finding jobs that offer private health insurance. But Kathryn Haslanger, director of policy analysis for United Hospital Fund, said this was unlikely to account for much of the change, because the ranks of the uninsured have been growing even faster in New York than in the nation as a whole, and many low-wage jobs do not offer affordable private health insurance.
Another partial explanation is that more low-income families may be forgoing both welfare and Medicaid because new workfare rules make it harder to combine a relief check with off-the-books earnings, even as a better economy makes it easier to find a part-time job. Many parents may not realize that their children probably are still eligible for Medicaid.
Other reasons concern new barriers in the public-assistance system, and the factor that Jim Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, described as "demand suppression -- where people are simply not coming in the front door of the public-assistance program because they perceive it not to be open to them."
Historically, the vast majority of low-income Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled at the same time they qualified for cash assistance in their local welfare office. This is still the case, but fewer people have been seeking welfare, and more are being turned away. The number of welfare recipients in the state has shrunk since 1995 by at least 547,000, two-thirds of them children.
"In welfare and Medicaid we are asking the former public assistance system to do two opposing things," Mr. Tallon noted. "One is to divert people away from benefits, and the other is simultaneously to maintain their eligibility for benefits. The data suggests that there has been an enormous underestimation of the administrative difficulty of implementing two conceptually conflicting requirements."
The tension between the two public policy goals is evident in New York. Gov. George E. Pataki has been in the forefront of a national push to extend health insurance to more children, and state lawmakers recently passed bills expanding both Medicaid and Child Health Plus, a program aimed at insuring children of families with somewhat higher income than the limit for Medicaid.
But in New York City, where most of the state's poor and uninsured families live, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been just as outspokenly committed to redesigning welfare centers so that poor people are discouraged from public assistance at the front door by being directed to seek jobs or charity before they are allowed to apply.
Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city's Human Resources Administration, which oversees both welfare and Medicaid, said the city is beginning an internal review of how welfare centers handle Medicaid, "to make sure that people are getting what they should."
She added: "We're telling people they don't have to be on welfare to get Medicaid services. We don't think that's a discouragement."
As a practical matter, however, such people are referred to a separate city Medicaid office to begin another application process that sometimes daunts even people with pressing medical needs.
At the same time, people who still obtain Medicaid along with a welfare grant are now at greater risk of losing both. Thousands of recipients are cut from the rolls each month for failing to meet strict workfare requirements, according to city data. People who lose public assistance for any reason automatically lose Medicaid, too, unless they appear in person at a Medicaid office for a "redetermination" of eligibility within 30 days -- a process that state officials acknowledge has led to erroneous terminations.
In Wisconsin, which pioneered the job-center model now gearing up in New York City, a recent study by researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee documented a 24 percent drop in Medicaid enrollment among the state's children when they compared the three-year period before that state's version of welfare reform and the six-month period after full implementation in September 1997. Wisconsin recently started an aggressive Medicaid outreach campaign, largely because state Medicaid caseloads had fallen so much more than expected.
Though national Medicaid enrollment figures are not yet available for the period following the Federal welfare overhaul, during the 1995-1996 period, when similar welfare changes were already well under way in many states, the decline already was taking shape, said Leighton Ku, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan social policy research organization based in Washington.
Few state Medicaid directors have been willing to draw attention to the problem, Mr. Ku said. "One, welfare reform is sacrosanct in many states," he said. "And the decline in caseload means for the first time Medicaid is not eating the budget."
Penny Schwartz, the director of REAP, the Resource, Entitlement and Advocacy Program sponsored by Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, said she has a window on the obstacles that poor patients and their families must now overcome to get or keep Medicaid coverage. "Forget about user-friendly," she said. "We're talking about user-hostile."
Among the cases she cited was that of a severely asthmatic father of three whose doctor wrote a letter saying he could not work outdoors. The man took the letter to the outdoor workfare site where he had been ordered to report and was told to go home and wait for an indoor assignment. Instead, he received a letter of sanction and was cut from both public assistance and Medicaid, leaving him without asthma medication. When he reapplied for Medicaid alone, as instructed, he was denied on the erroneous ground that the welfare sanction was still in place.
Another REAP client was a 37-year-old mother of three who could not attend a work assessment on Jan. 29 because she had an emergency appointment at the school that her emotionally disturbed son attends. Though the principal of the school contacted the work program to explain and reschedule, the entire family mistakenly lost all public assistance, Medicaid and food stamps.
The New York State Coalition of Prepaid Health Services Plans recently reported that "involuntary disenrollments" are running 20 percent higher this year than last year among more than 200,000 Medicaid managed care members and now affect more than 4.17 percent of the caseload each month, wreaking havoc with health care and billing.
Analysts at the Greater Hospital Association of New York said they hoped the loss of children from Medicaid would be partly offset and stemmed by Child Health Plus and "enrollment-friendly" measures recently passed by the state for children receiving both welfare and Medicaid. But since 1995, 136,000 children have lost Medicaid, not counting the disabled, while only 65,000 -- not necessarily the same children -- were newly enrolled in Child Health Plus, state figures show.
While subway posters lure newcomers to Child Health Plus, which allows mail-in applications, has no work requirement and now covers children in families with income of up to 200 percent of the poverty line, REAP advocates are still trying to win retroactive Medicaid benefits for the family of a 30-year-old immigrant mother whose 3-year-old son, a United States citizen, has been hospitalized with leukemia. They both lost aid after a welfare investigator who went to the wrong address did not find the mother at home, Ms. Schwartz said.
Lucy Quacinella, a lawyer and health care specialist in the Sacramento, Calif., office of the Western Center on Law and Poverty, sees a net loss in these opposing trends. "You have significant declines in Medicaid coverage for families, at the same time as you have major initiatives to reach out and insure children," she said. "But after all, children live in families."

HEADLINE: Northeast Is Still Reeling From Ice Storm's Economic Punch

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SOUTH COLTON, N.Y., Aug. 16

 BODY:
Seven months ago, Glen Thomas was staring at financial ruin. His maple sugar business had been put on ice by a stunning winter storm.
"It was devastating," said Mr. Thomas, who has 48 acres of maple trees in this rural town, about 120 miles northeast of Syracuse. "The damage was so massive I was really discouraged. But I'm repairing the damage." 
 Mr. Thomas is still evaluating his losses from the vicious ice storm, which smacked the Northeast in January. And he is still cleaning up the broken tree limbs from the forest floor and re-installing the plastic tubing that transports his sap.
In January, the future seemed bleak. Mr. Thomas estimated that the storm cost him $15,000 to $20,000. He said he usually makes 800 to 1,000 gallons of syrup each season; this year he struggled to produce 50 gallons.
Mr. Thomas is among hundreds of maple syrup producers, dairy farmers and others in six northern New York counties who suffered substantial losses from the storm.
The latest estimates by the 25 largest insurers in northern New York show that the companies paid $68.5 million on 48,753 claims from storm damage.
Disaster workers estimated that the state and Federal governments have spent $44.5 million so far on ice storm and flooding recovery.
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation has spent the most by far -- more than $125 million to repair lines to 120,000 customers who in some cases were left without power for weeks.
The House of Representatives recently passed a $2.9 billion emergency spending bill intended to help upstate New York and New England recover from the storm. About $5 million was included that would compensate dairy farmers who lost livestock and suffered from decreased milk production. About $4 million would help tree farmers.
With Federal emergency funds, Mr. Thomas said, he will be able to hire a contractor to clean out the fallen trees and branches and will eventually recover.
But others are on the verge of hanging up their buckets for good.
"They've been dealt a pretty severe blow," said Lewis Staats, a maple specialist at Cornell Cooperative Extension.
Mr. Staats said an estimated 380,000 taps were lost in northern New York as a result of the storm.
Statewide, 231,000 gallons of maple syrup was produced in the 1998 season, down from 269,000 gallons in 1997 and 350,000 in 1996.
Loyal Drake, who has made syrup for 55 years in Nicholville, in St. Lawrence County, is one of those producers ready to fold.
"I'm 73, and with what it's going to cost to get everything put back the way it was, even with Government help, I'm not sure it's worth it," Mr. Drake said. "I lost 40 percent of the limbs on my trees, and it's so bad we can't even walk in the woods."
