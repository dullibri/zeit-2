HEADLINE: Thaw in Budget Talks Freezes Over a Bit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A day after President Clinton submitted revisions to his budget and a slight thaw seemed to have developed in the budget negotiations, the President and Republican leaders in Congress reverted today to casting aspersions and drawing lines in the sand.
With further formal negotiations put off until next week, Mr. Clinton called reporters to the Cabinet Room at the White House before a meeting with Democratic governors to say he would stand firm against the Federal Government's relinquishing control of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. 
 Republicans want to end the 30-year-old Medicaid system under which everyone who meets Federal eligibility standards is entitled to whatever medical treatment or nursing home care they need. The budget legislation approved by Congress last month and vetoed by the President this week would cut deeply into projected spending for the program, give what Federal money was left to the states in the form of block grants with few strings attached and allow the states to set eligibility.
The White House has clearly decided that this is an issue on which to take the firmest possible stand.
"The Republican budget," the President declared, "would be a disaster for the states and for the people who depend on Medicaid."
"So I just want to be clear about this," he said. "I very much want to work with the Republican Congress to get a balanced budget, but I will not -- I will not -- permit the repeal of guaranteed medical coverage for senior citizens or disabled people, for poor children and pregnant women. That would violate our values."
Later, the White House publicity machine was switched on, and assistants spread word of how serious the Medicaid issue was to the President.
But Republicans said they too intended to insist on their Medicaid position.
"This isn't about values, and it isn't about money," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid. "No, this is about power," Mr. Bliley added, speaking in the Capitol at a news conference he had called to respond to the President. "This is about whether the states will be given the flexibility they need to meet the needs of their own citizens or whether they'll continue to have their hands tied by a huge, distant, inflexible Federal bureaucracy."
The revised budget Mr. Clinton submitted on Thursday would save $54 billion in the Medicaid program over the next seven years, only a third as much as the Republican plan would save.
The Republican legislation would set rigid ceilings on the Federal money that the program would make available to the states each year. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, would impose a limit only on the average amount that would be spent each year for each beneficiary. That approach would allow increases in total spending as Medicaid enrollment grew, a particular likelihood in times of recession.
The President's demand that Medicaid remain an entitlement is in contrast with his position on welfare. There, he has accepted the Republican argument that the main Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, should be turned over to the states and that poor families with children should no longer be guaranteed Federal assistance.
On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office is scheduled to issue its latest economic projections and spending forecasts. But it is unclear whether that will be the moment for serious negotiations on the budget to begin or whether the two sides will continue, as they have for the last two weeks, merely to jockey for political position.
The agreement between the President and Congress that ended the partial shutdown of the Government last month expires next Friday. With no progress made in the negotiations this week, there seems little chance of a budget agreement before the deadline.
Mr. Clinton asked Congress on Thursday to approve another temporary measure that would extend the Government's spending authority through much of January, but Republicans in the House of Representatives have been resistant.
This afternoon the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, and Speaker Newt Gingrich sent a letter to the White House asking the President to submit a new budget next week with $400 billion in lower spending, the amount needed to match the Republican savings.
In a letter of response, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, did not directly address the request but urged the Congressional leaders to agree to temporary legislation that would prevent another partial Government shutdown.

HEADLINE: Melvin Kranzberg, 78, Historian of Technology

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER

 BODY:
Melvin Kranzberg, a scholar who helped establish the study of the history of technology and explained its impact on society, died on Wednesday at his home in Atlanta. Dr. Kranzberg, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, was 78.
The cause was cancer, said August Giebelhaus, a professor of history at Georgia Tech and a longtime colleague. 
 Dr. Kranzberg co-founded the Society for the History of Technology in 1958. From then until 1984, he was the editor of its quarterly journal, Technology and Culture.
"His life's work was to assert the autonomy of this discipline," Professor Giebelhaus said. "It was not just applied science, and it was not just a minor part of economic history, but it was a discipline in itself.
Dr. Kranzberg argued that technological development could not be understood without seeing how it was linked to society.
He wrote or edited 11 books and wrote more than 150 scholarly articles; he also popularized his field in newspaper articles.
In a 1968 article, he wrote: "Engineers, in general, live in the suburbs, vote Republican and mouth the cliches of conservatism. Actually, if unwittingly, they are greater social revolutionaries than many wild-eyed political radicals.
"Without necessarily meaning to, they invent new products, processes, systems and devices that produce profound socio-cultural transformations."
The automobile self-starter, he wrote, freed women and children to see the world and electric washers, driers, vacuum cleaners, supermarkets and telephones freed women for "drinking, loafing, heavy thinking about issues like Vietnam and even jobs, the same as men."
"Radicals" like the inventors Watt, Fulton, McCormick, Edison and Marconi, he said, changed the face of the world.
Early in the computer era, he foresaw immense social upheaval, but he remained optimistic, as he generally was about technological change.
Writing more than 25 years ago, he said, "There is no doubt that many individuals will be thrown out of their jobs by automation, and the process will accelerate with every passing year. At the same time computers are speeding and extending the advance of science and technology at a pace never before witnessed in history. This, we know, will create new lines of productivity, new and better jobs, new professions and untold wealth."
Dr. Kranzberg was born on Nov. 22, 1917, in St Louis. He studied history and economics at Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1938. At Harvard University he earned a master's degree in 1938 and a doctorate in 1942.
During World War II, he served in the Army in Europe as a sergeant in military intelligence, fought in the Battle of the Bulge and interrogated German prisoners on the front lines. He won the Bronze Star for finding crucial enemy gun emplacements.
Originally a specialist in modern French history, Dr. Kranzberg taught at Harvard, the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and Amherst. In 1952 he joined the faculty of at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. There, while developing a history course for engineering students, he shifted to the history of technology.
He was appointed a professor at Case in 1959, and left in 1972 to become the Callaway Professor of the History of Technology at Georgia Tech. When he retired in 1988, he became a professor emeritus, and the institute named a professorship in the history of technology in his honor.
His awards included the NASA Apollo Achievement Award, the Roe Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the State of Israel's Jabotinsky Centennial Medal for eminence in science and letters, the Olmstead Award of the American Society for Engineering Education and the Bernal Award of the Society for Social Studies of Science.
Dr. Kranzberg is survived by his wife, the former Louise Lester of Atlanta; two sons by a previous marriage, John and Steven, both of St. Louis; a brother, Maurice, also of St. Louis, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A New Safety Net Is Created For Homeowners in Quakes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
California took a big step yesterday toward overhauling its homeowners' earthquake insurance market to create a new financial safety net for homeowners, replacing insurance companies.
After a heated competition among 40 securities firms, the state said firms led byMorgan Stanley & Company would handle an innovative $1.5 billion bond sale that would be part of a $10.5 billion package to pay homeowners' claims. 
 The plan also calls for homeowners to absorb much more of the risk from earthquakes because new policies will provide less coverage than existing policies.
After the Northridge earthquake in January 1994, which resulted in $12.5 billion of insurance losses -- $8.2 billion from homeowners, most insurance companies stopped accepting new customers, putting California officials under pressure to change the market.
"This plan makes insurance more widely available," said Chuck Quackenbush, California's Insurance Commissioner, adding that it also answered concerns about the solvency of many companies after a big quake.
Under the new mini-policies that will go on sale Jan. 1, homeowner premiums will be about the same as those for existing earthquake policies, but the new policies will provide less coverage. The two largest cutbacks are a $5,000 limit on coverage for a home's contents and a $1,500 limit on living expenses paid if a home is uninhabitable.
If the new mini-policies had been in place for the earthquake at Northridge, near Los Angeles, claims on homeowner policies would have been cut in half, insurers say. California Insurance Department officials expect the mini-policies to cost about the same as old policies, where premiums currently range from about $1.50 per $1,000 of coverage in a low-risk areas, to $4 per $1,000 in high- risk areas.
Although insurance companies will sell the new mini-policies and handle their claims, the $1.1 billion in annual premiums will go to the California Earthquake Authority, not the companies. The authority will use the premiums to pay for its expenses and for the $10.5 billion insurance plan.
The $10.5 billion plan taps many sources to pay homeowner claims, starting with $1 billion in cash contributed by insurance companies. The next $3 billion in claims would be covered by funds that insurance companies promise to provide if needed. The next $2 billion of coverage comes from reinsurers, followed by $1 billion from tax-exempt bonds that would be sold after an earthquake. The next $1.5 billion of claims would be covered by investors in the Morgan Stanley bond issue to be sold early next year, with another $2 billion available from an assessment on insurance companies.
Insurers and securities dealers close to the financing are optimistic that reinsurance can be bought for not much more than $300 million a year, or more than 15 percent of the coverage offered. Interest rates on the bonds would average slightly less than the reinsurance cost, but would vary widely depending on how much risk investors took.
Some investors, who agree that they would lose only part of their interest after an earthquake, might earn interest rates comparable with those of medium-quality corporate bonds, while others who could lose all of their interest or principal could earn rates more than 10 percentage points higher than Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Leaps in Early Trading But Falls Back on Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar soared in early trading yesterday to an 11-week high against the German mark, but then European traders took their profits and the currency ended little changed.
Currency traders said the dollar's ascent was set off by a rally in United States Treasury bond prices, which caused traders to push the currency through important technical levels. 
 Treasury bonds jumped after the release of a weaker-than-expected employment report for November improved the odds of lower interest rates ahead.
"The market bought the dollar because the bonds were rallying," said Joe Viola, a manager at Credit Suisse. "But after that there was no follow-through and the market sold it back down."
The dollar hit a high of 1.4550 marks, and soared to a 17-month high of $1.5205 to a British pound.
But once the bond rally stalled, European corporate traders, particularly from Germany, cashed in their dollar holdings.
"The dollar made some nice new ground on the top side, and we had some Friday afternoon profit taking," said Richard Vullo, dealer at Bayerische Hypobank. "That brought us down off the highs, but I don't think it changes the overall bullish tone."
The dollar continued to be supported by comments on Thursday by the president of the German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, who said he hoped for a stronger dollar against the mark. Traders said the comments suggested that the central bank, the Bundesbank, could soon lower interest rates.
And the dollar was helped as French markets continued to perform strongly in the face of a crippling national strike by public-sector workers, but some economists said investors might be too optimistic. The French franc's resilience against the mark makes the dollar more attactive relative to the mark.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4475 German marks, up from 1.4467 marks on Thursday. The British pound ended unchanged at $1.5325. The dollar slipped to 101.30 Japanese yen from 101.47 yen.
"It was really just magnified by thin conditions," said David Solin, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "There has really been no net change on the day."

HEADLINE: Data Show Fewer Jobs in New York Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Employment in the New York City metropolitan region dipped in November as a national slowdown continued to spill over into sluggish hiring across New York City, New York State and New Jersey.
According to the Federal Government's monthly employment report, there were 35,000 fewer jobs in New York State in November than in October, a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent. The loss was concentrated in New York City, where there were 46,000 fewer jobs in November than in the previous month, a 2 percent decline. 
 In New Jersey, the report said, 36,000 fewer people were employed in November than in October, a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
The unemployment rate, a measure of the number of people who are actively seeking jobs but unable to find them, improved slightly in New York State, to 6 percent, from 6.3 percent in October, and in New York City, to 7.8 percent, from 8 percent in October. But the rate rose in New Jersey, to 6.1 percent, from 5.8 percent in October.
John L. Wieting, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issued the report, said the slowdown reflected a decline in hiring across the nation. The report covered employment in the 11 largest industrial states; Connecticut is not among the 11 surveyed.
"The forces of the national slowdown filtered into the region in November," he said. Among those forces, he said, was a downturn in manufacturing that was particularly sharp in the Middle West, but also undermined employment in the region, particularly in New Jersey.
The dip in November came after a slight improvement in October, when both New York and New Jersey had employment gains, and reflected a series of small monthly gains and losses that have left the regional economy sluggish, but on a largely even economic keel, since the beginning of the year.
Among the strongest sectors of the regional economy in recent months have been tourism, restaurant sales and the entertainment industries.
"The numbers are still somewhat encouraging," Mr. Wieting said. Although the New York region lagged behind most of the nation in the economic recovery of 1993-94, he said, it did not experience the downturn suffered by other regions in the last 11 months.
"We are holding our own," he said.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
With No McDowell, The Focus Is on Cone

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
The Yankees made a last-ditch attempt to maintain dialogue with Jack McDowell by asking him to reject salary arbitration if they offered it to him by Thursday's deadline. Not surprisingly, McDowell refused this proposal because it would have heavily favored the Yankees. Thus, they relinquished their negotiating rights to the pitcher and essentially terminated any possibility of re-signing him.
If McDowell had accepted the proposal, he would have rejected their arbitration offer by Dec. 19, meaning that the Yankees would not have had to pay him as much as $6 million in 1996. Then the Yankees could have still discussed a more economically feasible contract with him and held his rights until Jan. 8. 
 Since McDowell never even received a preliminary offer from the Yankees, did not want to be played against David Cone, a fellow free agent, and did not want another team to be forced to surrender draft choices to the Yankees if he signed elsewhere, he rejected the idea.
"That wouldn't have done us any good," Jim McDowell, McDowell's brother and agent, said about a practice that is not unusual in baseball.
Without McDowell, the Yankees seriously desire Cone. They already have Mariano Duncan, they want Mickey Tettleton and they should not neglect Roberto Alomar. Welcome to the Yankees' hectic off season, in which they are competing with Baltimore for Cone and Alomar and where they won a smaller skirmish over the Orioles by signing Duncan, a utility infielder, to a two-year, $1.5 million contract yesterday.
By severing ties with McDowell, the Yankees have made it even more imperative that they sign Cone to anchor the pitching staff. Since Cone had a positive meeting with General Manager Pat Gillick and Manager Davey Johnson on Thursday and told an Oriole official that he wants his wife to visit the Baltimore area next week, the Yankees could wave goodbye to two former Cy Young Award winners in a brief time span. Still, the owner George Steinbrenner is not panicking.
"If we don't sign Cone or one of the other free agents, we could be short," Steinbrenner said. "But Cone's not the only one out there."
General Manager Bob Watson said Cone is expected to respond to a three-year, $15 million offer early next week, but Cone's price tag probably escalated when the Yankees parted with McDowell. The Orioles, who have not yet made an offer, figure that Cone wants a three-year, $18 million contract, and they are concerned about the Yankees outspending them because New York does not have a safety net in McDowell.
"As I look at it, it puts them in a tenuous position with Cone," said Jim McDowell. "I assume they feel pretty good about their chances of signing him. But if they don't sign him and they've given up on Jack, then who knows?"
McDowell was 15-10 with a 3.93 earned run average for the Yankees and was first in the American League in complete games and third in innings pitched. He is durable, but the Yankees privately expressed concern about back spasms that sidelined him last season and about a congenital condition in his right hip. Despite the hip condition, McDowell is routinely among the league leaders in starts, innings and complete games.
"Maybe more pitchers should have a hip like Jack, and then they would be able to pitch as well as him," Jim McDowell said.
Watson, who did not return telephone calls, signed Duncan yesterday to try to replace Randy Velarde. Duncan, who hit .287 with 6 homers and 36 runs batted in for the Phillies and Reds last year, accepted New York's offer to be a utility player over Baltimore's one-year offer to be a second baseman.
Since the Orioles told Duncan he would play second, what about their interest in Alomar? Not to be outmaneuvered, Gillick quickly contacted Jaime Torres, Alomar's agent, yesterday. Gillick said the Orioles can afford Cone and Alomar, who had told the Orioles he wanted a three-year, $23 million contract. But Gillick said it would be difficult to sign the duo and also snare a high-priced closer like Rick Aguilera or Jeff Montgomery.
Alomar's proposal to the Yankees was three years for $25 million, and Torres has not heard from Watson since last week. Watson's chief priority is signing Cone, but Torres will not wait for the Yankees because several teams are interested in Alomar.
"If Roberto Alomar is down on their list of priorities, that would indicate to me they are not that interested in him," Torres said. "We will not hold back in analyzing and deciding on other clubs to give the Yankees time to come around and discuss more seriously with Roberto."
The Yankees have made an undisclosed offer to Tettleton, who they want to use as a designated hitter and as a shaky backup at catcher, first base and in the outfield. But Tettleton has three other offers and would rather return to Texas.
After sporting one of the best one-two pitching punches in baseball with the durable Cone and the more durable McDowell, who combined to go 24-12 for the Yankees last year, they might not have either in 1996. Steinbrenner said the decision on McDowell was a blend of baseball and financial considerations. His former manager might have acted differently.
"It's not my money, but I'd bring both of them back," Buck Showalter said in September. "Where else are you going to find guys like that?"

THE WAR AGAINST THE POOR
The Underclass and Antipoverty Policy.

IF YOU CAME THIS WAY
A Journey Through the Lives of the Underclass.
By Peter Davis.

HERBERT J. GANS, a professor of sociology at Columbia University, has written a prescient, clear-eyed analysis of American social policy. He suggests that affluent people stereotype the poor as undeserving for complex reasons, just as the citizens of Salem, Mass., projected certain problems of colonial America on people accused of witchcraft. 
 But Mr. Gans pushes his thesis a bit beyond his evidence. He uses a political argument to challenge one of the most basic functions of sociology, the classifying and labeling of individuals and groups, because he does not like the way the labels have been used. The title of Mr. Gans's book is "The War Against the Poor," but he spends much of his time analyzing "the war of words -- or of pejorative labels -- that stereotype, stigmatize and harass the poor by questioning their morality and their values." His thesis is that the "terms and labels" that designate poor people as undeserving may be obstacles preventing their escape from poverty. He asserts that scholars, social scientists and journalists who use such terms contribute, knowingly or unknowingly, to the perpetuation of poverty.
Mr. Gans's argument helps explain why it is so difficult to count the underclass. That word, denoting extreme, persistent poverty, has a certain intuitive appeal, but there is no official or standard definition of the underclass. Knowing the poverty level for families of a particular size ($11,821 for a family of three last year), the Census Bureau can estimate the number of poor people in the United States. The concept of the underclass is more elusive: it refers not only to income but also to kinds of behavior that supposedly trap people in poverty.
Mr. Gans suggests, in a fresh and thought-provoking way, that intellectuals use the "underclass" label because it helps keep the poor at a distance. "By labeling some people as undeserving," he writes, "label users protect themselves from the risk of getting close to them and being hurt by the encounter." In addition, he says, loose use of the word validates the idea that "poverty is largely the fault of the poor," who bear children out of wedlock or engage in other behavior that flouts middle-class norms. Once labeled, Mr. Gans says, "the undeserving poor can be used to justify attacks on the welfare state," so they become scapegoats in a conflict of politics and ideology.
The ideas in this book germinated before Newt Gingrich and the Contract With America set the agenda for Congress. But it can be safely assumed that Mr. Gans would cite recent events as evidence that Republicans have declared war on the poor.
In "If You Came This Way," Peter Davis, who undertook his book after having been mugged at gunpoint outside his New York City apartment, provides a journalistic chronicle of underclass life that complements Mr. Gans's more theoretical discussion. The authors' politics are similar. "The war on poverty of the 60's has become the war against the poor of the 90's," Mr. Davis writes. At another point, he says that "the poor have replaced the Communists as our principal enemies." He introduces the "poverty caste," including elderly people, tough teen-agers and families at soup kitchens. This is a workmanlike account, but Mr. Davis, the author of "Hometown" and "Where Is Nicaragua?" and a film maker, does not set his literary sights very high. Neither his description of the poor nor his own journey of discovery, as he travels across the country talking with the urban and rural poor, is compelling. What conclusions are readers supposed to draw from these impressions?
Mr. Davis's political insights are tantalizing, but he does not develop them. Ending welfare as we know it, he says, alluding to Bill Clinton's campaign promise, is the wrong goal and is doomed to fail. "Instead," he says, "the debate should be over ending poverty as we know it."
For his part, Mr. Gans is at his best when he traces the evolution of the word "underclass" from its original meaning of people living in extreme, persistent poverty into a term denoting deviant or abnormal behavior. But he seems to gloss over the conservatives' argument that there is a genuine problem with young teen-agers' having babies before they finish junior high school. Mr. Gans does not try to document or measure the extent of grinding urban poverty, but says that the labels used in such empirical research too often assume the validity of middle-class norms.
In the early 60's, Mr. Gans says, Michael Harrington described "the culture of poverty," but the concept did not acquire racial connotations until a few years later. Daniel Patrick Moynihan analyzed "the female-headed black family," and Mr. Gans implies that the Moynihan Report of 1965 accelerated a process of labeling that "blamed poor blacks for their actual or imagined behavior."
MR. GANS derides "label makers," but aren't labeling, classifying and categorizing essential elements of research in science and social science? A social taxonomy, rich in demographic data, may be the first step to understanding the problems of the underclass. Such information can be used for odious or immoral purposes, but it can also be used to arouse the concern and compassion needed to cure misery. Indeed, this was one purpose of French positivists like Auguste Comte and of novelists like Charles Dickens, who documented the underclass of Victorian England without romanticizing or stigmatizing it.
Mr. Gans says the use of labels to scapegoat the poor can "shield politicians and citizens from having to deal with difficult social problems." But the use of labels can also help people identify and recognize such problems.
Many economists see technology as a source of jobs, or at least as a source of increased productivity and economic growth, needed to raise the nation's standard of living. Mr. Gans says that government may have a role in industrial policy, but unlike many politicians, who want to foster technology, he seeks ways to "prevent the further proliferation of job-destroying technology."
Prescribing antipoverty policy for the 21st century, Mr. Gans writes, "Luddite nostalgia is out of place, and giving up the computer is senseless, but a case could be made for returning to the labor-intensive and thus costlier manufacture of, say, cars." Alternatively, to spread income and wealth, he recommends a system of work sharing to shrink the normal workweek by 40 percent, to 24 hours. Mr. Gans sees this futuristic plan for "the virtual abolition of full-time work" as a way to create a more egalitarian society by distributing available work and doing away with unemployment. This hardly seems the most feasible means to that desirable end.

STEINWAY & SONS
By Richard K. Lieberman.
Illustrated. 374 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $35.
TO the countless aficionados who have relished its supple action and its rich, round tone, a Steinway piano may be a thing of beauty and a joy forever. But an expensive instrument is an object existing at an intersection of culture and commerce, and to those who produce it, it means mostly business. In "Steinway & Sons," Richard K. Lieberman brings a revealing, if not always uplifting, perspective to the story by looking at the company that for a century and a half made, marketed and sold Steinways. 
 Actually, this is the second history of the Steinway to appear this year. An earlier one, "The Steinway Saga," by D. W. Fostle, drew heavily on Steinway family archives. Mr. Lieberman's book, based largely on company archives, is not an investigative report but an institutional chronicle, perhaps too conscientiously concerned with promotion techniques and sales and profit figures through the ages. But a history of the Steinway is also, implicitly, a history of the pianistic tradition; and while concentrating on his specific brief, Mr. Lieberman also gives us an often fascinating overview of a musical epoch that may, regrettably, be coming to an end.
Mr. Lieberman -- a historian and the director of LaGuardia Community College's LaGuardia and Wagner Archives, which house the Steinway collection of documents -- approaches his subject largely through profiles of the men who ran Steinway & Sons in successive generations, in a system of inheritance that passed the leadership from father to nephew, as often as to the son. The family saga begins with Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, a cabinet and instrument maker who in 1835 started a modest piano manufacturing concern in the small German town of Seesen. In 1850, to escape restrictive trade regulations and political agitation, the Steinwegs followed their son Charles to New York, where they apprenticed themselves to such piano makers as Henry Pirsson, famed for producing "the American double-grand pianoforte," with keyboards facing one another.
By 1853, the new immigrants were ready to strike out on their own in the New World, with the Anglicized name Steinway & Sons. The piano, like the novel, rose with the middle classes, and the Steinways' success was largely due to their product's increasing popularity. However, in a trade then dominated by German manufacturers, they also distinguished themselves by their careful workmanship. Each instrument that came out of their factory was produced by a precise, patient process, which involved drying wood for a year, applying several coats of varnish to the piano case with long intervals between each coat, and shaping and fitting hundreds of small parts by hand. The early Steinway craftsmen included studious innovators like Henry Steinway Jr., who in the 1850's perfected the technique of over-stringing, which gave the piano a larger, warmer tone.
But aside from the high level of their skills, the Steinways were also canny about injecting into their instruments the impalpable extra ingredient of cultural cachet. The latter part of the 19th century was the era of superstar performers, and the Steinways capitalized on this to good effect by sponsoring the more famous among them in return for endorsements. Mr. Lieberman tells wonderful anecdotes of heroic performances -- like Anton Rubinstein's 1872 New York debut, during which he was kept playing till 4 o'clock in the morning by the wildly excited audience. In 1891, Ignace Paderewski, the musical idol of his day (and for a while the President of Poland), played six different concertos in his first week in New York, and the next year he gave 107 concerts in 117 days, much of the time playing in agony from an injured finger. He and other musicians, like Josef Hofmann, Rachmaninoff, Horowitz and Arthur Rubinstein, were kept loyal to Steinway in part by fat fees and careful coddling.
On the strength of such events and associations, the very name Steinway gradually became a byword for pianistic grandeur, as well as for bourgeois ambition and cultivation. Although the company's fortunes went through various ups and downs, Steinway & Sons mostly prospered and expanded, opening branches in Germany and England and shipping pianos to households across America and Europe. The Steinways themselves became a major cultural force in New York, opening the elegant Steinway Hall in 1866 and supporting musical causes and institutions. For a while they were also a major economic force in Queens, where they built factories and private mansions, established rail links to Manhattan and opened the immensely lucrative North Beach Amusement Park (on the site of today's LaGuardia Airport). Steinway & Sons initially transferred its operations to Queens to escape what one member of the family called the "anarchists and socialists" causing violent labor unrest in volatile Manhattan; perhaps their most inventive piece of business strategy was the creation of a "company village," in which they rented houses to their employees, supplied most of the public services and provided English and German lessons to the workers' children.
But the Steinways' paternalism wasn't always so benevolent. Within their own enclave, they never allowed women near the seat of power; within their factories, they kept strikers out and wages low. The chairmen in successive generations ranged from sensitive souls, who cracked from the pressures of their job, to ruthless businessmen and corporate thinkers. Mr. Lieberman's tale is surprisingly full of fraternal dissension, sexual scandal, dubious tactics and cutthroat competitiveness. In the early days, the company's management repeatedly bribed juries at international exhibits and competitions, thus assuring Steinway victories over such pianos as Chickering and Weber. During World War II, the Hamburg branch of Steinway & Sons complied with the Nazi regime without a murmur.
But finally, whatever their temperaments or managerial style, none of the Steinway leaders were immune to the effects of larger social and economic trends. In recent years the piano has come to occupy a less central place in our musical imaginations. The capricious element of charisma has moved from the classical virtuoso to the rock singer; and since the advent of the record player, fewer people have felt the need to make music in their homes themselves.
At the same time, with the rise of unions and increasing labor costs, the production of handmade instruments became less financially tenable. The Steinways were never good at shifting to less prestigious, or less expensive, models. In the 1930's, they lost the market for space-efficient uprights to brands like Baldwin and Kimball. But perhaps the real coup de grace came from Yamaha, which, once its offer to represent Steinway in Japan was refused in the 50's, started competing in America with cheaper mass-produced pianos. The rest, for Steinway, is sad history. In 1972, Steinway & Sons was sold to CBS, and since then the company has changed hands twice more; the pianos are still produced in Queens and Hamburg, but by more mechanized methods.
To some cognoscenti, the new-issue Steinways lack the clarity and warmth of the old versions. But perhaps such subtleties become harder to discern amid the noise of new technologies. Steinway may have gained its pre-eminence by questionable strategies, as well as by excellence; but it was one of the best vehicles for the kind of pianism that depends on fine tonal nuances, and on bravura sound. The decline of "the instrument of the immortals," as one advertising slogan called it, undoubtedly marks the waning of a living musical environment in which such things could be heard, and in which they mattered.

How Republicans or Democrats

the American Way of Life.

NIXON'S PIANO
Presidents and Racial Politics
From Washington to Clinton.

PRESIDENT CLINTON may have helped sell Ben J. Wattenberg's latest book, "Values Matter Most," when he called the author and told him he agreed with its criticisms of his Presidency. But that endorsement, of a book that condemns Mr. Clinton for abandoning his centrist campaign promises, is hard to consider as more than yet another poll-propelled campaign stunt, and this book deserves better. It is both a trenchant argument for the sort of values Mr. Clinton offered as a candidate and a smart discussion of which sorts of non-economic issues can be put to effective political use and which are trouble. 
 If Mr. Wattenberg sometimes seems too focused on the politics of appealing to the electorate where it is, Kenneth O'Reilly appears to think that Presidents can operate without any relation to public attitudes at all. "Nixon's Piano" is a carefully researched effort to demonstrate that America's Presidents have been racist -- although Mr. O'Reilly doesn't seem to notice that the country has been, too. He concedes that Lincoln, Truman and Johnson made things better for African-Americans. Each, however, is faulted for only acting ahead of his time and background and not also being color-blind.
"Values Matter Most" is, first of all, an argument for the Democratic Leadership Council-vintage Bill Clinton. His early supporters -- and Mr. Wattenberg, who worked for Lyndon Johnson in the White House and Senators Hubert Humphrey and Henry Jackson in political campaigns -- counted on him to be a New Democrat on issues like crime and welfare. They expected him to support capital punishment and prisons and kicking people off welfare, and they are unhappy that most of the time he has not. In fact, if they did not know that Mr. Clinton had some very traditional liberal views too, they collaborated with him in fooling themselves.
This book's greatest strength is the distinction Mr. Wattenberg draws between those kinds of social issues and "cultural issues" like abortion, pornography and homosexuality, a distinction that makes clear that the social issues have political heft and the cultural issues are risky. "Americans, by huge majorities," he writes, "are scared about crime, furious about welfare, irate about lack of discipline among school-aged children and angry about preferences. Americans typically believe in a fairly tough response to these corrosive concerns." And, he notes, government plainly should be involved in all of them -- so they all clearly deserve to be debated in politics, and a politician can line up with the majority with little danger. The cultural issues are more politically sensitive: "There is often no consensus because there is no agreement about the very nature of what they represent. Liberals often see the cultural issues as related to liberty and leeway. Conservatives often see them as related to license and libertinism." For examples, he cites homosexuals in the military, sex education and flag burning.
Mr. Wattenberg makes the case that values matter, and that politicians should face them without worrying whether reporters will accuse them of racist demagogy. But he strains to prove that they matter most with a numbing collection of graphs and charts designed to prove that economics doesn't matter at all. Anyone who talks to voters gets a sense of unease about downsizing, health insurance and whether their children will be able to afford to buy a house, an unease that keeps poll respondents saying there's a recession when economists can prove there isn't. A good economy may not help a candidate, as Mr. Clinton may discover next year, but a troubled one only magnifies the worries Mr. Wattenberg is most concerned with.
His analysis works best on the issue of crime and on the sloppiness with which Democrats have handled voters' plausible concern about the the importance of keeping convicts locked up. And he effectively skewers the House Democrats for being unwilling to follow Mr. Clinton's lead on educational standards.
Like the President himself, Mr. Wattenberg may be at his weakest on welfare reform, the particular subject of Mr. Clinton's apologetic phone call. Mr. Wattenberg blames Mr. Clinton for going slow and for being too liberal. But the better criticism has come from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has argued that Mr. Clinton's promise of two-years-and-off-the-rolls was naive, made with no understanding of how expensive it would be to accomplish at a relatively humane level. Mr. Wattenberg treats the issue almost entirely as an exercise in politics, not policy.
He is least convincing on quotas and affirmative action. The sort of consensus he sees, for example, on crime and the need for more certain punishment is absent from the discussion of what he calls "preference." Lots of white men agree with him that the time has come to abandon affirmative action, but many don't, and the support falls off sharply among women and blacks. More might agree if reality equaled his description. For example, the 1971 Griggs decision did not, as Mr. Wattenberg says, establish that "high school diplomas or test scores could not be used as a prerequisite for employment because in such competition blacks as a group did not do as well as whites as a group." It held that they could not be used because they had no relation to qualifications for power-plant jobs, and imposing them had the effect of denying jobs to blacks who had less education than whites. Mr. Wattenberg also brushes off Mr. Clinton's record on preference issues as having made things worse, when it could be argued that the President's statement last spring that affirmative action was good for America but needed a little fine-tuning was a brave and moral effort to calm an explosive issue.
Where Mr. Wattenberg notes approvingly Mr. Clinton's campaign denunciation of the rap performer Sister Souljah for suggesting that blacks start killing whites, in "Nixon's Piano" Mr. O'Reilly deplores it as evidence that Mr. Clinton took African-American voters for granted and was making a racist appeal to Reagan Democrats.
The best thing about Mr. O'Reilly's book is the title. He begins by describing one of those dreadful Washington evenings, the Gridiron dinner of 1970, through the appalled eyes of Roger Wilkins, one of the two black guests at this annual event where bureau chiefs and columnists buddy up with politicians. Richard Nixon, to show he was a good sport, joined the entertainment. But whatever he played on the piano was drowned out by Spiro T. Agnew, the as-yet-unindicted or even investigated Vice President, playing "Dixie."
An evening of good fun over Nixon's "Southern strategy" is Mr. O'Reilly's starting point for the argument that just about every President has pandered to the South. A few knew that slavery or segregation was wrong, but did nothing about it. Those few others who did something about it fall short, too, in Mr. O'Reilly's judgment, for insufficient purity of thought.
More than half the book is devoted to the last 35 years. John F. Kennedy is dismissed for advocating no more than "modest" civil rights legislation. Yet it was that bill that brought a quarter of a million Americans to the Lincoln Memorial, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech, and at the time it did not seem modest. Mr. O'Reilly, a professor of history at the University of Alaska and the author of "Racial Matters," contends that the disintegration of Jimmy Carter's Presidency began with equivocation over affirmative action. For both these Presidents, he acknowledges but seems unmoved by the way they impressed African-Americans from King to Andrew Young.
Fundamentally, Mr. O'Reilly argues that "the politics that came out of the Constitution and its articles on slavery are still stuck in a racial rut. With few exceptions, the deeds and dreams of our Presidents, and the choices they made and did not make in matters of race, deepened that rut." Where President Clinton is concerned, he writes, "it is a sad commentary" that Mr. Clinton, "arguably the least prejudiced of the 41 men who preceded him, sees fit to include a racial calculus in politics and policy."
What country does Mr. O'Reilly think Mr. Clinton is President of? This President, like his predecessors, must govern in a country still deeply divided over race, a nation where uncompromising politics is usually failed politics.

HEADLINE: The C.I.A.'s most Important Mission: Itself

BYLINE: By Tim Weiner; Tim Weiner, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, is an author of "Betrayal: The Story of Aldrich Ames, an American Spy."

 BODY:
ON AN AUTUMN EVENING, IN A PRIVATE PLANE APPROACHING WASHINGTON, JOHN DEUTCH, THE NEW Director of Central Intelligence, sprawled wearily in an armchair and worried aloud about the nation's spies. He compared them to a defeated force -- the United States Army after the fall of Saigon.
"What happened with the Army?" Deutch said. "The young officers looked at each other and said: 'We're in trouble. We've got to change. We've got to figure out a way to do this differently. We're either leaving or we're going to change the system.' And the people who stayed did change the system." 
 Deutch's struggle to transform the Central Intelligence Agency, the world's greatest and most reviled spy service, has become a war in itself, a battle against the history and the culture of the C.I.A. The opening shot came early one morning last May when Deutch first walked onstage at the Bubble, the agency's once-futuristic amphitheater, and looked out at 500 frightened people. Fear was the watchword of the day. The agency was taking a terrible beating, lampooned by cartoonists, lambasted by pundits and politicians. Its last chief had quit abruptly. Its best people were fleeing. Its great enemy, the Soviet Union, had disappeared. It had been betrayed by Aldrich Ames, the unctuous apparatchik who had blown a hundred secret missions and exposed scores of American spies. He helped Moscow create a team of double agents who manipulated American perceptions of the Kremlin for years, a fact the C.I.A. concealed from three Presidents and the Pentagon.
The agency's scarred heart -- the spies in the D.O., the directorate of operations -- needed surgery. Republican Senators, three-star generals and National Security Council officials were talking in public about whether merely to "overhaul" or to "eviscerate" or "blow up" the agency. A Presidential commission was debating whether the C.I.A. should live or die. The agency's very existence depended on what Deutch did -- and he had vowed to change it, if needed, "down to the bare bones." No wonder the spooks were spooked.
The new leader told a little joke to put them at ease. He recalled that his connections with the agency went back to 1976, when George Bush, then the director, put him on a panel of expert advisers on spy satellites and other technical wizardry. "And ever since that time," he said, "I always harbored a secret desire to be the Director of Central Intelligence."
The spies laughed, knowing the truth. In January, the President had gazed fondly upon Deutch, his brainy and ebullient Deputy Secretary of Defense, and said, John, your country needs you. Deutch, astute fellow, said no. His punishment was to find someone willing and able to say yes. The search went on for six weeks. Finally Deutch came up with an obscure Air Force general whose nomination wobbled, plummeted and crashed. And then the President gazed with something less than fondness upon John Deutch.
"The President pressed on me the view that I really had to do it," he recalls. Thus was a 57-year-old physical chemistry professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology given the most difficult experiment of his life.
Deutch's scientific specialty is visualizing atoms and molecules, seeing them with the mind's eye as they undergo changes, and understanding how those changes transform matter -- how a lump of coal under enormous pressure becomes a diamond. With a colleague, Francis Low, he solved a puzzle in laser physics three years ago: 1) A wave packet of photons (think of a cloud of no-see-ems) appears to move faster than the speed of light. 2) This is impossible. 3) Prove it. "The amazing thing about John," says Low, "is his ability to walk into a system he doesn't know fundamental things about and fix it." But if the physical world is ruled by immutable principles, the nation's spies are cursed by human frailty and weighted by a dark past. The biggest problem Deutch had to fix was not systems but people, for whom no quantum theory holds.
"The clandestine service is the heart and soul of the agency," says Robert M. Gates, Director of Central Intelligence from 1991 to 1993. "It is also the part that can land you in jail." The operations directorate was in such deep trouble that it was facing a life sentence -- or execution. It had "to change its nature and character," says Adm. William O. Studeman, acting director from January to May, 1995. Under enormous pressure, it had to be transformed.
The agency would live, Deutch told his audience that May morning, his first full day on the job. There would always be a C.I.A., he assured them, despite past calls to shut it down from people like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. And there would always be spies within it, despite proposals to the contrary from retired generals and would-be wise men ready to give the job to the military.
Deutch knew that the congressional intelligence committees and the Presidential commission re-evaluating the agency were beginning with a blank sheet of paper. He had their trust to fill in the blanks -- if they first could be convinced that the agency's 5,000 spies had the capacity to change, and the morale, the motivation and the mental wherewithal to perform vital missions. Deutch has had to convince himself. This is taking time.
The least difficult part of the equation was: which missions? There remains a widespread belief that the C.I.A., without a cold war to fight, is wandering around looking for work. The reality is different. The Clinton Administration has been using the agency as its own private Internet, a kind of secret adjunct to the Library of Congress, asking thousands of questions about ravaged rain forests, compact-disk counterfeiters, the opium crop in Afghanistan and the crooked ruler of Zaire. But many of the answers can be found in newspapers -- "and in many cases I get a better presentation in the newspapers than I do in a secret briefing from the C.I.A.," says Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee.
The clandestine service, unhappy at being thought of as a billion-dollar news bureau, conceived a plan. Shortly after Deutch arrived, it presented him with a glossy brochure titled "A New Direction. A New Future." It said, in essence, forget about ecology and human rights and epidemics and sociology. That's soft stuff. The spies proposed narrowing and sharpening their focus on what the C.I.A. calls hard targets.
Most of the top 10 targets were obvious -- though nobody knew where the next Somalia or Haiti would pop up, and everyone knew the agency would be crucified for failing to see it coming. The specter of loose nukes, the whole Pandora's box of weapons proliferation, was high on the list. So was terrorism in all its faces, including armed Islamic fundamentalism. The C.I.A. always had to satisfy the military's thirst for intelligence, from the order of battle in the Balkans to the latest intrigues in Libya.
Five nations pose endless questions. What's going on in the high councils of Iran, Iraq and North Korea? Who really understands China's future directions and leadership? What will happen in Russia, a minefield of out-of-work weapons designers and wild visionaries?
At that point, picking priorities gets trickier. International criminal cartels are now richer and stronger than many nations, and capable of many crimes from financial fraud to computer hacking. But supporting American law enforcement has never been the agency's strong suit -- not if nearly 50 years of bad blood between the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. is any sign. And grappling with the international drug market offers little chance for success. "Organized crime and drugs may be better left in the hands of the F.B.I. than the C.I.A.," says the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
Last on the priority list was the thorny problem of economic intelligence. Inevitably, that means spying on Japan, Germany and France. Is the information gleaned worth the risk of being caught stealing trade secrets from allies? Not to judge by the recent embarrassments over being caught tapping telephones in Tokyo and bribing bureaucrats in Paris. And not in the minds of the top American officials who read the C.I.A.'s take and openly deride its quality, utility and revelance.
Deutch had reservations about the spies' new vision. He would not have laid it out quite the same way. Now, he says, he embraces it as the "road map for the future." One of his deputies says the message for the clandestine service is blunt: "Let me explain life to you. Here are the 10 or 15 things that we cannot tolerate to fail against to advance the national-security interests of the United States. This is what we want you to devote your money, your people, your language training and your skills to. We want to get this right."
IN ORDER TO GET IT RIGHT, THE CLANDESTINE SERVICE HAS TO change its ways.
American spies overseas are almost all based in embassies, posing as diplomats and targeting their opposite numbers. But the United States has no embassies in Iran, Iraq or North Korea. And most terrorists, weapons dealers and drug kingpins do not wear white tie and tails.
"In the cold war," Bob Gates says, "if you wanted to recruit an East German or a Pole, the vehicle for that contact was the diplomatic cocktail circuit or the tennis court. None of the guys you're interested in now are on that circuit. None. You're not going to recruit a rogue nuclear scientist at a cocktail party. That's the biggest challenge: how to move the clandestine service away from the embassy to a more independent status, without the protection of diplomatic cover or a diplomatic passport. That represents a fundamental revolution in the way C.I.A. has conducted itself. Your whole training program, your language program, the way you pay salaries has to change. The risks are different and much higher. You no longer want people who can do tea and cookies in the afternoon. You have to look for a new kind of personality" -- different from the vast majority of the spies, who are "primarily white middle-class guys. You need a guy walking into Tripoli or Pyongyang who doesn't look like he just left Iowa."
If terrorists, thugs and tribes with flags were the hardest targets, then the spies had better be good. The alternative is to start from scratch and build a completely different clandestine service.
So how good were they? Deutch soon learned that though the clandestine service consumes only 3 percent of his budget, it would occupy half his waking hours, and more than a few restless nights. The Director of Central Intelligence is chairman of all the intelligence agencies as well as the C.E.O. of the C.I.A. Nearly 90 percent of the $28 billion or so Deutch will spend this year goes to military intelligence services like the National Security Agency, which conducts signals intelligence, or sigint, with satellites and ground stations, and the National Reconnaissance Office, which builds the fantastically expensive satellites. Deutch loves this stuff -- "I'm a technical guy. I'm a satellite guy. I'm a sigint guy," he says -- and orchestrating the instruments of intelligence to perform like an symphony was a task he could handle.
Making the clandestine chorus sing his tune was a different problem. From his first days, he went walking around the agency's headquarters, shaking hands, lunching in the cafeteria, semi-spontaneously dropping into people's offices, and then flying off around the world to C.I.A. stations, listening, nodding, questioning.
His initial impressions of the spies were unsettling. He says he was "shocked by their inability to formulate solutions" to their problems. He says he heard "a defensiveness, and almost panic, about what should be done" to reassert the C.I.A.'s credibility. He heard a lot of complaints, a lot of pleas to save the clandestine service -- but few ideas about how to do it. Though the spies had been through their own Vietnam, through two decades of scandals and snafus and self-inflicted wounds, the clandestine service did not appear to have the ability or desire to reinvent itself the way the Army did. Deutch did not find many first-class minds in the ranks. "Compared to uniformed officers," he said in September, "they certainly are not as competent, or as understanding of what their relative role is and what their responsibilities are."
He figured out later that the spies knew what he thought of them, and began to rethink his first impressions. He started to search for the talented younger officers who were unhappy with the clandestine service but had stuck it out, hoping for a change. He started saying "we" instead of "they." This, again, took time.
The directorate of operations' initial response to Deutch was not wholly favorable either. Antipathy boiled over in the Bubble on Sept. 29. That morning, Deutch was forced to confront the C.I.A.'s history. There are places where the agency has done good -- like smuggling money and fax machines to the Solidarity movement in Poland or securing Vaclav Havel's Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia -- but Latin America is not one of them. Nowhere is the agency's record worse than Guatemala, where it overthrew the Government in a 1954 coup and for the next 40 years supported a brutal military that has killed more than 100,000 civilians.
Prompted by the disclosure that one of the C.I.A.'s foreign agents, a Guatemalan colonel, might have been implicated in the murder of an American, Deutch ordered a worldwide re-evaluation of thousands of paid informers. The orders were to identify the crooks and the fingernail-pullers, to weigh the information they provided against their records, and to sack them if they failed the test. Then he reviewed the C.I.A.'s recent performance in Guatemala, and found what he politely called "tremendous deficiencies in the way the agency carried out its business." Above all, he found "a lack of candor -- between the chief of station and the Ambassador, between the station and the directorate of operations' Latin America division, between the directorate of operations' Latin America division and the deputy director for operations, and between the C.I.A. and the Congress." Guatemala proved to be a core sample of a deep rot.
In the World-of-Tomorrow setting of the Bubble, Deutch announced he was firing the former chief of the Latin America division and a former station chief. It is very hard to get fired from the C.I.A. -- no one was dismissed after the Ames debacle -- and the discipline did not go over well. The hundreds of officers gathered there were deeply unhappy, and they told Deutch so. They said he was moving the goal posts on them. They saw their job in Guatemala as getting rid of Communists, not providing grist for Amnesty International reports. They saw the affair as a supremely pointless scandal, a left-wing revisionist history of the cold war.
Deutch said, O.K., this was a setback, but you can't be afraid of failure. You can't be afraid of controversy. You've got to go out there and keep taking risks in the service of your country. And then a low, rumbling growl started from the back of the Bubble, a bitter, sardonic, self-pitying chuckle signifying: Yeah. Sure. They were laughing at him. The curse of the Old Boys was upon John Deutch.
THE CURSE IS THE PATRIMONY OF AN ELITE SECRET SOCIETY that degenerated into an elitist bureaucracy, an inbred tribal culture. The old boys were the Knights Templar of America. Secrecy was their sword and shield. They had billions of dollars; they could buy kings and break them; they were saving the world. They were different. Rules and laws were not for them.
Their legacy is an arrogation of power through secrecy, a we-know-what's-best-for-America imperiousness, a "lack of candor" -- lying to Presidents, to the Pentagon, to the Congress and to each other. It's a suicidal habit; it keeps threatening to do the spies in. Deutch must break the tradition.
"It's a tradition to keep in mind, because I'm certainly flowing against that tide," Deutch says. "They were careless. Not being fully forthcoming with -- never mind the Congress -- with the President? With the Secretary of State? With the Secretary of Defense? It's unimaginable." It dies hard. The old boys' heirs "have habits, they have practices, they have attitudes which are just not reasonable," he says. "There is a wish that somebody would come in and in one fell swoop replace what they see as the dignity of the past."
To better understand that past, Deutch stays in touch with the last great spymaster, the vicar of dirty tricks, who once said he wore his conviction for failing to testify truly to Congress as a badge of honor: the Honorable Richard McGarrah Helms, Director of Central Intelligence from 1966 to 1973.
Helms is at an age of funerals. Eighty-two years old, elegant as a British banker, he stood before a congregation in a small wood-beamed Episcopal church in September, the blue flag of the Central Intelligence Agency hanging by the altar. A hundred old men filled the pews. There was Bronson Tweedy, chief of the Africa division when Washington fought Moscow for dominion over Europe's lost colonies. Rolf Kingsley, chief of the Soviet division when we were eyeball to eyeball. Thomas Parrott, the agency's link to the White House in the days of coups and plots. These were the men, tempered by the fires of the cold war, who made the C.I.A. Walter Pforzheimer, the old boys' unofficial historian, leaned on his cane and observed: "This is the second-to-last great gathering of the clan. The last one will be for Helms."
The occasion was a memorial for Larry Houston, the agency's chief lawyer from 1947 to 1973. Helms gave the eulogy. He praised Houston as a man who always told the clandestine service what it could do, not what it could not. "And that," he said dryly, "was essential at the C.I.A. in those days."
A few days later, Helms sipped a beer under the slowly revolving ceiling fans of the Bombay Club in downtown Washington and mourned what has become of his service, how can-do decayed into can't. "Exactly how all this deteriorated, I don't know." But he does know. "If you're going to be involved with espionage you've got to be motivated. It's not fun and games. It's dirty and dangerous. There's always a chance you're going to get burned. In World War II, in the O.S.S., we knew what our motivation was: to beat the goddamn Nazis. In the cold war, we knew what our motivation was: to beat the goddamn Russians. Suddenly the cold war is over, and what is the motivation? What would compel someone to spend their lives doing this sort of thing?"
"In this," Helms said, polishing off his beer, "the director must provide the motivation. John Deutch is a damn smart fellow. He's obviously not terribly interested in having a lot of dirt thrown on him -- he wants to go back to M.I.T. -- and so he's instinctively drawing away from the D.O., seeing it as nothing but trouble. Nor is he the first to be distancing himself. He's got a job to do convincing them he's on the team."
Helms's day ended in congressional hearings that paraded a generation's worth of skeletons before the public -- the assassination plots, the coups, the spying on Americans. Then came a brief reformation in the late 1970's. Then came the counterreformation. In the 1980's, the C.I.A. expanded mightily under William J. Casey, President Reagan's Director of Central Intelligence. Casey hired thousands of new spies, but quantity was not matched with quality. He lowered the intelligence quotient of the C.I.A., said Gates, his deputy director. And when Casey was caught running guns to Iran and Nicaragua on orders from the White House in 1986, in defiance of law and common sense, the clandestine service took another flaying in the form of indictments and investigations. These left permanent scars, in the form of "a risk-avoidance mentality, a lack of boldness and imagination," Gates says.
The most recent beating, still being administered, began last year after the arrest of Aldrich Ames. For seven years after Ames walked out of headquarters with a six-pound stack of secret papers, no one at the agency investigating the betrayal ever told Gates or his predecessor, William Webster, anything close to the truth about the case. The chain of command was broken.
Now some of the best of the second generation of spies say the clandestine service has forfeited its leading role in national security. Among them is an old spy named Milt Bearden, a smart tough guy, the kind you want on your side in a war of words or a bar fight. Today Bearden lives down a dirt road outside an obscure New Hampshire hamlet. A few years back, he was running Stinger antiaircraft missiles into Afghanistan, baiting and bleeding the Russian bear. When the Soviet Union went into its death spasms in August 1991, he was watching with delight from inside K.G.B. headquarters in Dzerzhinsky Square. As much as any man, Bearden -- the last chief of the Soviet division -- had a good cold war. The only blot on his career was the fact that for 10 months he had a mole on his payroll named Ames.
A year into his retirement, he considers what was lost when we won the cold war. "It was easy, once upon a time, for C.I.A. to be unique and mystical," he says over mugs of tea in his New Hampshire dacha. "It was not an institution. It was a mission. And the mission was a crusade. Then you took the Soviet Union away from us and there wasn't anything else. We don't have a history. We don't have a hero. Even our medals are secret. And now the mission is over. Fini."
In its place, he says, are far smaller missions that require a smaller clandestine service. "Out of 5,000 people, you've got 1,500 buggy-whip makers" in the spies' ranks, he says. "There's nothing worse than having a couple thousand more troops than you need. It's poisonous. John Deutch needs to have a garage sale out there, and have those who remain understand that they're not the front line anymore. Their mission is greatly reduced: intelligence support to other agencies that will do things about the great transnational problems."
The spy service's future, he says, is in backing up the military and the F.B.I. and drug-enforcement agents and friendly foreign intelligence services who will do the dirty work. His conclusion is shared by many. The Pentagon wants to increase its own spying abroad, and has plans, not yet approved, to set up soldiers under the cover of phony overseas companies. The F.B.I. has similar designs on the agency's turf, and wants to play a greater part in foreign intelligence. Both would gladly usurp the power of the C.I.A.
Come what may, the agency will always have a role supporting the military, especially in helping the Pentagon create a 3-D map of the theater of war that overwhelms the enemy's two-dimensional vision. The failure to deliver timely, accurate information to battlefield commanders was one of the main shortcomings in the 1991 gulf war. Deutch's Pentagon experience and connections will create permanent channels to insure better performance the next time.
But on a typical Sunday morning, the United States is not at war. And its enemies sit not in the Kremlin or any other capital, but in the Bekaa Valley, the outskirts of Kabul, the nouveau-riche estates above Bogota and the mosques outside Teheran. As borders blur and states collapse, the threats are less nations than gangs. The harm they can do the United States is less a military matter than a law-enforcement problem.
The F.B.I. thinks this is a job for the F.B.I. The C.I.A. begs to differ.
The bureau and the agency have a lifetime of mutual mistrust to overcome, another legacy from the old boys, and one of Deutch's biggest burdens. The C.I.A. wants to keep control of overseas intelligence missions, seeing the F.B.I. as a bunch of cops in Ninja suits with a certain lack of savoir-faire. The bureau wants to wrest control from the agency, seeing it as unskilled in the basics of busting bad guys. They are forced to cooperate, and this requires working hard to avoid colliding. This struggle either will end in an amicable truce or a catastrophic loss of power and prestige for the clandestine service.
 "The problem we face today," Deutch says, "is getting both these communities to work together and build on each other's strength and forget about the fact that this tussle goes back to the time of Allen Dulles and J. Edgar Hoover."
The most fertile terrain for cooperation -- and the biggest minefield -- is in the C.I.A.'s overseas stations and bases. They maintain liaisons with 400 different foreign intelligence services, internal-security groups and police departments. These liaisons remain the least-known aspect of the agency's work abroad. When things go well, the foreign service can arrest a terrorist or subvert a drug syndicate. When they go badly, people die. And they are often dangerous liaisons, marriages of convenience marked by infidelity. For liaison is penetration: the C.I.A. tries to spy on the foreign service, co-opting police chiefs and colonels, and the foreign service spies on the C.I.A. "We are all each other's partners," Studeman said, "and we are all each other's targets."
Senior Justice Department officials say they often feel a certain uneasiness in their liaisons with the C.I.A. "We never know if we're getting the whole story," one says. "The agency usually has another agenda. When we don't know if we're getting the whole truth, it's a little unsettling." This bodes ill for bringing drug dealers and bomb makers to justice from abroad. The issue is nearly irresolvable: how can the agency keep secrets when the bureau wants to use them as evidence? Sharing secrets, says the C.I.A.'s deputy general counsel, Dawn Eilenberger, creates "a constant tension. That tension is never going to go away."
If the Pentagon and the bureau set up their own foreign intelligence services, the C.I.A.'s future role may be irrevocably diminished. But if the agency can defend itself from its allies in the United States Government, and survive the slow exhumation of its buried past, then it has a chance to preserve the heart of its true mission: identifying the handful of real secrets that might harm the United States and getting station chiefs to steal them.
THOUGH IT IS engaged in fewer clandestine operations today than ever before, the C.I.A. is still capable of achieving things. It helped to arrest the old terrorist Carlos the Jackal, 20 years a fugitive, in the Sudan last year. It helped take apart the Cali cocaine cartel by providing intelligence to Colombian authorities. It helped track and trap Ramzi Yousef, charged as the ringleader of the World Trade Center bombing. But to operate effectively, it needs effective operatives. And the curse of the old boys has so damaged the morale and reputation of the C.I.A. that it is hard to find good people, keep the best and replace the ones who leave.
"Some guy who's a talented Arabic speaker who just got a master's at Harvard has got Salomon Brothers saying you can come tomorrow, versus the agency saying, well, you have to take a lie-detector test and maybe we'll call you in nine months -- do I have a chance of competing for somebody like that?" a senior agency official asks.
The lie detector, or polygraph, is either an indispensible tool for security, or a medieval machine best suited for hunting witches, depending on your point of view. The agency's Office of Security swears by it, and rejects a very large fraction of job applicants for failing it. "Their reliance on the polygraph," Deutch said, "is truly insane." He is thinking about cutting back on it, in the hope that it might be a help in "getting flexible minds to come in and stay."
As for people leaving, that is harder to stop. If the agency conducted exit interviews, which it does not, if would have heard this from Phil Giraldi, who spent 16 years in the clandestine service, starting as a field officer in Rome and ending as chief of base in Barcelona in 1992: "The ultimate tragedy is spiritual. Most of the younger officers I knew have resigned. These were the best and the brightest. Eighty or 90 percent of the people I knew, halfway through their careers, have packed it in. There was very little motivation left. The enthusiasm was gone. When I joined the agency, back in '76, there was a tribalism. The esprit de corps that the Agency had was created by this tribalism, and it served a good purpose. You used to have great eccentrics. You used to hear criticism, intellectual debate. Now you have M.B.A. clones, not philosopher kings." Giraldi says that when he started out, his partner in the Rome station had a Ph.D. in Italian politics. In Barcelona, on his last tour, she was an English major who spoke no Spanish.
Even so, the best people remaining are very smart -- and very resilient. "How talented are we?" asks the deputy director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet. "More talented than people know." The greater part of that talent lies in the think tank, the directorate for intelligence. Its new chief, John Gannon, says his analysts include some of the most intelligent people in Washington. He may be among them. When Gannon was a graduate student in the 1970's, "the agency was not something that interested me," he says. "I was a Latin Americanist, so not only did it not interest me; I thought the agency was as close to evil as you get to in the universe. I disapproved of what they were doing in Latin America."
At the urging of a senior agency analyst, he came in for a look. "The quality of the work I saw being done was extraordinary. It had nothing to do with my image of the agency. It was really good stuff." The information was so far beyond what was available in academia, and the people so interesting, he says, that he stayed, and, over 18 years, has never looked back. But now, looking ahead, Gannon fears he may lose the expert colleagues he needs. One of his predecessors said in 1993 that he found it "hard to do serious analysis with a bunch of 19-year-olds on two-year rotations." That exaggerates the problem, but not by much.
Right now, Gannon says he has plenty of people, but not the right mix. German speakers? Too many. Chinese speakers? Some. Slavic language speakers? Nowhere close to enough. Economists? No. People capable of understanding what's going on in Azerbaijan or Afghanistan? Some, but not enough. Worst of all, Gannon says, the analysts feel adrift: "People in this directorate do want a sense of direction, a sense of what the mission is, and I need to work hard to give it to them," he says. "How do you take this supertanker and get it in the direction you want to put it?"
IT WILL TAKE A VERY long time to turn the C.I.A. around, if it can be done at all. Deutch is talking about three or four years. But it may be far longer. "We didn't get to the position we're in overnight and we aren't going to get out of it overnight," said Nora Slatkin, whom Deutch brought in from the Pentagon to serve as the agency's executive director, its day-to-day manager and by far the highest-ranking woman in its history. "Change isn't easy. There's always going to be some resistance to change. Always. If it takes a decade or so to build a new satellite, it's not unreasonable to take that long to build a new generation of C.I.A. officers."
If the curse can be broken, Deutch has the chutzpah to do it. "If any man can change the culture of the C.I.A., this is such a man," Senator Moynihan says. Few in Washington can match his brains, and not too many are aware that he has been around the business most of his life. "John's resume in intelligence," says Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, "is a lot deeper than most people know."
It begins with his father. Michael Deutch was a Russian Jew, born in Smolensk in 1908, who with his family fled the Bolshevik Revolution for Belgium and who learned chemical engineering at the University of Ghent. He married Jean Fischer, the daughter of a diamond merchant who ran the Zionist Federation in Belgium. Their son was born in Brussels in 1938, an inauspicious time and place for a child of his heritage. In 1939, the Deutches fled from the Nazis, first to Paris, then Lisbon and finally to America. His father quickly joined the military-industrial elite, serving as deputy director at the War Production Board, in charge of making synthetic rubber. He befriended generals and admirals and intelligence types, all of whom fascinated him.
In 1951, he went on a Presidential mission to the Philippines as an economic adviser. He became deeply impressed by an Air Force lieutenant colonel named Edward G. Lansdale. Detailed to the C.I.A., Lansdale was simultaneously trying to kill off a Communist insurgency in the Philippines, create a pro-American President and win over the populace with star-spangled propaganda, psychological warfare and covert action. Michael Deutch became a lifelong friend to Lansdale, a man who through hidden-hand diplomacy and dirty tricks came to embody American influence in the Philippines and Vietnam in the 1950's. (He was memorialized, heroically, as Col. Hillendale in "The Ugly American" and, devastatingly, as Pyle in Graham Greene's "The Quiet American.") Deutch was by Lansdale's side for a far less successful return engagement of his winning-hearts-and-minds road show in Vietnam.
President Kennedy loved Lansdale's style, and created a job for him as the assistant to the Secretary of Defense for special liaison operations. In 1961, the President, through his brother Robert, the Attorney General, set Lansdale off on a C.I.A. plot code-named Mongoose -- a plan to eliminate Fidel Castro. That year, Lansdale personally recruited John Deutch for his first Government job.
At 22, Deutch became one of Secretary of State Robert MacNamara's whiz kids in the Pentagon's office of systems analysis. The generals hated the whiz kids, and who could blame them? These earnest young men with slide rules were about to overturn the central tenet of American nuclear strategy: the complete destruction of everything east of the Iron Curtain at the first sign that the Soviets were ready for war. The plan was to kill hundreds of millions of people with 3,423 nuclear weapons on the first day of World War III.
The plan was based on bad intelligence. The C.I.A. and the Air Force estimated -- falsely -- that the Russians had a two-million-man army with 175 divisions and hundreds of nuclear missiles. The United States had a million-man army and thousands of nuclear missiles. Ergo: nuke them with a bolt from the blue.
"The idea was to get away from the single spasm response that destroyed everything and create the capacity to do something more complex," said Deutch's boss, Alain Enthoven, then 30 years old. Their idea -- that you could fight and win a limited, controlled nuclear war -- is a concept that theologists of the nuclear church still debate.
It was heady business for young John Deutch, who spent four years in systems analysis while earning his graduate degree at M.I.T. His father's fascination with military and intelligence matters now rested in him. So did the experience of overturning hidebound thinking with reason. And Deutch liked his taste of power.
He began a lifelong pattern. He held political posts in Democratic administrations and went back to academic and advisory posts in Republican times, serving in a sort of permanent government of defense intellectuals -- neither hawks nor doves but owls. He was a member of President Reagan's commission on nuclear strategy, President Bush's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and six other similar panels. Deutch stuck close to academic politics, becoming dean of science and then provost of M.I.T. Moving between these worlds, the bivalent professor won admirers in both. He may be the only living American to gain the approval of both Ronald Reagan and Noam Chomsky, the M.I.T. linguist and leading left-wing thinker. "He has more honesty and integrity than anyone I've ever met in academic life, or any other life," Chomsky said. "If somebody's got to be running the C.I.A., I'm glad it's him."
Deutch wanted to become president of M.I.T. in 1990, but did not win the prize. He stepped down as provost and returned to teaching, one of a dozen among the more than 900 given the title of institute professor. He had become rich from patents and consultancies and companies and investments and a partnership with William Perry, an old friend and colleague from the Pentagon. When the Democrats returned to power in 1993, there was a limited universe of people deemed capable of running the Defense Department. Deutch and Perry were in it, as was another friend from M.I.T., Les Aspin, a whiz kid who was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Aspin became Defense Secretary, Perry his deputy. Deutch became the procurement czar and by most accounts, did very well. He cut $90 billion out of President Bush's five-year military plan. He took a ruinously expensive and fouled-up program -- the new C-17 transport plane -- and made it fly.
In March 1994, Perry became Defense Secretary and Deutch his deputy. And now that Deutch holds what Perry says "may be the toughest job in Washington" -- tougher than running the Defense Department or, for that matter, the White House -- Deutch looks back and sees his experiences in stark relief.
"The Pentagon, this time around, was an organization equipped to take on change and well aware that it was necessary because of the fall of the Soviet empire," he says. "It was a huge organization whose leadership and all of its different parts said: 'We need to change, and to organize our resources and our people to accomplish this change.'
"The C.I.A. is an organization suffering because it's had tremendous criticism because of its own mistakes, and part of the problem is for the core work force to recognize that they are responsible for some of these problems and that it's in their power to change," he says. "There's been some tendency to say, 'It's the world that's wrong, not us, and if only we could revert to the good old days things would be better.' It's very much harder for an outsider to come in and make progress, especially when a great fraction of my time has been spent explaining these inexplicable past errors. It's a very, very different management challenge and by far the most difficult, running the C.I.A. By far."
IT IS THE BUSINESS OF INTELLIGENCE TO REPLACE ignorance and fear with knowledge and confidence. The C.I.A has been imprisoned by its own lies, living in fear, unsure of its history, uncertain of its future. Deutch is trying to force the agency to face its sins and shortcomings. If the C.I.A. has a future, this is how it must begin.
At 8:30 on Halloween morning, John Deutch returned to address the spies in the Bubble, once again trying to explain the inexplicable. The agency had suffered yet another self-inflicted wound, this time to its soul.
For eight years, the agency had knowingly given the White House and the Pentagon reports from Soviet agents it knew to be under Moscow's control -- a stupid and self-destructive decision. It was the most important job of the C.I.A. to speak truth to power. But the agency had simply picked the most plausible-sounding stories told by paid liars. Passing along information without revealing that its source works for the other side is putting poison in the well. The officers in question figured that they knew best. They thought the information was probably true, so they did not have to tell anyone that it came from double agents. They concealed that salient fact from three Presidents -- whose policy judgments may have been swayed by the reports. This deception reflected supreme arrogance, Deutch says, "an arrogance that let them ignore the fundamentals of their profession."
The double agents existed thanks to the treason of Aldrich Ames, and his treason sprang from that same arrogance. Ames was a child of the C.I.A., the son of an agency man, a living emblem of the malevolent mediocrity in its ranks. His treason has forced the agency to live in a state of fear, not knowing which of its secrets are secret. And this latest disaster shows that his spirit lives on. In a jailhouse interview last year, he spelled out why he sold out the agency's crown jewels to the Kremlin. "Call it arrogance, if you will, but I'd say: 'I know what's damaging, and I know what's not damaging, and I know what the Soviet Union is really all about, and I know what's best for foreign policy and national security.' And I do."
In the Bubble, Deutch discussed the disaster in detail for 15 minutes, then answered questions. And then he talked to the spies about the future. He said he understood the damage to their morale. He exhorted them not to let it bring them down. There are ways to fix it, he said. We're going to pull together. We're going to stand as one and move on.
They rose and applauded, long and loud.
Deutch received a similiar reception the next day at a convocation of station chiefs from around the world down at the Farm, the agency's training grounds at Camp Peary, outside Williamsburg, Va. After his return, a sense of wonder began showing through his deep weariness.
As he talked about it the next night, in his suite of offices up on the seventh floor, he began to think aloud again: maybe he was getting through to the spies. Perhaps this last chapter of the Ames affair had shocked them into consciousness.
"This one got to them, on their own terms," he said. "It was such a violation of their own rules. They've realized what happened here. And I think it's shaken them very considerably. They're a lot more ready to say: 'Tell us what to do. We're going to work.' "

Do Clothes Make the Student?

 BODY:
Keeping up with appearances at school these days is a bit bewildering. At prep schools, blazers and button-downs are giving way to sneakers and jeans, while at public schools, sneakers and jeans are giving way to blazers and button-downs.
Coats and ties used to be de rigueur at Andover, for example, but now the dean of students can come up with only two requirements. "You have to wear shoes and you have to be dressed," says Stephen Carter. Miss Porter's, where skirts, knee socks and sturdy brown shoes were once mandatory, has a similar nonpolicy for its girls. Says Sara Lapuk, dean of students: "At one point you weren't supposed to wear short-shorts into the dining room. We're pretty relaxed." 
 But while the preppies have gone native, many public schools are encouraging (and in some cases enforcing) no-frills dress codes to enhance self-esteem, eliminate expensive peer-group competition and discourage gang-related clothing. At the South Bronx Academy for Community Leadership, a public high school in New York, boys must wear white shirts with ties and navy or black trousers, girls white blouses with dark skirts or slacks. "We want their concentration to move away from what they're wearing to what they're learning," says Katherine Kelly, the principal, who adheres to the code herself.
There is an economic frill to all the pleated skirts and flannel trousers: at stores like J. C. Penney and Wal-Mart, generic uniforms are best sellers.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
American Hotels Report Big Upswing in Business

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
UNTIL the partial shutdown of the Government last month, causing furloughed employees and many others to tighten or eliminate their travel budgets, the nation's hotel industry was headed toward its strongest year in more than a decade. But even with that shutdown, and the possibility of another this month, analysts say the industry's vital signs look healthy for at least the rest of the decade. As a result, travelers would be wise to prepare for some changes, not all of them desirable.
While a strong hotel industry is in every traveler's long-range interest, to insure that lodging is available when and where needed, the short term may be another matter. Higher occupancy rates will likely mean that your favorite hotel may be sold out more often. When you do succeed in making a reservation, room rates will be higher. Checkout times are likely to be earlier and check-ins later. And you can expect more hotels to join Hyatt and Westin in imposing penalties if you check out one or more days ahead of schedule. 
 Even demographics are stacked against you: A recent lodging industry overview by Bankers Trust Research said that the nation's baby boomers, "the first generation to grow up regularly staying in hotels," will soon be entering their highest-income years, and their higher levels of spending on leisure time activities should translate into more vacations and more hotel stays.
But no one knows better than veteran hoteliers how quickly victory can turn to ashes. After the average occupancy rate hit a record 71.9 percent in 1979, it then fell for most of the next 12 years, tumbling to a low of 60.9 percent in 1991, according to an October report published by Bankers Trust Research. The industry also lost money for 11 consecutive years, before finally managing to break even in 1993.
While there were several reasons for that dismal performance, the main culprit was the laws that allowed if not encouraged hotels to be built as tax shelters. By the time the laws were amended in 1986, the nation was awash in hotel rooms, which could achieve even modest occupancies only by offering lower and lower room rates.
But last year the industry turned around dramatically, with occupancy rising to a 12-year high of 65 percent and profits rising to $5.5 billion, according to Smith Travel Research, which tracks hotel performance throughout the United States. The industry continued its resurgence this year, at least until the brief Government shutdown. Both the 72.7 percent occupancy rate during June, July and September, as well as the 4.7 percent gain in average room rate, were the highest of any third quarter since Smith began tracking such statistics in 1987.
Yet even before third quarter results were in, other industry analysts had noticed the rebound.
PKF Consulting, for example, estimated that occupancies will reach 70.2 percent by the end of this year, exceeding 70 percent for the first time since 1979, and will rise to 71.6 percent in 1996. It also estimated that next year hotels will achieve their highest profitability in 35 years. Coopers & Lybrand predicted a more modest occupancy increase, from 65.9 percent in 1995 to 67.2 percent in 1997. But it estimated that industry profits will rise from about $2,400 per available room this year to $3,500 in 1997.
This improvement is obvious to anyone has recently visited such cities as New York, Boston, Phoenix, Atlanta, Cleveland, San Francisco or Chicago. "No Vacancy" signs have been common at most of the better hotels, and at many of the also-rans.
At a recent reception for hotel executives, who were in New York for the annual International Hotel, Motel and Restaurant show, much of the talk was about New York's approximately 65,000 hotel rooms' being sold out for months on end, and about unlucky business travelers being shunted to hotels far from the city.
Jonathan Tisch, president of Loews Hotels, attributed New York hotels' performance to pent-up demand, a lower crime rate and other improvements in the quality of life, a weak dollar that has lured foreign visitors, and even the 1993 repeal of the 5 percent surtax on hotel rooms costing more than $100.
London hotels are also enjoying a robust fall, and bookings for spring are running ahead of last year's. The London Tourist Board recently said that at least 10,000 more beds will be needed in the next decade to augment the existing 60,000 rooms in order to satisfy the anticipated demand.
"London hotels are benefiting greatly because of increasing business travel from the rest of Europe," said Bob Denier, whose Dallas-based Hotel Reservations Network sells discount hotel rooms in most major cities in the United States, as well as London and Paris. "But Paris isn't doing as well," he added, "partly because of a weaker economy, terrorism, and boycotts by people angry at French nuclear tests in the Pacific."

HEADLINE: In Flower District, Ground Is Sown For Housing

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
WHEN the Adell family began assembling property around the Flower District for residential redevelopment, the current chairman of the City Planning Commission had not yet begun his career in government. Indeed, he was not yet out of fifth grade.
It has taken a long time -- a very long time -- for the Adells to acquire three large parcels on the Avenue of the Americas and win permission to build apartment towers there. They recently secured a rezoning of the avenue from 24th to 31st Street, changing it from a manufacturing district to a residential and commercial zone. And they were at last able to buy a key holdout parcel that had stymied their largest assemblage effort. 
 So now, after a quarter century, the Adells are ready to proceed with the project, a $250 million to $300 million undertaking: three buildings between 25th and 28th Streets, with a total of about 850 apartments and roughly 60,000 square feet of retail space. They informally call the project "Center Six," although someone once suggested to them that they call it "Flower Tower."
"It is not just housing but a new residential walk-to-work community in the middle of Manhattan," said Matthew G. Adell, president of the Adell Corporation and a partner in the development with his father, Leonard.
Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, who was in grade school when the Adell project began, said: "These are obvious development sites and they obviously don't work for manufacturing. It makes sense to have housing there and we have every confidence that housing, with mixed uses, is going to get built there."
Groundwork on the project has gone on for decades, but the final push came in the last two years, when the Adells co-applied for the rezoning with the City Planning Department, of which Mr. Rose is director. As a practical matter, that meant that the Adells picked up the $675,000 cost of an environmental-impact statement that considered the effect of the districtwide rezoning.
The Adells would not discuss specifically how much it cost for them to acquire and carry the property over this fallow period, although Matthew Adell said it was "fairly low" when considered against the development potential of nearly 800,000 square feet.
Nonetheless, he conceded, "most holding operations -- including ours -- have trouble surviving so long."
Although the rezoning clearly benefits the Adells first and foremost, Mr. Rose said there was a compelling reason to initiate the change, given the potential for housing development along the seven-and-a-half-block stretch of the avenue. "We believe there will be a market response," he said.
The Flower District is not the only industrial quarter in which housing may be on the horizon. Part of TriBeCa -- from Chambers to North Moore Street, Church to West Street -- was rezoned recently to allow the construction of new apartment buildings. Other manufacturing districts in which rezoning has been passed are Hunters Point, Queens and Charleston, Staten Island. It is also being contemplated in Port Morris in the Bronx and, in Brooklyn, the neighborhoods of Red Hook, Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Vinegar Hill.
"We are not trying to displace manufacturing from areas where it's thriving," Mr. Rose said. "The goal here is to acknowledge and nurture mixed-use neighborhoods, which are one of the things that makes living in New York City so attractive. There are environments where a strict segregation of uses doesn't make sense and isn't what people want. But that has taken a long time to embrace."
"Jane Jacobs is finally appreciated in her former hometown," he added, referring to her book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," published in 1961, which argued for an "intricately mingled" diversity of uses.
Diversity certainly characterizes the Avenue of the Americas between 23d and 31st Street, from the Korean import and export concerns at the north end, through the flower dealers clustered around 28th Street, to the sewing-machine companies in the lower 20's and the parking lots that play host to the enormous Annex Antiques Fair and Flea Market every weekend.
The district first came to life in 1870 when Bryant's Opera House opened on 23d Street. It was soon renamed Koster & Bial's Concert Hall and expanded to 24th Street, where it included a beer garden and four-story building that has survived to this day. (Its ornate pediment still reads, "The Corner / Koster & Bial.")
Also in 1870, the Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York laid the cornerstone for the Masonic Temple, a massive five-story granite structure on the northeast corner of 23d Street. The Masons remain on the property, in the 18-story Masonic Hall on 24th Street, completed in 1909, and a 19-story office building on 23d Street, completed in 1913.
AS the Masonic Temple opened in 1875, the six-story Racquet Court Club was under construction on the northeast corner of 26th Street, to designs by Alfred H. Thorp. The clubhouse, distinguished by its monumental arched windows and fine brickwork, had two courts, a gymnasium, a running track, weight and rowing machines, sparring and fencing rooms, billiard tables and a bowling alley.
After the Sixth Avenue el was constructed in 1878, there was almost no further substantive development along the avenue itself. But the district gained nationwide notoriety as the heart of the "Tenderloin," where prostitution, gambling, robbery and corruption flourished.
Industrial uses came to predominate in the early 20th century: wholesale flower dealers, furriers, sewing-machine companies, printers, chocolate factories and an electrical substation. The Racquet Club moved to West 43d Street in 1891 before it settled into its current home on Park Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets. Its former Sixth Avenue building was purchased by Harriet G. Coogan and turned into office, warehouse and factory space.
By the 1930's, millions of flowers were being sold around Sixth Avenue and 28th Street, including 500,000 Easter lilies from Bermuda and 30,000 tulips from Holland. One dealer who got his start at this time was Vasilios Koutsonikolis, who opened in 1936. That business is continued today as Bill's Flower Market, at the corner of 28th Street, which is run by his grandsons, Bill and Jim Nikolis.
The el came down in 1939 but little went up; only a six-story office building at 30th Street, built in 1949. The district was given an M1-6 zoning designation, which prohibited residential development but permitted the construction of high-density loft buildings for light manufacturing or commercial uses, with a floor-area ratio of 10. (That is, the owner of a 25,000-square-foot lot could build a 250,000 square-foot building).
Nothing happened. When older structures were razed, they were replaced with parking lots. One of those lots, between 25th and 26th Streets, was transformed in the mid-60's into a flea market by Nathan H. Mager, who had been director of the National Antiques Show at the old Madison Square Garden. His market operated on Sundays only, about 12 times a year. On other days, much of the avenue frontage was an asphalt wasteland.
Gazing out at this landscape from an office at 875 Avenue of the Americas, Leonard Adell began hatching an ambitious plan.
Mr. Adell had been in the men's clothing business until 1963, when he decided to try his hand at real estate. Over the years, he acquired office buildings in downtown Brooklyn, apartment buildings in New Jersey and retail space in Canarsie, Brooklyn and New Hyde Park, L.I.
But it was the view out his 31st Street window that compelled him. "I looked down at all this land right smack in the middle of Manhattan and nobody was doing anything with it," Mr. Adell recalled. "Yet, I thought it was viable. It had infrastructure, transportation and visibility."
In 1970, Mr. Adell acquired 799 and 801 Avenue of the Americas. "Then, everyone thought they had oil under their land," he said. "I got stymied. I couldn't do anything more on that side of the street." The assemblage proceeded painstakingly: a third parcel in 1970, a fourth parcel in 1971, two more parcels in 1972, another two in 1978, three more in 1979, and so on.
Meanwhile, the flea market was growing. Alan Boss, who operated a market in Brooklyn, was living in a loft near 24th Street. He watched people line up and set up for Mr. Mager's market and decided he ought to try his luck in Manhattan. In 1975, Mr. Boss opened his own market in the lot between 24th and 25th Streets and expanded two years later to the lot where Mr. Mager had operated.
In 1979, the Adells felt the time had come to approach the City Planning Department about changing the manufacturing zoning in the district. "It was very simple in the beginning," Matthew Adell remembered. "They said, 'No.' There was clearly a push for manufacturing retention."
AFTER years of discussion, the first formal rezoning effort came in 1985, when the City Planning Department proposed a manufacturing district in which residential units would have been permitted. The floor-area ratio would have been increased to 12, meaning that the owner of a 25,000-square-foot parcel would have been allowed to construct a building with 300,000 square feet of floor space. Up to half the floor area could be used for apartments.
There was also a proposal to reward developers for industrial retention with an additional 20 percent zoning bonus. "One reason it took so long," Mr. Rose said, "was a whole host of attempts to micro-overmanage the development process, with market-rate housing subsidizing the rents of new manufacturing activity. It was not realistic. It was too complex."
A further complication arose in October 1989 when the Coogan Building, which the Adells had purchased, was designated a landmark. The Landmarks Preservation Commission called it a "forerunner of the skyscraper type" and "one of the oldest surviving club buildings in Manhattan."
Two months later, however, in a rare move, the Board of Estimate overturned the designation. Borough President David N. Dinkins of Manhattan, who was by then Mayor-elect, said in a statement: "The economic realities make it unlikely that an owner would invest the capital dollars that a historic restoration would require. Nor do we believe that the Coogan Building has a major design impact on its surroundings."
The Adells' lawyer, Samuel H. Lindenbaum of Rosenman & Colin, said at the time that the reversal of the designation "opens up an opportunity to go forward with the proposal to rezone Sixth Avenue."
As it finally emerged, the rezoning changes the district from M1-6 to a category known as C6-4X, a high-density commercial and residential designation in which manufacturing is not allowed. The floor-area ratio remains at 10, although a developer can get a 20 percent bonus for providing lower-income housing elsewhere.
The zoning requires that buildings have large bases, 60 to 85 feet high (six to eight stories), before they set back into more slender towers. "It encourages street walls, which has a great advantage for retail," said the Adells' architect, Costas Kondylis, of Costas Kondylis & Associates. "Retail that's set back from the property line is always at a disadvantage."
Large bases are seen as a disadvantage by residential developers, since they dictate potentially awkward layouts. But Mr. Kondylis said the new zoning allowed for recesses in which bedrooms could be set, while living rooms would get corner windows. "It's not as bad as we thought it would be," he said.
According to the environmental-impact statement, the Adells' site on the west side of the avenue, between 25th and 26th Streets, would yield a 196,800-square-foot building with 212 apartments. Their site on the east side, between 27th and 28th Streets, would yield a 225,600 square-foot building with 244 apartments.
THE Coogan Building site, on the east side, between 26th and 27th Streets, would yield a 365,280-square-foot building, with 394 apartments, now that the Adells have purchased a holdout property at No. 786.
Matthew Adell said that "the chances are we will do more than one at a time, to create more of an impact." He said the development would take advantage of the "80-20" program, in which 80 percent of the units would be rented at market rates and 20 percent would be subsidized and made available to tenants whose annual income was less than half the median income for New York City. In return for this benefit, the project can be financed through the sale of bonds by the New York State Housing Finance Agency, interest on which is exempt from city, state and Federal taxes.
Mr. Adell said potential private financing sources included life insurance and pension funds, even commercial banks. He said there was a possibility that a partner would be brought in for a joint venture.
"Our goal is to move as quickly as we can," Mr. Adell said. Should all go according to schedule from here on in, the project might start by the end of next year and be completed in mid-1998.
His father, Leonard, added simply, "We want to change the character of the neighborhood."
Actually, the most prominent undeveloped site in the neighborhood, a parking lot at the southeast corner of 23d Street, is outside the rezoned district and owned by the Manocherian family.
The Manocherians have had discussions with the City Planning Department and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, as the site is within the Ladies Mile Historic District. "We've made substantial progress in setting design parameters," said their lawyer, Paul D. Selver of Battle Fowler.
Several other development sites are identified in the environmental-impact statement. The largest is a parking lot between 24th and 25th Streets, which could theoretically accommodate a 302,400-square-foot building with 327 apartments. The owner of the lot is identified in public records as Sexton Realty. Several telephone calls to that office were not returned.
Only a bit smaller is the parking lot between 25th and 26th Streets, which could accommodate a building with 298,800 square feet of space and 322 apartments. The owner, Alan N. Locker, said he did not want to comment.
Another potential development site is the parking lot on the southeast corner of 24th Street, which is owned by the Trustees of the Masonic Hall and Asylum Fund. The comptroller, Craig Hazan, said that he could not reach any Masonic official who would be able to comment.
THE rezoning won the conditional approval of Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, as well as Community Board 4, whose district includes the west side of the Avenue of the Americas, and Community Board 5, whose district includes the east side.
Ms. Messinger's report to the City Planning Commission said she supported the rezoning because it would allow for the development of "critically needed" housing in "an area that is under-built given its location and excellent transit access."
However, she also noted drawbacks to the plan, as did the community boards and a residents' group called the Concerned Citizens for the Sixth Avenue Corridor, which urged that the area's historic fabric be recognized.
Mid-block businesses serving the nearby garment industry might be displaced as a result of new development pressures, Ms. Messinger said, which "may have a ripple effect, adversely impacting the industry as a whole."
"The growing flower market and antiques district are also vital industries that will be threatened by displacement pressures," the Borough President warned.
Mr. Boss said the rezoning made him "uncomfortable." The Annex markets now operate on four parking lots and in a parking garage, drawing 10,000 to 15,000 shoppers every weekend, according to Mr. Boss. He is also planning to open a greenmarket next spring on a fifth lot. A task force was set up last month to explore how the market can be retained in the area. Mr. Boss said he believed the market's visibility and economic value benefited the neighborhood.
Bill Nikolis estimated that the flower market had shrunk by a third or even half in the last decade, but he added that the decline may be slowing. "There seems to be a bottom line we've hit where we keep hold against further shrinkage," he said. "Its makeup has changed dramatically. There's more diversity in the types of products being offered. We have to diversify to stay alive."
"Economic patterns will dictate how rapidly zoning changes will affect the area," Mr. Nikolis said. "I see both sides of the argument and I'm caught in the middle, being in the flower business and also a real estate owner."
If the Flower Towers are ever built, Mr. Nikolis said he would miss the sense of openness in the district. "We get a lot of light," he said. "It's very uplifting to work in this area. You're not shadowed in. Then again, the business of the city is business. And changes do occur."

HEADLINE: Habitats: South Kensington;
London: Some Different Rules in the Housing Game

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THEY are expatriate Americans, or, as they call themselves, "expats," a young married couple who have lived all over the Middle East -- in Syria, Yemen and Jordan. They have have now traded in their foreign-service postings for a small but glossily elegant two-bedroom apartment in South Kensington, the section of London real estate agents here call "the American ghetto."
Two years ago, C. David Parker accepted an "offer that was too good to refuse" from Merrill Lynch, covering the Middle East for its private-banking division here. Denise Parker found a job with a relocation service, finding housing for other expatriates. These "expats," especially Americans, are numerous: A spokeswoman for Knight, Frank & Rutley, an international real estate firm based in London, estimated that one-third of all apartment rentals in London go to Americans. 
 According to Mrs. Parker, finding an apartment in London -- to rent or to buy -- is a daunting task. As in New York City, there is no official multiple listing system, "so what you have to do is call hundreds of agents." ("New York and London -- the two places that probably need it the most," Mr. Parker added.)
But in London, there is also a perfectly legal, but extremely frustrating, practice called "gazumping."
In New York City, when a renter finds an apartment, contracts are generally signed immediately, contingent on a credit and reference check.
But in London, the contract is the last thing, and according to Mrs. Parker and several others who have lived in London, the landlord delays as long as possible to pounce on a higher or better offer.
Especially when buying a flat, the prospective purchasers may spend a great deal of money in mortgage applications, legal fees and a structural survey and then get "gazumped" out of the deal. In London, according to Mr. Parker, owners will not accept contracts with contingencies -- even a mortgage contingency.
"A friend got gazumped," said Mrs. Parker, "and usually you can at least sell your survey to the new buyers, but in her case it all happened so quickly, she couldn't. She was put off; it left a bad taste in her mouth."
Because she had lived in London for two years when she was a student, Mrs. Parker vowed she would not be gazumped. She had an edge: She was ready to go to contract immediately.
But she had one real problem: They were moving to London on Dec. 28, and they only had about a week to find something because their furniture was arriving -- momentarily.
"It's not like in the States," said Mr. Parker, "where Christmas is a half day off before and a day off after. It's a reasonably quiet time in the States -- but here it's like a neutron bomb went off; all the buildings are left standing, but there are no people."
The furniture created several problems. First, most apartments are rented, or let, as it is called here, furnished -- partly due to tradition and partly to a law passed by the Labor Party that resulted in the supposition that if a tenant installed his own furniture in an apartment it would be much more difficult to evict him. That law was repealed in the early 90's, but the tradition continues.
But the Parkers wanted their own furniture -- and it was big furniture: a four-poster bed, a highboy, a wide multidrawered dresser and a well-padded queen-sized sofa bed.
This created an additional problem because the rooms in most London apartments are smaller than in American apartments -- even New York City apartments. (In London, queen- and king-sized beds are manufactured so the long side rails break apart in the middle.)
"We'd walk in and just look at the staircase and shake our heads," said Mrs. Parker.
The Parkers saw 30 apartments in a few days, in South Kensington and Chelsea and Fulham, the nicest part of Earl's Court -- even in Islington, which has become popular with stock traders because it's a direct subway shot south to The City, London's financial district.
THEY found the raised ground-floor apartment -- what New Yorkers would call the first floor -- about midblock at 32 Cranley Gardens, a floor-through apartment in a period house with a bay window that overlooks one of London's private-garden squares.
They were tough negotiators -- expertise gained from their experience in the East, they say -- and negotiated a rent somewhere between 500 and 600 a week, or about $3,200 to $3,800 a month, an amount Mr. Parker called "shockingly expensive." Although some expats' rents are paid by their employers, the Parkers pay their rent themselves.
"If the job is considered a temporary assignment, the employer often pays the rent," explained Mr. Parker, a pleasant-looking young man with a shock of dark brown hair. "But my job is considered permanent: at least five years."
Arriving in London, the Parkers found a boom in the rental market, similar to New York City's.
"England lagged a year or two behind America in the tremendous deflation in real estate; it hit London in 1991," he said. But just like Manhattan, that didn't stop the influx of new residents. Worried about buying an apartment in a market that was still going down, the newcomers decided to rent -- en masse. That drove the rental market up, in both cities.
"People are buying rental buildings for investment," Mr. Parker said. "This flat is owned by a Danish company."
Although the apartment was essentially unfurnished, it nevertheless came with elaborate chintz draperies. And just before the Parkers moved in, the owner had completely refurbished the place: Laura Ashley wallpaper and borders and new paint and shiny reeded brass knobs and a renovated kitchen that contains London's standard-size refrigerator: a tiny, under-counter unit that Mrs. Parker opens and laughs about.
But despite the small refrigerator, the apartment is finished to a very high standard -- higher, the Parkers say, than a comparable rental in the States.
"To equip a rental, they go to Colefax and Fowler, to Laura Ashley," said Mrs. Parker, who views rental apartments every day as part of her job, at Karen Deane Relocations. "There was one 1,100 rental where the owner had a tapestry on the wall that was worth thousands. For him, it was just an investment, not a home, and he's off to Hong Kong."
According to Diana Busk, manager of the American Agency, a real estate company that caters to Americans moving to London, the demands of the Americans -- for better water pressure and what Londoners call "power showers" -- and for elegant bathrooms and larger kitchens have raised the standards of landlords.
"Americans want closet space, they want water pressure, they want a microwave -- but that's considered a luxury, not standard," Ms. Busk said. "They also want to see wood floors, and that was a real change; we usually cover our floors with carpet."
"A lot of bathrooms are carpeted," she continued, "and that's the first thing the Americans ask for: for the floors to be tiled."
PRETTY soon, the Parkers say, they will be looking again -- this time, for a place to buy. They've been here almost two years, and at the end of next year, certain tax advantages to renting run out.
"We're looking in the same area," said Mr. Parker, "but we'd like a bigger reception area, a proper-sized second bedroom, a larger kitchen -- and maybe a study."
The Parkers didn't say it, but according to Ms. Busk from the American Agency, that kind of apartment easily could cost 350,000 -- over $500,000.

HEADLINE: Why the Librarian Stays Right in Style

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
IN the age of the Internet and the World Wide Web, when terms like the information superhighway are almost as passe as information explosion, one venerable source of information just keeps going and going: the public library.
And reference librarians at some of the state's biggest institutions report that despite the new marvels of the electronic age, they have not detected any decrease in calls from people seeking out information on a variety of topics ranging from the mundane to . . . well, the the weird. 
 In the latter category, the folks in the reference room at Hartford Public Library still talk about the woman who called about the snake in her oven. She said she had a stove on the back porch and when she looked inside the oven she saw the snake. She closed the oven, quickly. She didn't know what kind of snake it was, and she didn't want to hurt it. All she wanted was to get it out of the oven.
The reference people scurried for a clue on enticing a snake out of an oven. Aha! In a children's book, it was mentioned that snakes are partial to raw eggs. The librarians suggested that the woman dribble raw egg from the oven to the end of the porch, then open the oven door with a broom handle and see if the snake would take the bait, eating its way to the yard.
They assume the method worked. In any case, they did not hear back from the woman.
In contrast to this one, most questions are relatively prosaic, can be answered quickly, and then are forgotten. But no matter what the question, all calls are treated with respect, said Carol Fitting, head of T.I.S. (that's Telephone Information Service) at the Hartford library.
"Most people have a serious reason for calling," she said. "They need information and don't know where else to get it. We regard every question as serious."
And some are more serious than others. "One call we get, but rarely, is when a pet or child has ingested something that may be poisonous," said Ms. Fitting. "We give the number of the Poison Control Center and say to dial it immediately. And we feel sorry about people who call up for information on diseases."
In fact, quick information services at bigger libraries, have always been part social agencies, affording people a real link to often impersonal cities. And there seems to be no immediate prospect that that role will diminish. As cities get poorer and poorer, the number of people who can afford computers to go surfing through the Internet gets proportionally smaller and smaller. "We're the last resort for people who do not have access to computers," said Ms. Fitting. "We're always here."
Some things in the questioning line never change. Thirty years ago, and this year, too, one of the leading questions is what were the seven wonders of the ancient world. "I'm probably the only person in creation who can rattle them off without thinking," Ms. Fitting said. (The seven wonders, one more time, are the Colossus of Rhodes, the Pharos lighthouse at Alexandria, the hanging gardens of Babylon, the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, the pyramids of Egypt, the tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the statue of Zeus at Olympia.)
The other hardy perennial among questions is when does the time change from daylight saving to standard, or vice versa. Twice a year, the phones ring off the hook.
The Hartford Public Library was one of the pioneers in the nation in establishing a separate telephone information line. The date was June 14, 1965, and Ms. Fitting, who had just gone to work for the library, was given the job of running it. Thirty years later, she is still running it, using other librarians to help her staff the phones. On Aug. 10 of this year, T.I.S. observed a real milestone: the 50 millionth question answered over the phone.
As the makeup of the city has changed, so too has the makeup of the library and its telephone service. Hartford's main ethnic group is now Hispanic, so at the library there are now several people on the staff who speak Spanish.
When the telephone service started, and for most of the three decades since, nearly all of the answers came out of books: general reference books, city directories, books on laws, books on folk practices, books on dates in history -- and, of course, telephone books. More recently, the research librarian may be more apt to hit a few symbols on a keyboard than go rummaging through the stacks.
"We're hooking into the Internet right now," said Vera Skop, head of the reference department at Greenwich Library. "We're learning to be techies."
As Hartford reflects its population by many of the questions directed at its library, such as where to find social services and medical help, so too does Greenwich reflect its population with questions about mutual funds or the relative rank of big corporations.
But affluent Greenwich, the nation's richest community in per capita income, has also been hard hit by the economic distress of this decade. Executives with six-figure salaries have been some of the casualties.
So on any given day, a call to the library might be from a woman planning her daughter's wedding; what does the Old Farmer's Almanac predict for weather on a particular day several months hence? But the next call might be for information on some major corporations by a former executive who is now out of a job.
The calls of economic distress have decreased a little recently, Ms. Skop said, as the economy seems to be recovering somewhat. "But it has been a tough time for a lot of people here," she said.
About a quarter of her library's incoming calls are referred to the children's room. Some are from teachers, getting background on, say, a dinosaur project. Some are from youngsters, planning the dinosaur project. And some, said Ms. Skop, are from "home schoolers," youngsters whose parents elect to educate them at home. There are a lot of them in Greenwich, she said.
Telephone information services at the public libraries in New Haven and Bridgeport were hard hit by Connecticut's recession, but are now recovering, research librarians in both cities say.
In New Haven, hours at the Free Library were cut back to 24 a week in 1990, but with more financial support from the city in the past two years, it is now open 53 hours a week.
It might be supposed that Yale would be the source of calls for information at the New Haven library. But that is not the case, according to Valeria Haines, head of public services at the library.
The reason is that the university has so many of its own excellent reference resources, she said. Consequently, the people who use the city library are mostly from the community outside Yale and their questions reflect that community. "They want more basic information, a large part of it consumer information," Ms. Haines said. "We get a lot of questions about tenants' rights, and medical kinds of questions, about laser liposuction and melantonin, about the side effects of drugs."
And if Yale students don't call the library much, public school students certainly do. "We always know when term papers are due," Ms. Haines said, "about the American Revolution, about Martin Luther King. The kids ask the same questions." She said the librarians will give the budding term-paper writers basic information like dates but won't do their homework for them. "We tell them to come in so we can teach them how to use the library."
Eighteen miles from the New Haven Free Public Library, the Bridgeport Public Library has also endured major cutbacks. In 1990, when it appeared that the city actually might go into bankruptcy, the hours of the library were reduced to 20 a week.
Like its counterpart in New Haven, however, it has received more money to operate in the last few years and is now open 48 hours a week, spread over five days.
In the past several months the telephone calls for information have reflected the main interest, if not the fixation, of many of city residents: gambling.
Bridgeport had been earmarked by Gov. John G. Rowland for a big gambling casino to be run by the Mashantucket Pequots, as the way to pump new economic life into the impoverished city. Where were the casinos, callers asked. How successful were they? What did the national press say about them? Judging from the calls, "Just about everyone in Bridgeport was a supporter of a casino," said Anne Maio, the head of reference services at the library.
On Nov. 17, however, despite the zealousness of Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim and other city officials, despite busloads of Bridgeport residents who went to the state capital in Hartford to lend support, despite Governor Rowland's pushing, the State Senate, in a 24-10 vote said no, Bridgeport was not going to get a casino. One of the minor ripples from the vote: calls about gambling ceased at the the city library.
But life goes on, and there are other questions. All sorts of questions about other countries, about animals, museums, state capitals, ethnic breakdowns, anything that anyone wants to call about. And sometimes the little questions, the ones that should be easy to answer, drive research librarians crazy, said Ms. Maio.
Like the one the other day. Someone wanted to get a telephone number for Ellis Island. What could be more simple than that?
Most questions, it developed, could be more simple. The research librarian started with the New York phone books. No address or telephone number listed for Ellis Island. "There was no address on the Internet, or museum directories," Ms. Maio added. It was bizarre. The Federal Government spent a fortune to create a museum of immigration on Ellis Island. There had to be a phone number somewhere.
'We finally found one, in a guide book," said Ms. Maio. "Would you believe that!"

HEADLINE: College President Discusses Arts Cuts

 BODY:
I read "Arts Cut at Old Westbury Revives a Battle" [Dec. 3] with interest. The reporter had called me at least twice to respond to the allegations contained in the article. As both our public relations staff and the academic vice president for academic affairs had discussed the allegations with her at length, there did not seem to be a reason for me to repeat the same concepts.
None of what the public relations officer said was printed, and very little of what the vice president for academic affairs said is printed. Why? 
 Your reporter apparently spent a great deal of time on the campus interviewing faculty and students. Unfortunately while on campus she did not make the effort to interview administration, nor did she inform the administration that she was on campus. She could have received additional information if she had chosen to visit relevant administrators.
There are many errors and unsupported allegations in the article.
The retrenchment of the American music theater and dance program is not related to the 1995-96 operational budget for the campus of $18.2 million. Our original budget for the 1995-96 year was $19.4 million.
After the SUNY budget was passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor, it became clear that all SUNY campuses would have budget cuts. Our cut was $1.2 million, leaving us with $18.2 million. Since that cut we have experienced a midyear cut of $190,000 and will also pay $150,000 back to the system because of an enrollment shortfall in 1993.
The funds that will be saved by the retrenchment of the program will amount to about $350,000 for salaries for the 1996-97 budget year, not the 1995-96 year. However that latter figure does not include the costs of new instruments nor the repair of old ones. Nor does it include maintenance costs for the facilities.
In the past 10 years I have authorized the purchase of two sets of instruments for the program. Most of those instruments are no longer at the college, and to support the program it would be necessary to make another purchase.
Thus the total costs would amount to at least $500,000 for 20 students. In addition, the program had already been identified by analyses from SUNY central as a high-cost low-enrollment program, and the college was asked to consider whether it could defend its continuance.
We have also proposed cutting two other programs, a French certificate program and an economics program. In fact, most SUNY campuses have proposed program cuts.
Why is Old Westbury being singled out for news? Why not the other SUNY campuses on Long Island?
There is no "racial" line in the retrenchment process. The article compares actions taken by a past president, who happened to have been a white male, to me as an African-American female. Is there some real purpose in this type of comparison? Does the reporter suggest that race should be a factor in making program cuts to achieve fiscal viability? Such reporting is at best misleading and at worst an attempt to create news based on race than on administrative decisions.
My doctorate degree, achieved in 1966, is in psychology, not in music education. I hold a bachelor of music degree, with a major in piano and a minor in organ. As an undergraduate student, I often played jazz on the organ at dances to add to my income to achieve my educational goals.
The SUNY officials did not order me in 1993 to rescind the retrenchment action taken at that time. Such was done on my initiative, once the program agreed to develop a proposal that would allow them to offer a registered-degree program. The program was not a registered-degree program at that time.
The proposal had to be approved by SUNY and the State Board of Education before I rescinded the retrenchment. The program was approved in the fall of 1994. However enrollment has continued to decline, and graduates have also declined.
According to Article 35 of the 1991-1995 U.U.P. contract with SUNY, U.U.P. members who are to be retrenched must be given a year's notice. Thus the retrenchment will begin in the fall of 1996.
Prof. Richard Harper's reported assertion that I am "no jazz fan" is not relevant to the administrative decision that has been made. It was I who brought the Long Island Jazz to the campus as visiting artists. References to whether or not I like jazz merely divert attention from the administrative aspects of the decision.
The recommendation to retrench the program has been made to me twice in the last three years by two different vice presidents for academic affairs, using relevant data about program cost, enrollment, graduation rates, entry into graduate school and the development of performance groups on the campus. These two senior officers reached the same decision independent of each other.
The issues raised by Prof. Maureen Dolan about the college's Budget Planning Committee suggests that I have stopped the process. In fact I only canceled one meeting because of time needed to review the Faculty Strategic Planning Report. No SUNY budget for 1967-97 had been developed, and because the report of the SUNY board of trustees to the Governor and the Legislature due on Dec. 1 had not been completed, there was no fiscal-policy context nor recommendations from the board within which we might review such a report.
Since the trustees' report has now been sent to the Governor, I have instructed the chair of the Budget Planning Committee to schedule meetings for the committee and to review the Strategic Planning Report within the context of the trustees' report.
The SUNY board of trustees did not and have not requested a multiyear report from all campuses by the end of October 1995.
The general administrative costs of the college amount to 8.1 percent of the total operating budget, not 11 percent. Several administrators who are not part of general administration were included in the original dollar amount. SUNY Old Westbury has the smallest number of general administrators of all of the university colleges.
The trip to China was to conduct a workshop at the Fourth U.N. Conference on Women in Beijing. Three Old Westbury faculty were part of the workshop, along with three other participants. The entire trip was supported by donated external funds.
SUNY would not have paid for such an activity, nor would I ever have considered asking the university to pay for the trip.
The trip to South Africa was part of my responsibilities as chair of SUNY's Commission on Africa and was conducted to assess the possibility of academic interaction between SUNY campuses and institutions of higher education in South Africa. I have responded to students on those issues several times.
The college did support theater students to attend a theater festival at Buffalo last year. They received accolades for their performances. No request for this years has been received by me.

Downsize, They Ordered. No Way, He Said.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
THE FACT that those people lost their jobs, that was my responsibility," said Raymond E. McCreary, businessman.
Say what? The Dow's been blazing a blue streak. Corporate profits are up, and downsizing is why. Last month, while the Moet corks popped on Wall Street, another batch of premier companies on this side of the Hudson got into fighting trim, laying off thousands of those cumbersome employees: Prudential in Newark, AT&T in Basking Ridge, Midlantic in Edison and West Paterson. 
 But here we have some guy in a leased factory the size of a high school gym, beside the railroad tracks in Clifton, talking about corporate responsibility -- and putting his money where his mouth is.
The other day, Mr. McCreary was puttering around his used steel-punch presses and heat sealers, preparing to restart production in a business that was downsized last summer, when its corporate owners, Willert Home Products, consolidated operations in St. Louis and dumped 50 workers in New Jersey.
Mr. McCreary, who is 46 years old and lives in Hackensack, had been vice president for production at Excell Products in Clifton, which Willert purchased in 1993.
In the six years he ran the factory, costs dropped and sales rose. Last June, when Willert decided to shut down manufacturing in Clifton, the company offered Mr. McCreary a vice presidency at its headquarters.
He looked at his co-workers and said no thanks.
"These employees are good people," Mr. McCreary explained. "They worked hard. We were able to cut production costs by a third before the owners closed down the company. They shouldn't be just left out in the cold."
So he spent the summer running the numbers for a business plan, and put together $500,000 from personal savings and bank loans to go back into business in Clifton.
He figured the chances for succeeding were a little better than 50-50. His wife of 21 years urged him to do go for it. "I know it's going to work," Susan McCreary, a retail executive, said firmly.
Five months later, Mr. McCreary's new company, Paragon Household Products, plans to start production this week. Some of the former employees are already back at work for Mr. McCreary, who has an engineering degree, two M.B.A.'s, years of corporate background in joint ventures and mergers -- and few illusions about business.
"I've worked for large corporations and I know what the hard realities are," he said in his austere office, which has some Japanese prints on the wall and overlooks a row of old warehouses. "Sentimentality is nice, but not when you have close to a half-million dollars at stake.
"We're not producing anything anymore in this country," he went on. "I just want to make something, as dumb as these products might sound."
Mr. McCreary's products are second-wave enough to give Newt Gingrich and the Tofflers a case of the vapors. Under the brand name Common Scents, Paragon will make mothballs and hook-on toilet-bowl, urinal and room deodorizers, all pressed out of powdered paradichlorobenzene, a far less dangerous substance than the naphthalene traditionally used.
Willert, his former company, controls about 95 percent of the national market for mothballs and toilet deodorizers.
Paragon now has six employees, including two foremen, Ramon and Fausto Rodriguez, who worked at the old company for 14 years. "It's very good to have the job," said Ramon Rodriguez, who supervises shipping. The Rodriguez brothers each earn $12 to $13 an hour -- which incidentally is the figure that some economists say edges a worker into the middle class.
Next month, Mr. McCreary said, there will be 12 employees, many of them rehired from the former company. By April, Mr. McCreary expects to employ as many as 25.
Unglamorous as it sounds, mothballs and toilet deodorizers is a cut-throat business played by Wal-Mart rules, where an intruder who appears on the big boys' radar screens can get blown out of the sky with a blast of predatory price-cutting.
Mr. McCreary intends to fly in low, using short distribution routes and quick deliveries to small stores and bodegas, and a few regional supermarket chains, in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and the fringes of New England.
Later, after Paragon finds its niche, he figures some product innovation might be in order.
"Household products is a funny category," he said. "You know, that one little aisle in the supermarket that nobody likes to go down?"
The aisle where they sell not just mothballs and deodorizers, but "brooms, mops, dust-pans, scrub brushes, drain cleaners, rust removers . . . ."
He thought for a minute. "Mousetraps," he said, wondering about the prospects of building a better one.

AT&T Offer: One Said No, One Said Yes

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

DATELINE: NEW VERNON, N.J.

 BODY:
JIM BOWERS wraps the ham, roast beef and cheese left over from lunch and talks about why he is refusing the voluntary severance package AT&T offered him last month.
Even though he may be "involuntarily separated" from his middle-management job as early as next month, it doesn't make sense for him to take the risk, said Mr. Bowers, who at 48 has spent 13 years at AT&T. For him, the buyout offer is not much higher than severance would be. Besides, he and his wife, Judith, do not want to uproot their teen-age daughter, Alaire, a talented flutist and a member of the New Jersey Youth Orchestra. Given the poor New Jersey job market, a move would be likely. 
 "I think AT&T is going to need me," said Mr. Bowers, in the house he helped design and build near AT&T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.. "But there's not a single person AT&T couldn't do without. I'd have to be a fool to say I wasn't worried."
An hour and a half's drive and a life's experience away in Manhattan, Clare Powell sits perched on a cardboard moving-company box and talks about why she accepted AT&T's buyout offer. She is about to move to Connecticut to a new job as a sports marketing consultant. Her last day at AT&T is Jan. 10.
"You don't just walk away from a company that you have a very deep emotional attachment to," said Ms. Powell, who is 35 and single. "But I think I'm a better employee if I have one foot out the door. It keeps you from being complacent."
She added: "You always read about another company laying people off and you have to be cognizant that you could be next. It's a useful paranoia."
Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell are two of the more than 72,000 employees --half of AT&T's managers -- offered the voluntary severance package. Like other big companies, AT&T uses such packages -- a combination of cash, pension sweeteners and other incentives -- to avoid the cheaper but more demoralizing method of summary dismissal. Only about 300 employees have volunteered, and if not enough employees step forward, dismissals will be necessary as early as Jan. 15. And there is no guarantee that the shrinkage will stop there.
What is unusual about the AT&T plan is not only the number of employees involved, but also the fact that even those who stay will face almost permanent uncertainty. It used to be that cutbacks were painful surgery that employees could soon put behind them. Now the blade is never far away.
The buyout offer follows the September announcement that AT&T plans to break up into three less-gargantuan pieces: a long-distance telephone company, an equipment company and a computer maker.
And everyone at the new companies could be "at risk," the company euphemism for subject to layoff, if not now, then a year or 10 years from now. It is a stark reversal of the monopoly days, when AT&T was the biggest company on earth and a job there could mean a lifetime assignment and a fat pension.
"It's almost as tough to be a survivor as someone who has been asked to leave," said John Derse Jr., a partner at Ernst & Young who is an employee benefits consultant. "People are having the hell scared out of them."
ALAN JOHNSON, head of Johnson Associates, another benefits consultant, said: "For people who don't take the buyout and retain their jobs, it should be a wake-up call. You need to keep your skill sets in line with the needs of your industry, or else."
He added that many people, especially professionals, neglect to consider the bleakest possibility in industries in the turmoil of retrenchment. "No matter what you do," Mr. Johnson said, "you may have no future whatsoever."
And Jim L. Meadows, AT&T's human resources vice president in charge of "career placement alternatives," said: "There is no magic number" of employees at which AT&T would stop reassessing its staffing needs. "I don't think there is an answer to the question, 'When does this process stop?' Business changes. The world changes."
Like many other companies, AT&T has been steadily paring the number of employees to cut costs. But unlike other companies, AT&T is doing so not because it is losing money -- it is expected to post a profit of $5.6 billion this year -- but because it is trying to escape its bloated past.
AT&T, with more than $75 billion in annual revenue, has cut an average of nearly 900 employees, about the size of a medium-sized business, every month for the 12 years since the 1984 breakup accord that created AT&T and the seven regional Bells, like Nynex and Bell Atlantic. That comes to 126,000 jobs.
AT&T is the largest profitable company to choose a more or less permanent state of revolution, in which it may rapidly add jobs, either piecemeal or through acquisitions, and years later just as rapidly shed jobs in a gigantic, nerve-jangling (for employees, at least) work in progress.
For Jim Bowers and Clare Powell, the big picture was the furthest thing from their minds on Sept. 20, a Wednesday, when AT&T announced what employees call the "trivestiture." Both Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell had similar reactions and took a similar length of time to realize the personal consequences.
Mr. Bowers is a product manager in charge of software for giant telephone networks, like one that helps maintenance workers pinpoint faults in transmission. He remembers hearing the announcement by AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, on his car radio while on his way to visit a corporate customer.
As a senior marketer, Mr. Bowers had had trouble selling products to local phone companies like Nynex because AT&T's long-distance branch is a likely competitor when the local phone market is opened to competition, much as long distance was in the 1980's. The competition can only become more intense as cable companies like Time Warner also offer telephone service.
The trivestiture "really is in the best interests of the company," Mr. Bowers said. "It's better to be the arms merchant for all the warring parties than trying to sell ammo to someone who says, 'Hey, you're my enemy.' "
Ms. Powell is corporate event marketing director in the Manhattan office of AT&T. She helps organize events like the AT&T Pro-Am Pebble Beach golf tournament, as well as sponsorship of shows and institutions like Cirque du Soleil and the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame.
Ms. Powell's boss warned her to cancel all appointments that Wednesday morning in anticipation of an important announcement from Mr. Allen. Ms. Powell watched the announcement on her office television set and thought to herself, "What a brilliant, smart, smart decision." Trivestiture, she said, made AT&T much more competitive.
Both Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell were in a bit of a daze after the announcement, and both had so much work that they plunged into it, hoping to avoid thinking about the effect on their jobs.
When Ms. Powell told her parents the news, her father, David Powell, a recently retired public relations executive at Allied Signal, recalled asking, "Where are you going to get assigned, Clare?"
What he really meant, Mr. Powell said, is, "Are you going to have a job?" Ms. Powell said she didn't know where she would be assigned.
Whatever affection Ms. Powell felt for AT&T ("It's like my family"), she thought it only prudent to update her resume and return the phone calls of executive recruiters.
An economics graduate of Hamilton College, Ms. Powell abandoned what she thought was a possible career as a stockbroker or money manager for a much more tenuous career in marketing.
She had worked her way up from a temporary position in 1985 to a job organizing corporate sponsorship for concerts and street festivals for the Hispanic market. After the band leader Tito Puente kissed her, "I almost didn't wash my cheek for days," she said.
A week passed before it really sank in that she could be laid off. "In the back of my mind, I always live assuming I might get a pink slip," she said. "I'd be lying if I said it was something I enjoyed thinking about. But this is not the world it was when my father was working. You don't have lifetime employment."
"Clare's typical of a new breed," said her father, who worked for 23 years at Exxon and 16 years at Allied Signal. "The old paternalistic relationship is dead. The employee is simply the sum of his or her skills."
Just two weeks after the announcement, Ms. Powell got a call from the ISL Company, a Stamford, Conn., subsidiary of a Swiss sports-licensing concern: Would she like to do at ISL what she does at AT&T? Ms. Powell liked the principals of the firm, whom she got to know in working on AT&T projects, and thought seriously about leaving.
Then, last month, AT&T made its buyout offer. "At some point I knew I had to leave because I eventually want to own my business," Ms. Powell said. "But when is the right time? If I didn't jump, I'd probably regret it for the rest of my life."
Recently separated and about to complete a divorce, Ms. Powell also had no children to complicate a decision. Under the buyout, she will receive about a half year's salary. She would not disclose her salary, but Ms. Powell's type of job typically pays between $80,000 and $120,000.
"If you're going to go, it would be great to go when they give you money to go," she said. "Pretty simple."
For Jim Bowers, the decision was also straightforward -- after he took more than a week to sense that his job could be in danger. He quickly realized, however, that he was too young to quit and, he feared, too old to get another job.
A physiology major at Ohio State, Mr. Bowers got a master's degree in library science at Rutgers University. After serving on the library-science faculty at the University of Florida in Gainesville, he became the corporate librarian and marketing manager at Allied Chemical, which eventually became Allied Signal. He also received an M.B.A. from Fairleigh-Dickinson University.
THEN, thinking videotext would be the next big thing, he joined AT&T in 1982 in the abortive project to develop and market a precursor of business and residential computer services. He eventually moved up to become a project manager for computer software.
But the job market today in New Jersey is weaker than it was a decade ago, Mr. Bowers said. The traditional route of early retirees -- returning to AT&T as a consultant at a large fraction of your old salary -- is vanishing.
Mr. Bowers and his wife decided they would simply have to tough it out. "The whole thing was a nondecision for me," he said on a recent afternoon dressed in a plaid shirt and a "Camp Friendship" T-shirt.
"I could leave this house, which I love, in a day. But everything my wife and I do now is focused on daughter," referring to Alaire, the flutist. "Daughter goes to private school. Daughter would lose her music tutor. Daughter would lose her place in the New Jersey Youth Orchestra, which is very competitive." Even a standard flute for Alaire costs more than $4,000.
He added, 'If I don't have to go, I'm willing to stick it out for daughter."
The family lives in comfort in a home filled with family keepsakes and furniture picked up at flea markets and antique stores. But Mr. Bowers sees few places where they can cut costs if he loses his job, whose salary Mr. Bowers does not want to specify but is probably between $60,000 and $80,000.
The family doesn't eat at expensive restaurants or take costly vacations, and Mrs. Bowers only rarely goes to Manhattan to the opera. Mr. Bowers heats much of the house with more than four cords of wood gathered from nearby roads.
Except for Alaire's schooling and martial-arts lessons, the family's main outlay is for extensive payments into AT&T retirement and savings accounts. They also have $20,000 in savings that a financial planner recommended as a supplement to Social Security. But a car recently hit the family Ford Taurus, which had an insurance value of just $7,000. They want to buy a new car to replace it, but that will eat up $13,000 of the couple's special fund.
Moreover, the financial planner gave Mr. Bowers the sobering advice that he must work until age 62, or 14 more years, mainly to cover Alaire's college expenses, as well as qualify for a higher pension.
Under the buyout program, Mr. Bowers would get a little more than half a year's salary "to take a walk." If he waits to get dismissed, he only loses eight weeks' salary, or about $9,000 to $12,000.
Mr. Bowers, 48, doesn't qualify for a full pension. Typically, an AT&T manager would have to be 55, with 20 years of service, to qualify. There is always the pension he will receive after working for 10 years at Allied Chemical, about $300 a month.
"Enough to buy a loaf of bread in the year 2009," Mr. Bowers said ruefully.

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE

 BODY:
STEVE LORENZEN took his first trip abroad in 1957, when his parents drove the family to Mexico City for a vacation. Since then, Mr. Lorenzen, now 49, has returned to Mexico dozens of times, and has visited Africa, Europe and Central America.
In fact, foreign lands have become a field of study for him. "I have a longstanding interest in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe," Mr. Lorenzen said. An economist at the Texas Department of Human Services, he has also done research on how people eke out a living in the slums outside Mexico City, and he continues to stay in touch with Mexican friends. 
 With these interests, it is no surprise that Mr. Lorenzen and his wife, Cathy, who is 43 and a data manager at the same agency, have many foreign investments. The couple, who live in Austin, have accounts in 17 mutual funds, and nine of them focus on international equities. Of the $115,500 they have in retirement and nonretirement assets, $54,400 is in foreign stocks and just $32,100 in American ones. They also own four Mexican stocks in the form of American depository receipts, and to gauge their prospects Mr. Lorenzen uses the Internet to track Mexican unemployment rates, interest rates and factory production.
But David Diesslin, a fee-only certified financial planner at Diesslin & Associates in Fort Worth, warns them that while scholarly interests are fine, putting lots of assets abroad makes for a lopsided portfolio.
"You may be taking more risk than you realize," he said, noting that with international stocks "not only do you have market risk but you have currency risk" as well.
Also, the Lorenzens have too much money in stocks for Mr. Diesslin's taste -- nearly 80 percent of their assets, counting some small shares in limited partnerships. "I don't think this is the time to bet the ranch in the stock market," he said.
Oddly enough, it was a wager of sorts, in addition to their intellectual interests, that helped draw the couple's money abroad.
"A year or so ago, I made a bet that the international markets would do better than they have," Mr. Lorenzen said. "So I shifted a substantial share of my assets into international funds." But reality did not cooperate in this attempt at market timing. According to the Morgan Stanley Europe, Austral-Asia and Far East index, a widely used performance measure, foreign stocks have risen 16.83 percent this year through Nov. 30, while the Standard & Poor's 500 has gained 34.98 percent in the same period.
Of course, the wisdom of taking risks depends on investors' income, expenses, time frame and other factors. But a look at the Lorenzens suggests that by these measures their investing may be too chancy.
For example, their combined annual income of $95,000 is offset by substantial expenses. Their monthly mortgage payment is $1,250 -- they have 21 years to go on it -- and they spend another $500 a month to keep their 22-year-old son, Kurt, in cheeseburgers, books and protractors as he studies physics at the University of Texas. Other monthly expenses include about $300 in car and life insurance payments.
And while longer horizons can lessen investment risks, some of the couple's cash needs may come well before retirement. There will be college costs for their 7-year-old daughter, Kristina, for example, and both of them harbor professional dreams that may shrink their income.
Mr. Lorenzen hopes to start a business someday in which he can use his knowledge of Mexico. And Mrs. Lorenzen -- who has two novels, as yet unpublished, to her credit -- would rather be known for her writing than for managing data.
They may not change their jobs, but if they do, they may have to tap the $9,000 in their Acorn International mutual fund account, or the $4,000 in Harbor International, at an inopportune time.
Moreover, the bulk of their $115,500 -- $82,100 -- is in tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s. But raiding this money might lead to tax penalties, so that leaves the remaining $33,400 as the likeliest candidate in times of need. And this nonretirement money, unfortunately, is where the Lorenzens have some of their riskiest investments.
The couple may also be less tolerant of risk than their current investments suggest. "In any one year, how much of a loss would drive you out of stocks?" Mr. Diesslin asked Mr. Lorenzen. "If in two years, your portfolio was worth $50,000, you'd still be comfortable?" Though Mr. Lorenzen spoke of the virtues of long-term investing, he still seemed fairly discomfited at the possibility.
Based on all this, Mr. Diesslin presented the couple with several recommendations.
First, he favored lowering stocks from nearly 80 percent of the couple's assets to about 65 percent, and raising bonds from 5.2 percent to 25 percent. "Even though bonds outperform stocks only 27 percent of the time," Mr. Diesslin said, the couple would have more protection if stocks fall.
Also for safety, he recommended that they hold more stocks in domestic issues. "If we really do balance the budget in the United States, and the dollar has substantial strengthening, gains made overseas could be wiped out," he said.
Mr. Diesslin felt that the Lorenzens should reduce the number of mutual funds they hold as well. "I'm into simplification," he said. "If you want to hold this many funds, you have to do more homework." He suggested that the Lorenzens sell at least 5 of their 17 funds, and that they compare the top 10 holdings of each of the remainder to see if there is any substantial duplication.
The planner also believes that the couple need to make other investment changes if they are to retire on an annual income of $60,000, as they wish.
Both are in line for pensions from the state, though the amounts depend on their lengths of stay. They also put pretax money into 401(k) plans -- he devotes 15 percent of income while she puts in 7 percent -- for a total of $1,325 a month.
In judging whether these savings were adequate, Mr. Diesslin made some very conservative projections. Because of intervening inflation, he figured, the spending power of $60,000 today would require $116,000 a year when Mr. Lorenzen retires. Mr. Diesslin also assumed that Mr. Lorenzen might leave his agency before he reached age 65 and, as a result, might get only about $20,000 in annual pension.
Under these assumptions, the Lorenzens need to pick up the pace of their 401(k) savings, Mr. Diesslin said. Ms. Lorenzen must invest $500 more a month. "That's where you can get the farthest distance toward building that nest egg," he said. "A dollar in the 401(k) saves 30 cents in taxes."
Mr. Diesslin also urged the couple to save for Kristina's college bills, putting money into the Twentieth Century Giftrust, a growth fund specializing in small-company stocks and used for trusts for minors.
A few days after talking with Mr. Diesslin, the Lorenzens discussed finances while sipping iced tea on the deck of their home. Ms. Lorenzen agreed that they needed to save more in their 401(k)'s, but an extra $500 "seems like a lot to me at this point," she said. "Every week, with school activities and Brownies, there are always small expenses and it just all adds up." But she believes an added $200 a month is doable.
Similarly, Mr. Lorenzen plans to begin buying some bond funds; Mr. Diesslin recommended Loomis Sayles Bond fund and the Lindner Dividend fund. But Mr. Lorenzen wondered where Kristina's college money would come from. In a few years, " Kurt, hopefully, will be through with college," he said. "Maybe after he gets out, we can free up some money."
But one thing will not change for the Lorenzens: their belief in international investing, particularly the emerging markets. "If you ignore those economies," Mr. Lorenzen said, "you are ignoring a growing part of the capitalization of the world."

FUNDS WATCH

BYLINE: By CAROL GOULD 

 BODY:

Gauging the Cost Of 401(k) Plans
The amount paid for 401(k) plans can vary widely, according to the Butler Index, begun recently by the Pension Dynamics Corporation of Lafayette, Calif. 
 The index shows what 12 mutual fund and other companies would charge for a plan with $1 million in assets and 50 employees -- in other words, a small plan. The annualized costs are divided into the amount paid by the employer and that paid cumulatively by the 50 employees. Though they may not realize it, employees who check on their plans will generally find that a portion is deducted from the accounts of individual participants.
For a plan of this size, the lowest-cost providers were Principal Financial, T. Rowe Price Century Plan and Vanguard, according to the index.
Along with costs, a critical factor is investment performance. "A vendor may say that, although its costs and fees are above average, you are being awarded with superior investment performance," said Stephen J. Butler, president of Pension Dynamics. "Don't take this claim on faith. Check the performance of your prospective vendors' investments in a respected source, such as Morningstar."
 
Best of the Bonds? Corporates and Munis
Buying shares in a Government bond fund is easier than buying small quantities of Government bonds. But most Government funds lag behind their benchmarks. They're expensive, and there are better alternatives, John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Investor, wrote in the most recent issue.
About 85 percent of Government Treasury and mortgage bond funds trail the Lehman Brothers Government index, and they don't compensate by showing lower risk. The reason is that the market is very efficient, and fund managers are handicapped by expenses, which average 1.05 percent of assets a year.
Best bets for investors are the low-cost Vanguard funds, Mr. Rekenthaler concludes. Other options are Strong Government Securities, which stretches the definition of Government to include unusual mortgages and some corporate bonds, and Sit U.S. Government Securities, which owns mobile-home mortgages.
Otherwise, investors in low tax brackets should now go with corporates, Mr. Rekenthaler argues. They are less costly and their market is less efficient. FPA New Income has beaten the Government indexes for a decade with less risk, he said. Other funds he recommends: Loomis Sayles Bond, Dodge & Cox Income and Harbor Bond.
For people taxed at 28 percent or more, municipal bond funds, especially single-state funds, are the way to go. Exempt from Federal and state tax for in-state residents, the single-state funds yield more without sacrificing long-term performance. Best bets are run by Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Mr. Rekenthaler says.
Because long-term munis carry a lot of interest-rate risk, cautious investors might consider intermediate-term muni funds even though yields are lower.
 
A Rift Over Money Funds
A proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission to force money market funds to report their holdings quarterly is running into opposition from the industry.
The Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund trade group, says the proposal is neither "necessary nor appropriate" and would result in unnecessary costs.
Not so, says Glen King Parker, publisher of the Income Fund Outlook, an investment newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. Many institutional money funds already publish portfolios monthly and make them available to shareholders, he said, and those that sell to the general public should provide more disclosure.
In fact, he would prefer reporting monthly instead of quarterly. "Money funds have become quasi-banks," he said, "and I don't think that there's anything wrong with an increased level of scrutiny."
 
A Portfolio Thinks Small
James Oberweis, manager of the $135 million Oberweis Emerging Growth fund, is starting the Micro-Cap Portfolio, which will invest in very, very small stocks. The average market capitalization of the stocks in the Emerging Growth portfolio is $400 million to $500 million; in the new fund it will be less than $100 million.
The new fund is being structured to let investors get in at the starting gate. Money will be collected from mid-December, but it won't be invested until the fund begins operating on Jan. 2.
To stay true to his small-cap mission, Mr. Oberweis plans to close the fund when it reaches $50 million in assets. Even existing shareholders won't be allowed to add new money, though they can reinvest their earnings.
 
More New Funds
Robertson, Stephens & Company, San Francisco, is adding three funds. Its Information Age fund, managed by Ron Elijah, who already runs the company's Value and Growth fund, will concentrate on small-capitalization technology companies with unusual offerings in multimedia, wireless communications, networking, software and the like. Global Natural Resources will be managed by Andy J. Pilara Jr., who also manages the Partners and Contrarian funds. Global Low Priced Stock will buy overlooked companies with share prices of $10 or less.
Bank of America has started three Time Horizon funds with stated maturity dates in the life-style category. The funds aim to maximize total return and then emphasize capital preservation as the fund approaches its maturity date. Time Horizon Portfolio 1 is for investors with a financial goal near the year 2005, Portfolio 2 for 2015 and Portfolio 3 for 2025.
Fidelity Investments has added to its international lineup with six aggressive growth funds that invest in single countries and regions abroad. All the funds carry a 3 percent sales charge and a 1.5 percent redemption fee on shares held less than 90 days. They are Fidelity France, Germany, Hong Kong and China, Japan Small Companies, Nordic and United Kingdom.
 
New Management
Ernst H. Von Metzsch, who picked up the Vanguard Wellington fund after the death of Vincent Bajakian in September, has been named the permanent manager.
Catherine Dudley left Phoenix Growth to join Chancellor Investments. She is replaced at the fund by William J. Newman, the company's chief investment strategist.
In Brief
Fidelity Investments plans to make all its prospectuses available soon on the Internet. The company has 83 prospectuses there now (http://www.fid-inv.com) and expects to put the remainder there by early next year.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLUSHING;
Once Again, Armory Shelters Homeless and Stirs Dispute

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
For the 14 years that the Flushing Armory was used by the city's Department of Homeless Services as a women's shelter, it was a source of controversy. Neighborhood residents said the homeless women at the shelter loitered on the streets, used drugs and alcohol and solicited male students at nearby Flushing High School.
Now, with the armory reopened as an emergency shelter for homeless men, residents are again up in arms, and local elected officials said the city was circumventing regulations by operating the shelter without a permit from the state. 
 In a joint statement, State Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin and State Senator Leonard Stavisky said the city had "either deliberately violated or deliberately circumvented" its own procurement rules by awarding a $540,000 contract to the Salvation Army to run the shelter without an open-bidding process. In addition, an aide to Mr. McLaughlin said the city does not have an operating license from the State Department of Social Services to run an emergency shelter at the armory.
City officials said open bidding was not necessary because the city was merely extending an existing Salvation Army contract to run a shelter on Borden Avenue in Long Island City. "It was completely appropriate and completely consistent with the city's procurement rule," said Muzzy Rosenblatt, chief of staff at the Department of Homeless Services. "The Salvation Army is the only contract who met all of our needs."
Terrence McGrath, a spokesman for the State Department of Social Services, said the city does not need state certification to run the shelter because it is used only on an as-needed basis.
Community leaders, who had hoped that the armory would be converted into a multipurpose community center with offices for the Police Department's Queens North Task Force and Community Board 7, said they feared that the shelter would be detrimental to the area's recent economic improvement.
"We certainly understand and are sympathetic to the administration and to the needs of the homeless," said Jo-Ann Jones, executive director of the Flushing Arts Council, which has headquarters at Flushing Town Hall, across the street from the armory. "But for those of us who are working toward the quality of life and enhancing the safety of the area, this is certainly a setback."
Ms. Jones said the shelter was "extremely detrimental to the area" when it was used to house homeless women, who she and other residents said often engaged in drug use and prostitution. "Businesses near the shelter closed because owners couldn't put up with the harassment," she said.
Mr. Rosenblatt said the armory, at 137-58 Northern Boulevard, would be used from December through April when other shelters exceeded than 95 percent capacity. To further insure the community's safety, the homeless will be bused in from Manhattan from a central processing unit in the evening and will be bused back to Manhattan by 8 the next morning.
Maj. Betty Israel, social services secretary for the Salvation Army for Greater New York operations, said the center, which has its own security guard and about 30 employees, would not accept any walk-ins.
Mr. Rosenblatt said the Flushing Armory, with a capacity of 180 in the homeless shelter, took in 120 people on Dec. 1, its opening night, and 24 people each on two nights last week. JANE H. LII

Fur Center Sale: The Synagogue

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
In its glory days, the Fur Center Synagogue on West 29th Street was so crowded that some services had three seatings. Today, the congregation, founded in 1935, has fallen to 27 members from a peak of 700. Struggling to pay its bills, it is negotiating to sell the one-story synagogue it built in 1965 to a meditation group. Last month it stopped holding services.
"We're all heartsick," said Abby Thomas, the synagogue's administrator. "But the fur district isn't what it used to be." 
 The synagogue's troubles mirror the economic and demographic changes that have wrenched the fur industry. Cheap imports, a string of warm winters and the animal-rights movement have conspired against a once-thriving industry centered at 30th Street and Eighth Avenue. In 1955, there were 25,000 fur district workers, 80 percent of whom were Jewish. Today the workers, most of Greek descent, number 2,000.
Seven years ago, the congregation hired a 26-year-old rabbi, Joel Kenny, who members say helped bring about a renaissance in the synagogue's spiritual life. Dozens of Jews who live in the surrounding area joined the synagogue and attended services on weekends, when most of the furriers are home in the suburbs. Although the synagogue is Orthodox, all Jews were welcomed. "Before he came, this place was really moribund," said Joan Rosenfelt, a film maker who lives in Greenwich Village. "He brought in the fire of youth and attracted a diverse bunch of people."
But enthusiasm was not enough to pay the $18,000 a year it costs to heat and light the building or the $40,000 it took to fix a leaking roof. Ms. Thomas, who did not disclose the building's sale price, said she hoped the new owner would let the congregation meet in the basement.
Sol Goldstein, chairman of the synagogue, remembers when hundreds of skin merchants, coat manufacturers and fur wholesalers would gather in the main sanctuary for yahrzeit, the service marking the anniversary of the death of a relative. "You'd look around and every face would be a familiar one," said Mr. Goldstein, 81, a retired furrier. "They're all gone now, and I can't tell you how sad that is for me." ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: The Center Holds Out

BYLINE: By Paul Tsongas; Paul Tsongas, a lawyer and a Democrat, was a Senator from Massachusetts from 1979 to 1984.

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass.

 BODY:
If you are ever in front of an audience and searching for an engaging topic, try this: suggest there is a "passionate center" to the American body politic -- or "sensible center," as Colin Powell would say, or "radical center" as others would argue. Suggest that this center is held together by four basic points of agreement.
First, it is fiscally conservative. It strongly supports a balanced budget -- not so much because of the economic consequences of large-scale debt but because of the irresponsibility such debt symbolizes. While it is true that a balanced budget will reduce interest rates and free up capital to enhance America's global competitiveness, the passion for fiscal responsibility really flows from people's adamant opposition to saddling their children with a $5 trillion debt. 
 Second, the passionate center is socially inclusive and protective of individual liberties. Most Americans are not racist or sexist. Increasing numbers accept homosexuality. Polls show, unsurprisingly, that most Democratic and independent women are pro-choice, but they also show that most Republican women are pro-choice as well.
 Third, it is pro-environment. Where did anyone get the idea that Americans were so fed up with Federal regulations that they would want Congress to gut the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act? Or to open up wildlife refuges to oil companies? Or to support any of the myriad bonehead ideas of the last year? Most Americans, especially the young, see the environment as fundamental to their quality of life, as a legacy to be protected, not a place to be plundered for the profit of the few.
Fourth, the passionate center wants campaign finance reform. Americans are sickened by political action committees owning Congress and by "soft money" funds that evade campaign laws to benefit the very people who passed those laws. When President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich shook hands in New Hampshire in June and agreed to strengthen campaign laws, most Americans doubted that they were serious. As the weak "reform" package passed by Congress shows, the skeptics were right.
Run these four principles past most audiences and you will meet very little resistance. You will likely get vigorous assent. But if you ask which of the two major parties shares them, you will get silence.Perhaps some Democrats will get up and talk proudly about their party's noble record on civil rights. And Republicans will get up and talk proudly about their party's courage this year in seeking to end the budget deficit. But can anyone vouch for his or her party on all four principles? Or even on three? No.
Why is it that the only attempt by the White House to produce a balanced budget missed by some $200 billion a year? Why is it that Republicans want a tax cut for the wealthy that will necessitate severe cuts in programs for the most vulnerable? Why is it that no remaining Republican Presidential candidate is pro-choice? Why does it take a public outcry to force the White House to reconsider and reject the Democratic National Committee's plan to charge big contributors $100,000 each for a dinner with the President?
Both parties fail to give Americans what they really want because they are beholden to the ideologically pure in their ranks: old-time big spenders on the Democratic left and the Reaganomic stalwarts on the Republican right. That is why the voters of the "passionate center" feel alienated.
In 1992 they embraced Ross Perot until his temperament diverted their interest from his sincere efforts to educate the country on the perils of the huge deficit. This year they longed, in vain, for Colin Powell. America needs someone or some group to force, cajole and embarrass the two major parties into moving toward this passionate center. That is why I have taken part in several recent meetings with prominent centrists including the former Governors Richard D. Lamm of Colorado and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, and the former Representatives John Anderson of Illinois and Tim Penny of Minnesota.
We prefer a two-party system and don't want to be spoilers. But if the 1996 election shows that Republican and Democratic leaders cannot or will not respect the passionate center, there will be a third-party movement in 1997, whether we are part of it or not. Americans will not stand by mutely and watch their future jeopardized by the mood swings of two unresponsive parties.

Some Winnings for Farmers From Atlantic City Gambling

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

 BODY:
Money gambled in Atlantic City's casinos is helping buy a new tractor for Virgil Eachus's farm in Mullica Hill.
Mr. Eachus recently received a check for $65,600, the first chunk of $3 million in loans that the Casino Revinvestment Development Authority is making to farmers in southern New Jersey. Twenty-two farmers have already qualified for $2 million. 
 Since the casino reinvestment agency was set up in 1984, it has funneled millions of dollars into economic development projects around the state. Until now, its focus has been urban areas in general and Atlantic City in particular.
In announcing the loan program, state officials talked about the economic importance of preserving the stability of farming in southern New Jersey. That message, particularly when backed by money, is good news to farmers like the Eachus family, who have owned Wellacrest Farms in Gloucester County since 1942. "We're kind of in a hardship now," Mr. Eachus said. "Farm prices are really down."
No matter what price milk is bringing in, the farm's 300 cows must be milked every day. "We start about 8 in the morning and go until about 4," Mr. Eachus said. "Then we start up about 8 P.M. and go all night." And when the milking is done, there's the rest of the day-to-day business of running the 1,500-acre farm.
That doesn't leave much free time. But, yes, Mr. Eachus says, he has been to Atlantic City once or twice himself. SUSAN JO KELLER

HEADLINE: Doors Open to China's Remote West

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Karl E. Meyer's "Asia's Lost World" (Editorial Notebook, Dec. 4) raises some interesting points about the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region in western China.
The area was designated such by the Chinese in 1958. Autonomy is limited only to some aspects of culture, not economy or politics. 
 Uighur is a created name for the titular ethnic group in the region. A Turkic people, the Uighur, came to the area in the 800's and formed the Uighur Empire in the eastern portion of the area. They intermarried with local Turkic and Persian groups.
After the Mongol conquest in the 1200's, people referred to themselves only as being from Kashgar or Turpan without a specific ethnic identity. Uighur as an ethnic term fell into disuse until the 1920's.
The Soviets resurrected this term to refer to these descendants of the Uighur Empire. Another "minority" group in the area, the Kazakh, have a similarly complicated history, but with the newly independent state of Kazakhstan, the Kazakhs in China will be finding a new voice.
China's open-door policy has meant greater circulation of foreign goods, travelers and traders in the region as well as foreign ideas -- not just from neighboring places like Pakistan and Kazakhstan but also from Europe, the United States and Japan. Linkages in Central Asia will become as strong as those in the Pacific Rim. The open borders have linked Uighurs and Kazakhs with the global community.
In the past 10 years that I have been going to the region, many changes have occurred. Besides the rail link to Kazakhstan and through that to Russia and Europe, roads tie Xinjiang to Kirghizia, Mongolia and Pakistan, and jets connect to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and soon to Pakistan and Russia.

HEADLINE: WHO'S SORRY NOW?;
Stalwart in Defense Of His Shrinking Turf

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON blocked the Republicans' sweeping plans for reshaping three decades of American social and fiscal policy last week sitting squarely behind a symbol of the spirit he sought to project in the Oval Office: the burly, dark oak desk that Queen Victoria gave to Rutherford B. Hayes. It is made of timber from a British ship whose name is this President's latest watchword: Resolute.
"I am using this pen to preserve our commitment to our parents, to protect opportunity for our children, to defend the public health and our natural resources and natural beauty, and to stop a tax increase that actually undercuts the value of work," Mr. Clinton intoned, wielding the pen that Lyndon B. Johnson used 30 years ago to sign legislation creating Medicare and Medicaid. 
 His aides were jubilant that their President, so often accused of standing for so little, had at last clearly defined a patch of ground and stood it -- defending Medicare and Medicaid to apparent public acclaim. He has been equally firm on an issue with much less public support: sending troops to police a peace accord in Bosnia.
But even as he vetoed the Republicans' plan to cut taxes, shrink Federal programs and reduce tax credits for the working poor, Mr. Clinton offered his own proposal for meeting their goal of balancing the Federal budget by 2002, with slower and shallower cuts in many of the same programs. In that teeter-tottering tension between determination and accommodation lies a tale.
For Mr. Clinton's current resolve was born of months of small, sidewinding steps of contrition and compromise that have moved him steadily closer to Republican aims while preserving just enough of his carefully culled priorities to make it plausible to claim that he is protecting them. Indeed, it may be that Mr. Clinton can only presume to conquer by compromising.
This may be partly congenital. Mr. Clinton, the accommodating elder son of a classically dysfunctional family, can seldom resist trying to win converts, as he did when he seemed to repudiate his own 1993 budget by telling an audience of rich Texans this fall that he raised their taxes too much.
But it is also tactical. When Republicans won control of Congress last year promising tax cuts and leaner Government, Mr. Clinton revived his own call for middle-class tax relief and renewed his efforts to "re-invent" Government. When Republicans said that Mr. Clinton was resisting balancing the budget, he said he wanted to, too -- but insisted it would take 10 years.
Finally, last month, to restart the Government after it was halted by a stalemate over a temporary spending bill, Mr. Clinton agreed to the Republicans' call for balancing the budget in seven years but only in exchange for language to protect popular programs for health, education and the environment that the White House thinks could be key to the President's re-election.
 
A Spate of Mea Culpas
 Ceding ground to gain ground is one of the oldest patterns in politics. Mr. Clinton reclaimed the Arkansas Governorship in 1982 with a campaign that apologized for the mistakes of his first term. Dick Morris, the ambidextrous pollster who was his strategist then, has become his strategist again, urging the President to join the Republicans when he can't beat them -- so he can beat them when he couldn't join them without alienating Democrats. Even Republicans acknowledge the strategy has borne fruit.
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said Mr. Morris is trying "to take the underpinnings away from the issues that hold together a Republican majority coalition. He's trying to say, 'Don't fight them on the balanced budget idea; get into the mechanics, get into the sausage, agree with the goal and pick them to death on how.' "
"I think they have pursued a relatively coherent policy in terms of political positioning, in a relatively stable fashion for a year in a row," he said. "That is something Mr. Clinton was not able to do in the first two years in office, and as a result his political standing is better. The trouble is, it is very difficult to maintain that balancing act."
Michael Beschloss, a historian, sums up Mr. Clinton's year a bit differently.
 
Going for the Center
 "What he's done on the one hand is to dive for the center, and at the same time, in order not to give the impression of being a capitulator, he has picked his battles and used language and little moments like the veto speech to give the impression that this is someone who is standing up," Mr. Beschloss said. "I think it's a roll of the dice, a gamble that people's attention spans are short enough that they will remember those bold moments, and not the other moments."
The other moments have included a confessional to the conservative columnist Ben Wattenberg, in which Mr. Clinton denounced his own welfare reform plan as too weak and said he had behaved like a prime minister, shepherding legislation, and not enough like a President, leading public opinion.
Having pledged in the 1992 campaign to "end welfare as we know it," Mr. Clinton helped unleash public demand for overhaul that this year produced Republican bills far more extreme than he would have wished. The President was so eager to be seen as supporting change that he backed a Senate bill that his own aides warned would put more than a million children into poverty. But because House negotiators are insisting on even harsher terms, Mr. Clinton may end up vetoing whatever welfare measure ultimately emerges.
 
An Eye on History
 Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of biographies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and President Johnson, noted that politicians who are accommodationists by instinct, training and necessity often come to relish the benefits of having a clearly defined opposition, as Roosevelt did in the fight over the New Deal and Johnson did in the battle over civil rights.
For his first two years, Mr. Clinton fought with, or bowed to, the Democratic barons of Capitol Hill as much as he did with Republicans. Once the shell shock of last fall's Republican sweep wore off, a White House that thrives on campaigning was liberated. Mr. Clinton's aides now talk self-consciously of playing for the history books in the budget battle, and they say that Mr. Clinton knows the outcome could end up defining not only his Presidency but the future of the Democratic party and the programs it helped create.
"It may well be that the combination of the budget fight and the Bosnia decision coming together, both of which challenge him to take a risky stance, has inspired him," Ms. Goodwin said. "I think he's got to feel more freedom now. If you stand firm, and it pays off, there are more muscles for the next time. He just seems to be enjoying himself more in a positive way, in terms of exercising his leadership, and knowing that capacity is there."
 
Dancing in the Dark
 Still, the outcome is uncertain. Even if Mr. Clinton wins on the terms he has defined -- smaller cuts in Medicare, smaller tax cuts, protection for programs he likes -- there are inherent risks.
"This is much more of a gamble than the White House tacticians may think," Mr. Beschloss said. "If a President seems to be something during the first two years of his term, and something else the last two, what that suggests is that virtually nothing he has said is a reliable indicator of what we might expect during a second term, when he has no constraints of re-election. It is a very important weapon of leadership to have at least enough consistency that people know what they're voting for."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
In Japan, Blacks as Outsiders

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

 BODY:
FOR many black Americans, Japan is less the great economic power or serene synthesizer of the arts and more a country of offensive remarks about blacks and other minorities by prominent government officials, including former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
When a black film maker, Reggie Life, headed to Japan on a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship three years ago, friends warned him that racism was rampant in Japan. On the eve of his trip a Japanese Government official publicly compared prostitutes in Tokyo's notorious red-light district to blacks who move into white neighborhoods and "ruin the atmosphere." 
 "I thought maybe my friends' concerns about racism in Japan had some validity," recalled Mr. Life, who lives in East Chatham, N.Y., near Albany.
But the insensitivity, prejudice and snubs that many foreigners -- black, white or other -- experience in Japan has less to do with race and everything to do with being "gaijin." A foreigner. The other. The outsider. Japan prides itself on homogeneity, on a group consciousness that subsumes that of ethnic minorities like the Koreans and Chinese. There is a large gap to bridge as an outsider, one far more complicated than the black-white dynamic at the core of America's racial ferment.
Some Japanese are likely to get out of a communal bath when a non-Japanese enters it. They may move away on the subway when foreigners sit down. Or, more characteristically, they may not answer, indeed, ignore the presence of a questioner, when approached and asked a question in English.
The experience leaves many Americans, blacks in particular, assuming that they have been slighted or insulted racially.
The recent arrest of three American servicemen, all black, accused of the kidnapping and rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl in Okinawa, prompted charges of racial discrimination by their families in the United States. The Japanese, however, saw the suspects as American servicemen, not black servicemen.
 
Not Black but Gaijin
 "Some blacks come here prepared to face, and repel, racism," said Karen Hill Anton, a black American and columnist for The Japan Times. "But if they can let down their armor, they will recognize that they are first and foremost part of that larger group called gaijin.
"Anyone who is not Japanese in this country is part of a minority -- and, of course, that means whites, too," said Mrs. Anton, a resident of Japan for more than 20 years.
Donald Richie, a white American writer and film scholar who speaks Japanese and has lived in Japan for more than 40 years, said that outside his neighborhood and circle of friends, he is still considered an outsider. "Giggly school girls on the subway will sit and talk about me, thinking I don't speak Japanese, about how pink I am, how hairy," he said.
Even though Mr. Richie recently received the Japan Foundation award, one of the highest awards given by the Japanese Government, he said "I'm still gaijin." He captures the feeling in his 1971 classic about Japan called "The Inland Sea" (Kodansha). "I live in this country as the water insect lives in the pond," he writes, "skating across the surface, not so much mindful as incapable of seeing the depths."
The Japanese, however, do have stereotypical images of black Americans, gleaned from American television and press accounts. Some of them assume that blacks are either entertainers or sports figures or slow, lazy, strong and destructive. Americans, overall, are seen as violent. Yet the manifestations of Japanese racial superiority are not comparable to those expressed by some American racists.
"The Japanese may be phobic and insular, but they're not going to bother you," said Mr. Life, who has done two films on Japan, one on black Americans living there, the other on Japanese children of mixed race. "There's no physical threat there. As a black male in America, you always have to consider, if I go here, how will I be received. Is it safe?"

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Accord On Budget Won't End The Debate

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is a deep and impatient hunger among much of the Washington establishment for a budget deal. Why, they ask, can't the sensible centrists in each party hunker down in some back room of the Capitol, split the difference on Medicaid, Medicare and the size of the tax cut, find a suitable fudge on the differing economic assumptions and let the Government get back to business?
It is, after all, the way things are usually done, and it is still considered a reasonably likely outcome of the budget war of 1995. But there is another school of thought: that at least some of the differences between the two parties are too profound for the closed-door politesse of budget summitry; that these differences ought to be taken to the voters in 1996, and that the unresolved philosophical debate of the 1980's, which was always finessed, ought to be rejoined.
 
Resolve (Gulp) These Issues?
 What, exactly, does it mean to get the Federal Government off the backs of the people? Does it mean rolling back environmental regulations? What programs are voters willing to trim to balance the budget and create billions in new tax cuts? How much do they realize, as the current class of Republicans candidly acknowledges, that it cannot be done by simply eliminating waste, fraud and abuse? 
 Should the Federal Government leave poverty programs to the states, or should there be a Federal guarantee of health coverage and cash assistance to poor women and children? Is the 30-year record of welfare policy so poisonous that, in fact, anything would be better?
Even if some kind of budget deal is reached, and there were a few tentative signs of progress last week, many believe it will only paper over some of these ideological divisions. It is hard to split the difference on questions like these.
Republicans argue that the voters already gave their answers when they ousted, with surgical precision, the Democratic majority in 1994 and replaced it with an ideologically charged Republican class brandishing a detailed Contract With America. If ever there was a mandate, the Republicans say, it came in 1994. But Democrats considered 1992 to be a mandate to embark on a sweeping expansion of benefits for "the forgotten middle class" -- remember the Health Security Act of 1994? -- and found, to their horror, that the voters had something else in mind.
The meaning of these last two elections is a subject of great debate among political scientists and pollsters. Some do see 1994 as a classic realignment toward the Republican Party, an analysis that prompted a wave of obituaries for the Democrats last summer. But others assert that each party has dramatically over-interpreted its mandate in the last four years, and that it is once again time for the voters to sort things out.
Few would dispute the notion that voters sent an anti-Democratic, anti-Clinton message in 1994. But post-election polls showed most Americans were unfamiliar with the Republicans' Contract, which has shaped the Republicans' budget and assumed the status of holy writ in the House.
Moreover, those who turned out in 1994 were disproportionately Republican and conservative; dispirited Democrats tended to stay home. If history is any guide, the turnout in 1996 will be substantially larger.
"There's much to be said for thrashing it out in another election," said Walter Dean Burnham, a political scientist at the University of Texas, and an expert on realignment.
Two things could happen in 1996, he said: The Republican revolution could be reaffirmed, giving the Republicans a clear field for governing. Or it could be derailed, with a Clinton victory and Democratic gains in the House, in which case the 1990's will look less like the decade of realignment than the decade of repudiation, a series of slaps to whichever party is in power at the time. (Of course, the voters could also produce a mixed result with a Clinton re-election and a strengthened Republican Congress.)
A less scholarly and more partisan conclusion comes from James Carville, the Clinton campaign adviser.
"The best thing would be to have a budget deal that protects the things President Clinton cares about," Mr. Carville said. "But if these issues are too big to be resolved, the people are going to have to resolve them. Why is that necessarily a bad thing?
"The real friction is with the elite, anti-small-d-democrats, who basically say, 'Let's act like adults, get behind closed doors, hammer something out, cut a deal and go forward; that these are unseemly questions that the voters ought not to be bothered about.' It's only about their education, their health care, their environment."
But can the politics of the 1990's produce a big, issue-oriented election that says more than "throw the bums out?"
Once upon a time there were such elections: Martin P. Wattenberg, a political scientist at the University of California at Irvine, notes that 80 percent of the voters in 1964 were familiar with the Civil Rights Act, and knew which candidate was for it and which was against it. President Lyndon Johnson's victory that year was a mandate on civil rights and other major issues, like the creation of Medicare.
There are many, however, who doubt that a big, budget-driven election would be an uplifting exercise in democracy. And there are many here in Washington who defend the notion of "split the difference" policy-making. According to that thinking, when the voters produce a mixed result -- a conservative Republican Congress and a Democratic White House -- closed-door compromising between the two can produce something approximating what the people really want.
 
The Ultimate Fear: a Third Party
 Moreover, both the Republican leadership and the Administration may ultimately feel it's in their best interest to reach a deal and mute their differences. Otherwise, the conventional wisdom holds, a grumpy electorate might grow even more disgusted with Washington gridlock and even more open to an independent candidate, an abiding fear in both parties.
By that scenario, the voters would be spared, once again, the messy chore of sorting out their own priorities. They would not have to choose between their competing needs and wants: a balanced budget, a big tax cut, a Medicare program that hums along largely unchanged, a Medicaid program that will cover their parents' nursing home costs, a Federal Government that is dramatically pared back, yet still cleans up toxic waste dumps and monitors water. Their politicians will finesse those differences for them.
Maybe an independent candidate will come along who will try to force a debate. Perhaps just as likely, maybe one will emerge who tells Americans they can have it all.
Summitry, in other words, is unlikely to bring a lasting peace in the budget wars until the voters are brought into the room.

HEADLINE: China to Start Trial of Top Dissident This Week

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 9

 BODY:
China's Communist Party leadership has notified the family of the country's most prominent dissident, Wei Jingsheng, that his trial on charges of attempting to overthrow the Government will begin on Wednesday.
International human rights groups called on President Clinton today to condemn the criminal proceedings against the outspoken democracy campaigner, who has already spent 16 years in prison or detention for his essays and public statements. 
 Two former United States Attorneys General, Richard Thornburgh and Nicholas Katzenbach, publicly offered to assist Mr. Wei's family in preparing his defense, although the gesture is sure to be rejected by the Chinese authorities.
The outcry over Mr. Wei's case in part reflects the frustration among his supporters that the Clinton Administration, which at one time strongly identified itself with Mr. Wei's appeal for democracy, has gradually put distance between itself and China's pro-democracy dissidents. Mr. Clinton has instead pursued a course of dialogue and "engagement" with China, in hopes that stable relations and continuing economic reform here will eventually lead to an end to political repression.
What is also clear, Chinese and American officials say, is that Mr. Wei's fate is being decided as Beijing and Washington are engaged in secret negotiations over the annual effort by the United States and European and other countries to condemn China's human rights record at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The question that will only be answered by Mr. Wei's trial and sentencing is whether the Chinese authorities are seeking to exert pressure on Washington to drop the condemnatory initiative in Geneva. But it could also be that they simply want to dispose of Mr. Wei's case well in advance of the Geneva proceedings in March to signal that they are not willing to grant Mr. Wei his freedom at any price.
Tonight, Mr. Wei's younger brother, Wei Xiaotao, said the family had retained a prominent Chinese lawyer, Zhang Sizhi, who in the past has defended prominent dissidents like Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming.
The charge carries a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of death, although the death penalty is almost never invoked against prominent political dissidents.

HEADLINE: Giuliani and Bratton See Racism in Harlem Fire

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said yesterday that the black gunman-arsonist who killed seven people and himself in a fiery attack on a Jewish-owned clothing store in Harlem on Friday had apparently been motivated by racism.
At a joint news conference at One Police Plaza a day after Freddy's clothing store on 125th Street was turned into a blazing death trap by a man with a revolver and a container of flammable liquid, the police said they still knew little about the gunman and the Mayor urged caution about the interpretation of an incident with potentially explosive racial overtones. 
 But he said the attack was apparently related to weeks of emotional demonstrations and a boycott called to protest expansion plans by the store involving the eviction of a neighboring black-owned record shop that has been a Harlem fixture for decades.
At a news conference in Harlem yesterday, a sharply different view was expressed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, by Morris Powell, the leader of the 125th Street Vendors Association who helped organize the demonstrations, and by Sikhulu Shange, the owner of the record shop. They insisted that there were no racial overtones to the protests.
"We didn't want to see a man put out on the sidewalk who had paid his rent for 20 years," Mr. Powell said. "Whatever race was doing something like that would have us step to it." And, referring to the attack, Mr. Shange said: "We never knew something like this would ever come from this matter. We are not hatemongers."
The conclusion that the gunman was motivated by racism, Commissioner Bratton said, was based on "comments he made during the course of the incident." The officials did not disclose the assailant's remarks that had persuaded them that the case was a bias crime. But one investigator said that the gunman, after running into the store, had shouted: "It's on now! All blacks out!"
Some black people did escape unharmed, but four people in the store -- the white Jewish manager, a Guyanese employee and two white construction workers -- were shot by the assailant. The conditions of three of them, initially listed as critical, were upgraded to serious but stable after each underwent surgery at St. Luke's Hospital.
The Mayor and the Commissioner sounded notes of caution yesterday that reflected the many questions still swirling unanswered about the deadly blaze. While the authorities had concluded that it was an apparent bias case, they still could not say whether the attacker acted alone, had close ties to the protesters or what his precise motive might have been.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bratton said the assailant, who carried an apparently phony photo identification card bearing the name Abubunde Mulocko, still had not been identified. They suggested he was not well known in Harlem, but had been seen -- and videotaped -- at several demonstrations outside Freddy's in recent weeks. Efforts to trace his identity through computer records of fingerprints turned up nothing, one police investigator said.
Mr. Giuliani said it was not yet clear whether the attacker had acted alone or had been part of a conspiracy involving others.
"This is an incident that will change several times in terms of the gathering of the facts," the Mayor said. "It will take a while to determine precisely what the motive is. And it is going to take a while to determine whether or not the perpetrator acted alone, whether there was some complicity by others."
But whether the gunman acted alone or with the help of others, the Mayor indicated that what had begun as a real estate dispute -- between the building owner, a predominantly black Pentecostal congregation called the United House of Prayer for All People, the white owner of the clothing store, Fred Harari, and Mr. Shange, the owner of the Record Shack next door -- was apparently subverted by people with a racial agenda.
"We do know this was an economic dispute between a landlord, a tenant and a subtenant that somehow turned into something far worse than that," the Mayor declared. "That shouldn't have happened. And we should not allow others to push that agenda any further. It's a shame that some degree of racial arson was inserted into this."
Commissioner Bratton said that investigators had determined that the flammable liquid the gunman splashed over piles of clothing around the store to start the fire was paint thinner. They said they also found a fuse for an M-80 firecracker, suggesting that he may have intended to escape after setting the place ablaze.
The Mayor and Commissioner Bratton said the protests outside the store in recent weeks, and efforts to mediate the complex dispute, had been handled by the Police Department. "It was dealt with as a police matter," Mr. Giuliani said when asked if City Hall had known about the protests and the dispute. He later acknowledged: "We had not been informed of it."
Mr. Giuliani bristled when asked about comments earlier yesterday by Mr. Sharpton at his news conference at a Harlem elementary school, where he and others disavowed any racial bias in the demonstrations.
"I think the least said about what he said the better for the safety of the city and the decency of the city," Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Sharpton.
In painting the protests as an economic boycott of Freddy's, Mr. Sharpton had earlier said: "I want to stress that I saw no anti-Semitic, anti-white or any other expressions of racism. The fact of the matter is that the pickets was just as adamantly opposed to the action of the black church that was the landlord as they were the actions of Freddy's."
Mr. Shange, looking weary, said he was shaken by Friday's events. He said he had contacted Harlem's Representative Charles B. Rangel, as well as Assemblyman Keith L. Wright and and City Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, seeking help in his real estate dispute with the owner of the clothing store.
Negotiations had appeared to resolve the dispute several weeks ago. Mr. Shange was to acquire another site a few doors away at a corner of 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, though the rent would be nearly double his present $2,500-a-month payments. But the deal fell through, apparently when Mr. Shange objected to other lease terms that would have weakened his position.
Mr. Rangel and other Harlem political and civic leaders met at the 28th Precinct yesterday in a mood of deepening concern. They called for calm and expressed hope that the violence would not harm the economic rebirth of 125th Street.
They also heard the Precinct commander, Deputy Inspector Joyce Stephen, detail a police bias investigation that began Nov. 29 after a demonstrator -- who was not the gunman -- threatened to "burn and loot the Jews." Extra patrols had been assigned to the block and demonstrations were videotaped, she said. Community affairs officers also were assigned to help ease tensions
As confusion over the case continued, grieving families mourned the victims of the attack and Harlem leaders and residents called for calm. On 125th Street, residents laid bouquets for the dead on a rainwashed sidewalk and peered into the burned-out wreckage of Freddy's.
It was a gray and gloomy day, fit for mourning, but the streets of Harlem were crowded with Saturday shoppers, and a scalloped sea of umbrellas moved like tides on the busy boulevards.
The clothing store at 272 West 125th Street was a charred gruesome reminder of the tragedy that had unfolded there. As a cold drizzle fell, a steady stream of people stopped to peer into the hellish interior: a darkened eerie stage of dangling cables and light fixtures, fallen beams, piles of ashes and the half-burned remnants of shirts, jeans and jackets.
On the sidewalk in front, behind blue police barricades, lay a jumble of rubble piled like an impression by Miro: a ladder, a broken chair, a shattered cabinet, coated with snow and ash and tatters of charred clothing. Nearby, someone had left a bittersweet bouquet of pink carnations, freesias, daisies and lilies. It, too, was surrounded by slush from the day's snow and sleet.
There were no remnants of the name of Freddy's. The cream stucco facade over the storefront was still black from flames that had licked up and out; the second-floor windows were all shattered. A boutique to one side was boarded up, and a banner tacked to the plywood advertised videos of the Million Man March.
On the other side, steel gates were down over the Record Shack. They had been painted with a city skyline, a gold record disk and musical notes floating in the air. There was no name on the shop.
Bundled against the cold, Tamara Martin, 22, a Harlem resident, stopped and said she wished she could have brought flowers or candles. She said she had read of the tragedy and recognized the picture of one of the dead women -- it was someone she remembered fondly, though she did not know her well.
"She was so nice," Ms. Martin said. "You knew who she was just by her smile." Looking into the dark recess of Freddy's, at the place where the people had been killed, she shook her head sadly and said: "It's sick. They had their whole lives ahead of them, and suddenly it's all up in flames in a death trap."
One of the wounded, Alan Grossberg, the store's manager, told his family that he had escaped from the burning building by crawling through a hole in a basement wall.
Mr. Grossberg's nephew, Matthew Tallis, 21, said at St. Luke's Hospital yesterday that his uncle told him that he had pulled the store's bookkeeper, Jack Douek, through the hole after him.
"He knew there was a hole where the store was burglarized last month," Mr. Tallis said.
Mr. Tallis said that his uncle, who is known as Tennessee because he was reared in Memphis, had not yet been told how many people perished. "He knows people died, but he didn't know they were employees," Mr. Tallis said. "He treated them like they were his family."
The attacker was found, with three female victims, lying at the back of the store's main floor. He apparently shot himself once in the chest, the police said. Four other victims -- two men and two women -- were found in the store's basement.
An autopsy by the Medical Examiner's office yesterday concluded that the gunman had died of the gunshot wound and of carbon monoxide poisoning, the result of inhaling smoke in the fire. The other seven victims, all employees of the store, were found to have died of smoke inhalation. They had not been shot.
Stymied in their immediate efforts to identify the assailant, the police asked for the public's help yesterday. They released a picture of him and asked anyone with information about him to call (800) 577-TIPS, or the 28th Precinct at (212) 678-1608.

HEADLINE: DEATH ON 125th STREET: The Dispute;
From a Quiet Beginning, a Volatile Brew Explodes in Harlem

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
It was three years ago that Freddy's clothing store settled into a former meat market on 125th Street in Harlem, and began selling discounted men's and boys' wear. Its immediate neighbor was the Record Shack, which had been in place for 17 years offering used 45's and old gospel albums, and whose lease was encased within Freddy's lease.
Almost the very first conversation between Fred Harari, the clothing store owner, and Sikhulu Shange, the proprietor of the record shop, placed the men in opposing camps. According to Mr. Shange, Mr. Harari told him that he would have to leave when his lease expired at the end of 1995, unless he paid more rent. 
 From that tame and unremarkable beginning, months of tangled events would culminate in gruesome drama Friday morning. A tall black man who the authorities believe was somehow caught up in an escalating dispute burst into Freddy's with a gun and a container of flammable liquid. By the time he was done, he and seven victims lay dead in the incinerated remains of the clothing store. Four others had been wounded.
Given that Mr. Harari is white and Jewish and Mr. Shange and the attacker are black, it would be easy to reduce these events to a simple morality tale reeking of one of the uglier and most enduring stereotypes of prejudice.
But the volatile ingredients that flowed together inside Freddy's appear to be nowhere that straightforward. Another party central to the dispute was a predominantly black Pentecostal church that owned the building and had been aggressively striving to maximize the return on its land holdings. And there were protesters who undoubtedly held mixed goals.
Yesterday, the police said the attacker carried an apparently phony identification bearing the name Abubunde Mulocko. But everything else about him -- his real name, his motivation, whether he acted alone -- remained a mystery. For his part, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani characterized the dispute as an economic disagreement that was subverted by people with a racial agenda.
No one knows now if race was ever at the root of this long-running dispute or if it was the allure of money or even just two people who didn't much like each other. But as is often the case in issues of life and death in New York, a mix of factors may have transformed it into something other than it was. Before it was over, the predicament of one record shop had come to represent for some people the entire anguished history and enduring scars of the street that has been Harlem's soul.
The "25," as it is known in the community, has always been a street of expectations and disillusionment, a street where capitalism has dangled its sweet and elusive promise.
When blacks first moved to Harlem at the end of the 19th century, they were forced to use fair-skinned members of their race as fronts to acquire houses and apartments. Even during the Harlem Renaissance, the days of the 1920's when Harlem was alive with jazz and basement clubs, blacks could not go to many of the clubs and they could not eat in the luncheonettes and restaurants.
At Howard's Hat shop, blacks could buy hats, but they could not try them on without first covering their head with a shower cap. They could buy shoes, but only after they slipped on another store-supplied sock. At Frank's Restaurant, blacks could go to the bar but not into the restaurant proper.
The merchants craved blacks' business but not their services. The only blacks who could get jobs in the stores were those who took menial positions.
The biggest store on the block was Blumstein's department store, and it became an early target of black protest. Only in 1929 did it hire its first blacks -- as elevator operators and porters. In 1934, blacks started a "Buy-Where-You-Can-Work" campaign, picketing Blumstein's until it agreed to hire 35 blacks for clerical and sales positions. Other stores capitulated, and a turning point was reached in Harlem history.
Along 125th Street today, an economic rejuvenation in Harlem has sparked greater diversification in the ownership of businesses on 125th Street. Stores are owned not only by whites, but by blacks, Koreans and Hispanic people. Although some community leaders complain that blacks still own few businesses there, the 125th Street Business Improvement District says that of 322 businesses on West 125th Street, 158 are black-owned.
When Harlem was included last year as part of a new Federal Empowerment Zone that meant more than $300 million in Federal, state and city funds would be applied to the community, Harlem business owners began preparing for growth and expansion.
But the revival of the street has also brought fresh friction. Last year, the city moved scores of illegal street vendors off to a separate market, saying they clogged the sidewalks. Rents have soared, and some of the small businesses that struggled through the lean years have been squeezed out. Others are unsure if the influx of money will benefit or harm them. This new tension "is more economic than racial," said Lloyd Williams, president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, "but it is very difficult in a community like Harlem to separate one from the other."
 
The Beginning 3 Sets of Players, Different Views
Originally, there were three primary players in the story of 272 W. 125th Street, and their geographic proximity to one another formed a triangle.
Fred Harari, the 31-year-old owner of Freddy's, belonged to a tightly knit Orthodox Jewish community in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. He grew up in Brooklyn's Ocean Park area and followed a family tradition into the clothing business. At first, he worked as a shipping supervisor for Conway Stores, a large chain of discount stores co-founded 60 years ago by his grandfather, Abe Cohen.
Mr. Harari opened his own store on Third Avenue in the Bronx seven years ago, adding the one on 125th Street in 1992. A third store is on Fordham Road in the Bronx. All three specialize in low-priced closeout clothing. Business was good enough that he was pursuing more space. At his Third Avenue site, he recently bought the building that housed the store and was displacing a coffee shop.
He is married with two children. Yesterday, a statement that came through his attorney said that he was in seclusion, mourning for the victims and their families.
Sikhulu Shange was born in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 54 years ago, and came to this country in 1964 with a Zulu dance troupe. He set up his record store in 1975, and in time it became one of the best-known black-owned businesses on 125th Street. Across from the famed Apollo Theater, it specializes in blues, Motown, African and Caribbean music.
Though those who knew him said he was not a politically active presence, he was impassioned in condemning apartheid. Four years ago, he helped found the South African-American Organization, a nonprofit group dedicated to raising awareness about South Africa. His pet project was rebuilding a primary school, the Lungelani School in his hometown, which was finished last year.
He has also explored the possibility of opening a music outlet in South Africa while using his Harlem store to school Americans and Africans in retailing.
A tall man with a deep voice and a strong accent, Mr. Shange typically dressed in African attire, including his signature brimless hats. He lives in the Bronx and has three grown daughters.
Above the two merchants, both physically and in terms of power, was the owner of the building, the United House of Prayer for All People, a predominantly black Pentecostal church based in Washington, which conducted its services on the second floor.
The church was founded in 1926 in Charlotte, N.C., by Bishop C.M. (Daddy) Grace. During the 1920's and 1930's, he was a man accorded mythical stature in Harlem, where he was known as Sweet Daddy. Besides healing people, he sold them a line of products including eggs, coffee, toothpaste and cold cream. All this enabled him to live more than comfortably in a 20-room mansion in Montclair, N.J., and an 85-room estate in Los Angeles.
The church says it has members in 132 cities in 23 states, in numbers variously estimated on a range from 27,000 to three million. Its real-estate holdings include churches, low-rent apartment buildings, day-care centers, cafeterias and senior-citizen homes. The national leader is Bishop Samuel C. Madison.
The church settled on 125th Street in 1936, and today is one of the biggest landlords on the street. Besides the building at 272 West 125th Street that housed Freddy's and the Record Shack, it owns the building directly across the street. One of the tenants is the 125th Street Business Improvement District. The church has plans to develop almost three blocks of housing between Frederick Douglass Avenue and Manhattan Avenue, from 118th to 121st Street
The church recently embarked on a $4.5 million renovation of the building that was to be ravaged by the fire. Because of the work, the local congregation of 300 people is temporarily worshipping on 116th Street. Every August, the church conducts street baptisms on 111th Street using hoses.
"The church had been aggressively trying to do something over there," said Frank Hernandez, a real estate broker in the neighborhood. "If certain things don't fit into a landlord's plans, then they try to make a change."
Its actions suggested that it wished to extract the most out of its land holdings. The Dilrich meat market that had occupied the space taken by Freddy's was told in late 1992 that its lease would not be renewed and it left. Windsor Drugs had a 10-year lease with the church in a space near the meat market. Irving Katz, the owner of the drugstore, said that in July 1993, Malcolm Barksdale, a real estate broker who represented the church, came in and told him that his lease would not be renewed and he had to leave in 60 days. "He said to me, 'You're out,"' Mr. Katz said yesterday. "We're beautifying the church, we need the space, you're out."
At first, Mr. Katz thought the decision was racially motivated, since he was white. But he said the church refused to renew leases for a black-owned shoe-repair shop and an instructional tennis program. "He was the same to blacks as well as to whites," Mr. Katz said. "It was just a question of money."
 
Differing Views A Notice Of No Renewal
From the start, Mr. Harari, Mr. Shange and officials of the church did not see things the same way. Soon after Mr. Harari secured the lease on the space, including the sublease on the Record Shack, he let Mr. Shange know that he would not renew his lease when it expired on Dec. 31, 1995.
Mr. Shange told him he could not leave: "This was my livelihood."
He said he wanted to renew, and he said Mr. Harari told him that to stay he would have to pay more money. A business associate of Mr. Harari said Mr. Shange was paying about $2,500 a month, well below the market rate on a street where rents had been climbing rapidly.
The merchants returned their attentions to their businesses and the months and years passed. Last spring, with the expiration of his lease more clearly in sight, Mr. Shange got edgy. He tried to feel Mr. Harari out about renewing and said he could get no answer. He tried to contact Jeff Sutton, Mr. Harari's real estate partner, but said he did not return his calls. "He started ducking me about discussing the lease," Mr. Shange said.
Finally, the two connected, and Mr. Sutton asked Mr. Shange to make an offer. He came up with a proposal, which he would not divulge, and had a friend present it to Mr. Sutton. "He never responded to us," Mr. Shange said.
Things began to follow the familiar pattern of landlord-tenant confrontations. Mr. Shange turned to the weapon of money. He refused to give the rent check to the man Mr. Harari regularly sent to collect it. "I told him, I want your boss to come pick up the check," Mr. Shange said. "I want your boss to come see me."
Shortly afterward, Mr. Sutton did come to see Mr. Shange. According to Mr. Shange, he told him, "I want to be candid with you. I want you to move out of here. My family is going to take this spot."
Mr. Shange replied, "Really? I'm not going to let you just push me out of here. I'm going to fight back."
The stage was now set for the fourth character to enter this still unremarkable drama, and this was a collective character that could be called the protesters. Its ultimate ambition may not necessarily have been entirely in line with that of its sponsor, Mr. Shange, but it was this character, coupled with actions by the other three, that pushed events toward a disastrous, and utterly unanticipated, denouement.
Feeling he had been drawn into a battle he could not win alone, Mr. Shange appealed to the Harlem community. He had begun laying the groundwork back in April, when he was on a show on a radio station during which he spoke of his problem. He wrote to Representative Charles P. Rangel, the longtime Democrat who represents Harlem, as well as Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright. Increasingly he showed up at street rallies, where he told everyone that his business was in dire jeopardy.
In time, he enlisted the support of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, and Morris Powell, the leader of the 125th Street Vendors Association, which came into being to fight city efforts to remove the illegal vendors from 125th Street.
In September, protesters commenced picketing Freddy's, beseeching shoppers to boycott the store unless it allowed the Record Shack to stay. A petition was circulated advocating that Mr. Shange's store be kept open on 125th Street.
Although Mr. Shange acknowledged in an interview that the church had "double-crossed" him, he apparently rarely made mention of the church in his efforts to muster support. The issue was portrayed more starkly in him-versus-me terms, the him being Fred Harari. Some of those who embraced the cause simplified it further -- a white Jew versus a black.
An article on the matter in The New York Amsterdam News asked, "Could this be the beginning of a systematic attempt to drive viable black-owned businesses out of Harlem? Prior to the 1950's, blacks could not shop on 125th Street, let alone run their own business operations in the area."
Some members of the black community quickly embraced this as a cause with more resonance than a record shop in jeopardy. To them, the black-white friction in Harlem through the decades was somehow embodied in the tapes and CD's that lined its shelves. "This man symbolized the plight of black people in Harlem and their inability to find safety nets and support," said Conrad Muhammad, who heads the Nation of Islam in New York and who supported the boycott. "And so he was a cause celebre."
The protesters themselves became a factor of some consequence. Many were street vendors, some of whom were said to be keen to renew attention to their own situation. Mr. Shange apparently had a mixed view of the vendors. "He hated the peddlers," said Mr. Katz. "They were ruining his business. He once went out there with a machete." Others, however, said Mr. Shange wanted the vendors who sold illegal tapes gone but felt comfortable with others.
To some extent, Mr. Harari, according to associates of his, felt he was caught in a larger game rightfully being played between the church and the Record Shack. One associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Harari needed more money from the Record Shack to meet his own rent to the church. He felt it was unfair that his store was being picketed.
Dismayed by what it saw on the street, the United House of Prayer made itself heard. It asked Mr. Shange to call off the pickets. It said it would offer him a new space on the corner of 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
Mr. Shange agreed. He told the pickets to put down their placards, that he was in negotiations for a new lease. Mr. Shange said his supporters were reluctant to disband until there was something more tangible, but he insisted.
In short order, Mr. Shange said he began discussions with Malcolm Barksdale, the broker representing the United House of Prayer. "He said within three to four days he would come to me with a drafted lease," Mr. Shange said. He thought the dispute had finally come to a satisfactory end.
 
Weeks Pass A Lease Offered And Rejected
Those weeks came and went. After eight weeks, Mr. Shange got suspicious. He appealed to The Amsterdam News to publish an article on his situation. He said that soon after a reporter from that paper called Mr. Barksdale for comment, a lease was delivered to his store.
When he studied its terms, he said, his mood turned bleak again. While he described the rent as "exorbitant," -- others said it was $5,000, double the present rent -- he said that money was not his principal objection. There were clauses and sub-clauses, he said, that compromised his position. He said one clause established a year-long probationary period during which the landlord reserved the right to cancel the lease "for any reason or no reason at all."
In his mind, he said, this was no lease. It was an eviction order.
Mr. Shange said he showed the lease to his lawyer, Douglas Haywood, who he said told him, "You don't have a lease if that clause is in there."
When Mr. Barksdale next came by the Record Shack, Mr. Shange hoped to discuss the lease. First, he said, he complained to Mr. Barksdale about scaffolding that had been erected outside his store without notification. "He walked out," Mr. Shange said. "And he never came back."
Thereupon Mr. Shange notified his supporters that he and his landlord had reached an impasse. The picket line took form again. Fliers were circulated imploring people not to buy from Freddy's. "Freddy didn't have any interest in me being part of anything," Mr. Shange said. "He just wanted me out of there."
Other leaflets also raised questions about the role of the House of Prayer in the dispute. Still others included anti-Semitic language. The police opened a racial bias investigation after they said a security guard told the police that a demonstrator on Nov. 29 said, "Twenty niggers are going to come back and burn and loot the Jews."
Last Saturday, Mr. Sharpton showed up at the picket line and yelled for the owner of Freddy's to come out; he also threatened to go in and sit on the counter. The store manager spoke to Mr. Sharpton, and he appeared to be appeased.
Mr. Shange, though, grew increasingly embittered at both Mr. Harari and the church. Though he said he did not view the dispute entirely in racial terms, he found it shaped by that backdrop. "I saw it this way," he said. "Somebody was being ruthless with me, regardless of his color or creed. Something could have been worked out. Yes, it is a serious problem. There are almost no black businesses in Harlem, and I'm one of the few. If I go out of business, it's going to be very difficult for me to come back."
Some of the people embroiled in the dispute thought Thursday was a pivotal day. On that day, Mr. Harari filed a civil suit in Supreme Court seeking to stop the pickets. The suit named Mr. Shange and the National Action Network. There was to have been a hearing tomorrow.
Mr. Harari's associates said the protest was crimping his business. He began considering closing the store, and though he readied a liquidation sale, associates said nothing was imminent. On Wednesday, Freddy's was shuttered to prepare for the sale. A sign pasted on the window read: "That's it. We've had it. Freddy's 125th Street location only, wall to wall liquidation."
The sale was advertised to start at 11 A.M. on Thursday. However, the doors opened at 9:30 in order to circumvent the picketing. When a dozen or so protesters turned up at 11, they were angered to see the store doing a lot of business.
Some of the protesters, according to an associate of Mr. Harari, chanted, "Bring a casket to work tomorrow."
The next day, the weather turned bitter cold. Collars were turned up against the clawing wind. A little after 10 in the morning, from out of the jostling masses on the sidewalk, the tall gunman appeared. Freddy's was open for business, and when the man went in, the police said, he yelled, "It's on now! All blacks out!"

HEADLINE: HEALTH LOBBYISTS WIN ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDICARE PLAN

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB 

 BODY:
Out of the spotlight of the Medicare debate, the nation's private health plans have obtained a series of technical changes in the overhaul approved by Congress that stand to reap them billions of dollars.
One adjustment would raise the rate by which Government reimbursements would increase next year by several percentage points more than would have been done in previous versions of the legislation, resulting in billions of dollars more for the health-care companies. 
 This was one of several dizzyingly technical changes -- built on what many would consider minutiae -- that the industry vigorously pushed for to improve its fortunes.
The health care industry says these changes would allow health maintenance organizations and other private plans to offer greater benefits and lure enrollees out of the conventional Medicare program, in which the Government pays providers for individual services.
Critics say the adjustments will lead to greater profits for the health care industry but a bleak financial outlook for Medicare, the Federal health care program for the elderly. They say the private plans will attract mostly healthier people, leaving the sickest people, and the greatest costs, to the traditional Medicare program.
Although President Clinton last week vetoed the budget bill containing the Medicare legislation, the adjustments stand a good chance of surfacing in a compromise plan. This is because the Administration proposal for Medicare calls for far more modest cutbacks in money for the plans.
The story of how the industry got largely what it wanted is one of a politically powerful lobby haggling over subtle, lucrative details that few outside Washington even realized existed.
Industry representatives defend the changes. "Congress understands very clearly that to attract people into H.M.O.'s and managed care there has to be sufficient reimbursement so that these managed care plans can continue to provide the kind of comprehensive benefits which attract managed care beneficiaries right now," said Donald B. White, a spokesman for the Group Health Association of America, which represents 1,000 managed care plans and spearheaded the lobbying campaign. "We're not aiming for windfall profits."
Republicans say the adjustments make economic and policy sense. Representative Bill Archer, a Republican from Texas who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the bill "offers beneficiaries the opportunity to choose better coverage while helping stem the rapid growth in the cost of the program."
Clinton Administration officials are cynical about the changes.
Bruce Vladeck, who runs the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the Administration, said he saw the increases in Congress's bill as an effort to "buy off" segments of the health care industry.
"Our take is they're trying to keep the providers happy in the short term and turn on the screws in the long term," he said. "And, as Keynes said, in the long term, we're all dead."
Large profits for private industry, at least early on, are one possible result of the changes, some experts say. "That's why everyone's thinking of getting into this business," said Lynn Etheredge, who headed the health care unit of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter and Reagan Administrations.
He added that the ability of plans to market themselves to healthy Medicare enrollees was the key to financial success. "I think it's going to be profitable in many areas," he said, "and Congress has set it up that way largely to get enrollment."
Under the current Medicare structure, the financing for healthy enrollees, who need relatively little care, in effect subsidizes services for people with serious ailments. If healthy people and ill people end up in separate plans, many fear that services for sicker recipients would suffer.
Among the health-care lobby's other victories in the conference committee that reconciled the House and Senate versions of the bill were these:
*The final bill allows private plans to receive Medicare money for medical education and care of the uninsured, even when they do not send members to teaching hospitals or to institutions that serve uninsured patients. The Senate version of the bill had eliminated these payments.
*The final bill lets stand more of the wide disparity between payments to plans in rural and high-cost urban areas than the Senate bill would have allowed. High fees in many urban areas have led to a profitable expansion of private Medicare plans. Meanwhile, in the final bill, Congress set a minimum payment for low-cost areas, which a Clinton Administration official says could lead to windfall profits.
*The final bill continues to use a basic financing formula for private plans as a jumping off point to compute future payments. This formula has long been criticized as overly generous and a cost to the Medicare program. Alternative formulas, although discussed, were never even seriously considered in Congress.
Even with the changes in Congress's bill, the legislation calls on private plans to absorb tens of billions in reductions in anticipated annual Government payments. The plan would cut $270 billion in projected growth in Medicare spending over seven years, largely by raising recipients' premiums, encouraging recipients to use less costly services provided by private plans, and cutting increases in payments to the plans that had been projected to be far higher.
Mr. Clinton's proposal would cut Medicare's expected growth by $124 billion over seven years. Although his plan would reach its goal through many of the same devices as Congress's bill, he has proposed that they be used far more moderately. In this way, it preserves more of the flavor of the current system for the 37 million older Americans on Medicare, and seeks less in savings from the private plans.
Private insurance companies, and, more recently, managed-care plans have been potent forces on the Washington scene, contributing more than $25 million over 10 years to the two political parties and to Congressional candidates, according to the public interest group Common Cause. Some played a major role in defeating Mr. Clinton's efforts to revamp health care last year.
Another advocacy group, Citizen Action, said that eight leading insurance companies had contributed roughly $375,000 to representatives and senators this year, with roughly 80 percent going to Republicans, including Speaker Newt Gingrich and several committee heads.
In pressing for increases in the money private plans could collect for treating Medicare patients, representatives of four trade organizations decided that the Group Health Association would take the lead, industry sources say.
Association officials, often with allies on hand, argued their case before Mr. Gingrich, who was said to have an unusual understanding of minute financing details, and House and Senate committee heads and staff.
The upshot was that under the final bill, the Government would pay private plans more than in the House and Senate versions. This meant that the savings to the Government would go down and would have to made up elsewhere.
Congressional Budget Office estimates starkly reveal the loss to the Government. Under the House plan, the savings were estimated at $33.6 billion over seven years; under the Senate version, they were estimated to be $10 billion greater.
But under the final legislation, the budget office estimated savings of only $26.9 billion. This was largely if not exclusively because of benefits won by private plans.
Nothing about these estimates is simple; under an alternate computation, the budget office estimated savings of $41 billion in the final bill. But these were still an equal amount below alternate estimates for the House and Senate legislation. Revised estimates are scheduled for release on Tuesday.
The most striking way in which private plans would get more money under the final bill was through the larger increase, of 8 percent, in next year's payments. The House version of the legislation called for an increase of 5.3 percent, and the Senate's, using a more complicated formula, would probably have been lower than that.
Diane Dennett, the health association's vice president in charge of governmental affairs, described the increase as "a very key issue." She said many plans had already begun marketing products based on a fee schedule approved in October by Medicare officials that called for a 10.1 percent increase, the rate the Administration still favors. Indeed, the association pressed for the full 10.1 percent.
Republican Congressional staff members defended the increase for the same reason. They and the association also said in interviews that under Federal regulations, excess payments that plans receive have to be returned to Medicare -- which never happens -- or passed to beneficiaries through benefits or lower premiums.
But skeptics say greater benefits will only draw more enrollees to the plans, which will increase profits, and that it is nearly impossible for Medicare officials to tell whether private plans are tucking excess payments in administrative costs or other areas that are hard to pin down.
The Republican plan also builds future payments on a base that many critics say favors private plans and would cost the Government money. Alternatives were never seriously considered.
Under the financing formula retained for next year in the final bill, the plans receive for each enrollee 95 percent of the average cost for a comparable beneficiary in the traditional Medicare program in the same county. The presumption is that plans save 5 percent because most practice managed care, which tends to hold down costs.
Yet a study two years ago by a private company, Mathematica Policy Research, found that private plans saved twice as much on each beneficiary. This, the report found, was because of economies in managed care and because plans enrolled healthier Medicare patients.
The managed care industry strongly disputes these findings, citing other studies that contend that their clients are similar to Medicare's. But the Mathematica report has been cited as recently as last month by agencies like the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, and the Physicians Payment Review Commission, an advisory council to Congress. This year the commission recommended that in many cases, rates should be set by competitive bidding.
In a report last month, the accounting office said favorable rates had led to an explosion in the number of health maintenance organizations serving the Medicare population, to 164 from 109 in less than 18 months.
Still, Congress stuck with the 95 percent rate. One Congressional staff member said Republicans felt it was important to provide continuity and insure that plans had money for more benefits.
The staff member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also pointed out that although the 95 percent rate applies next year, future increases are based on other figures.
In its plan, the Administration also starts with the 95 percent figure, but provides more generous increases. Mr. Vladeck said his agency, the Health Care Financing Administration, would undertake competitive bidding projects next year.
In further complications, the haggling over the bill continued over how hospitals are paid for the care of the uninsured and how teaching hospitals are paid for education.
Both sums are now included in the average figure computed for the cost of a beneficiary's care in the standard Medicare program. Because of this, these fees are passed to private plans in the 95 percent rate.
But even though plans receive this money, they often do not send patients to hospitals caring for the uninsured or training doctors.
"It does not make much sense to include a payment that was originally intended to be a reimbursement to hospitals for particular costs if those costs are not going to be incurred by the managed care organizations," said John M. Eisenberg, chairman of the Department of Medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center.
Senate Republicans agreed and eliminated the payments in their legislation. But in the conference committee, the payments were restored. Ms. Dennett argued that increasingly, managed care plans were using teaching hospitals and hiring residents.
Representative Archer said that given the sharp reductions in rates to the plans over the years, "we felt that it was important not to further depress rates by taking out funding for teaching hospitals."
Mr. Vladeck said the Administration plan called for the payments to be phased out by 1998.
Members of Congress from low-cost medical areas were also concerned about using costs of care in individual counties as the basis of payments to private plans. Countywide averages vary from less than $200 a month in Fall River County, S.D., to more than $600 in the Bronx.
As a result, private plans compete vigorously for enrollees in high-cost areas like Dade County, Fla. With so much money at their disposal, some plans there have eliminated premiums and offered extra services like free eyeglasses and drugs.
Virtually no private plans are active in 32 lower cost states.
The Senate legislation addressed the disparity by basing payments on a figure made up of a 50-50 mix of countywide costs and national costs, a solution opposed by the industry. The effect would have been to sharply decrease payments in urban areas and upgrade them in rural ones.
The House and the Administration proposed far more moderate approaches to reduce the disparity, each arguing that anything more extreme would cripple plans in high-cost areas.
In the conference committee, the Senate approach was trimmed back. But to address the concerns of rural counties, the final bill includes a floor of $300, which will eventually rise to $350, on monthly payments, regardless of local costs.
The Administration opposes this approach. Mr. Vladeck said, "In a number of those counties anybody who can get an Medicare contract has a good chance at a very significant windfall."
In another potential boon to private plans, the final bill includes a provision not in the House version that would allow plans to increase premiums to a limited degree in certain situations when it appeared Medicare payments would not cover their costs.

HEADLINE: For Yet Another City, U.S. Budget Cuts to the Quick

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MODESTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Two or three times a day, Union Pacific freight trains, some a mile long, snake through the center of this table-flat city in the Central Valley. Rolling along at barely 10 miles an hour, the trains regularly tie up traffic across a 15-block stretch of downtown.
"The joke around here is, 'I was late to a meeting because I was stopped by the Ninth Street train,' " said the city manager, J. Edward Tewes. 
 It's a stale joke, and getting staler. A $24 million, eight-year-old project that counted on a large contribution of Federal money to pay to move the railroad tracks has been trapped in the cross hairs of Washington's battle of the budget. "Without Federal funds," Mr. Tewes said, "that project will not be built in our lifetime."
Similar doubts hang over numerous Federally financed projects and programs in Modesto and Stanislaus County, of which Modesto is the hub. In these as in all American communities, the budget debate's jargon and unfathomable billions are being distilled to something with real meaning for peoples' lives and pocketbooks.
With President Clinton fighting some of the sharpest of the Republican Congress's cuts, details of the budget remain unsettled. But both sides have submitted plans to balance the budget in seven years, which requires massive reductions in spending, and the probable effects are becoming clear. The cuts will hit hardest those who depend most on Federal largesse -- poor people and poor communities.
Some communities sink and swim with the money that supports a military base, for example, or pays for highways and job training in downtrodden pockets of Appalachia. Rich cities like Santa Barbara, Calif., or Aspen, Colo., get relatively little aid and are less constrained in finding ways to pay for services they want to keep.
Modesto, population 179,000, is fairly average. Federal spending helps the poor get housing, the young get jobs, the homebound elderly get meals, addicts get treatment, the city get police and the roads get repaired -- all the little things that help make Modesto a nicer place to live. And that money is shrinking or disappearing.
Overall, cities face some pain and tough political choices in being weaned from the Federal dole. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors, 85 percent of 145 mayors said that the cuts would force them to shrink city services.
Sixty-one percent said they would have to lay off Government workers, and 41 percent said they would have to raise taxes. More than 80 percent said the cuts would impede their ability to reduce crime and homelessness, create jobs and meet basic transportation needs.
 
Cuts Will Be Felt Across the Board
 Here, Federal money helped pay for the county's bold, glass-and-concrete administrative headquarters, the public library, the two-year-old salmon-colored bus depot and a cavernous new welfare services building that on Fridays is quiet as a tomb because the state, fighting its own budget crisis, has shrunk the staff.
But visions of big, new, largely Government-paid projects are fast evaporating. As for the Ninth Street train, officials are betting that Congress will go along with moving the tracks but will deny or postpone money for an overpass they say is essential.
All told, said Reagan M. Wilson, chief executive of Stanislaus County, population 423,000, "I think there will be a fairly significant change."
"Some programs will be cut or eliminated," he said. "The safety net will in the short term get stretched. There may even be some tears in it." He said his work force would shrink, either by attrition or layoffs.
Still, Mr. Wilson sees a silver lining in Washington's retreat. With the spending cuts, Congress is also cutting many of the strings of Federal control and turning more program authority over to state and local governments. And even with less aid, Mr. Wilson said the county would devise better programs.
"The Federal Government doesn't listen to us," he said. "The focus of their debate is not the focus of our debate."
However the county adjusts to the cuts, payoffs will be down the road, said Representative Gary A. Condit, the county's man in Congress. "Decisions have to be made that we prefer not to make to have a balanced budget in a time certain," said Mr. Condit, a Democrat. "That would be a major victory for this county and this country."
Like many California cities, Modesto grows sideways. Mr. Tewes, the city manager, calls it "a city without suburbs." Mr. Wilson, the county executive, calls it "a suburb without a city." Modesto sits in the heart of a fertile agricultural region, a source of fruits and vegetables, milk, wine and nuts. Major employers are tomato canneries and a Gallo winery. Unemployment often exceeds 10 percent because many jobs are tied to harvests.
Federal programs are found throughout this economy. Mr. Wilson says state and Federal spending accounts for two-thirds of his $525 million operating budget. Welfare, at $170 million a year, is the biggest chunk, and of that, more than 60 percent represents cash payments through Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the largest Federal welfare program.
That whole system is changing. As things stand now, the Government will reduce its total payment for welfare and distribute the money in lump sums, known as block grants, to the states, which they can hand out to the poor based on their own criteria. Along with the reduction, Congress will set limits on the grants, so the Federal entitlement of aid for whoever qualifies as poor will end.
"It's an unfunded safety net," said Ciel Chatham, a program manager at the county office of the state's Department of Social Services. To keep costs down, the state will reduce welfare payments to families in communities with a relatively low cost of living like Modesto by 9.8 percent. For a family of two here, that means a reduction to $442 each month from $490. Recipients will also be limited to five years of welfare.
The ensuing impact of a decline in welfare spending that flows into the county, to its landlords and supermarkets, utilities and laundromats, is impossible to calculate yet. "I don't think those people know what's coming," Ms. Chatham said.
 
Unknown Effects On the Job Market
 It is also hard to gauge how another feature of the overhaul of the welfare system -- a requirement that most adult recipients look for jobs -- will affect the economy and the job market. The work requirement collides with provisions in the budget that could make jobs, already scarce in Stanislaus County, even harder to get.
Like most local governments, Stanislaus receives money from the Labor Department to train and retrain workers, including many on welfare, and help them find jobs. But in the budget, spending for job assistance is to be reduced by 20 percent, with the money distributed to the states to spend as they choose.
This comes on top of earlier cuts. Two years ago, William L. May, county director for employment and training, had $1.9 million to steer 700 at-risk youth back into school and train them for work. The program was pared to $418,000 last year, so it reached only 300 youths.
Under another Federal program, Mr. May spent $3 million this year to pay 1,400 teen-agers the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour for public service summer jobs, like cleaning parks and playgrounds. But nothing remains of the program in the likely budget. "You're talking about kids," Mr. May said. "They were doing something. What are they going to do instead of that?"
Crime and drug abuse, lures of idle youth, are already urgent issues. Judy Tognolini, administrative analyst for the Modesto Police Department, said that incidents of violent crime here rose 9 percent during the first six months this year, while statewide it fell 7 percent.
Yet Federally financed efforts to deal with these issues, too, are under the knife.
The Community Oriented Policing Services program, established by the 1994 Federal crime bill, has been helping the city fight the trend. Washington paid $1.5 million and the city $750,000 to add 14 officers to the 200-member police force for three years. But Ms. Tognolini said the Federal grant is unlikely to be renewed.
 
Addicts and Elderly Will Be Hit Hard
 Less is coming, too, for drug and alcohol treatment. Through a Federally subsidized substance abuse program, about 600 clients a year spend a month living in dormitory rooms in a former tuberculosis ward where they receive treatment and help in getting jobs. But the Republican budget would cut the Federal $1.9 million contribution to the program by 13 percent.
In addition, fewer addicts would qualify for admission. At present, substance abuse addiction is considered a disability under the Federal Supplemental Security Income program for the elderly and disabled. That makes indigent addicts eligible for both a welfare check and Government-paid treatment through Medicaid, the health program for the poor.
But in the budget, Congress disallows the addictions as disabilities to qualify for S.S.I. "That system is gone," said Robert H. Allaire, alcohol and drug programs administrator for the Stanislaus Department of Mental Health.
Low-income older people, too, stand to lose something because of cuts in spending under the Older Americans Act, which Congress adopted 30 years ago to help the elderly lead independent lives. It supports a variety of programs here, including one that assures anyone 62 or older a meal a day.
About 600 retirees gather for lunch, games and singing every weekday at 14 sites operated by the Senior Opportunity Service Program throughout the county. About 600 more, who are confined to their homes, are brought one meal a day that is prepared at the largest site, just off Ninth Street downtown.
This is a cheerful, bustling, bare-bones operation with long, covered tables. Guests are invited to put a $2 donation in a locked metal box for their meal, but many do not. Volunteers go table to table passing out portion-controlled meals.
"People come to us because they're in need," said Shirley Mooney, who supervises the countywide service for a nonprofit contractor. Demand for the meals grows 100 or so a year, but Congress has stabilized financing for several years and is now likely to reduce it. "We serve and we serve and we serve," Ms. Mooney said, "and we're going to have to cut it."
She has already closed two meal sites, leaving the 14, laid off three of 17 remaining site workers, and, last month, dismissed one of her eight cooks. But harsher cuts await the people who get meals at home.
"We'll have to re-evaluate them," Ms. Mooney said. "We're going to be getting strict and tough. We want to see if they can get up and get their meal or have a family member do it."
For the old who can get out but do not drive, getting around on Modesto's fleet of 29 buses is becoming more of a hassle because of cuts in Federal operating subsidies. Five years ago, Washington contributed $1 million, which covered 28 percent of the cost of running the buses. This year, it is contributing $455,000, which covers 8 percent.
City officials expect the Federal subsidy to be cut in half again in the new budget. "I'm sure that in the next seven years, they're going to zero out operating assistance," said Fred Cavanah, city transit manager.
To cope with the reductions, the city raised fares a nickel in July, to 75 cents. Another raise of at least a nickel is likely next July. "What we'll probably do," said Mr. Tewes, the city manager, "is a combination of service reduction and a fare increase."
To keep fares from rising more, he said, the city will divert money from maintenance of Modesto's wide, unblemished asphalt roads. The new Federal budget, said Mr. Tewes, "means more potholes."

HEADLINE: Talks on Rebuilding Bosnia Become Squabble Over Bill

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The United States and more than 40 other countries completed a two-day meeting here today on planning the reconstruction of Bosnia, but progress was slowed by the sheer scale of the problems, from repatriating refugees and rebuilding houses to restarting the shattered economy.
The countries did not even try to address the critical question of who would pay for a program that in the long run could cost $5 billion or more. And while they settled on Carl Bildt, the former Swedish Prime Minister and European envoy to the Bosnia peace talks, to lead the civilian reconstruction effort, they only touched on the complexities of specific issues, such as how to create a central bank, or a police force that will be accepted by Muslims, Croats and Serbs. 
 The United States and its major European allies used the conference to repeat that their commitment to bringing peace and stability to the former Yugoslavia did not end with the dispatch of troops to Bosnia. For peace to take root, they said, governments and international agencies would have to work together to create out of the rubble of war the physical, political, legal and economic foundations of a stable society.
The presence of 60,000 NATO troops in Bosnia "can help insure that the wounds of war do not reopen during the next year," Madeleine K. Albright, the American representative to the United Nations, told the conference today. "But the only concentrated therapy that can heal those wounds is the hard work of restoring Bosnia's economy, democracy and respect for the rule of law."
For all the talk of help, though, delegates to the conference acknowledged that efforts to turn their commitment into action would be complex, time-consuming, expensive and potentially fraught with conflicts among the many countries and international organizations taking part in them.
No one was able to say in any detail, for example, how and when the two million to three million people who were forced from their homes, including around 1.7 million who are refugees outside of Bosnia, would get the chance to return home.
Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said there had not yet been any comprehensive survey of what housing was available in what towns, and that it remained unclear how much it might cost to provide housing for those who wanted to return. Many other issues remained unresolved, as well, including whether refugees who have not returned to Bosnia by the time elections are held, probably next summer, could vote by absentee ballot.
"I realize very much the complexity and immensity of the task," Mrs. Ogata said.
The United Nations was given the task of providing a temporary police force, and said it would try to recruit 1,500 officers from member nations to provide a skeletal law-enforcement agency and begin recruiting and training Bosnians for the job.
J. Brian Atwood, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said one of the biggest challenges would be creating a functioning economy in a country that had not only been decimated by war, but that had not really even begun the shift from Communism to capitalism before fighting broke out.
To begin economic redevelopment would require steps like setting up a central bank and a currency, and rebuilding factories and roads, delegates said.
Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's Foreign Minister, said the country's goal was to restore the per capita income of its citizens, which is now almost nothing, to two-thirds of its prewar level in five years. He said Bosnia would need at least $1 billion a year in international aid for the next three to five years to rebuild the economy.
"Promises of money are like checks in the mail, but when it comes to the international community we hope the story is different this time," Mr. Sacirbey said. "In this case real peace can be bought in part with money."
But even before there were any comprehensive independent estimates of the cost of reconstruction, the United States and Europe were haggling over who would pay how much.
Before the conference, the Clinton Administration rejected a proposal by France that the United States and Europe each pay a third of the reconstruction bill, with the rest picked up by wealthy Islamic countries that have supported the Muslim-led Bosnian Government during the war and by other wealthy nations like Japan.
Citing its budget difficulties and the need to focus on winning Congressional support for sending 20,000 American troops to Bosnia, the Administration has proposed paying around $600 million, about a third of what Europe wants the United States to contribute.
Administration officials contend that the bulk of the costs should be borne by the countries of the European Union because Bosnia is basically their problem.
"We think that the E.U. should do more and that a third is exorbitant for us," said Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser.

HEADLINE: Black Leader in Congress Chosen to Run N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Hoping for a leader to bring it back to fiscal health and political relevance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored people today chose Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland as its chief executive officer.
The civil rights organization's board of directors chose the 47-year-old Congressman to fill the N.A.A.C.P.'s top staff job, which had been vacant for more than two years since the group's former executive director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., was dismissed after being accused of financial mismanagement and sexual harassment. Several board members said today's vote had been unanimous. 
 Mr. Mfume, who has represented Baltimore, the site of N.A.A.C.P. headquarters, as well as several suburbs west of the city since 1987, said he would step down from his Congressional seat in mid-February. In giving up his seat, Mr. Mfume is signaling his belief that, for the moment, he can be more effective outside the Republican-controlled House than within it.
"I am absolutely honored to have been chosen for this opportunity," Mr. Mfume (pronounced Kwah-EEE-see Oom-FOO-may) said at a news conference after the vote. He promised to restore the organization's "financial, political and spiritual health."
In recent months, as events like the O. J. Simpson trial, the Million Man March and the debate over affirmative action have pushed race relations to the forefront of the national agenda, the N.A.A.C.P. has been paralyzed by internal squabbles and financial difficulties. Officials say the last time the board of directors had a meaningful debate over policy was when it was considering whether to endorse the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in 1991. The board finally opposed him.
While the N.A.A.C.P. has turned inward, other groups and individuals, including Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, have moved forward, angering traditional allies of the civil rights movement like Jews and worrying white liberals.
Speaking of the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Mfume said, "We must, without equivocation or timidity, reclaim our rightful place as the voice of African-Americans and others who believe in the power and the premise that all people are in fact created equal."
The selection of Mr. Mfume marks the completion of efforts by reformers within the N.A.A.C.P. to revamp its leadership, an effort that often laid bare regional and class divisions within the group, the country's oldest and largest civil rights organization. In the past two years, these reformers succeeded in ousting Mr. Chavis and William F. Gibson, who was replaced as chairman of the board last February by Myrlie Evers-Williams.
In accepting the job, Mr. Mfume vowed to revitalize the N.A.A.C.P., which is still staggering under a $3.2 million debt and recovering from internal bickering in recent years and from charges of corruption on the part of its top leaders.
His acceptance of the position marks a personal odyssey for Mr. Mfume, who rose from being a street tough in Baltimore who fathered five children out of wedlock to becoming the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus at a time when the Democrats controlled Congress.
His selection is a clear sign that the organization, which has been casting about for direction, will be emphasizing political themes like voter registration, education and lobbying. It also marks a change in direction for the organization's leadership: Mr. Mfume will become the first head of the N.A.A.C.P. since Roy Wilkins stepped down in 1977 whose background was not that of a clergyman.
In giving its top job to Mr. Mfume, the group has opted to rely on a person whose skills are more in the area of political organizing and strategy than in oratory and appeals to morality.
Mr. Mfume's decision to give up a safe Congressional seat, to which he has been re-elected by large margins four times, is a signal of how the Republican takeover of Congress has transformed the dreams and strategies of black politicians. Once considered one of the most powerful black figures in the country and a person who aspired to be the first black Speaker of the House, Mr. Mfume is taking over a debt-ridden organization whose staff has fewer than 50 people.
With the Republicans in charge, several black members of Congress, including Mr. Mfume and Representative Cleo Fields, who recently ran unsuccessfully for the Louisiana governorship, now say their political goals and ambitions can be better served outside Congress.
"I am convinced without reservation that I can best affect the social, economic and political change in the broader capacity that the N.A.A.C.P. represents," Mr. Mfume said.
By choosing Mr. Mfume, a veteran and telegenic Congressman, the 64-member board is conceding power in the running of the day-to-day activities of the group back to the chief executive officer. Since the 1980's, when the former executive Benjamin L. Hooks barely survived an attempt to oust him, power within the organization has flowed from the top staff position to the often-fractious and unwieldy board.
Indicative of this shift in power is the new title the board gave to Mr. Mfume's job, changing it from executive director to president and chief executive officer. Mr. Mfume said the change in title "represented a new power position" within the N.A.A.C.P.
Mr. Mfume was chosen after a five-month search by a special nine-member committee made up of board members and representatives of corporations, universities and the bar. The committee, headed by A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., a retired Federal judge from Philadelphia, employed the executive search firm Russell Reynolds & Associates. The committee interviewed more than 200 applicants for the position. In keeping with its mandate, the committee presented only one name -- Mr. Mfume's -- to the board for ratification.
The choice elated many members of the board, particularly the reformers. "This is someone we admire, that we trust and that we have high hopes for to turn the organization around," Ms. Evers-Williams said.
But other longtime critics of the organization were less sanguine over Mr. Mfume's prospects of revitalizing the N.A.A.C.P.
"It's an organization which is now moribund, discredited and financially insolvent," said Michael Meyers, president of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. "The N.A.A.C.P. is, I think, now a relic, a dinosaur that is about to be put out to pasture. All the naming of an executive director will do is give it some blip on the screen of a faint heartbeat."
Mr. Mfume takes on a formidable task. In addition to the debt, he has been bequeathed a board that in recent years has provided little help in gaining access to money or political power and has spent most of its time meddling in the organization's day-to-day operations.
Today, Mr. Mfume endorsed the idea of reducing the board's size, saying that "you will soon see real and meaningful efforts toward addressing the problem of size in such a way that we have a more manageable operation."

HEADLINE: Russia, Vexing Partners, Asks For Changes in Space Station

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Russia is proposing changing the planned international space station by incorporating all or part of the Russians' existing Mir orbiting outpost into the design. The move is causing concern among other nations that are partners in the project, including the United States, which oppose any change that might add to the program's costs or delay its completion.
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say that they do not know exactly what changes in the international station the Russians want. They are to get details in the coming week, when a delegation of Russian space agency and industry officials arrives in Houston to outline the proposal. 
 The delegation, headed by Boris Ostroumov, deputy general director of the Russian agency, is to meet on Friday at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston with officials of the space station program. Engineers at Johnson have been informally assessing the feasibility of a number of options that would incorporate Mir components into the international station, known as Alpha, said people within and outside of NASA who are familiar with the situation.
Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, raised the issue of using Mir as part of Alpha last month when Wilbur Trafton, NASA's space station director, and other American officials were in Russia during a joint mission involving an American shuttle's docking with Mir. Mr. Trafton told Mr. Koptev then that the United States would not consider redesigning the space station.
This week Ray Castillo, a NASA spokesman, reiterated the agency's position that the station would not be redesigned. But he said NASA would evaluate proposals that might cut project costs or speed completion of the station. "If a proposal increases cost, delays the schedule or compromises safety, we will not agree to it," Mr. Castillo said.
Russia is building Alpha's propulsion module -- the unit that will steer and stabilize the entire station -- and several other crucial components; the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan are contributing science laboratories, living quarters, solar power units and other segments. Some of the international partners, who were wary when Russia joined the effort as a full partner in 1993 and are under pressure to hold down their costs in the undertaking, are concerned that changes proposed by the Russians could jeopardize the project, experts said.
Experts on Moscow's space program said Russia, which continues to face severe economic problems, wanted to incorporate Mir into the Alpha project because using some existing equipment would cut its costs. One option being discussed, they said, is substituting two of Mir's newest scientific modules, called Spektr and Priroda, for new research components that Russia is supposed to build for Alpha.
Mir, which is almost 10 years old, is believed by many to be nearing the end of its useful life. But Spektr, which is equipped for biomedical and atmospheric research, is only a year old. And Priroda, designed to study the Earth's resources and the oceans, will not be attached to Mir until next year.
The first components of Alpha, which are in advanced stages of construction, are scheduled to be launched into space in late 1997. The entire outpost, which will serve as a permanent orbital base for six astronauts, is to be completed by 2002. Any changes that disrupt this timetable or result in higher costs may put the $35 billion project into deep trouble politically and endanger its completion, space experts said.
NASA's Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, and other officials have maintained for almost two years that the design of Alpha is final. It is a scaled-down version of a larger proposed station, Freedom, that went through several costly redesigns over a decade, resulting in an expense of billions of dollars with little to show for it.
Given assurances that the project now can be brought in on time and without cost overruns, Congress has supported it as a cornerstone of international cooperation and a source of jobs for the aerospace industry.
A space expert on the staff of a House committee that oversees NASA, who spoke on the condition that he not be otherwise identified, said lawmakers were waiting to see what Russia proposed. "We're going to be looking at this very hard," he said. "If they propose something that compromises the cost or schedule, or undermines U.S. leadership of the project, it's going to meet a lot of resistance on Capitol Hill."

HEADLINE: Hearing Held On Gay Issues In the Schools

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
After years of local skirmishes between religious conservatives and gay advocates, the battle over how school curriculums deal with homosexuality moved to Capitol Hill this week.
A two-day hearing before a House Economic and Educational Opportunities subcommittee was seen by both sides as a significant national forum, but the circumstances of the hearing proved more controversial than the testimony itself. 
 Conservatives are angry that taxpayers' money is being used to support programs they think expose children to dangerous, offensive sexual practices, in the guise of AIDS education, and advocate homosexuality by teaching that it is unobjectionable. They see the role of parents as moral exemplars being undermined by teachers and school administrators.
Gay groups and their allies, like the Parents, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays, fear that the conservatives will weaken AIDS-prevention efforts and dismantle programs they believe are needed to foster understanding and acceptance of homosexuals, especially given the violence and ostracism faced by lesbian and gay youth.
Given that atmosphere, both sides tried to exploit the political potential of the hearing, even though Representative Peter Hoekstra, a Republican from Michigan who heads the subcommittee, insisted that the focus was neither homosexuality nor AIDS. Rather, he said, the theme was "parents reclaiming their role as the primary and most important teachers of values."
But Mr. Hoekstra acknowledged that the hearing, titled "Parents, Schools and Values," had been controversial long before he gaveled it into order Tuesday.
In August, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition and an outspoken opponent of gay rights, sent a letter to his supporters noting that before Representative Newt Gingrich became Speaker, "he promised us he would hold a hearing on the promotion of homosexuality in the public schools."
As a result, gay groups mistrusted the hearing from the outset, in the belief that it was a platform that Mr. Gingrich had offered to Mr. Sheldon.
Mr. Gingrich's sister, Candace J. Gingrich, a spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian and gay political organization, said news accounts and Mr. Sheldon's own words "strongly suggest that this Congressional hearing is a political payoff to a fringe group."
And Mr. Sheldon did little to dispel the impression that he had set things in motion. "All I can say is that the commitment was made and the hearings are held," he said Tuesday as he stood outside the hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building.
"But these are not my hearings because I'm not a member of Congress," Mr. Sheldon said. "The Speaker made the commitment that he would have a member of Congress do them. I am so thrilled that Peter Hoekstra has held these hearings. I am 100 percent pleased at the nature of the hearings. And I feel my commitment has been fulfilled."
Mr. Hoekstra denied that there was any connection. "I've never talked with the Speaker on this," he said. "I don't sit here and wait for Newt Gingrich to tell me to do this or do that."
"I can't take accountability and responsibility for what Lou Sheldon says this hearing is going to be," Mr. Hoekstra continued, "and I can't take accountability and responsibility for how the Human Rights Campaign describes this hearing. That's their business."
Mr. Hoekstra traced the hearing's origin to town meetings, school visits and conversations with constituents in his western Michigan district. He said he had talked to teachers who were struggling with unfamiliar issues in the classroom and to parents who felt they had to educate their children at home.
In the end, the tenor of the hearing was largely subdued, as Mr. Hoekstra had insisted it would be. A spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, David M. Smith, said that "because of the public outcry, it ended up much tamer than it could have been."

HEADLINE: Death on 125th Street: The Prelude;
Officials Tell of Efforts to Stave Off Trouble

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
Elected officials and civic leaders in Harlem said yesterday that they had begun making efforts in the last few weeks to mediate the real estate dispute on 125th Street that apparently lay behind the arson attack on a white-owned clothing store Friday that left a gunman and seven store workers dead.
Sikhulu Shange, whose small record store was being forced off the block, had contacted, among others, the area's longtime Representative, Charles B. Rangel; the state Assemblyman, Keith L. T. Wright, the City Councilwoman representing the district, C. Virginia Fields, and the local community board for help in his dispute with Freddy's clothing store, which held his lease, and with the building's owner, the United House of Prayer for All People, a predominantly black church. 
 "We've spoken several times," Mr. Wright said outside the smoldering store on Friday. "I was supposed to get all the parties together this week."
But before the meeting could be set up, a black gunman barged into Freddy's clothing store on Friday morning, setting it on fire and shooting fleeing white construction workers, wounding three. The gunman, who has not been identified, died of smoke inhalation, along with seven employees trapped in the building.
The police had been carefully watching the dispute, opening a racial bias investigation after they said they received a report on Nov. 29 that a picket had said "twenty niggers are going to come back and burn and loot the Jews."
Deputy Inspector Joyce Stephen, the commander of the 28th Precinct, said the police had made efforts to mediate the dispute, talking to the store owners, landlord and pickets, warning them to avoid trouble.
Inspector Stephen said extra patrol officers had been assigned to the block, with larger details posted when pickets turned up. In addition, she said, two community affairs officers were assigned to the dispute. As part of the bias investigation, the protests were videotaped, and the police said the dead suspect had been among the pickets on one occasion.
The stunned and chastened political leaders, storekeepers and other Harlem residents gathered yesterday morning at the 28th Precinct station house -- which Friday night had echoed with the anguished screams of the families of the victims -- to hear Inspector Stephen review what the police had learned thus far and voice their thoughts.
Representative Rangel, among others, voiced fears that the incident would threaten the economic rebirth of 125th Street by scaring off shoppers.
"Headlines say Harlem is under siege," Mr. Rangel said. "We need to believe it's safe to shop on 125th."
But others wondered how the dispute, which had been a public issue for months, had been allowed to fester for so long.
"I know the police have a responsibility to find out what's going on," the Rev. Betty Neal, a street preacher, said at the meeting. "I hear a lot of things on the street. I predicted three weeks ago as I was passing Freddy's that something terrible was going to happen."
At City Hall, officials said the Giuliani administration had not been aware of the problem until the shooting and fire broke out on Friday.
"It was handled on a local basis," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said at a news conference at Police Headquarters yesterday.
But Ms. Fields said that Mr. Shange had come to her with his problem and that he had also raised it again as recently as Wednesday evening at a meeting of Harlem's Community Board 10.
Barbara Askins, chairwoman of the community board, said that at one point a few weeks ago the dispute appeared to be settled, "but then it escalated again."
At the meeting, Malcolm Barksdale, who manages the United House of Prayer's extensive real estate holdings, approached Terence Tolbert, an aide to Assemblyman Wright, for help in mediating the dispute with Mr. Shange.
"I think if we just had another 24 hours, maybe we could have just sat down and figured out how to solve it," Mr. Tolbert said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A New Salt Mine;
One-Industry Town Presses for State Aid

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: CUYLERVILLE, N.Y.

 BODY:
Just before dawn on March 12, 1994, an earthquake rumbled across the gentle slopes and rich flood plains of the Genesee River Valley here, 30 miles south of Rochester.
The tremor, registering 3.6 on the Richter scale, did not come from a natural shift in a fault; it was the sound of the largest salt mine in the Americas dying. 
 A thousand feet beneath this village, on the southern fringe of the Retsof Salt Mine, a roof slab larger than the field at Yankee Stadium fell to the floor.
No one was hurt, but the mine -- an 18-square mile hive of chambers excavated over a century by four generations of miners -- began to flood. One million gallons of water an hour gushed through the breach from aquifers above.
Twenty-one months and 15 billion gallons later, office workers at Akzo Nobel Salt, the mine's owner, were jokingly taking bets on when the last pockets of air would be forced from the now-abandoned mine.
But jokes are the exception these days in Livingston County. With more than 200 miners laid off when the mine was sealed forever in September, local officials, miners and employees of related businesses are pressing state environmental officials to quickly issue Akzo Nobel a permit for a new $120 million mine three miles from Cuylerville.
Interest in keeping salt mining here extends far beyond the hills of the Genesee Valley. The old mine had provided much of the road salt for New York State, New York City and New England. A salt stockpile sufficient for two average winters is on hand, Akzo officials say, but if the new mine is delayed or denied, customers will have to start importing salt at a higher cost.
The old mine had also bolstered the state economy by providing work for truckers and railroads, so the Pataki administration, over the objections of some environmentalists, has put the permit on a fast track.
To insure that Akzo Nobel builds a new mine in Livingston County and not in Canada, the Caribbean or another state, Gov. George E. Pataki and county officials have pressed ahead with a $53 million package of state and local tax breaks and other incentives first proposed by the Cuomo administration.
While other industrial icons, like steel mills or nuclear power plants, tend to loom over the communities around them, the salt mine here lay hidden for more than a century. Under a largely agrarian landscape, the mine expanded underground, chamber by chamber, as crews sawed, blasted and hauled away 130 million tons of salt from a 400-million-year-old bed left behind by a dried-up sea.
 
Commuting to Work Amid Salt Columns
 One miner, who declined to be identified, recalled the wonder of going to work by riding an elevator 1,100 feet down, then speeding off for a 45-minute drive through a maze of broad white salt pillars and dark chambers extending seemingly to infinity.
"Going into some of those old workings was like going back into time," he said. "It was like history back in there. Now it's all underwater."
The mine had seen fatalities and small cave-ins but was considered relatively safe. Salt was not a health hazard or pollutant, like coal. So no one except a few grass-roots environmentalists kept tabs on its progress or problems. Their main concern was the company's plan to store hazardous ash from municipal incinerators in empty chambers.
Today, residents still grapple with the scars left by the disaster: as subterranean salt dissolved, two sinkholes hundreds of feet in diameter gobbled farmland and swallowed 70-foot-tall trees. A bridge collapsed. Dozens of wells were sucked dry. Several square miles of the Genesee Valley sank eight feet, with the entire area over the mine complex expected eventually to follow. Small tremors have continued almost monthly and hip-deep cracks have opened in farmers' fields.
Malodorous hydrogen sulfide and explosive methane seeped from the ground. Akzo installed wells and ignited the gas, and company engineers say the flares should subside as water fills the mine.
That is little consolation to Dean Pendergast, a Federal agriculture analyst whose bedroom faces the gas flares. He and his wife had gotten used to the clockwork regularity of blasting deep in the Retsof mine, which took place every night at 11 P.M. and grew steadily louder in the months before the cave-in.
But Mr. Pendergast said he cannot get used to the idea that the house he and his wife worked so hard for now sits next to flaming gas and a man-made bog. Although Akzo bought other properties near the collapse, he said, it has offered him only a guaranteed mortgage for a buyer should he sell his house next year. But buyers will not be lining up quickly, he said.
"All night long we close the blinds," Mr. Pendergast said. "But we still see that flickering."
Akzo's consultants argue that a break or flaw in the overlying layers of rock, which could not have been foreseen, precipitated the collapse.
But several miners say that they told mine managers about the danger. They continued cutting, blasting and hauling, they said, because they made bonuses of $1,000 a week or more for high salt production.
 
Fierce Snowstorms Put Salt in Demand
 Another possible contributing factor, miners say, was the unprecedented demand for salt in the brutal winter of 1993-94 -- a winter in which National Guard troops had been enlisted to truck salt from the Retsof mine and miners worked round the clock. In fact, the day of the collapse was the first day off in a two-month stretch.
Given the problems at the old mine and the deep pockets of Akzo's parent company, Akzo Nobel N.V., a Dutch conglomerate with more than $12 billion in annual sales, some state legislators are beginning to challenge the need for state aid for the new mine -- which includes $10.5 million in mass transportation funds for a rail line used only for salt.
"The best you can say about them, from their own testimony and experts, is that they went forward with an unusual technique without checking out the consequences," said Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's environmental conservation committee, which has held several hearings on the mine collapse.
He questioned the logic of taxpayers' providing millions, even though Akzo's insurers have balked at reimbursing the company for the loss of the mine because of unresolved design questions. Akzo, in turn, has sued its insurers.
"Is there any degree of corporate culpability at which you say, 'You haven't earned this amount of public money?' " Mr. Brodsky said.
But state mining officials say Akzo has dealt with the disaster honorably, paying for years of studies of changes in groundwater and other effects of the collapse and agreeing to fix the collapsed bridge and other damage.
The Livingston County Board of Supervisors is unanimous in its support of the new mine, said James M. Steele, the board's chairman. That appears to be the prevailing attitude around the valley, where many residents have depended on salt mining for work or have sold mineral rights to the company.
A local citizens' group, Friends of Akzo Nobel Salt, collected 10,000 signatures on a petition supporting the mine proposal, said the group's president, Bill Lubanski.
"Accidents happen all the time," he said. "Look at the space shuttle. You have to build from mistakes and go forward. That's what makes the economy grow."
Early this month, the old Retsof mine was still abuzz with activity -- at least on the surface. With winter fast approaching, front-end loaders attacked one flank of a 10-story, 2.5-million-ton mountain of salt extracted from the mine before it was flooded.
In an office nearby, the plant manager, Kenneth R. Cox, acknowledged that, in the weeks leading to the 1994 collapse, miners had expressed concern about unstable conditions. He said that, because of the record demand for salt that winter, "a chaotic form of management" had taken hold at Retsof that may have contributed to delays in responding to such reports.
But he defended the new mining technique, in which salt is excavated in a pattern that leaves thick abutments around the perimeter of a chamber but only slender pillars supporting the middle of the roof. The new technique was thought by mining engineers to be safer, and more productive, than the traditional pattern, in which 80- by 80-foot pillars separate excavated chambers of a similar size.
Mr. Cox said the disaster had left the managers and miners in shock, adding that they had just begun to mine in a new salt layer 100 feet beneath the old layer. "We had 200 years to go," he said.
 
The Lonely Voice Of an Opponent
 But Melissa Jacobs, an organic farmer and environmental activist whose husband, Tim, is a fourth-generation salt miner, said that too many people had chosen to overlook questions about the destruction of the old mine -- and to attack critics of Akzo -- in their desperation to keep the new mine on track.
As Mrs. Jacobs and her husband shared a dinner of chili and fresh-baked bread with several people whose property was affected by the collapse, she described death threats the couple had received for fighting the mining company on other fronts in years past.
For several years Mrs. Jacobs had challenged Akzo Nobel's ash storage proposal. Although it could have provided the company with additional income, she contended it would have threatened the local environment. She held up snapshots of hate messages directed at the Jacobses spray-painted on the rock-salt walls of the mine.
Mr. Jacobs, who calculated that his family had put in 338 years of work at the Retsof mine, proudly displayed a copy of a letter from his wife, published in a local newspaper on Dec. 21, 1993, three months before the collapse, that constituted the only printed prediction that a catastrophe loomed.
"Why are they creating unsafe conditions and endangering their own miners' lives by 'pillar robbing,' the salt supports that stabilize underground rooms?" the letter read.
A friend and local newspaper columnist, Howard Russell, chimed in, saying, "When she warned everybody about the danger, they said she was a crackpot. When her warnings came true, they said she was a witch."
Mrs. Jacobs said that fear of losing jobs has given Akzo Nobel a stranglehold on the community. "Sometimes," she said, "I feel like I'm living in the United States of Akzo, not the United States of America."

WHAT HAPPENED: A Mine's Collapse
The Retsof Salt Mine, owned by Akzo Nobel Salt Inc., was closed in September after roof collapses in two parts of the mine allowed the 6,000 acre underground site to fill with water. As a result, much of the land above the mine has sunk, in some places by as much as eight feet.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Tax Giveaway

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki of New York came of age politically in the 1980's, and he obviously remembers Ronald Reagan's intended lesson: cut taxes first, and everything else will follow. If your goal is to unravel the social safety net, the rule is an excellent one. But if Mr. Pataki wants to govern responsibly, he should rethink his strategy.
Mr. Pataki's second state budget will be unveiled Dec. 15. By all reports it will include proposals for drastic cuts in welfare, Medicaid and other state programs. Anyone who objects will be challenged to come up with another way to close what he now says is at least a $4 billion budget gap. 
 The gap is partly the result of a whopping personal income tax cut approved by the Legislature earlier this year. The loss of revenue from the tax cut was only $575 million in 1995. The bulk of the lost revenue -- an additional $2.3 billion -- will come next year. A further $1.9 billion reduction in revenue will come in 1997.
Had the Legislature been asked to choose between tax cuts and home health care or reasonable tuition at state colleges, the tax bill might never have been passed. But Mr. Pataki urged the cut-now-pay-later approach and the Legislature happily reduced taxes without considering the consequences for the "out" years. The process was all the easier because the budgeting process does not require long-term planning. The state has always looked at its finances one year at a time.
Another player here is Mario Cuomo, whose deferred tax cuts littered his budgets like land minds. When Mr. Cuomo's political career ended, he left behind a schedule of future tax cuts so badly drawn that they would have benefited the wealthy while forcing some poor New Yorkers to pay more. The Cuomo cuts would have gone into effect automatically this year if the Assembly Democrats and the Republicans had not created an alternative.
Like Mr. Reagan, Governor Pataki originally promised that tax cuts would be paid for with a vague mixture of efficient government and increased revenues from a rising economy. But now the real costs are coming clear. All the proposals the Legislature rejected last year as too harsh are likely to be back again, with less leeway to find an alternative. The Governor reportedly will seek a one-month-per-year limit on home relief for single adults, and is considering a cut of up to 26 percent in welfare payments to families with dependent children.
The Republican leader of the Senate, Joseph Bruno, says his own plans for a budget include still more tax reductions, which he would be happy to pass now and implement later. The largest, repeal of a 4.25 percent tax on utility company power sales, would cost the state nearly $1 billion more a year.
The last thing the state needs is another deferred tax cut. But dropping the utility tax, which is particularly burdensome on manufacturers, would be a good substitute for some of the personal tax reductions scheduled to kick in over the next few years. The Legislature should revisit the whole tax-cut plan, and retain only those reductions it can truly afford to implement.

HEADLINE: MARKET TIMING

 BODY:

Tuesday
 
The Labor Department is to report producer prices for November. Some economists expect an increase of one-tenth of a percentage point, after a drop of that amount in October.
 
Morgan Stanley is to tell employees the size of their 1995 bonuses. Over all, Wall Street bonuses are expected to rise 15 percent to 20 percent from last year's levels, reflecting the bull market.
 
Wednesday
 
The Commerce Department reports retail sales for November. Analysts expect a rise of about five-tenths of a point; sales fell two-tenths of a point the month before.
 
Thursday
 
Important reports are due out on consumer prices and industrial production. Analysts predict a very modest rise of two-tenths of a point in consumer prices; energy prices probably rose the same amount. Consumer prices were up three-tenths of a point in October. Industrial output was probably unchanged or barely lower, after falling four-tenths of a point.
 
Financial markets are looking to see whether the German central bank lowers interest rates. That could weaken the mark somewhat, and help exporters. The Bonn Government, which was predicting economic growth of close to 3 percent this year, now is hoping for 2 percent.
 
A Balkan peace agreement is to be signed in Paris. That could lead to the sending of 20,000 American troops to Bosnia for a year, according to a Pentagon estimate.
 
Friday
 
The budget negotiators in Washington face another deadline. The spending authority for agencies employing hundreds of thousands of workers is set to expire today. Unless a deal is worked out, or another temporary budget is agreed to, the workers could be sent home again.
 
Sprint's proposed alliance with the French and German phone monopolies is expected to be approved by the F.C.C.

HEADLINE: Death on 125th Street: The Victims;
A Cross-Section of the City's Everyday People

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
The gunman had burst in and opened fire, yet none of the seven had been hit. Spared, several ran in fear to the back of the store. Others, hearing the gunfire above, took cover in the basement. But the flight to what they believed was safety was an awful mistake. The gunman had set fire to the store.
Those who were shot, it turned out, were the lucky ones and fled with their lives; none of the seven who dodged gunfire survived. Their oxygen was stolen by the smoke of the fire, their lives gone moments later. 
 Dead in the silence of the cinders were a cross-section of the city's minimum-wage workers. Among them were five women, all barely beyond high school, who had worked at Freddy's, a retail clothing store in the economic heart of Harlem, for no more than $4.50 an hour. For some, the wages went for modest purposes -- jewelry, to finance nights of dancing, to pay a 19-year-old's telephone bills. For others, the money went for the urgent daily cause of helping keep households in the Bronx afloat.
"Hers was just a job to pay her bills," Elmys Rentas said of her sister, Mayra, one of the seven workers killed in the deadly assault on Freddy's. "But she was happy there. It was money so she could just live."
For friends and family yesterday, the initial shock of the deaths of the seven workers was giving way to an enervating hurt.
Khahejha Brunner, a 13-year-old girl preparing to perform today in the New York City Housing Authority's 26th annual talent show, walked through her routine knowing that her uncle, Kareem, 22, wouldn't be in the audience. On 168th Street in the Bronx, Melvin Martinez, 8, spent Friday night sleeping in an apartment empty of his only sister's laughter.
In Jackson Heights, Queens, Silvana Ramautar, who was used to spending evenings without her husband, for he worked seven days a week, sat in her bedroom. But yesterday, not even midnight would bring back Garnette Ramautar, who was 43.
In an apartment on Harrison Avenue in the Bronx, the two children of Luz Ramos -- 3 years old and 9 months -- played with neighbors as, downstairs, others spoke of their dead mother. And at Mayra Rentas's mother's apartment, 7-year-old Michael Rentas had his coat buttoned.
"I love her," Michael said of his 22-year-old sister. "I miss her." Then he went to play in the snow.
 
 Kareem Brunner
In a project apartment building on Webster Avenue in the Bronx, a shrine had been erected for Kareem Brunner in the Nigerian tradition of his family. There were bottles of holy water. There was a photograph of the 22-year-old. There was a prayer book, and a handprinted list of seven dead relatives.
Mr. Brunner had gone to Bronx Community College for a year, and he had recently gone to work in the Bronx at a Freddy's outlet, one of the three stores owned by Fred Harari. Several months ago he accepted an offer to help out with security at the 125th Street store. He worried enough about the protests against the store to warn his sister to stay away, but he himself felt secure.
His income, while modest, went to help his mother, Trina Williams, who lives on public assistance.
"He went on and did his job," said his mother. "He said, 'If they close up, I'll find another job.' He said security jobs were easy to get."
Mr. Brunner, known as Slim to his friends, was said to have avoided the worst perils of the street. One of the two photographs on his bedroom walls was of a stack of dollar bills and coins.
" 'This is going to be me one day, Mom -- Money Man,' " Trina Williams remembered him saying.
Instead, Mr. Brunner's family remembered the way he looked when his sister and brother identified him at the morgue Friday night.
"His mouth was puckered up," Trina Williams said, "like he was trying to get that last breath."
 
Cynthia Martinez
The friends of Ms. Martinez remembered the 19-year-old as a women with a tough exterior, who nonetheless slept with a special pillow and often sucked her thumb with an embarrassed smile. She had come to the city at 15, and worked to help support her mother and brother.
"Working at Freddy's was more like a hangout," said Julissa Colon, a friend. "People would visit. The owner would say Cynthia was crazy, but that he loved her."
Ms. Martinez's greatest aim was to get her own apartment. She would go with her friend, Tasha Havens, and stare at television sets in store windows, shopping in their imagination for furniture.
"We wanted our own place," said Ms. Havens. "And we wanted it to be right. We wanted to be together forever."
Yesterday, Melvin Martinez, the 8-year-old brother, recalled the last time he had seen his sister. It was Friday morning. He asked if she was going to work. She was. She turned to her mother and said, "Bless you." And she was gone.
 
Mayra Rentas
Lydia Jimenez could not get up from her couch in the five-room Bronx apartment that was overloaded with visitors and grief yesterday. Her daughter, the one with the dream of becoming an airline ticket agent, was gone. She had been a workaholic at unglamorous jobs that she was never embarrassed to labor hard at. Ms. Rentas had come from Puerto Rico in 1987. Now, she was going back to be buried at the age of 22.
"Mayra had nothing to do with what was going on," Ms. Jimenez said of her daughter and the controversy at Freddy's. "She was just working."
Ms. Rentas had done that since she was 14, when her family had come from Santa Isabela in Puerto Rico to Philadelphia and then the Bronx. She had graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. She was a dancer. She translated for neighbors who couldn't speak English.
"She was one in a million," said David Rosa, a cousin. "A crazy maniac going into a store? I wouldn't expect it to happen to my family."
 
Luz Ramos
The playpen was empty in the Bronx apartment where Luz Ramos had lived. Next to it, the trophy Ms. Ramos had won as the 1990 Second Princess of the Bronx Puerto Rican Parade sat in a revered spot. The children that usually occupied the playpen were upstairs. The 20-year-old woman who had won the trophy was dead, killed on her last day of work. She was returning to care for her two boys.
Ms. Ramos had her two boys, Jonathan and Joshua, baptized last summer, a month after her own mother had died of cancer. There had been a three-tiered Dominican cake.
"It was the closest mother-daughter relationship I ever saw in my life," Nilsa Ramirez, a sister-in-law, said of Ms. Ramos's relationship with her mother. "Jonathan was as attached to his mother as Luz had been to hers."
The chance at a family appeared within reach too. With the father of her children estranged, Ms. Ramos had found a boyfriend. On Friday morning, he came by the apartment, recalled Carlotta Herring, Ms. Ramos's friend. There was a gift box, and a gold ring. There were two interlocking hearts.
That night Tony went to the morgue.
 
Olga Garcia
 Ms. Garcia, 19, had seen classmates in high school have their faces slashed by other girls who thought they were too pretty, and so she had decided to try and become a doctor, her sisters said. She had taken jobs at Pizza Hut and Toys R Us, got her general equivalency diploma and was working at Freddy's to put together the money to go to college.
Yesterday, her three sisters finished making funeral arrangements and recalled snippets of Ms. Garcia's abbreviated life. She had been a gifted reader in kindergarten. They joked that she had been a bit of a brat, but fondly noted that she most recently would stay up late, combing their hair, picking out their outfits.
"She was a perfectionist," said Marjorie Lopez, her sister.
 
Angelina Marrero
 Oscar Marrero, a Pentecostal minister, worked frantically during the day, ignoring his poor health. He had a daughter to bury, relatives to pick up at the airport, a family to hold together.
He could do nothing for the people of 951 Woodycrest Avenue.
"This is a close building," said Theresa Jones, a neighbor of the 19-year-old victim. "My daughter grew up with Angie. Angie was beautiful."
Ms. Marrero had graduated from Taft High School. She had attended classes at Monroe Business Institute at Fordham University. She used her paychecks to purchase a pair of earrings, a skirt, the unremarkable but great needs of a teen-ager.
She had returned from Freddy's Thursday night and told friends that people had come in the store and made threats. But she went to work the next day without fear.
"She believed very strongly in her Pentecostal religion," said Jose Vilas, a friend. "Her father indoctrinated her very well."
 
Garnette Ramautar
One of 12 children, Mr. Ramautar emigrated to America nearly three decades ago. He lived with his mother and four children, hustling every day of his life to hold onto his modest piece of good fortune. He had four children, the youngest only 8 months old.
Yesterday, his wife, Silvana, sat on her bed. A diploma from a medical training school was on the wall. The children were racing around, half-dressed, half-understanding. She had an unfocused fear, wondering who might hurt them next.
"He worked so hard, so long, he'd fall asleep going to work," Mrs. Ramautar said of her husband. "But he could have the worst day of his life, and he'd come back smiling."
Not Friday, the worst day of any of their lives.

HEADLINE: Last of the Big-Time Rockefellers

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
IT has been a rough year for the standard-bearer of one of the most fabled families in American history.
Just as David Rockefeller was solidifying his role as the business dynasty's third-generation patriarch, two of the proudest symbols of the Rockefeller name suffered embarrassing blows to their prestige. 
 First, Rockefeller Center filed for bankruptcy protection in May, despite Mr. Rockefeller's intense effort to avert that humiliation. Three months later, the Chase Manhattan Bank, known for years as the "Rockefeller Bank" and the crucible where Mr. Rockefeller forged his reputation as America's premier capitalist and business statesman, was gobbled up by Chemical Bank, its decidedly more plebeian competitor.
To top it all off, the 80-year-old Mr. Rockefeller broke his leg on a trip to Tokyo in February to negotiate with the Mitsubishi Estate Company about keeping Rockefeller Center out of its creditors' hands.
"There have been some episodes, yes, that were unhappy and difficult, breaking my leg not the least of them," he said in an interview on Nov. 30 at his unimposing office on the 56th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the nerve center of the family's activities.
But it will take more than a few disappointments to sidetrack the grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the 19th-century oil magnate, from his mission as caretaker of the family legacy. It is a role that in a sense has been thrust on him; of John D. Jr.'s five sons, only David and Laurance, 85, survive, and Laurance has made it clear that he prefers to keep out of the limelight.
Moreover, none of the Cousins, as the 22 members of the fourth generation are known, have emerged with the experience and connections to take on the mantle of leadership. Only in this generation have the women assumed senior roles in the family's affairs, though a fair number have abandoned the Rockefeller name.
And so, David Rockefeller carries on, the one force capable of uniting the growing number of heirs to the multibillion-dollar family fortune. Despite his age, he maintains an extremely busy schedule. He continues to update a card file containing 100,000 names of most of the people he has ever met. And he always strives to put the best light on the shifting Rockefeller fortunes.
Thanks to his efforts, the family is poised to regain a stake in Rockefeller Center, albeit a much smaller one than it held before the bankruptcy. And while confessing to a certain melancholy over Chase's absorption by Chemical, he takes the stoic view that some sort of merger was inevitable, given the rapid consolidation of the American banking industry. Even though the combined bank will clearly be dominated by Chemical executives and their culture, he likes to point out that it will carry Chase's name and its "beveled bagel" logo.
His fractured femur has barely slowed him. Just three weeks after doctors inserted two pins into his leg, he presented an award to King Hussein of Jordan on behalf of the American Committee for Foreign Policy, and in another month or so, was back doing his morning workouts. "I only have a little more difficulty riding on horseback, because I can't quite get my leg up over the saddle easily," he said.
His upbeat attitude hardly surprises his associates. "The past year has been fraught with frustrations and challenges for him, but he's made of steel, you know," said Joseph Verner Reed, an undersecretary general at the United Nations and an old friend.
Mr. Rockefeller is more apt to describe himself as a plodder. "When things happen, you just have to try to find the best way of working them out that you can," he said.
Even within the family, there is the sense that David Rockefeller represents the end of an era. As others take possession of the Rockefeller crown jewels and the clan itself becomes bigger and more dispersed, it becomes increasingly uncertain whether the Rockefeller name will much longer retain its cachet as a passport to the centers of political and economic power.
Today, some 110 Rockefellers are direct descendants of John D., the feisty founder of the Standard Oil empire and America's first billionaire. His brother, William, produced an even bigger brood that now numbers more than 300, although they do not benefit from the web of trusts established by John D. Jr. that have preserved the family wealth, estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion.
David Rockefeller Jr., Mr. Rockefeller's son and the current head of the family enterprises, Rockefeller & Company, has volunteered to represent the family and oversee the management of its money and collective affairs. And most of John D.'s other descendants are busy in the Rockefeller tradition of hard work and philanthropy.
David's daughter Peggy Dulany, for example, has built strong ties to leaders in emerging countries and works to help them put together social and economic development projects, while her sister Neva Goodwin, a professor at Tufts, is completing a textbook on elementary economics for Russia. Rodman Rockefeller, the oldest son of the late Nelson Rockefeller, is an astute business man, while John D. 4th, known as Jay, is a Senator.
None of these younger Rockefellers, however, seem equipped or inclined to follow in David Rockefeller Sr.'s footsteps. "No one can step into his shoes," said Warren T. Lindquist, a longtime friend. "Not because they aren't good, smart, talented people but because it's just a different world, and they have different interests."
David Jr. agrees. "We're no longer just a New York City family," he said. "My guess is that there will be multiple leaders and patriarchs and perhaps matriarchs." And the elder Mr. Rockefeller himself reluctantly recognizes that he probably represents the last of a breed. "When a family multiplies the way ours has, it's hard to maintain the identity over time," he said.
"I don't think it's fair to judge what the next generation is doing by comparing them and their activities to what I and my siblings have accomplished at the end of our lives," he added. "I think it's fair to say that 20 or 25 years ago, I was less well-known than now."
EVEN so, the Rockefellers have shown remarkable staying power compared with the other American family empires. Who remembers any one member of the third generation of the Kelloggs, the Carnegies or the Vanderbilts, for example, other than for lavish home-decorating or scandal? Even more impressive, the Rockefellers produced not one but two third-generation luminaries: first Nelson, four-time Governor of New York and Vice President during the Ford Administration, who died in 1979; and now David.
The Brothers, as the third generation of Rockefellers is known (even though the oldest of the brood was a woman, Abby, who died in 1976), were determined to avoid the fate of the other business clans. "There is an old saying: 'Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations,' " one of the brothers told the biographer Joe Alex Morris shortly after the end of World War II. "Well, we have to avoid a third-generation anticlimax."
For all the accolades, David Rockefeller isn't without his detractors. While few doubt his seriousness of purpose, for example, some say he was a bit like an absentee manager when he ran Chase Manhattan, once the world's largest bank.
As its chairman and chief executive in the 1970's, Mr. Rockefeller spent a good deal of his time traveling the world in search of new customers and business opportunities. Mr. Reed, the United Nations official, recalls that he made 78 trips in the 12 years that he worked as Mr. Rockefeller's assistant at the bank -- and not quick jaunts, but long excursions. The Rockefeller name worked magic in opening doors, not only in the free world, but in the Communist bloc as well. Chase was the first Western bank to open branches in Moscow and Beijing and was the primary lender to many of their satellites in Africa, the Far East and Latin America.
Critics, however, said that his globe-trotting led him to neglect Chase's business at home. After all, it was during his watch that Citibank, Chase's longtime rival, overtook "David's bank" as the No. 1 bank in the country. And in the late 1970's, souring loans in real-estate and Latin America threatened further deterioration.
Others took Mr. Rockefeller to task for meeting with some of the world's most notorious dictators. He defends these contacts as quiet diplomacy. "The fact that I met with them doesn't mean I agree with them," he said. "My feeling is that one has a much better chance of getting people to make changes if you're talking to them."
Such willingness to hobnob with the leaders of undemocratic regimes can still stir up trouble for Mr. Rockefeller. When Ms. Dulany, his daughter, learned that Fidel Castro, whom she had met through her work in developing countries, was coming to New York for the United Nations' 50th anniversary celebrations this fall, she asked her father to hold a dinner for the Cuban dictator. Fearful that such an event would set off Rockefeller-bashing of the sort he had managed to avoid for years, he declined, but suggested that Ms. Dulany hold her own dinner party for Mr. Castro, which she did.
It was not so easy to sidestep the land mines of unfavorable publicity, however. Mr. Rockefeller was in a car on his way to a dinner that Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York was having for visiting dignitaries when he heard WCBS radio announce that he was at that very moment giving a party for Mr. Castro.
The next day at the United Nations, Mr. Castro strode across a room packed with diplomats and world leaders to shake Mr. Rockefeller's hand, a gesture captured in pictures that appeared in newspapers nationwide. "I must have shaken the hands of 50 people that day, but of course, the only picture that made it into the papers was the one with Castro," he said with a smile.
IN a brief meeting later with Mr. Castro, he continued his efforts at pragmatic bridge-building. "I told him the world has changed, and I thought it was time our two countries tried to find a way to see if they could get together," Mr. Rockefeller recalled. "He said he'd think about it."
He left Chase at its zenith, having disposed of its troubled loans and given it global reach. But some critics, including even some of his close friends, say that his preoccupation with foreign affairs had in fact sown the seeds of the bank's future frailty. In their view, his worst sin was a failure to cultivate strong subordinates, creating a leadership void.
Banking analysts say that that flaw was compounded by a clouded judgment. They say it is now clear that neither Willard C. Butcher, who succeeded Mr. Rockfeller at Chase, nor Thomas G. LaBrecque, the current chairman who was one of Mr. Rockefeller's fair-haired boys 20 years ago, had the ability to lead such a large and multifaceted institution.
His supporters note that in fact, Mr. Rockefeller axed the successor he had chosen, Herbert P. Patterson, reluctantly agreeing with Chase board members that Mr. Patterson lacked the aggressiveness to keep the bank competitive, a trait that unfortunately permeated the Chase culture.
Mr. Rockefeller brushes off such sniping. "Bill deserves much of the credit for the turnaround at the Chase that I was given credit for when I left," he said. "There was no doubt in my mind that he was qualified and entitled to succeed me."
Some note that Mr. Rockefeller, who retired from Chase in 1981, had no role in selecting Mr. LaBrecque for the bank's top job in 1990. And Mr. Rockefeller argues that Mr. LaBrecque performed admirably, even in selling what many regarded as a Rockefeller institution (though the family's stake in Chase was never more than about 5 percent). "I think this is the best solution for the Chase," he said. "I doubt that the Chase would have been able to, quickly enough, raise the capital to keep itself competitive as a world-class bank."
His supporters say his backing for Mr. LaBrecque is a manifestation of the fierce loyalty that he has always extended to his friends and associates -- a trait that can create havoc if it is misplaced. It certainly roiled Rockefeller University, one of the world's pre-eminent medical research institutions that enjoys the financial support of the Rockefeller fortune. In late 1989, Mr. Rockefeller backed the appointment of Dr. David Baltimore, winner of a Nobel Prize for biomedical research, to the presidency of the university, in spite of widespread opposition by many professors who objected to the scientist's role in a dispute over whether a colleague committed fraud in a paper that Dr. Baltimore had helped write.
The university's board, which Mr. Rockefeller headed, pushed through Dr. Baltimore's appointment, and he served a tumultuous year-and-a-half reign that saw the departure of at least three prominent faculty members who opposed his leadership.
"It's easy in hindsight to say he should have left earlier, but I don't believe in turning against someone the moment they get in trouble," Mr. Rockefeller said. "It may be the truth that in the end I err on the side of giving people the benefit of the doubt, but I don't think that's such a terrible thing to do."
After his retirement from Chase, Mr. Rockefeller took over his family's affairs just as the family was beginning to grapple with its increasing diversity and size. The wealth that trickled out of the Rockefeller trusts was being spread increasingly thin, and many of the family's assets were in real estate that generated a low return.
Rockefeller Center was one of the family's biggest assets, but with its high maintenance costs and long-term leases, it made very little money. The family, led by Laurance, began agitating to cash out of the center and put the proceeds in more lucrative and liquid investments. In 1985, the trusts, which were the actual owners of Rockefeller Center through the family holding company, the Rockefeller Group, sold a mortgage on a portion of the center to the public, realizing $1.3 billion, $250 million of which was put to work earning hefty returns for the family.
Four years later, the trusts decided to sell the property outright, offering the Mitsubishi Estate Company an 80 percent stake in Rockefeller Group for $1.4 billion.
From the family's vantage point, their timing was impeccable. "The trustees were shouldering a heavy responsibility: was it prudent to have so much of the family's wealth invested in real estate and in New York City real estate at that," David Rockefeller Jr. said. "Their move to sell the center turns out to have been quite good, especially in terms of timing when you consider that the bottom fell out of New York City real estate shortly thereafter.
"If I could roll back time, however, maybe I would give up some of the profits to avoid the outcome of the deal," he added.
Friends say Mr. Rockefeller was loath to sell Rockefeller Group and the center, but he was outvoted by his brother Laurance and many of the other family members, who were lobbying the trust committee to turn it into more liquid assets. "It pained him to see the family so willing to abandon it," said one longtime friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The notion that the family abandoned Rockefeller Center and, by extension, New York City, was raised in articles and editorials after the property went bankrupt. The accusation outrages many family members. After all, they point out, one is hard put to find a corner of New York where they have not left their mark. Without the Rockefellers, the city's financial district would have evaporated, and the United Nations would have ended up in San Francisco. Morningside Heights would have remained a slum, the World Trade Center would not have been built and the Museum of Modern Art, erected on the site of their parents' mansion, and Lincoln Center, built with the support of John D. 3d, would be vastly different places.
Mr. Rockefeller and David Jr. both stressed the family's commitment to the center and to the city. The impression that the Rockefellers no longer cared about the city because they did not ride in on a white horse made of money to save the center, they say, is a mistaken one. They note that the final decision on family finances lies in the hands of the five trustees -- including mutual-fund giant George Putnam and the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker -- who administer the trusts.
The family is often blamed for decisions made by the trustees, over whom they have little if any control, they say. "We can give advice and so forth, but it is the holders of the shares of the trusts, the trustees, who make the decisions," said David Rockefeller Jr., speaking of Rockefeller Center's recent travails. Some say that in the aftermath of the Rockefeller Center debacle, some members of the family feel that Mr. Bowen allowed an opportunity to save the property from bankruptcy to slip away by trying to secure a few extra points of interests for the family's investment in a joint rescue plan with Mitsubishi Estate.
Mr. Bowen, who did not return calls to his office seeking comment, had previously said that his fiduciary responsibilities to beneficiaries of the trusts forced him to drive a hard bargain. And Mr. Rockefeller, who, friends say, does not have the warmest feelings for Mr. Bowen, said there was more at issue than a few points of interest.
But Mr. Rockefeller doesn't find fault with the trustees. Rather, he lays the blame for the debacle at the feet of Mitsubishi, which, he said, spurned the trust's offer to lend money to a rescue package at well-below market returns.
Nonetheless, the trusts also did not come to Mr. Rockefeller's aid when he began working as part of a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company to buy the property out of bankruptcy. Instead, two other wealthy families whose patriarchs are friends of Mr. Rockefeller, the Agnellis of Italy and the Niarchoses of Greece, put up more than $180 million while he contributed $20 million.
Mr. Rockefeller and his friends plan to use the money to buy a 45.45 percent stake in the property.
Both Mr. Rockefeller and his son bristle at the suggestion that the family did not back him up in his fight to keep at least a piece of the center in the Rockefeller fold.
But if the Rockefellers are putting on a show of public unity about the outcome of the Rockefeller Center drama, some shareholders in the company that holds the mortgage on the center, Rockefeller Center Properties, are not so unforgiving.
Mr. Rockefeller and his fellow investors will gain control of the property by buying up all the shares of Rockefeller Center Properties, which is slated to take ownership of the center in what will be an effective foreclosure on its mortgage. The investors will pay shareholders $8 apiece for their shares, or about $12 less than the shares were worth a decade ago when the Rockefeller trusts sold the mortgage. The upshot of their complaint is that they ended up taking the hit for the decline in New York City real-estate values over the last 10 years, while the Rockefellers cashed out in the late 1980's for more than $2 billion and are now getting a big chunk of ownership back for a song.
Mr. Rockefeller declined to discuss any aspect of the pending deal to buy the property out of bankruptcy while it is awaiting the review of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But it is clear he feels his character has been unfairly questioned, and his friends say he is troubled by that. "He's annoyed as anyone would be when somethings get about that are really untrue or unfair," said Mr. Lindquist, his longtime friend. "People are very apt to, on little or no information, make up motives or intentions that are completely unrelated to the truth, and anyone saying David Rockefeller is only looking out for his self-interest and the interests of his family is just wrong."
Mr. Lindquist met Mr. Rockefeller in Paris after World War II, when they both worked for the American military attache there. "I didn't quite know what to expect," Mr. Lindquist recalled. "I had been briefed at the Pentagon and told I would be working with David Rockefeller. I asked whether he was one of the Rockefellers, and they said yes. I thought about it a minute and then said, well, so what?"
If Mr. Lindquist was at all concerned a Rockefeller might make a less than ideal colleague, Mr. Rockefeller put him at ease from the start, as he does with most people. "The general and David met me when I got off the bus from Orly in front of the Ritz," Mr. Lindquist recalled. "Captain Rockefeller shook my hand and picked up my bag and began carrying it."
His easygoing manner has helped Mr. Rockefeller collect an impressive network of contacts, all of whom he calls friends. Asked how many "friends" he has, Mr. Rockefeller said it would depend on how the word was defined. "If you include all the people I've shaken hands with over the years, well, then it would be quite a few," he said. "My card file records about 100,000 names that I update with each new meeting, but a certain percent -- and more and more now, I have to say -- are in the morgue."
On a recent morning, he was jotting down notes from a recent trip to "places where I have friends" on behalf of Chase so that his secretaries could update the card file. Asked which friend he met in Thailand, Mr. Rockefeller smiled a little apologetically. "Well, in Thailand, surprise, surprise, it was the King and Queen," he said.
That friendship dates back to the early 1960's, when Mr. Rockefeller helped the Thais set up the National Institute for Development Administration.
"It was just one of those fortunate moments when he asked for something, and I was able to help," Mr. Rockefeller said. He did so by tapping an economist who was working for his brother Nelson; the economist conducted an exhaustive study of the Thai economic system and suggested a development plan.
Despite his modesty on the subject, it is for his efforts to use private means to influence public policy that Mr. Rockefeller would like to be remembered. "I would like to be thought of as having seen that there was an important role for the private sector in world affairs and cooperating with governments for the benefit of both parties," he said. "That's what I've tried to demonstrate with my activities on behalf of the Chase and with things like the Council of the Americas and the Trilateral Commission," two public service organizations he helped establish.
George Ames, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company who was involved in some of Mr. Rockefeller's real-estate deals, said his sense of public obligation usually outweighed the profit motive.
"I believe they all inherited a very strong sense of public responsibility from their father," Mr. Ames said. "The whole Rockefeller Center development was created with that in mind. I doubt it ever turned a significant profit until after World War II. It was more that this was a place in the middle of a city that everyone could enjoy and be proud of and, in some way, feel an ownership in it."
Today, at an age when most men might be content to relax in the memory of their achievements, Mr. Rockefeller attends numerous functions each week, travels frequently and continues to seek out new business opportunities. "I'm enjoying what I'm doing," he said, perplexed by a question about why he keeps pushing on. "I like what I do. It's fun."
And there's no indication that he intends to slow down, extending an invitation to "come back and see me in 20 years."

JIM BOWERS wraps the ham, roast beef and cheese left over from lunch and talks about why he is refusing the voluntary severance package AT&T offered him last month.
Even though he may be "involuntarily separated" from his middle-management job as early as next month, it doesn't make sense for him to take the risk, said Mr. Bowers, who at 48 has spent 13 years at AT&T. For him, the buyout offer is not much higher than severance would be. Besides, he and his wife, Judith, do not want to uproot their teen-age daughter, Alaire, a talented flutist and a member of the New Jersey Youth Orchestra. Given the poor New Jersey job market, a move would be likely. 
 "I think AT&T is going to need me," said Mr. Bowers, in the house he helped design and build near AT&T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.. "But there's not a single person AT&T couldn't do without. I'd have to be a fool to say I wasn't worried."
An hour and a half's drive and a life's experience away in Manhattan, Clare Powell sits perched on a cardboard moving-company box and talks about why she accepted AT&T's buyout offer. She is about to move to Connecticut to a new job as a sports marketing consultant. Her last day at AT&T is Jan. 10.
"You don't just walk away from a company that you have a very deep emotional attachment to," said Ms. Powell, who is 35 and single. "But I think I'm a better employee if I have one foot out the door. It keeps you from being complacent."
She added: "You always read about another company laying people off and you have to be cognizant that you could be next. It's a useful paranoia."
Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell are two of the more than 72,000 employees --half of AT&T's managers -- offered the voluntary severance package. Like other big companies, AT&T uses such packages -- a combination of cash, pension sweeteners and other incentives -- to avoid the cheaper but more demoralizing method of summary dismissal. Only about 300 employees have volunteered, and if not enough employees step forward, dismissals will be necessary as early as Jan. 15. And there is no guarantee that the shrinkage will stop there.
What is unusual about the AT&T plan is not only the number of employees involved, but also the fact that even those who stay will face almost permanent uncertainty. It used to be that cutbacks were painful surgery that employees could soon put behind them. Now the blade is never far away.
The buyout offer follows the September announcement that AT&T plans to break up into three less-gargantuan pieces: a long-distance telephone company, an equipment company and a computer maker.
And everyone at the new companies could be "at risk," the company euphemism for subject to layoff, if not now, then a year or 10 years from now. It is a stark reversal of the monopoly days, when AT&T was the biggest company on earth and a job there could mean a lifetime assignment and a fat pension.
"It's almost as tough to be a survivor as someone who has been asked to leave," said John Derse Jr., a partner at Ernst & Young who is an employee benefits consultant. "People are having the hell scared out of them."
ALAN JOHNSON, head of Johnson Associates, another benefits consultant, said: "For people who don't take the buyout and retain their jobs, it should be a wake-up call. You need to keep your skill sets in line with the needs of your industry, or else."
He added that many people, especially professionals, neglect to consider the bleakest possibility in industries in the turmoil of retrenchment. "No matter what you do," Mr. Johnson said, "you may have no future whatsoever."
And Jim L. Meadows, AT&T's human resources vice president in charge of "career placement alternatives," said: "There is no magic number" of employees at which AT&T would stop reassessing its staffing needs. "I don't think there is an answer to the question, 'When does this process stop?' Business changes. The world changes."
Like many other companies, AT&T has been steadily paring the number of employees to cut costs. But unlike other companies, AT&T is doing so not because it is losing money -- it is expected to post a profit of $5.6 billion this year -- but because it is trying to escape its bloated past.
AT&T, with more than $75 billion in annual revenue, has cut an average of nearly 900 employees, about the size of a medium-sized business, every month for the 12 years since the 1984 breakup accord that created AT&T and the seven regional Bells, like Nynex and Bell Atlantic. That comes to 126,000 jobs.
AT&T is the largest profitable company to choose a more or less permanent state of revolution, in which it may rapidly add jobs, either piecemeal or through acquisitions, and years later just as rapidly shed jobs in a gigantic, nerve-jangling (for employees, at least) work in progress.
For Jim Bowers and Clare Powell, the big picture was the furthest thing from their minds on Sept. 20, a Wednesday, when AT&T announced what employees call the "trivestiture." Both Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell had similar reactions and took a similar length of time to realize the personal consequences.
Mr. Bowers is a product manager in charge of software for giant telephone networks, like one that helps maintenance workers pinpoint faults in transmission. He remembers hearing the announcement by AT&T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, on his car radio while on his way to visit a corporate customer.
As a senior marketer, Mr. Bowers had had trouble selling products to local phone companies like Nynex because AT&T's long-distance branch is a likely competitor when the local phone market is opened to competition, much as long distance was in the 1980's. The competition can only become more intense as cable companies like Time Warner also offer telephone service.
The trivestiture "really is in the best interests of the company," Mr. Bowers said. "It's better to be the arms merchant for all the warring parties than trying to sell ammo to someone who says, 'Hey, you're my enemy.' "
Ms. Powell is corporate event marketing director in the Manhattan office of AT&T. She helps organize events like the AT&T Pro-Am Pebble Beach golf tournament, as well as sponsorship of shows and institutions like Cirque du Soleil and the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame.
Ms. Powell's boss warned her to cancel all appointments that Wednesday morning in anticipation of an important announcement from Mr. Allen. Ms. Powell watched the announcement on her office television set and thought to herself, "What a brilliant, smart, smart decision." Trivestiture, she said, made AT&T much more competitive.
Both Mr. Bowers and Ms. Powell were in a bit of a daze after the announcement, and both had so much work that they plunged into it, hoping to avoid thinking about the effect on their jobs.
When Ms. Powell told her parents the news, her father, David Powell, a recently retired public relations executive at Allied Signal, recalled asking, "Where are you going to get assigned, Clare?"
What he really meant, Mr. Powell said, is, "Are you going to have a job?" Ms. Powell said she didn't know where she would be assigned.
Whatever affection Ms. Powell felt for AT&T ("It's like my family"), she thought it only prudent to update her resume and return the phone calls of executive recruiters.
An economics graduate of Hamilton College, Ms. Powell abandoned what she thought was a possible career as a stockbroker or money manager for a much more tenuous career in marketing.
She had worked her way up from a temporary position in 1985 to a job organizing corporate sponsorship for concerts and street festivals for the Hispanic market. After the band leader Tito Puente kissed her, "I almost didn't wash my cheek for days," she said.
A week passed before it really sank in that she could be laid off. "In the back of my mind, I always live assuming I might get a pink slip," she said. "I'd be lying if I said it was something I enjoyed thinking about. But this is not the world it was when my father was working. You don't have lifetime employment."
"Clare's typical of a new breed," said her father, who worked for 23 years at Exxon and 16 years at Allied Signal. "The old paternalistic relationship is dead. The employee is simply the sum of his or her skills."
Just two weeks after the announcement, Ms. Powell got a call from the ISL Company, a Stamford, Conn., subsidiary of a Swiss sports-licensing concern: Would she like to do at ISL what she does at AT&T? Ms. Powell liked the principals of the firm, whom she got to know in working on AT&T projects, and thought seriously about leaving.
Then, last month, AT&T made its buyout offer. "At some point I knew I had to leave because I eventually want to own my business," Ms. Powell said. "But when is the right time? If I didn't jump, I'd probably regret it for the rest of my life."
Recently separated and about to complete a divorce, Ms. Powell also had no children to complicate a decision. Under the buyout, she will receive about a half year's salary. She would not disclose her salary, but Ms. Powell's type of job typically pays between $80,000 and $120,000.
"If you're going to go, it would be great to go when they give you money to go," she said. "Pretty simple."
For Jim Bowers, the decision was also straightforward -- after he took more than a week to sense that his job could be in danger. He quickly realized, however, that he was too young to quit and, he feared, too old to get another job.
A physiology major at Ohio State, Mr. Bowers got a master's degree in library science at Rutgers University. After serving on the library-science faculty at the University of Florida in Gainesville, he became the corporate librarian and marketing manager at Allied Chemical, which eventually became Allied Signal. He also received an M.B.A. from Fairleigh-Dickinson University.
THEN, thinking videotext would be the next big thing, he joined AT&T in 1982 in the abortive project to develop and market a precursor of business and residential computer services. He eventually moved up to become a project manager for computer software.
But the job market today in New Jersey is weaker than it was a decade ago, Mr. Bowers said. The traditional route of early retirees -- returning to AT&T as a consultant at a large fraction of your old salary -- is vanishing.
Mr. Bowers and his wife decided they would simply have to tough it out. "The whole thing was a nondecision for me," he said on a recent afternoon dressed in a plaid shirt and a "Camp Friendship" T-shirt.
"I could leave this house, which I love, in a day. But everything my wife and I do now is focused on daughter," referring to Alaire, the flutist. "Daughter goes to private school. Daughter would lose her music tutor. Daughter would lose her place in the New Jersey Youth Orchestra, which is very competitive." Even a standard flute for Alaire costs more than $4,000.
He added, 'If I don't have to go, I'm willing to stick it out for daughter."
The family lives in comfort in a home filled with family keepsakes and furniture picked up at flea markets and antique stores. But Mr. Bowers sees few places where they can cut costs if he loses his job, whose salary Mr. Bowers does not want to specify but is probably between $60,000 and $80,000.
The family doesn't eat at expensive restaurants or take costly vacations, and Mrs. Bowers only rarely goes to Manhattan to the opera. Mr. Bowers heats much of the house with more than four cords of wood gathered from nearby roads.
Except for Alaire's schooling and martial-arts lessons, the family's main outlay is for extensive payments into AT&T retirement and savings accounts. They also have $20,000 in savings that a financial planner recommended as a supplement to Social Security. But a car recently hit the family Ford Taurus, which had an insurance value of just $7,000. They want to buy a new car to replace it, but that will eat up $13,000 of the couple's special fund.
Moreover, the financial planner gave Mr. Bowers the sobering advice that he must work until age 62, or 14 more years, mainly to cover Alaire's college expenses, as well as qualify for a higher pension.
Under the buyout program, Mr. Bowers would get a little more than half a year's salary "to take a walk." If he waits to get dismissed, he only loses eight weeks' salary, or about $9,000 to $12,000.
Mr. Bowers, 48, doesn't qualify for a full pension. Typically, an AT&T manager would have to be 55, with 20 years of service, to qualify. There is always the pension he will receive after working for 10 years at Allied Chemical, about $300 a month.
"Enough to buy a loaf of bread in the year 2009," Mr. Bowers said ruefully.

 BODY:

Gauging the Cost Of 401(k) Plans
The amount paid for 401(k) plans can vary widely, according to the Butler Index, begun recently by the Pension Dynamics Corporation of Lafayette, Calif. 
 The index shows what 12 mutual fund and other companies would charge for a plan with $1 million in assets and 50 employees -- in other words, a small plan. The annualized costs are divided into the amount paid by the employer and that paid cumulatively by the 50 employees. Though they may not realize it, employees who check on their plans will generally find that a portion is deducted from the accounts of individual participants.
For a plan of this size, the lowest-cost providers were Principal Financial, T. Rowe Price Century Plan and Vanguard, according to the index.
Along with costs, a critical factor is investment performance. "A vendor may say that, although its costs and fees are above average, you are being awarded with superior investment performance," said Stephen J. Butler, president of Pension Dynamics. "Don't take this claim on faith. Check the performance of your prospective vendors' investments in a respected source, such as Morningstar."
 
Best of the Bonds? Corporates and Munis
Buying shares in a Government bond fund is easier than buying small quantities of Government bonds. But most Government funds lag behind their benchmarks. They're expensive, and there are better alternatives, John Rekenthaler, editor of the Morningstar Investor, wrote in the most recent issue.
About 85 percent of Government Treasury and mortgage bond funds trail the Lehman Brothers Government index, and they don't compensate by showing lower risk. The reason is that the market is very efficient, and fund managers are handicapped by expenses, which average 1.05 percent of assets a year.
Best bets for investors are the low-cost Vanguard funds, Mr. Rekenthaler concludes. Other options are Strong Government Securities, which stretches the definition of Government to include unusual mortgages and some corporate bonds, and Sit U.S. Government Securities, which owns mobile-home mortgages.
Otherwise, investors in low tax brackets should now go with corporates, Mr. Rekenthaler argues. They are less costly and their market is less efficient. FPA New Income has beaten the Government indexes for a decade with less risk, he said. Other funds he recommends: Loomis Sayles Bond, Dodge & Cox Income and Harbor Bond.
For people taxed at 28 percent or more, municipal bond funds, especially single-state funds, are the way to go. Exempt from Federal and state tax for in-state residents, the single-state funds yield more without sacrificing long-term performance. Best bets are run by Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and Scudder, Stevens & Clark, Mr. Rekenthaler says.
Because long-term munis carry a lot of interest-rate risk, cautious investors might consider intermediate-term muni funds even though yields are lower.
 
A Rift Over Money Funds
A proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission to force money market funds to report their holdings quarterly is running into opposition from the industry.
The Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund trade group, says the proposal is neither "necessary nor appropriate" and would result in unnecessary costs.
Not so, says Glen King Parker, publisher of the Income Fund Outlook, an investment newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. Many institutional money funds already publish portfolios monthly and make them available to shareholders, he said, and those that sell to the general public should provide more disclosure.
In fact, he would prefer reporting monthly instead of quarterly. "Money funds have become quasi-banks," he said, "and I don't think that there's anything wrong with an increased level of scrutiny."
 
A Portfolio Thinks Small
James Oberweis, manager of the $135 million Oberweis Emerging Growth fund, is starting the Micro-Cap Portfolio, which will invest in very, very small stocks. The average market capitalization of the stocks in the Emerging Growth portfolio is $400 million to $500 million; in the new fund it will be less than $100 million.
The new fund is being structured to let investors get in at the starting gate. Money will be collected from mid-December, but it won't be invested until the fund begins operating on Jan. 2.
To stay true to his small-cap mission, Mr. Oberweis plans to close the fund when it reaches $50 million in assets. Even existing shareholders won't be allowed to add new money, though they can reinvest their earnings.
 
More New Funds
Robertson, Stephens & Company, San Francisco, is adding three funds. Its Information Age fund, managed by Ron Elijah, who already runs the company's Value and Growth fund, will concentrate on small-capitalization technology companies with unusual offerings in multimedia, wireless communications, networking, software and the like. Global Natural Resources will be managed by Andy J. Pilara Jr., who also manages the Partners and Contrarian funds. Global Low Priced Stock will buy overlooked companies with share prices of $10 or less.
Bank of America has started three Time Horizon funds with stated maturity dates in the life-style category. The funds aim to maximize total return and then emphasize capital preservation as the fund approaches its maturity date. Time Horizon Portfolio 1 is for investors with a financial goal near the year 2005, Portfolio 2 for 2015 and Portfolio 3 for 2025.
Fidelity Investments has added to its international lineup with six aggressive growth funds that invest in single countries and regions abroad. All the funds carry a 3 percent sales charge and a 1.5 percent redemption fee on shares held less than 90 days. They are Fidelity France, Germany, Hong Kong and China, Japan Small Companies, Nordic and United Kingdom.
 
New Management
Ernst H. Von Metzsch, who picked up the Vanguard Wellington fund after the death of Vincent Bajakian in September, has been named the permanent manager.
Catherine Dudley left Phoenix Growth to join Chancellor Investments. She is replaced at the fund by William J. Newman, the company's chief investment strategist.
In Brief
Fidelity Investments plans to make all its prospectuses available soon on the Internet. The company has 83 prospectuses there now (http://www.fid-inv.com) and expects to put the remainder there by early next year.

Fur Center Sale: The Synagogue

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
In its glory days, the Fur Center Synagogue on West 29th Street was so crowded that some services had three seatings. Today, the congregation, founded in 1935, has fallen to 27 members from a peak of 700. Struggling to pay its bills, it is negotiating to sell the one-story synagogue it built in 1965 to a meditation group. Last month it stopped holding services.
"We're all heartsick," said Abby Thomas, the synagogue's administrator. "But the fur district isn't what it used to be." 
 The synagogue's troubles mirror the economic and demographic changes that have wrenched the fur industry. Cheap imports, a string of warm winters and the animal-rights movement have conspired against a once-thriving industry centered at 30th Street and Eighth Avenue. In 1955, there were 25,000 fur district workers, 80 percent of whom were Jewish. Today the workers, most of Greek descent, number 2,000.
Seven years ago, the congregation hired a 26-year-old rabbi, Joel Kenny, who members say helped bring about a renaissance in the synagogue's spiritual life. Dozens of Jews who live in the surrounding area joined the synagogue and attended services on weekends, when most of the furriers are home in the suburbs. Although the synagogue is Orthodox, all Jews were welcomed. "Before he came, this place was really moribund," said Joan Rosenfelt, a film maker who lives in Greenwich Village. "He brought in the fire of youth and attracted a diverse bunch of people."
But enthusiasm was not enough to pay the $18,000 a year it costs to heat and light the building or the $40,000 it took to fix a leaking roof. Ms. Thomas, who did not disclose the building's sale price, said she hoped the new owner would let the congregation meet in the basement.
Sol Goldstein, chairman of the synagogue, remembers when hundreds of skin merchants, coat manufacturers and fur wholesalers would gather in the main sanctuary for yahrzeit, the service marking the anniversary of the death of a relative. "You'd look around and every face would be a familiar one," said Mr. Goldstein, 81, a retired furrier. "They're all gone now, and I can't tell you how sad that is for me." ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: Russia, Vexing Partners, Asks For Changes in Space Station

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Russia is proposing changing the planned international space station by incorporating all or part of the Russians' existing Mir orbiting outpost into the design. The move is causing concern among other nations that are partners in the project, including the United States, which oppose any change that might add to the program's costs or delay its completion.
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say that they do not know exactly what changes in the international station the Russians want. They are to get details in the coming week, when a delegation of Russian space agency and industry officials arrives in Houston to outline the proposal. 
 The delegation, headed by Boris Ostroumov, deputy general director of the Russian agency, is to meet on Friday at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston with officials of the space station program. Engineers at Johnson have been informally assessing the feasibility of a number of options that would incorporate Mir components into the international station, known as Alpha, said people within and outside of NASA who are familiar with the situation.
Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian space agency, raised the issue of using Mir as part of Alpha last month when Wilbur Trafton, NASA's space station director, and other American officials were in Russia during a joint mission involving an American shuttle's docking with Mir. Mr. Trafton told Mr. Koptev then that the United States would not consider redesigning the space station.
This week Ray Castillo, a NASA spokesman, reiterated the agency's position that the station would not be redesigned. But he said NASA would evaluate proposals that might cut project costs or speed completion of the station. "If a proposal increases cost, delays the schedule or compromises safety, we will not agree to it," Mr. Castillo said.
Russia is building Alpha's propulsion module -- the unit that will steer and stabilize the entire station -- and several other crucial components; the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and Japan are contributing science laboratories, living quarters, solar power units and other segments. Some of the international partners, who were wary when Russia joined the effort as a full partner in 1993 and are under pressure to hold down their costs in the undertaking, are concerned that changes proposed by the Russians could jeopardize the project, experts said.
Experts on Moscow's space program said Russia, which continues to face severe economic problems, wanted to incorporate Mir into the Alpha project because using some existing equipment would cut its costs. One option being discussed, they said, is substituting two of Mir's newest scientific modules, called Spektr and Priroda, for new research components that Russia is supposed to build for Alpha.
Mir, which is almost 10 years old, is believed by many to be nearing the end of its useful life. But Spektr, which is equipped for biomedical and atmospheric research, is only a year old. And Priroda, designed to study the Earth's resources and the oceans, will not be attached to Mir until next year.
The first components of Alpha, which are in advanced stages of construction, are scheduled to be launched into space in late 1997. The entire outpost, which will serve as a permanent orbital base for six astronauts, is to be completed by 2002. Any changes that disrupt this timetable or result in higher costs may put the $35 billion project into deep trouble politically and endanger its completion, space experts said.
NASA's Administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, and other officials have maintained for almost two years that the design of Alpha is final. It is a scaled-down version of a larger proposed station, Freedom, that went through several costly redesigns over a decade, resulting in an expense of billions of dollars with little to show for it.
Given assurances that the project now can be brought in on time and without cost overruns, Congress has supported it as a cornerstone of international cooperation and a source of jobs for the aerospace industry.
A space expert on the staff of a House committee that oversees NASA, who spoke on the condition that he not be otherwise identified, said lawmakers were waiting to see what Russia proposed. "We're going to be looking at this very hard," he said. "If they propose something that compromises the cost or schedule, or undermines U.S. leadership of the project, it's going to meet a lot of resistance on Capitol Hill."

IT has been a rough year for the standard-bearer of one of the most fabled families in American history.
Just as David Rockefeller was solidifying his role as the business dynasty's third-generation patriarch, two of the proudest symbols of the Rockefeller name suffered embarrassing blows to their prestige. 
 First, Rockefeller Center filed for bankruptcy protection in May, despite Mr. Rockefeller's intense effort to avert that humiliation. Three months later, the Chase Manhattan Bank, known for years as the "Rockefeller Bank" and the crucible where Mr. Rockefeller forged his reputation as America's premier capitalist and business statesman, was gobbled up by Chemical Bank, its decidedly more plebeian competitor.
To top it all off, the 80-year-old Mr. Rockefeller broke his leg on a trip to Tokyo in February to negotiate with the Mitsubishi Estate Company about keeping Rockefeller Center out of its creditors' hands.
"There have been some episodes, yes, that were unhappy and difficult, breaking my leg not the least of them," he said in an interview on Nov. 30 at his unimposing office on the 56th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the nerve center of the family's activities.
But it will take more than a few disappointments to sidetrack the grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the 19th-century oil magnate, from his mission as caretaker of the family legacy. It is a role that in a sense has been thrust on him; of John D. Jr.'s five sons, only David and Laurance, 85, survive, and Laurance has made it clear that he prefers to keep out of the limelight.
Moreover, none of the Cousins, as the 22 members of the fourth generation are known, have emerged with the experience and connections to take on the mantle of leadership. Only in this generation have the women assumed senior roles in the family's affairs, though a fair number have abandoned the Rockefeller name.
And so, David Rockefeller carries on, the one force capable of uniting the growing number of heirs to the multibillion-dollar family fortune. Despite his age, he maintains an extremely busy schedule. He continues to update a card file containing 100,000 names of most of the people he has ever met. And he always strives to put the best light on the shifting Rockefeller fortunes.
Thanks to his efforts, the family is poised to regain a stake in Rockefeller Center, albeit a much smaller one than it held before the bankruptcy. And while confessing to a certain melancholy over Chase's absorption by Chemical, he takes the stoic view that some sort of merger was inevitable, given the rapid consolidation of the American banking industry. Even though the combined bank will clearly be dominated by Chemical executives and their culture, he likes to point out that it will carry Chase's name and its "beveled bagel" logo.
His fractured femur has barely slowed him. Just three weeks after doctors inserted two pins into his leg, he presented an award to King Hussein of Jordan on behalf of the American Committee for Foreign Policy, and in another month or so, was back doing his morning workouts. "I only have a little more difficulty riding on horseback, because I can't quite get my leg up over the saddle easily," he said.
His upbeat attitude hardly surprises his associates. "The past year has been fraught with frustrations and challenges for him, but he's made of steel, you know," said Joseph Verner Reed, an undersecretary general at the United Nations and an old friend.
Mr. Rockefeller is more apt to describe himself as a plodder. "When things happen, you just have to try to find the best way of working them out that you can," he said.
Even within the family, there is the sense that David Rockefeller represents the end of an era. As others take possession of the Rockefeller crown jewels and the clan itself becomes bigger and more dispersed, it becomes increasingly uncertain whether the Rockefeller name will much longer retain its cachet as a passport to the centers of political and economic power.
Today, some 110 Rockefellers are direct descendants of John D., the feisty founder of the Standard Oil empire and America's first billionaire. His brother, William, produced an even bigger brood that now numbers more than 300, although they do not benefit from the web of trusts established by John D. Jr. that have preserved the family wealth, estimated at between $4 billion and $5 billion.
David Rockefeller Jr., Mr. Rockefeller's son and the current head of the family enterprises, Rockefeller & Company, has volunteered to represent the family and oversee the management of its money and collective affairs. And most of John D.'s other descendants are busy in the Rockefeller tradition of hard work and philanthropy.
David's daughter Peggy Dulany, for example, has built strong ties to leaders in emerging countries and works to help them put together social and economic development projects, while her sister Neva Goodwin, a professor at Tufts, is completing a textbook on elementary economics for Russia. Rodman Rockefeller, the oldest son of the late Nelson Rockefeller, is an astute business man, while John D. 4th, known as Jay, is a Senator.
None of these younger Rockefellers, however, seem equipped or inclined to follow in David Rockefeller Sr.'s footsteps. "No one can step into his shoes," said Warren T. Lindquist, a longtime friend. "Not because they aren't good, smart, talented people but because it's just a different world, and they have different interests."
David Jr. agrees. "We're no longer just a New York City family," he said. "My guess is that there will be multiple leaders and patriarchs and perhaps matriarchs." And the elder Mr. Rockefeller himself reluctantly recognizes that he probably represents the last of a breed. "When a family multiplies the way ours has, it's hard to maintain the identity over time," he said.
"I don't think it's fair to judge what the next generation is doing by comparing them and their activities to what I and my siblings have accomplished at the end of our lives," he added. "I think it's fair to say that 20 or 25 years ago, I was less well-known than now."
EVEN so, the Rockefellers have shown remarkable staying power compared with the other American family empires. Who remembers any one member of the third generation of the Kelloggs, the Carnegies or the Vanderbilts, for example, other than for lavish home-decorating or scandal? Even more impressive, the Rockefellers produced not one but two third-generation luminaries: first Nelson, four-time Governor of New York and Vice President during the Ford Administration, who died in 1979; and now David.
The Brothers, as the third generation of Rockefellers is known (even though the oldest of the brood was a woman, Abby, who died in 1976), were determined to avoid the fate of the other business clans. "There is an old saying: 'Shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations,' " one of the brothers told the biographer Joe Alex Morris shortly after the end of World War II. "Well, we have to avoid a third-generation anticlimax."
For all the accolades, David Rockefeller isn't without his detractors. While few doubt his seriousness of purpose, for example, some say he was a bit like an absentee manager when he ran Chase Manhattan, once the world's largest bank.
As its chairman and chief executive in the 1970's, Mr. Rockefeller spent a good deal of his time traveling the world in search of new customers and business opportunities. Mr. Reed, the United Nations official, recalls that he made 78 trips in the 12 years that he worked as Mr. Rockefeller's assistant at the bank -- and not quick jaunts, but long excursions. The Rockefeller name worked magic in opening doors, not only in the free world, but in the Communist bloc as well. Chase was the first Western bank to open branches in Moscow and Beijing and was the primary lender to many of their satellites in Africa, the Far East and Latin America.
Critics, however, said that his globe-trotting led him to neglect Chase's business at home. After all, it was during his watch that Citibank, Chase's longtime rival, overtook "David's bank" as the No. 1 bank in the country. And in the late 1970's, souring loans in real-estate and Latin America threatened further deterioration.
Others took Mr. Rockefeller to task for meeting with some of the world's most notorious dictators. He defends these contacts as quiet diplomacy. "The fact that I met with them doesn't mean I agree with them," he said. "My feeling is that one has a much better chance of getting people to make changes if you're talking to them."
Such willingness to hobnob with the leaders of undemocratic regimes can still stir up trouble for Mr. Rockefeller. When Ms. Dulany, his daughter, learned that Fidel Castro, whom she had met through her work in developing countries, was coming to New York for the United Nations' 50th anniversary celebrations this fall, she asked her father to hold a dinner for the Cuban dictator. Fearful that such an event would set off Rockefeller-bashing of the sort he had managed to avoid for years, he declined, but suggested that Ms. Dulany hold her own dinner party for Mr. Castro, which she did.
It was not so easy to sidestep the land mines of unfavorable publicity, however. Mr. Rockefeller was in a car on his way to a dinner that Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York was having for visiting dignitaries when he heard WCBS radio announce that he was at that very moment giving a party for Mr. Castro.
The next day at the United Nations, Mr. Castro strode across a room packed with diplomats and world leaders to shake Mr. Rockefeller's hand, a gesture captured in pictures that appeared in newspapers nationwide. "I must have shaken the hands of 50 people that day, but of course, the only picture that made it into the papers was the one with Castro," he said with a smile.
IN a brief meeting later with Mr. Castro, he continued his efforts at pragmatic bridge-building. "I told him the world has changed, and I thought it was time our two countries tried to find a way to see if they could get together," Mr. Rockefeller recalled. "He said he'd think about it."
He left Chase at its zenith, having disposed of its troubled loans and given it global reach. But some critics, including even some of his close friends, say that his preoccupation with foreign affairs had in fact sown the seeds of the bank's future frailty. In their view, his worst sin was a failure to cultivate strong subordinates, creating a leadership void.
Banking analysts say that that flaw was compounded by a clouded judgment. They say it is now clear that neither Willard C. Butcher, who succeeded Mr. Rockfeller at Chase, nor Thomas G. LaBrecque, the current chairman who was one of Mr. Rockefeller's fair-haired boys 20 years ago, had the ability to lead such a large and multifaceted institution.
His supporters note that in fact, Mr. Rockefeller axed the successor he had chosen, Herbert P. Patterson, reluctantly agreeing with Chase board members that Mr. Patterson lacked the aggressiveness to keep the bank competitive, a trait that unfortunately permeated the Chase culture.
Mr. Rockefeller brushes off such sniping. "Bill deserves much of the credit for the turnaround at the Chase that I was given credit for when I left," he said. "There was no doubt in my mind that he was qualified and entitled to succeed me."
Some note that Mr. Rockefeller, who retired from Chase in 1981, had no role in selecting Mr. LaBrecque for the bank's top job in 1990. And Mr. Rockefeller argues that Mr. LaBrecque performed admirably, even in selling what many regarded as a Rockefeller institution (though the family's stake in Chase was never more than about 5 percent). "I think this is the best solution for the Chase," he said. "I doubt that the Chase would have been able to, quickly enough, raise the capital to keep itself competitive as a world-class bank."
His supporters say his backing for Mr. LaBrecque is a manifestation of the fierce loyalty that he has always extended to his friends and associates -- a trait that can create havoc if it is misplaced. It certainly roiled Rockefeller University, one of the world's pre-eminent medical research institutions that enjoys the financial support of the Rockefeller fortune. In late 1989, Mr. Rockefeller backed the appointment of Dr. David Baltimore, winner of a Nobel Prize for biomedical research, to the presidency of the university, in spite of widespread opposition by many professors who objected to the scientist's role in a dispute over whether a colleague committed fraud in a paper that Dr. Baltimore had helped write.
The university's board, which Mr. Rockefeller headed, pushed through Dr. Baltimore's appointment, and he served a tumultuous year-and-a-half reign that saw the departure of at least three prominent faculty members who opposed his leadership.
"It's easy in hindsight to say he should have left earlier, but I don't believe in turning against someone the moment they get in trouble," Mr. Rockefeller said. "It may be the truth that in the end I err on the side of giving people the benefit of the doubt, but I don't think that's such a terrible thing to do."
After his retirement from Chase, Mr. Rockefeller took over his family's affairs just as the family was beginning to grapple with its increasing diversity and size. The wealth that trickled out of the Rockefeller trusts was being spread increasingly thin, and many of the family's assets were in real estate that generated a low return.
Rockefeller Center was one of the family's biggest assets, but with its high maintenance costs and long-term leases, it made very little money. The family, led by Laurance, began agitating to cash out of the center and put the proceeds in more lucrative and liquid investments. In 1985, the trusts, which were the actual owners of Rockefeller Center through the family holding company, the Rockefeller Group, sold a mortgage on a portion of the center to the public, realizing $1.3 billion, $250 million of which was put to work earning hefty returns for the family.
Four years later, the trusts decided to sell the property outright, offering the Mitsubishi Estate Company an 80 percent stake in Rockefeller Group for $1.4 billion.
From the family's vantage point, their timing was impeccable. "The trustees were shouldering a heavy responsibility: was it prudent to have so much of the family's wealth invested in real estate and in New York City real estate at that," David Rockefeller Jr. said. "Their move to sell the center turns out to have been quite good, especially in terms of timing when you consider that the bottom fell out of New York City real estate shortly thereafter.
"If I could roll back time, however, maybe I would give up some of the profits to avoid the outcome of the deal," he added.
Friends say Mr. Rockefeller was loath to sell Rockefeller Group and the center, but he was outvoted by his brother Laurance and many of the other family members, who were lobbying the trust committee to turn it into more liquid assets. "It pained him to see the family so willing to abandon it," said one longtime friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The notion that the family abandoned Rockefeller Center and, by extension, New York City, was raised in articles and editorials after the property went bankrupt. The accusation outrages many family members. After all, they point out, one is hard put to find a corner of New York where they have not left their mark. Without the Rockefellers, the city's financial district would have evaporated, and the United Nations would have ended up in San Francisco. Morningside Heights would have remained a slum, the World Trade Center would not have been built and the Museum of Modern Art, erected on the site of their parents' mansion, and Lincoln Center, built with the support of John D. 3d, would be vastly different places.
Mr. Rockefeller and David Jr. both stressed the family's commitment to the center and to the city. The impression that the Rockefellers no longer cared about the city because they did not ride in on a white horse made of money to save the center, they say, is a mistaken one. They note that the final decision on family finances lies in the hands of the five trustees -- including mutual-fund giant George Putnam and the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker -- who administer the trusts.
The family is often blamed for decisions made by the trustees, over whom they have little if any control, they say. "We can give advice and so forth, but it is the holders of the shares of the trusts, the trustees, who make the decisions," said David Rockefeller Jr., speaking of Rockefeller Center's recent travails. Some say that in the aftermath of the Rockefeller Center debacle, some members of the family feel that Mr. Bowen allowed an opportunity to save the property from bankruptcy to slip away by trying to secure a few extra points of interests for the family's investment in a joint rescue plan with Mitsubishi Estate.
Mr. Bowen, who did not return calls to his office seeking comment, had previously said that his fiduciary responsibilities to beneficiaries of the trusts forced him to drive a hard bargain. And Mr. Rockefeller, who, friends say, does not have the warmest feelings for Mr. Bowen, said there was more at issue than a few points of interest.
But Mr. Rockefeller doesn't find fault with the trustees. Rather, he lays the blame for the debacle at the feet of Mitsubishi, which, he said, spurned the trust's offer to lend money to a rescue package at well-below market returns.
Nonetheless, the trusts also did not come to Mr. Rockefeller's aid when he began working as part of a group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company to buy the property out of bankruptcy. Instead, two other wealthy families whose patriarchs are friends of Mr. Rockefeller, the Agnellis of Italy and the Niarchoses of Greece, put up more than $180 million while he contributed $20 million.
Mr. Rockefeller and his friends plan to use the money to buy a 45.45 percent stake in the property.
Both Mr. Rockefeller and his son bristle at the suggestion that the family did not back him up in his fight to keep at least a piece of the center in the Rockefeller fold.
But if the Rockefellers are putting on a show of public unity about the outcome of the Rockefeller Center drama, some shareholders in the company that holds the mortgage on the center, Rockefeller Center Properties, are not so unforgiving.
Mr. Rockefeller and his fellow investors will gain control of the property by buying up all the shares of Rockefeller Center Properties, which is slated to take ownership of the center in what will be an effective foreclosure on its mortgage. The investors will pay shareholders $8 apiece for their shares, or about $12 less than the shares were worth a decade ago when the Rockefeller trusts sold the mortgage. The upshot of their complaint is that they ended up taking the hit for the decline in New York City real-estate values over the last 10 years, while the Rockefellers cashed out in the late 1980's for more than $2 billion and are now getting a big chunk of ownership back for a song.
Mr. Rockefeller declined to discuss any aspect of the pending deal to buy the property out of bankruptcy while it is awaiting the review of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But it is clear he feels his character has been unfairly questioned, and his friends say he is troubled by that. "He's annoyed as anyone would be when somethings get about that are really untrue or unfair," said Mr. Lindquist, his longtime friend. "People are very apt to, on little or no information, make up motives or intentions that are completely unrelated to the truth, and anyone saying David Rockefeller is only looking out for his self-interest and the interests of his family is just wrong."
Mr. Lindquist met Mr. Rockefeller in Paris after World War II, when they both worked for the American military attache there. "I didn't quite know what to expect," Mr. Lindquist recalled. "I had been briefed at the Pentagon and told I would be working with David Rockefeller. I asked whether he was one of the Rockefellers, and they said yes. I thought about it a minute and then said, well, so what?"
If Mr. Lindquist was at all concerned a Rockefeller might make a less than ideal colleague, Mr. Rockefeller put him at ease from the start, as he does with most people. "The general and David met me when I got off the bus from Orly in front of the Ritz," Mr. Lindquist recalled. "Captain Rockefeller shook my hand and picked up my bag and began carrying it."
His easygoing manner has helped Mr. Rockefeller collect an impressive network of contacts, all of whom he calls friends. Asked how many "friends" he has, Mr. Rockefeller said it would depend on how the word was defined. "If you include all the people I've shaken hands with over the years, well, then it would be quite a few," he said. "My card file records about 100,000 names that I update with each new meeting, but a certain percent -- and more and more now, I have to say -- are in the morgue."
On a recent morning, he was jotting down notes from a recent trip to "places where I have friends" on behalf of Chase so that his secretaries could update the card file. Asked which friend he met in Thailand, Mr. Rockefeller smiled a little apologetically. "Well, in Thailand, surprise, surprise, it was the King and Queen," he said.
That friendship dates back to the early 1960's, when Mr. Rockefeller helped the Thais set up the National Institute for Development Administration.
"It was just one of those fortunate moments when he asked for something, and I was able to help," Mr. Rockefeller said. He did so by tapping an economist who was working for his brother Nelson; the economist conducted an exhaustive study of the Thai economic system and suggested a development plan.
Despite his modesty on the subject, it is for his efforts to use private means to influence public policy that Mr. Rockefeller would like to be remembered. "I would like to be thought of as having seen that there was an important role for the private sector in world affairs and cooperating with governments for the benefit of both parties," he said. "That's what I've tried to demonstrate with my activities on behalf of the Chase and with things like the Council of the Americas and the Trilateral Commission," two public service organizations he helped establish.
George Ames, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company who was involved in some of Mr. Rockefeller's real-estate deals, said his sense of public obligation usually outweighed the profit motive.
"I believe they all inherited a very strong sense of public responsibility from their father," Mr. Ames said. "The whole Rockefeller Center development was created with that in mind. I doubt it ever turned a significant profit until after World War II. It was more that this was a place in the middle of a city that everyone could enjoy and be proud of and, in some way, feel an ownership in it."
Today, at an age when most men might be content to relax in the memory of their achievements, Mr. Rockefeller attends numerous functions each week, travels frequently and continues to seek out new business opportunities. "I'm enjoying what I'm doing," he said, perplexed by a question about why he keeps pushing on. "I like what I do. It's fun."
And there's no indication that he intends to slow down, extending an invitation to "come back and see me in 20 years."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Of Mondrian, Street Grids And Cities Transcendent

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
UPTOWN, DOWNTOWN, crosstown, our town: long before reaching the painting "Broadway Boogie Woogie," visitors to the Museum of Modern Art's magnificent Mondrian show may find themselves drawn into a New York state of mind. Mondrian's painted grids, of course, fit almost too neatly into the city with the 90-degree soul. And for an architecture critic, the show casts a revealing light on the city itself. It may be entirely coincidental that Mondrian's grids recall the street plan of Manhattan. Even so, the paintings and the city both stand at the intersection of material reality and metaphysical thought.
At the Modern, wall plaques help viewers grasp the idea that Mondrian's abstract forms are not simply a matter of composition or design. For Mondrian, and for those susceptible to the creative process he pursued with such passion, the departure from representation holds a spiritual dimension. Perhaps the show itself can help us perceive the transcendent city outside from a similar point of view. The engineers who designed New York's grid did more than carve out identical plots of land from a bumpy little island. They also defined a metaphysical space, a test ground for the aspirations that the skyline came to symbolize. 
 I have a wandering mind. I confess that while walking through the show, the thought that haunted me was somewhat off the wall: Martha Stewart has bought Gordon Bunshaft's house. I couldn't get that picture out of my mind. Martha Stewart, living in a glass International Style house in East Hampton. Here is a writer (I swear by her book on hors d'oeuvres) who stands for getting back in touch with the physicality of life. She chops vegetables and even grows them, raises chickens, bakes bread and does all this messy, hands-on stuff.
Now she has come to roost in a house that is a classic statement about the increasing abstraction of modern life. If Martha Stewart can't escape the tug of abstraction -- if, in fact, she deliberately chooses to dwell within it -- what hope is there for the rest of us?
Actually, I think it's a tribute to Mondrian's art that the show can put you in mind of something like Martha Stewart. I say something, rather than someone, because Martha Stewart, while a real person, is also an abstraction, a brand name that stands for things like baking bread and raising chickens. She makes a career of dispensing images of these things to people who eagerly devour them because the reality of rising yeast and clucking hens, not to mention the traditional way of life associated with them, has become increasingly elusive.
Stewart, in short, is a brilliant example of what Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has called a "symbolic analyst," the elite worker (including everyone from executives to artists) in today's economy whose task is to "simplify reality into abstract images that can be rearranged, juggled, experimented with, communicated to other specialists and then, eventually, transformed back into reality." But reality, with Stewart, is itself an abstraction; some of her readers choose to grow chickens, yet most consume the printed and televised images of food, hearth and family. That's why she ought to feel at home in Gordon Bunshaft's house.
Symbolic analysts should feel right at home in Mondrian's studio, or rather the reconstruction of it at the Modern show. The walls of the studio are hung with scores of abstract images, which the artist has patiently rearranged, if not precisely juggled. The result of his experiments transformed art. But from what reality did Mondrian initially extract his images?
The modern city was an important source. That is one of the thrilling revelations of the show. In 1915, just before he leaped into abstraction, Mondrian created a group of drawings and paintings based on the cityscape of Paris. The artist was fascinated by half-demolished buildings whose innards had been exposed by the stripping away of their masonry facades. In one painting of 1915, squares of pink and blue represent the painted walls of apartments and the orthogonal interior structure that the facade has covered up. Mondrian's mature work, in other words, traces an arc that lifts from Paris and touches down in New York 30 years later, when the city appears through the lens of abstract form.
The arc parallels the innovations that revolutionized architecture in the 1920's: the stripping away of the masonry facade, the exposure of the building's interior by glass walls, the reduction of the city center to an abstract diagram.
The progressive abstraction of architecture and city planning is one of the principal developments of the modern movement; it is evident in projects like Mies van der Rohe's Friedrichstrasse project of 1921 and in the diagrammatic urban plans of Le Corbusier. These European models transformed New York's architecture in the postwar decades with buildings like the glass skyscrapers that rose along Park Avenue and the high-rise complexes like the Silver Towers on Bleecker Street. By the late 1960's, New York was well on its way to becoming an abstract city, a place that came into its own as the world capital of symbolic analysis, a center for media, information and global finance.
Abstraction had a place in New York long before the Seagram Building was built in 1958. The Manhattan street grid is a piece of engineering, not a work of art. Still, it is an abstraction, a geometric pattern projected on the ground without regard for the city's natural topography. To some extent, the city that arose from that pattern seems to reverse Mondrian: where he progressed from depicting the physical cityscape to creating abstract form, New York has grown from an abstract diagram to the densely built-up metropolis we see today.
But the city's physicality is deceptive. As the architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable once observed, "There is no art as impermanent as architecture." Huxtable was writing about the volatile real estate market and the corrosive pressures it brings to bear on the city's landmarks. Thanks to the preservation movement, which Huxtable heroically championed, those pressures have been partly held in check. Not everything solid is destined to melt into air.
There are other factors, nobler than real estate values, that contribute to the city's persistent impulse toward immateriality. In "The Skyward Trend of Thought," the Dutch architectural historian Thomas A. P. van Leeuwen describes the metaphysical aspirations of the architects who designed this century's early skyscrapers. Inspired by the soaring heights made possible by engineering, architects like Raymond Hood, Cass Gilbert and Hugh Ferris created designs that would lift the skyscraper from the material to the spiritual realm.
The architect's victory over gravity might be made to represent the groping of earth toward heaven. The neo-Gothic spires of Gilbert's Woolworth Building and Hood's American Radiator Building, the dreamy cityscapes rendered by Ferris: projects like these gave form to the utopian idea that a commercial city need not exclude the transcendent; it could pay spectacular homage to it.
TODAY, THAT IDEA MAY strike us as naive or even cynical. The architectural historian Carol Willis is surely correct, in her new book, "Form Follows Finance," to emphasize the crassly material foundations from which the skyscraper city arose. Didn't Cass Gilbert, Woolworth's architect, once call the skyscraper "a machine for making money"? Yet I think that Mondrian was not wrong in discerning that the dynamism symbolized by that skyline has a transcendent dimension all its own.
This is the dimension Mondrian evokes in "Broadway Boogie Woogie." It is not the moralistic dimension of medieval piety evoked by Cass Gilbert's neo-Gothic ornament. Rather, it is the creative realm of the artistic imagination. The painting does not literally represent the city. It remains a work of abstraction. But both the painting and its title inevitably evoke the city's streets; they recall the network of void space that runs throughout the built-up metropolis. That void is the space of creativity, the matrix of movement, of change, of ideas yet unformed, of the city yet to be built.
For me, the lesson of the Mondrian show is that abstraction is not a period style, not a dated mode of painting or designing. It is a contemporary way of being. The show documents an artist's successful struggle to live creatively in the present. The city is the record of such moments.

HEADLINE: Balancing Profits And Principles In South Africa

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa

 BODY:
IT'S HARD TO pigeonhole Anant Singh, the producer of "Cry the Beloved Country," in the terms one uses to discuss his counterparts in America and Europe.
Major film maker? Not yet, although Miramax, his American distributor, has high hopes for "Cry, the Beloved Country," which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday. Here in South Africa, the hope is that it will be the country's break-out film, the one that does for the local movie industry what "Breaker Morant" did for Australia's in 1980. 
 To that end, the country's President, Nelson Mandela, was present at a gala screening of the film in New York in October during the 50th-birthday celebration of the United Nations. At that screening -- which was attended by James Earl Jones and Richard Harris, two of the stars of the film, along with Mr. Singh and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- Mr. Mandela said, "Much of 'Cry, the Beloved Country' evokes such strong emotions about the terrible past from which South Africa has just emerged." The film, he added, "for my generation, will evoke the bittersweet memories of our youth."
So, is the 39-year-old Mr. Singh an anti-apartheid film maker? That's too narrow, although several of Mr. Singh's films -- he has produced nearly 40 -- have attacked apartheid. And if "Cry, the Beloved Country" doesn't become the defining anti-apartheid film (a version was made in 1951 by Zoltan Korda), it's at least a Hollywood-scale version of Alan Paton's defining anti-apartheid novel, one that has been read by high school students everywhere since its publication in 1948 and shapes their view of South Africa the way "Huckleberry Finn" shapes foreign views of America.
Some might even call Mr. Singh a schlock film maker, since he has produced his share of kick-boxing pictures, quickies like "Bedroom Eyes II," whose sizzling posters depict large-breasted women in mortal danger, and horror films like "The Mangler," based on a Stephen King story about a laundry-folding machine with a blood lust.
He's no fool: American B-movies that go straight to video are staples of third-world cinemas. And video-rental fees his films earn in America mean serious money here.
Mr. Singh describes himself as a black film maker, although he is Indian; in America he is constantly having to explain this to others, white and black. Since he was denied the right to vote, he tells them, and had to make his living distributing films on the "nonwhite" theater circuit -- and since he wasn't about to call himself "nie-blanke" ("nonwhite'), or Asian, as the Government preferred -- he calls himself black, as do many worldly people here.
One of the freedoms of the new South Africa is not having to submit to stereotypes, whether Afrikaner or American.
Like Mr. Singh himself, "Cry, the Beloved Country" subtly shows the difference between race relations in South Africa and those in America. The plot conforms to the book: a humble Christian priest from Zululand in the hills of Natal (played by Mr. Jones) journeys to the big city of Johannesburg to find his son, who had gone there a year before to look for work and then vanished. A prosperous English farmer (Mr. Harris) makes the same journey, by plane, to bury his son, a white liberal writer killed in a "native break-in" at his home. Inevitably, it is revealed that the priest's son was the panicky burglar who fired the shot, and the two fathers meet.
The central theme of the movie, directed by Darrell James Roodt, is also true to the book: self-congratulatory whites may delude themselves that they "brought civilization" to a culture that didn't even have a written language, but they actually destroyed southern Africa's deeply religious tribes by making their men wage slaves of a mining economy. The film, too, ends with a bittersweet note of reconciliation: two aging fathers can bridge a gap even if their peoples cannot.
It is the details, though, that recall how stark the differences were in 1946, the year in which the story is set, two years before the first apartheid laws were passed. There is a black child's expression of terror as Mr. Harris rides past and simply looks at her. There is the contrast on a train platform between a Lesotho man's straw hat, topped by its anti-lightning charm, and the elegant baggage of the whites in first class.
Mr. Singh, who wasn't around in 1946, is the son of a doctor. He grew up in Durban, an elegant old English and Indian port city with an unhurried world view that is vastly different from that of money-mad Johannesburg, which sprang up atop the gold mines in 1870.
BUT HE STILL understands. Professionally, he is a creature of apartheid who was oppressed by it and yet profited by outwitting it.
He gave up his teen-age dreams of attending a film school abroad (the only South African one was at a whites-only university) when his father died. He studied engineering but was earning a pittance as a rewinder in a 16-millimeter film-rental shop when the white boss asked whether he wanted to take over the business and buy it out of future receipts. He did, though it stayed in the boss's name, since nonwhites could not own businesses in that neighborhood.
Within nine months, at 19, he had paid off the owner. Astutely, he started buying the South African rights to foreign films, haggling Hollywood studios' demands down from $20,000 to $1,000 or so. His first big success was "Secrets," a forgettable film resurrected only because it featured Jacqueline Bisset minus the wet T-shirt she had just made famous in "The Deep."
Under the country's bizarre censorship laws, Mr. Singh was once jailed for showing the James Bond film "Live and Let Die" to friends. "Yaphet Kotto slapped Jane Seymour around in it," he explains, "so only whites were allowed to see it."
Many American movies his customers wanted were barred, from blaxploitation films like "Superfly" to model-Negro ones like "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." Sometimes he appealed. "The board in Pretoria was six clearly right-wing Afrikaner guys," he said. "The minute I appeared, you could see their arrogance come out."
At first, he never won. Later, when he could afford to hire a white lawyer, he occasionally did.
Sometimes he flouted the law and simply got the film. "It was forbidden fruit," he said. "And you're learning about a culture. For us, there was no other way to see films with black heroes."
In the 1980's, home video replaced 16-millimeter film, and since Mr. Singh's inexpensive contracts for hundreds of films included all video distribution rights, they were worth a fortune. His company, as it grew, turned into a big family business, with his brother a partner and cousins sharing his suite of offices in the hills above Durban. Mr. Singh, an unmarried workaholic, has recently managed to buy a house at the beach.
With his new wealth, he began making films that attacked apartheid. "Place of Weeping," about a brutal white farmer who fatally beats a worker who simply wants enough to eat, was made for $30,000 in 14 days, always on the run.
"Every day, the police would show up at the location where we'd been the day before," he says. On day 15, he flew to London with the negative. The next day, the police arrived at his Durban office, demanding it.
He arranged the film's commercial opening for New York, betting correctly that the Pretoria censors wouldn't risk international humiliation by banning a political film at home that major American critics had praised. Janet Maslin said in The New York Times that the film had "a plain, clumsy style that does nothing to diminish its power."
Mr. Singh, who in 1993 produced an unsuccessful Disney picture, "Father Hood," disdains Hollywood, in part because it wastes so much money: "If you need two production people," he says, "a studio wants 20 because no one wants to make a decision. Then the costs -- hotels, catering -- just compound themselves."
In 1992, he made "Sarafina!" based on the Broadway hit of the same name, with Whoopi Goldberg, for $4 million. And "Cry, the Beloved Country," which has the period sets, costumes, cars and trains that American audiences love so much, along with helicopter shots and original music, cost less than $7 million. (That in an era when the average Hollywood film is about $30 million.)
"He's very cost conscious," said Helena Spring, his associate producer. "But if a project is worth putting more money into, he'll find the money. The crews who work with him come back happy."
Darryl Accone, the editor of Big Screen magazine here, calls Mr. Singh "fairly principled, in ways that often coincide with a chance to make a profit."
GIVEN ITS LOW COST AND early success, "Cry, the Beloved Country" will presumably do that. Local reviews were tepid because the story has no new message for South Africans, but critics admired the performances. And what is unusual is that it is still in 40 theaters here after five weeks; American films like "The Bridges of Madison County," which opened the same weekend, usually chase local films out quickly.
In the United States, Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, was full of praise for Mr. Singh. "He shot extra scenes for the American version," Mr. Weinstein says. "And when all else fails, he sends me so much South African wine that I agree with everything he says."
Still, Mr. Weinstein acknowleged that the film, which is hardly escapist entertainment, would have to do well in the Golden Globe and Oscar nominations to stay alive.
Mr. Singh is ready. The waiting room of his office building is decorated with framed programs from Oscar ceremonies. Should something more substantial come along, he'll find the money for a niche.

HEADLINE: FILM VIEW;
A Chronicler Of Time's Slow March

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning 

 BODY:
HOW COULD SUCH A SMALL TREE BEAR SO much fruit, someone asks in "The Quince Tree Sun," a film by the Spanish director Victor Erice about an artist painting the quince tree in his backyard in Madrid. The question might be asked about all of Mr. Erice's films, for they create large landscapes out of the smallest worlds.
Mr. Erice (pronounced a-REE-thay), who, at 55, is considered by many to be Spain's foremost auteur, is surprisingly little known in the United States. But "Spain on Film: Spanish Cinema Now IV," a two-week festival that opened on Friday at the Walter Reade Theater, may help remedy the situation. It includes a retrospective of Mr. Erice's three movies, starting Wednesday, which the director is expected to attend. 
 "Erice is a master of Spanish cinema whose portrayal of the passage of time and the identity of the Spanish people is unique," says Angel Gil, the American film adviser to the Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers, a producer of the festival with the Cervantes Institute, the Spanish Ministry of Culture and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "He has been very faithful to his art, making only three films in 20 years and doing what he wanted, no matter what."
Mr. Erice's films have had critical successes in this country. "The Spirit of the Beehive," the story of a little girl who becomes entranced by Frankenstein's monster after the James Whale classic is shown in her village, has become a cult movie since its release in 1973. His latest film, "The Quince Tree Sun" (the English title, which Mr. Erice prefers to the American "Dream of Light") won the International Critics Award at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.
But the new film has no American distributor, which is not surprising given that the film depicts the painting of the tree at a slow-moving two hours and 20 minutes. During the French press screening at the hectic French festival, the room emptied quickly not long after the painter Antonio Lopez Garcia, a friend of Mr. Erice's, began painstakingly capturing the tree on canvas through its autumn blooming and winter decay, in what amounted not to a documentary but to a journal of an artist's work and life and a film about creation and life itself.
Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, described the film as "quiet, meticulous and supremely simple." "Mr. Erice's method is modest, yet his film manages to achieve a mesmerizing intensity," she continued. "The purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style."
That description would work as well for "The Spirit of the Beehive" and "The South," which was released in 1983. Each film has an almost unnervingly observant little girl as its central character. Both children are effectively alone in the world, loved by mothers who cannot withstand the pain of living with the remote, tormented men who are their husbands and the girls' loving fathers.
Dark magicians in their ways, one man is a beekeeper and the other a water-diviner. Both have chosen to exile themselves and their families in desolate rural areas of Spain, where fields and buildings look like a modernist's flat planes and geometric shapes, where the dark interiors and the people in them resemble those in paintings by Rembrandt or Vermeer, and where cheerful village life teems about the families at a distant periphery.
THAT LANDSCAPE RESEMBLES CARRANZA, the village where Mr. Erice was born and spent his summers as a child. The nearby city of San Sebastian, where he grew up, was a place where he could see films. (There were no movie theaters in Carranza.) "I was forced to live as a spectator, in an atmosphere reflected in 'The Spirit of the Beehive,' " Mr. Erice said in a recent interview from Madrid, where he lives.
His first memories of film, from the age of 4, are of terror. "It is funny, but I have found more than one director whose first contact with film was connected with the feeling of fear," Mr. Erice said. "This makes me think that between the children of my generation and some of the films of that time, there was a relationship that began with a certain trauma. It is not strange. One of the first films of the Lumiere brothers provoked fear, as viewers saw the image of a train entering a station."
After graduating from the University of Madrid with a degree in economics and political science, Mr. Erice studied directing at the Spanish Film School in Madrid. "The Spirit of the Beehive" was his first professional full-length feature.
"The horror movies produced by Universal interested me, but it is not true that I always had the idea of making a film on the myth of Frankenstein," Mr. Erice said. "What happened is that in 1972 I saw again, on television, the movie 'Frankenstein' by James Whale, which made me relive old emotions." Mr. Erice had just been approached by Elias
Querejeta, the noted Spanish producer. "We agreed we both wanted to make a film about the myth."
Mr. Erice kept a still from the Whale movie on his work table. In the picture, the monster and the little girl sit together beside a river. The photograph suggested to him that that first encounter, so important a part of any myth, was the heart of his first film.
"The Spirit of the Beehive" has been described as a parable about Spain under the dictator Generalissimo Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, an interpretation that Mr. Erice agrees is almost inevitable, given the tendency of art to reflect its time. But the dictatorship and Franco's death were perhaps not as great an influence in shaping Mr. Erice's career as the pressures of an unforgiving industry.
His next film, "The South," also produced by Mr. Querejeta, was about another little girl. Mr. Erice intended the film to end with her voyage to the south of Spain, where her father's family lives and which she imagines to be the warm antithesis of her bleak surroundings. But time and money ran out before he could complete the movie to his satisfaction. "For me, 'The South' is an unfinished film," he said.
Again, almost a decade went by before Mr. Erice began work on his next project. He had been participating in the debates about style during his film-school years when he helped to found Nuestro Cine, a journal that supported neo-realism over Hollywood movie making. Between films, Mr. Erice worked as a critic, screenwriter and teacher. He is now a professor of directing at the Spanish Film School in Madrid, which reopened in September after many years. He also made publicity movies for film and television, "a very efficient way to accumulate technical knowledge," he said. And he wrote a book with Jos Oliver on Nicholas Ray, an American director for whom Mr. Erice has great sympathy and admiration.
Ray had his difficulties with American studios. Mr. Erice worries about the problem of making films that do not follow industry models in an era in which all electronic image making is lumped together, at least in Europe, under the popular catch phrase "audio-visual." Film-making is an art and not a commodity, Mr. Erice insists, and must be treated as something different from video or television.
The making of "The Quince Tree Sun," with its measured and luminous unfolding, is a good example of what he is talking about. Produced by Maria Moreno, Mr. Lopez's wife, and a few friends, the movie was shot in single takes over 10 weeks, starting in September 1990. Once, film stock ran out, but Mr. Erice let the movie proceed at its own slow pace, shooting in video for three days, then transferring that to 35-millimeter film. He spent more than eight months editing the movie.
The film grew out of the two friends' talk of night dreams. When the painter told Mr. Erice about his idea of painting the tree through the winter, Mr. Erice decided to make the film, inspired, too, by Mr. Lopez's dream about being a child again, at home, and the only one in a mysterious group of people to notice the dying fruit on a quince tree.
"He arranged for me to come to his garden a few days later," Mr. Erice said. "It was my problem if I wanted to go with a camera, because whatever happened, he was going to be working next to the tree. I had never seen Antonio paint a tree. I didn't really know what might happen. I knew that the quince is an autumn fruit. The idea was to capture the sun of that particular season, which was linked to the dream and its extraordinary image.
"The point of the film is to observe the work of a painter who is trying to represent a tree in a style characterized by tenacity and perfectionism," Mr. Erice said. "The difficulty was not only the position of the sun but also the model."
In the film, which is both comical and poetic, Mr. Lopez marks the leaves and drops plumb lines from the fruit. "The model wasn't fixed," Mr. Erice said. "It was a tree whose leaves and fruit were in motion, in constant and subtle change. We are not talking about dying nature, but about life. The will of the painter to fix that moment of maximum splendor creates a tension. Indifferent to his work, obeying the laws of nature, the tree grows from ripeness to decay, as it has always done, and time is revealed as a central and decisive element of experience."

IN THE SHADOW OF WAR
The United States
Since the 1930s.
By Michael S. Sherry.
Illustrated. 595 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $35.
A LARGE standing military has been so central a part of our national life for more than two generations that many Americans may have difficulty recalling how relatively new a phenomenon it actually is. Through most of our history, national leaders cobbled together armies in wartime, then largely dismantled them in peace. As late as 1939, the American military was a small, insular, poorly equipped corps. 
 In 1940, however, the United States began to assemble one of the greatest fighting forces in history. We have never disassembled it. The result, according to Michael S. Sherry, a historian at Northwestern University, has been a transformation of the nation. Culture, politics and the economy have become tied inextricably to the reality and the image of war. We have lived for more than 50 years, he argues, in an essentially martial state.
Mr. Sherry is well qualified to explore this question, as the author of two important histories of the modern military: "Preparing for the Next War" and "The Rise of American Air Power." And he has obviously spent much time thinking about the broad reach of militarism in American life. "In the Shadow of War" is his effort to synthesize that thinking into a sweeping narrative of recent history, from the New Deal to now.
His claim to originality in this survey (drawn largely from secondary sources) lies in his argument that militarization is not just an element in our recent history, but the defining element. Military issues have shaped our politics, military imperatives have justified the expansion of our state and military demands have reshaped (and distorted) our economy. Military images have dominated our culture and encouraged us to think of our domestic life as a kind of warfare as well. The "war on poverty," the "war on drugs," the "culture wars": these terms are not simply metaphors, but descriptions of a distinctively militarized national psychology.
Mr. Sherry has produced an intelligent narrative and has given significant attention to the structure and behavior of military institutions -- which is relatively unusual in historical syntheses. He is highly sensitive to how ideas of war have shaped ideas about sex and sexuality; his discussion of the interplay between militarization and homosexuality, for example, is one of the most interesting and original parts of his book.
The end of the cold war, he argues, offered an opportunity to break the grip of militarism on American life, but so far our leaders have failed to seize it. Militaristic thinking continues to define our approach to social problems, but now it has become a source of our animus toward government. The legacy of wasteful spending, disastrous wars and other elements of our troubled romance with war, he writes, "left many Americans further suspicious about, or simply indifferent to, the state's wisdom and efficacy."
This provocative interpretation of recent American history is only intermittently persuasive. Much of what Mr. Sherry describes as "militarization" could just as easily be explained in completely different ways. A preoccupation with war has certainly had an impact on anti-Communism, corporate power, racism, homophobia and more. But militarism is not an adequate explanation for any of them. Mr. Sherry shows little interest in the many other ways historians have tried to explain our recent past. There is little attention here to the growth of large-scale institutions (many of them unrelated to the military), to the transformation of the industrial economy, to the rise of a rights-based political culture or to the expanding power of communications media and the consumer culture. When militarization doesn't work as an explanation of events, as it often does not, Mr. Sherry seems to lose interest in interpretation and simply offers a narrative.
As a result, this seems at times almost to be two different books. One is a capable but largely conventional synthesis of recent American history. The other, embedded within the first, is a challenging (if not always fully persuasive) reinterpretation of some parts of that history. This would, I suspect, have been an even better book had Mr. Sherry focused more narrowly on those areas of our recent past that support his belief that militarization is the key to understanding postwar American history.

GASTONIA 1929
The Story of the Loray Mill Strike.
By John A. Salmond.
Illustrated. 226 pp. Chapel Hill:
University of North Carolina Press. $24.95.
THE 1920's were grim years for organized labor -- with the possible exception of the 1980's, the worst in this century. Saddled with inept leaders, helpless in the face of a sophisticated antiunion campaign by employers, divided internally along racial, ethnic and political lines, the American Federation of Labor (A.F.L.) dithered and floundered, all the while hemorrhaging members. 
 Nowhere were prospects grimmer for the labor movement than in the Southern textile industry, as John A. Salmond, a professor of history at La Trobe University in Australia, suggests in his briskly told study, "Gastonia 1929." At the start of the decade, tens of thousands of workers in the Piedmont region had joined the A.F.L.'s United Textile Workers. But labor militancy soon collapsed in the face of employer intransigence, the violent opposition of police, state militias and vigilantes, and a severe economic downturn.
Textile employers cut costs with what workers called "stretch-out" tactics, increasing the pace of work and the rigor of supervision while substituting piecework for regular wages. In the Loray Mill in Gastonia, N.C., the largest textile mill in the South, wages fell 25 to 50 percent in the late 1920's.
Across the Carolinas in the spring of 1929, thousands of desperate textile workers finally rebelled in spontaneous and short-lived strikes little noticed outside the immediate region. In terms of public attention, Gastonia proved the exception. Not that the strike at the Loray Mill was notably more successful; begun on April 1, it effectively collapsed by midmonth. What made it different was the fact that hundreds of native-born white Southerners were willing to accept leadership from the Communist Party-led National Textile Workers Union. Thus, despite the brevity of the strike, Gastonia took on mythic proportions in subsequent years -- depending on your point of view, either as the symbol of left-wing attempts to subvert the "Southern way of life" or as the welcome harbinger of the radical ferment of the 1930's.
Mr. Salmond denies that he is offering any "overarching thesis" in his book. A "well-told story," he declares in his preface, "has a justification of its own." Yet implicit throughout "Gastonia 1929" is the counterfactual proposition that had someone other than the Communists played the leading role in the strike -- some group equally dedicated and self-sacrificing, but shrewder, less burdened by dogma and more sensitive to local mores -- then Gastonia might have proved a triumph rather than a tragedy.
According to Mr. Salmond, "There is no doubt that the constant emphasis on the alien, menacing nature" of the National Textile Workers Union organizers, "the threat that they posed to basic traditions and values, did contribute to the growing climate of violence in Gaston County and gave sanction to the violent incidents that did occur."
The violence included police assaults on picket lines, vigilante attacks on the union's headquarters and, finally, the gunning down of Ella May Wiggins, a millworker and mother of nine, and the balladeer of the Gastonia strike. There was also a shoot-out between armed strikers and deputy sheriffs that resulted in the death of Gastonia's chief of police and the subsequent arrest of dozens of union supporters and organizers for conspiracy. In the ensuing trials, union leaders were sentenced to prison terms of up to 20 years; Ella May Wiggins's accused killers, on the other hand, were acquitted by a local jury after less than 30 minutes' deliberation.
THE Communists who came to Gastonia in 1929 brought with them more than their share of ideological delusions and organizational shortcomings -- their celebration of the Soviet Union, their addiction to inflammatory revolutionary rhetoric, their self-proclaimed atheism (though also, it should be remembered, their equally unpopular commitment to racial equality). But was any other outcome to the strike possible? The subsequent record of unremitting failure racked up by the A.F.L., and later by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O.), suggests otherwise. Gastonia's strikers faced overwhelming odds; the fact that they were willing to risk livelihoods and lives -- under whatever fallible leadership presented itself to them at the time -- stands only to their credit.

HEADLINE: Mall Aglow With New Stores and 'Real' Santa

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
BOGGED down with shopping bags from stores throughout the Roosevelt Field mall, Roy Cotignola and Mary-Jo Thompson were doing their holiday shopping at J. Crew.
"We've already been to Kay-Bee, Disney, Warner Brothers, Learningsmith and the Nature Company," said Ms. Thompson, who traveled to the mall from Queens to find the items on her holiday list. 
 "In Queens, there's no place like this mall," she said, "where we can find such variety and feel safe."
She took out her holiday list to emphasize her success over the last few hours. "I know exactly what I'm looking for, for each person," she said.
"Not me," Mr. Cotignola said as he looked at the merchandise in the men's area. "My shopping is spontaneous. I hope I can find something here for my uncle."
The Friday after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, was extremely busy, according to the manager of J. Crew, Nicole Sliby. Business slowed down over the weekend, but became busy again on Monday and has continued to build.
The activity at J. Crew is representative of the entire mall, said Marie-Claire Cunningham, an assistant vice president of Corporate Property Investors, which owns and manages the center. Traffic over the weekend after Thanksgiving was disappointing, reflecting a national trend, she said, adding, "People are waiting longer and longer to do their holiday shopping."
Despite the optimism among managers and owners, it is too early to tell whether this will be a lucrative season. As many shoppers wait for holiday sales, last-minute shopping has become more of the norm than the exception, retailers say. Final figures for the holiday season may not be available for months.
J. Crew, which opened in Roosevelt Field three years ago, has traditionally been known as a catalogue-clothing company. Its Roosevelt Field location is its lone store on the Island.
When the store opened, it catered to a younger crowd, but now it attracts more upscale customers, Ms. Sliby said, adding: "The moms and dads who were shopping here with their kids are seeing things they like for themselves," she said. A changing customer base prompted the introduction of a more expensive line, J. Crew Exclusive, a designer collection, the manager said. The changing image is part of a trend, Ms. Cunningham said. On 106 acres, the mall, which opened in 1956, was renovated in 1993 as a three-level center, with a food court and four anchors, J. C. Penney, Macy's, Stern's and A. & S. Bloomingdale's moved from Garden City last month and replaced A. & S. last month.
Nordstrom, another upscale department store, is scheduled to open at the mall in 1997.
On the main floor, Jane Batterman was in Tourneau, paying with a credit card for a Concord watch that she had just bought for herself as a holiday gift. "This store is beautiful," she said of the Island's first Tourneau store, which opened on Nov. 16. "I had shopped around for this watch, and the prices at Tourneau were competitive. But I came here mostly because of the service."
The executive vice president of Tourneau, Anthony Dembrosio, said the store was significantly ahead of initial projections. "We've already changed our annual projections, based on business during the first few weeks," he said.
The store is selling higher-priced merchandise than it expected, Mr. Dembrosio said, adding, "Customers are more upscale than we had predicted."
The hottest items for holidays are purchases that will last, he said, adding, "People are investing in items that they can pass down to their great-grandchildren, who are not even yet born."
"I live in New York City," Ms. Batterman said, "but like to shop out here, where I can get all my holiday shopping done in one place."
Nearby, her mother, Marilyn Batterman of Westbury, said: "The new Bloomingdale's is beautiful. And at Stern's, we found great sales and got gorgeous velour shirts for the men in the family. I've lived out here for 36 years, and years ago, there was nothing in this mall except Macy's. The changes are wonderful."
 
Renovations And a New Image
The new Bloomingdale's and Tourneau reflect a changing image toward a more well-off customer. Besides the 285,000-square-foot Bloomingdale's, the mall will soon have a Nordstrom's, one of the largest specialty department stores. The chain from Seattle plans to open a 225,000-square-foot store at the mall in late 1997.
The expansion includes two restaurants near the movie theater on the former site of Herman's. The sporting-goods store reduced its size, making room for the California Cafe that opened last week and Houston's, which is to open in February.
In keeping with the new image, the California restaurant serves sophisticated cuisine with a Mediterranean influence, along with an extensive wine list and a pastry chef.
Houston's, a chain from Phoenix, is a more casual family-style restaurant.
The shift toward a more upscale image began with the 1993 expansion, Ms. Cunningham said. New shops then included Banana Republic, Warner Brothers, J. Crew and Bebe, a women's clothing chain.
"With our current expansion," she said, "we're going slightly higher. After the completion of the second level, 60 stores are to be added by next fall. They will include Crabtree & Evelyn, Kenneth Cole and F. A. O. Schwarz."
Long Island has a high level of purchasing power, said the chief economist of the Long Island Association, Dr. Pearl Kamer, adding, "Long Island residents have deep pockets."
According to the Commerce Department, the per capita income in 1993 in Nassau County was $32,966. The only other large county in the New York metropolitan area that surpassed Nassau was Westchester, at $35,945.
Dr. Kamer said that to be competitive and stay in business, malls had to stay updated and that modernization was a national trend.
"But at the same time," Ms. Cunningham said, "we do not want to alienate our more moderate tenants. Long Island is a mix of income levels, and it is important to maintain a balance so Roosevelt Field will continue to be considered the place to shop."
An 8,000-square-foot Sam Goody music store recently opened on the lower level. By next month the lower concourse, formerly just for offices, will be filled, with a Noodle Kidoodle, a store that sells children's electronics and computer games, as well as other toys.
The marketing director of the mall, Deborah Ann Flattery, said quality was also important, because people looked for value. "Customers are no longer shopping willy-nilly," Ms. Flattery said. "They are more sophisticated and more selective. They want to know that they're getting value, and they expect to be educated about their purchases. Today added customer service has become a mallwide policy."
 
Injecting 'Excitement' Into the Mall
Shelley Tessler, a longtime resident of Syosset who recently moved to California, was on her way to the airport but had to take a detour to see the new Bloomingdale's.
"It's fabulous," said Mrs. Tessler, while resting at a cosmetics counter to buy a few last-minute items. "The only consolation about moving away from Long Island is that I heard that they're opening a new Bloomingdale's in Newport Beach!"
Words of exclamation from other shoppers echoed that. "Beautiful," "exciting" and "wonderful" were frequently heard about the store that opened on Nov. 3 in the area that A. & S. formerly occupied. Aside from the Bloomingdale's on 59th Street in Manhattan, it is the largest Bloomingdale's in the country, with more than 500 employees.
Last month was a good month for business, said the general manager of the store, Richard Mast. "Now we're cautiously optimistic about December.We've brought some excitement to the mall."
Bloomingdale's customers are selective and are buying better, Mr. Mast said, with the better end of the business selling well. "As a result of Bloomingdale's coming here," Mr. Mast said, "the mall is now starting to lease to other upper-end stores."
A major change is having a salesperson accompany a customer from one purchase to another throughout the store, Mr. Mast said. "It's all about relationship building," he said. "We still have a staff at each department. But we train our salespeople to be able to shop with customers throughout the entire store, and we encourage them to stay with their customers, so they don't have to look for a different salesperson in each department. Our vision is to have 500 sales people, moving with their clients, from one department to another."
For the holiday season gifts that have been selling especially well include cosmetics -- Bloomingdale's introduced four lines, YSL, Guerlain, Fashion Fair and Origins, that it did not sell in its store in Garden City -- ties, particularly designs by Nicole Miller, Jerry Garcia, Frank Sinatra and Vicki Davis; women's cashmere and chenille sweaters; food and gift baskets, Morgan bottles with preserved specialty foods, and, for children, Woofles, a stuffed dog from Gund, and Barbie merchandise like telephones and dolls.
Bloomingdale's is the No. 1 store on Long Island for Barbie, according to Mr. Mast.
An interesting twist to being in the mall, he said, is that the store has developed a big young people's business that it did not have in Garden City. "There are so many kids in the mall," Mr. Mast said. "And we're getting a lot of spillover traffic from young people coming into Bloomingdale's to shop."
 
Valet Parking And Added Security
On a recent Friday afternoon drivers waited 10 minutes for valet parking. The two young attendants sprinted back and forth, handing tickets to newcomers and running to retrieve cars.
"You sure get a lot of exercise," said one shopper to an attendant as she handed him a $1 tip. The attendant, rosy cheeked, smiled and hurried to move the next car.
At Roosevelt Field valet parking has been a security feature for three years. It started at holiday time and is now available year-round, at a fee of $3.
Bloomingdale's has its own valet parking, which is free for customers who show a Bloomingdale's charge card. Last month the service parked 8,000 cars, Mr. Mast said.
For Debbie Fasciana of Franklin Square, valet parking is one reason that she shops at Roosevelt Field. "I always use the service," Mrs. Fasciana said. "I have three kids and usually come here with a baby and a stroller. And when I come out I usually leave with a lot of shopping bags."
Mrs. Fasciana, who said she shopped at the mall about once a week and more often before the holidays, said, "Particularly when I come here alone I feel much safer using the valet service."
Some customers complained about difficulties in finding parking spots. Even though the mall has 9,000 spaces, a south parking deck will be started after the holidays and, later, a third deck is to be added. With the three decks the mall will have 11,000 spaces.
Security is a top priority, Ms. Flattery said. Among the features are a closed-circuit television system to monitor inside and outside buildings, a new county police center, security vehicles and mounted county officers on patrol, extensive lighting, an escort service on request and two courtesy shuttle buses for the holidays.
The buses depart from the main entrance, near the Chemical Bank branch, and circulate throughout the parking area. If a bus is not crowded, Ms. Flattery said, it will go to shoppers' cars.
 
A Food Court For Many Tastes
It was standing room only at lunch time in the Food Court. Shoppers and employees hovered near tables, waiting for an empty seat. Plates were filled with deli sandwiches, hamburgers, french fries, tacos, chicken chow mein, hot dogs and yogurt with assorted toppings -- something for everyone, just like the theme of the mall.
At a table for two, Shari Hymowitz and Pam Harper, who sell Guess watches, were taking a break from visiting the stores that carry their merchandise.
"Of all the malls we visit this is the nicest on Long Island," Ms. Hymowitz, of Hewlett, said. "What they've attempted to do -- clean it up and make it more upscale -- they've really done. They've made it easy for everyone, from J. C. Penney shoppers to Bloomingdale's shoppers. There really is something for everyone."
Nearby four executives of Raymond Weil watches, dressed in suits, carried their trays as they waited for a table.
"We're here to see our accounts," one executive, Larry Lich, said. "We sell at Macy's, Tourneau and Bloomingdale's, and they're all doing well. So far it's been a very good season with our watches. People seem to be looking for a better product and are spending more."
The changes in the mall are readily apparent, starting with the look of more affluent shoppers, Mr. Lich said. As for the quality of his lunch, he said, "It's adequate."
 
Santa Claus With a Real Beard
Terri Muller of Lynbrook did not expect to be in the picture with Santa Claus and her 1-year-old daughter Danielle. "It's our first time visiting Santa," she said. "I hope she cooperates."
But Danielle was not pleased to be alone on Santa's lap. No matter how many times the photographer's assistant waved the stuffed clown at her, no matter how hard she tried to make her smile, Danielle would stop crying only when her mother stepped in to sit next to Santa and hold her daughter on her lap.
"It's too bad," Mrs. Muller said after the photograph was taken. "I really wanted a picture of just Danielle with Santa."
A half-dozen families were on the line. The Jung family, from Queens, waited. Their daughter Kristen, 3 1/2, said, "I'm going to ask Santa for a toy can opener for my kitchen and for Baby Tumbles."
"That's a doll," explained her mother, Linda.
Before visiting Santa, the Jungs had been to the Disney Store and Penney's, with great success, judging by their many shopping bags.
Two Santas alternate shifts near the grand fountain. The set has been redesigned to resemble a stroll through a country lane, with old-fashioned lampposts, foliage and simulated ponds.
The mall expects Santa -- one or the other -- to welcome 20,000 to 25,000 children, Ms. Flattery said.
For the first time, both Santas have "real beards, real bellies," she said, adding:
"They work eight-hour shifts. But can't go to the bathroom, because kids know that Santa doesn't go to the bathroom. And we allow a 15-minute break between Santas, to be sure that no kids can ever see two Santas as the same time."

HEADLINE: Merchants Keep Hoping, Despite Slow Start

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IT may be the season for glad tidings, but not so far this year for anxious retailers. In Westchester as elsewhere, shopkeepers are reporting brisk foot traffic in their stores in the weeks before Christmas -- but disappointing sales.
"The bottom line is not how crowded the stores are, but how many shoppers are leaving with bags," said Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the Westchester Chamber of Commerce. "The consumers may be out there, but whether they're buying is another question." 
 At the newly renovated 137,000-square-foot Neiman Marcus store in White Plains -- part of an upscale chain that has traditionally reported strong sales despite conditions elsewhere -- shoppers so far this season have been "just looking, taking it all in," reported Raina Penchansky, a spokeswoman.
In the store's Christmas catalogue, a $900,000 yellow diamond necklace was still languishing last week among the pages of expensive merchandise, the spokeswoman said.
Nordstrom's department store -- which like Neiman Marcus is in The Westchester Mall -- also reported that there have been more lookers than takers in the aisles. To make up for the slow start, the retailer is banking on a longer shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas -- five more days than a year ago -- said Christine Schrader, a spokeswoman.
Smaller retailers have also been holding their breath. Joseph Galano, the owner of Irvington Hardware, said merchants along Main Street in that village were "waiting for the big bang."
Like many analysts who are observing shopping patterns, Mr. Galano suggested that customers might be holding out until the last minute.
In Yonkers, at the Cross County Shopping Center, Leonard and Claire Morreale, owners of the Mont Royale Gift Shop, said they too were waiting for the shopping season to take off. They said the delayed start might be explained in part by the lateness this year of Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish festival of lights, which usually begins early in the month but does not start this year until Dec. 18. Whatever the reason, retailers throughout the county -- with substantial inventories on their hands -- were fighting to draw customers. "Virtually every store I've been in has been featuring a sale, and not just a small-time sale," Mr. Vogt said. "We're talking 50 percent off at the beginning of the season. Merchants are driving very, very hard."
Meanwhile, national figures reflected the somber picture. The International Council of Shopping Centers in New York City reported that on the Friday after Thanksgiving -- the day known as Black Friday, when retailers hope to turn their ledgers the same color -- there was a 5.8 percent surge in mall sales. But over the next two days, sales declined, and the net result was a flat sales picture for the weekend.
A week later, the trade organization reported that the picture had worsened. Sales in specialty stores in regional malls declined by 1.3 percent for the first full week of the holiday shopping season, compared with the same period last year when malls reported a 0.9 percent gain.
The bright spots were in the categories of jewelry and cards, gifts and books, both of which showed an increase of 3.2 percent, the council said. The apparel category continued to be weak, falling by 6.8 percent. Music, entertainment and software, which started strongly on Black Friday, also fell by 6.8 percent.
Home furnishings were down 2.4 percent, and footwear was down 1.5 percent. The council's holiday report includes sales from specialty stores in 80 malls but does not include department stores.
Figures from TeleChek Services, a check-acceptance company in Houston, showed that over the Thanksgiving weekend retail sales in the country were down 4.7 percent from the previous year. The news was much worse in the New York City area, where sales were off 14.6 percent.
A follow-up report last Monday said that holiday sales continued to slow in the 10 days following Thanksgiving. Their figures are based on yearly comparisons of the dollar volume of authorized checks written by consumers. Checks account for 37 percent of spending, compared with 13 percent for credit and debit cards. The rest is primarily cash.
Despite the gloomy reports, some retailers were more cheery than others, and there was some good news to report. White Plains was cheered late last month when the State Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco reversed part of an earlier agreement that would have required Federated Department Stores to close its White Plains Macy's to resolve anti-trust concerns.
When Federated merged with R. H. Macy & Company last year, it owned three White Plains department stores: Macy's in the downtown area, Stern's at the Galleria mall and Bloomindgdale's several miles away on Bloomingdale Road. The news that Macy's could stay cheered many smaller merchants who welcome customers that department stores bring to the area.
Though not the rule, sales -- as well as foot traffic -- were brisk at some stores, despite the sober reports elsewhere. At Sears in White Plains, Michael Leahy, the manager, said snow blowers were "flying out of the store" along with scarves, jackets and other cold-weather gear.
"Our sales are up," Mr. Leahy said. "We're meeting expectations. So somebody's buying!"
And at Borders Books & Music, a spokeswoman, Susan Burger, said: "It's not only wild in the store, but they are buying, too. Our shoppers seem very focused this year."
Ruthe Berman, executive director of marketing for the Cross County Shopping Center, said few customers were going home empty-handed. She attributed some of the success at that mall to the Sears store that opened there this year.
Even Miss Penchansky at Neiman Marcus had some good news to report. A $35,000 limited-edition BMW Z3 Roadster offered through the catalogue, a copy of the model driven in the latest James Bond movie, "Goldeneye," sold out early, she said, suggesting that perhaps customers were simply being more choosy this year.
Miss Penchansky may be right, and some shoppers who were interviewed said that they were simply buying more carefully this year.
"It has been a slow start," said Maribel Garcia, who was shopping last weekend at the Galleria mall. "We're watching the sales and waiting for the best deals. We're just not rushing things."
In Irvington, Pat Stockhamer was shopping at Arco Iris, a boutique, glad not to be caught in the crush at the malls and happy to be looking at specialized merchandise. "It's quieter here, unhurried," she said. "And the gifts aren't all mass produced. I'm looking for something a little different this year."
Paula Boyd, who was at the Galleria last week, said she was also looking for "something special, a little bit different." She bought many of her gifts this year at the yearly gem show at the County Center in White Plains
Certainly retailers were optimistic heading into Christmas, and the season could still end on an upbeat note, analysts said. In October, retail hiring was up by 800 jobs, compared with the same month a year ago. That was the highest October level -- 64,300 jobs this year -- since 1990, reported Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist with the state's Department of Labor.
Overall, there appeared to be a high level of confidence in the Westchester economy, said Mr. Surdey, who predicted that it would eventually translate into spending. He added that the state, in general, was in an expansion mode, with 60,000 more jobs this year than in 1994.
"We're trudging ahead, not galloping, but the indicators are postive," Mr. Surdey said. "Westchester is a big draw for shoppers from a tri-state area. It's like a family outing to go there."
Martin Deitch, a partner with Aries, Deitch & Edelson, a Hartsdale concern that develops and manages commercial properties, said merchants had every reason to be optimistic.
"Forget the doom and gloom," he said. "It's just a slow start."

HEADLINE: Business Rising, Hotels Invest in Sprucing Up

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
THE Stouffer Renaissance Westchester Hotel in White Plains has already spent $4 million on renovation, with an additional $3 million budgeted for work to be completed in the spring.
Renovations to guest rooms and meeting rooms at Tarrytown House in Tarrytown are estimated to cost $700,000, in addition to a $3.5 million expenditure for construction of a new ballroom. 
 At the Crowne Plaza in White Plains, a $4 million refurbishing of every guest room, lobby and restaurant is under way.
And in Yonkers, the former Carvell Inn has been totally renovated by new owners, who opened it in October as the Royal Regency Hotel.
Still to come in early March is a new luxury hotel in Tarrytown that will make its debut as the Castle, which will be converted from a former landmark, Axe Castle.
"Hoteliers have solid reasons for optimism," said Georgia Kalayjian, president of the Westchester Convention and Visitors Bureau. "This year, after several dismal years, occupancy is on the rise."
Citing the economic recovery as leading to a surge in business and leisure travel, Ms. Kalayjian said: "Hotels report that occupancy is up from 4 percent to 10 percent this year, and they predict an additional 3 to 5 percent rise for 1996. The repeal of the 5 percent state surtax on hotel rooms makes our hotels competitive with those in Connecticut and New Jersey, which will allow us to market Westchester more widely."
Figures are not yet in for 1995, but Ms. Kalayjian reported that 1,000 new jobs in the hotel industry were created in 1994. "The industry payroll is also at an all-time high, with 31,603 people employed in the hospitality industry."
The Convention Bureau's campaign to sell Westchester as a destination has shown results.
"For example, attendance at historic sites this year rose 18 percent," Ms. Kalayjian said. "And we have The Westchester, a fabulous mall, as a new attraction we can market to convention planners. With Neiman Marcus and the only Nordstrom in New York, we tell them we have something they can't find in Manhattan. Convention planners like to have activities they can refer to as being attractive for spouses. Now we've broadened our marketing efforts with a year-round national advertising campaign to sell Westchester as a wanted destination in itself, not just a stop on the road to Manhattan."
Westchester has about 4,000 hotel rooms, and room sales continue to rise, exuberant hotel managers say.
"We feel very optimistic," said John D. Williams, general manager of Stouffer. "Not only did we have a big boost in convention business, but leisure travel has increased. We have seen more international guests than ever before, and over the Thanksgiving holiday we booked relatives and friends of local residents." What is especially notable, Mr. Williams said, "is the rise in the number of Manhattan companies that are holding meetings and conventions here." He added, "We are more affordable and offer them a higher level of service than they can find in New York City."
At the Crowne Plaza in White Plains, business has also been excellent, Ann Peterson, the hotel's manager, said. "Our proximity to The Westchester mall gives us high visibility that we never had before," she said. "When our renovations are completed, we will be marketing a totally new, upscale product."
Jeffrey Weggeman, director of sales and marketing at Tarrytown House, said: "We're having a very good year. Overall business is up by 10 percent with projections for an additional 20 percent rise next year. Under new management by Dolce International, we have been successfully packaging the entire Biddle mansion to large corporate groups of 90 or more for the first time."
Tarrytown House, designated as one of the historic hotels of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, is also being marketed to the public successfully, Mr. Weggeman said, as a getaway destination. A great estates weekend package at Tarrytown House directed to the vacation traveler includes candlelight tours at nearby historic sites, cocktail parties and other extras.
"The getaway weekends, with room rates of $115 to $129 are going very well," Mr. Weggeman said. "They're especially popular with people from Manhattan. Our business was strong over Thanksgiving weekend, and the momentum is continuing."
And when the Castle opens this spring, visitors and business people will have an opportunity to occupy five luxury suites in the original stone landmark building, dine in a fine new restaurant and hold meetings in the Castle's ballrooms, said Kathryn Andersen, director of sales and catering for the Castle.
"The Castle is owned by a group of private investors who have positioned it to appeal to a very upscale market," Ms. Andersen said. "We're currently in the process of adding an additional 24 deluxe rooms, and when all the construction is finished we intend to apply for Relais et Chateaux status, which will make us one of a very select group of unusual luxury hotel properties."
At Doral Arrowwood Conference Center in Rye Brook, business generally follows activity on Wall Street, said Edmund J. Burns Jr., the general manager.
And lackluster, like the market, was how Mr. Burns described Arrowwood business during the first quarter of 1995.
"But the second half of this year has made up for it," he said. "Business has been spectacular. Revenues are up by 9 percent, and we expect even better things for next year."
Arrowwood has spent $2 million, Mr. Burns said, on capital improvements "to assure our position as a major conference center." He continued: "Repeat business is very important to us. We keep making capital improvements, and we also have 68 managers here because service is the key to repeat business."
Although hotel managers agree that an economic recovery and the repeal of a room tax have stimulated business, they also observe that when hotel business in Manhattan is strong, as it has been for the last year, Westchester business follows suit. Currently, hotel occupancy in Manhattan is the highest it has been in seven years.
In Yonkers, Patricia Breen, director of sales at the new 92-room Royal Regency Hotel, said that corporations have already given the hotel an enthusiastic reception. "We opened for business in October, and during the first week we were almost sold out," she said. "We have 25,000 square feet of banquet, meeting room and ballroom space, large enough to seat 800 people at a banquet. And judging from the business we have been booking, I know that lower Westchester was overdue for our type of service-oriented, moderate-priced hotel."
As for the seasonal profit maker, the holiday party, managers report an across-the-board increase this season.
"Holiday parties are very strong," Mr. Williams said. "What's more, more is being spent on them. The food is upgraded and my feeling is that it's through the party that companies are saying thank you to employees for coping during difficult economic times."

HEADLINE: Cross-Border Traffic Fuels Effort to Change Bar Closings to 2 A.M.

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI 

 BODY:
THE longstanding debate on what time Westchester's bars should close is simmering again, this time with a real possibility that last call will be rolled back to 2 from 4 A.M.
Proponents of the earlier closing say their reasons are simple: the move will reduce drunken driving and save lives. Supporters want to put an end to the migration of drinkers from Connecticut -- where bars close at 2 -- into such border communities as Port Chester and Lewisboro, where the police say they have problems with vandalism, rowdiness and traffic accidents. 
 Opponents say that closing bars two hours earlier will not only hurt the economy but also put more drinkers on the road. They argue that Westchester drinkers will either begin their evening of drinking outside the county or leave Westchester when the bars close and drive to the Bronx, Rockland or Putnam. Then, the argument goes, they will drive back through Westchester even later than usual, possibly more inebriated.
Last year, the County Board of Legislators voted for a resolution calling for the earlier closing. But the effort was blocked by the now defunct County Alcohol Beverage Control Board, which critics said favored the tavern industry.
But the political climate changed earlier this year, when Gov. George E. Pataki eliminated funds for the board, and decision-making authority on liquor sales was transferred to the State Liquor Authority. Anthony Casale, chairman of the three-man authority, said he would not comment on the situation in Westchester because there was no formal resolution before the State Liquor Authority. But he has said in the past that he considers closing time a local option and described himself to Gannett Suburban Newspapers as "a home-rule guy from way back."
Several municipalities are among those supporting the earlier closing time. The village hardest hit is Port Chester, where the police say that southbound Boston Post Road at 1:30 A.M. looks as if it were rush hour as people from Greenwich stream into the county. The Police Department's 1994 statistics showed that 97 of its 219 arrests for driving while intoxicated were made between 2 and 6 A.M. About one fourth of all accidents and property damage also occur during those hours. At least half of those arrested were Connecticut drivers, Capt. Joseph Ferretti of the Port Chester Police said.
"They are rushing over here to drink and then rushing home, going through our residential streets," said Mayor Christine Korff of Port Chester. "You're spending so much municipal money in order to allow people to drink between 2 and 4 A.M. You have to balance your resources."
The town of Lewisboro shares a long border with the Connecticut towns of Ridgefield, Wilton and New Canaan. Dr. Leslie N. Simon, the Supervisor of Lewisboro, said that the town and the neighboring communities of North Castle, Pound Ridge and Bedford, were experiencing the same type of problems as Port Chester.
"It's a diversion of manpower," Dr. Simon said. "Not only are police dealing with accidents, but we have a volunteer fire department, and these guys are fast asleep in the middle of the night, then they get a call and go out to another accident. Why do people have to drink in a bar from 2 A.M. to 4 A.M.? It would seem to me those couple of hours in the middle of the night don't make any sense."
The municipalities of Bedford, Harrison, Larchmont, the village of Mamaroneck, Mount Kisco, Mount Vernon, the town of Ossining, , Port Chester, Rye Town, Somers and Yonkers have all passed resolutions calling for earlier bar closing in Westchester.
The Westchester chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving would also like to see the earlier closing. "We are committed to seeing this through," said Barbara Spuehler, president of the chapter. "We feel it will cut down on drunken drivers being out on the road. But the basic bottom line is money. The bar owners are going to lose money. We, on the other hand, want to save lives."
Recently the Westchester chapter held a candlelight vigil for victims of drunken driving. Despite the groundswell in favor of a rollback, there is strong opposition to the change, and much of it is in the County Board of Legislators. Thomas J. Abinanti, Democrat of Greenburgh, while acknowledging the problems faced by the border communities, said that an earlier closing was not a solution.
"If we close Westchester at 2 A.M., then our people are going to get on the road," Mr. Abinanti said. "You are not going to change people and make them stop drinking earlier. You are going to move them. Let's say you have people who are accustomed to hanging out at their local bar until 2:30 A.M. Well, if they can't do that, they will go to the Bronx, leave there at 2:30 A.M., and now they are driving home at 3:15 A.M. through our communities. Where they may have had a short walk, or at worse a short drive, now they are driving on highways, in strange neighborhoods and traveling long distances, so what have we accomplished?"
Earnest D. Davis, Democrat of Mount Vernon, chairman of the Board's Legislative Committee and soon to take office as Mayor of Mount Vernon, echoed those comments. "I'm not personally convinced that closing bars at 2 A.M. would stop people drinking," he said. "I think rather that you'd see more transportation during hours you don't want. I think people will just go farther and farther."
Mr. Davis referred to the resolution as feel-good legislation. He said that younger people often didn't go out for the evening until 11 P.M. He also said he feared the move would lead to underground after-hours clubs. Such clubs would be unregulated, would provide no tax revenues and would be potentially dangerous, he said.
Mr. Abinanti and Mr. Davis suggested that education and stricter enforcement of laws would better solve the problems of drunken driving. Mr. Abinanti also suggested that closing bars at 2 A.M. discriminated against shift workers, like the police, doctors and nurses. "What about the correction officers who work until midnight?" he said. "They have a right to go out. Even if it's just a few people, who are we to say they should be deprived of that right?"
Captain Ferretti said that such an argument defied a reasonable answer. "I don't see the doctors, nurses and police officers in Connecticut complaining that they work until 2 A.M. and they have no place to drink," Captain Ferretti said. "We're not trying to bring back prohibition, but I don't see a need to be out drinking after 2 A.M., and I don't see why 2 A.M. in Connecticut should be the start-off point for drinking in Westchester." The resolution is still in the Legislative Committee. If the full Board of Legislators approves the resolution, it will then be required to hold a public hearing, and the State Liquor Authority would be asked to consider the matter.
County Legislator Paul J. Noto, a Republican-Conservative who represents Port Chester and parts of Harrison, Rye Town and Mamaroneck, said: "I think this is one of those cases of special interests versus the public interest. Certainly, people are profiting from the 4 A.M. closing, but that's not as persuasive an argument as the public safety argument. One result of this is that fewer people would be drinking and driving after 2 A.M. I don't know how people can argue that that's not a good public policy."

GASTONIA 1929
The Story of the Loray Mill Strike.
By John A. Salmond.
Illustrated. 226 pp. Chapel Hill:
University of North Carolina Press. $24.95.
THE 1920's were grim years for organized labor -- with the possible exception of the 1980's, the worst in this century. Saddled with inept leaders, helpless in the face of a sophisticated antiunion campaign by employers, divided internally along racial, ethnic and political lines, the American Federation of Labor (A.F.L.) dithered and floundered, all the while hemorrhaging members. 
 Nowhere were prospects grimmer for the labor movement than in the Southern textile industry, as John A. Salmond, a professor of history at La Trobe University in Australia, suggests in his briskly told study, "Gastonia 1929." At the start of the decade, tens of thousands of workers in the Piedmont region had joined the A.F.L.'s United Textile Workers. But labor militancy soon collapsed in the face of employer intransigence, the violent opposition of police, state militias and vigilantes, and a severe economic downturn.
Textile employers cut costs with what workers called "stretch-out" tactics, increasing the pace of work and the rigor of supervision while substituting piecework for regular wages. In the Loray Mill in Gastonia, N.C., the largest textile mill in the South, wages fell 25 to 50 percent in the late 1920's.
Across the Carolinas in the spring of 1929, thousands of desperate textile workers finally rebelled in spontaneous and short-lived strikes little noticed outside the immediate region. In terms of public attention, Gastonia proved the exception. Not that the strike at the Loray Mill was notably more successful; begun on April 1, it effectively collapsed by midmonth. What made it different was the fact that hundreds of native-born white Southerners were willing to accept leadership from the Communist Party-led National Textile Workers Union. Thus, despite the brevity of the strike, Gastonia took on mythic proportions in subsequent years -- depending on your point of view, either as the symbol of left-wing attempts to subvert the "Southern way of life" or as the welcome harbinger of the radical ferment of the 1930's.
Mr. Salmond denies that he is offering any "overarching thesis" in his book. A "well-told story," he declares in his preface, "has a justification of its own." Yet implicit throughout "Gastonia 1929" is the counterfactual proposition that had someone other than the Communists played the leading role in the strike -- some group equally dedicated and self-sacrificing, but shrewder, less burdened by dogma and more sensitive to local mores -- then Gastonia might have proved a triumph rather than a tragedy.
According to Mr. Salmond, "There is no doubt that the constant emphasis on the alien, menacing nature" of the National Textile Workers Union organizers, "the threat that they posed to basic traditions and values, did contribute to the growing climate of violence in Gaston County and gave sanction to the violent incidents that did occur."
The violence included police assaults on picket lines, vigilante attacks on the union's headquarters and, finally, the gunning down of Ella May Wiggins, a millworker and mother of nine, and the balladeer of the Gastonia strike. There was also a shoot-out between armed strikers and deputy sheriffs that resulted in the death of Gastonia's chief of police and the subsequent arrest of dozens of union supporters and organizers for conspiracy. In the ensuing trials, union leaders were sentenced to prison terms of up to 20 years; Ella May Wiggins's accused killers, on the other hand, were acquitted by a local jury after less than 30 minutes' deliberation.
THE Communists who came to Gastonia in 1929 brought with them more than their share of ideological delusions and organizational shortcomings -- their celebration of the Soviet Union, their addiction to inflammatory revolutionary rhetoric, their self-proclaimed atheism (though also, it should be remembered, their equally unpopular commitment to racial equality). But was any other outcome to the strike possible? The subsequent record of unremitting failure racked up by the A.F.L., and later by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (C.I.O.), suggests otherwise. Gastonia's strikers faced overwhelming odds; the fact that they were willing to risk livelihoods and lives -- under whatever fallible leadership presented itself to them at the time -- stands only to their credit.

HEADLINE: Bilingualism Enhances Our Competitiveness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re letters on bilingual education (Dec. 5, 7):
Spanish-speaking citizens are the fastest-growing minority group in this country, and by the year 2000 are expected to be the largest. 
 The short-term effects of English-only legislation can therefore be expected to be problematic, especially in emergency situations when warnings of dangerous conditions would go unnoticed by people who do not understand English.
Moreover, people unable to obtain bilingual services may fail to get immunizations against contagious diseases to seek essential medical attention, further endangering public health. My Republican colleagues tout integration and nationalism yet systematically chip away at the programs that would help immigrant and other foreign-language communities enjoy that reality.
Multilingualism is a tremendous resource to the United States because it permits improved communications and cross-cultural understanding.
Conversely, English-only measures undermine the economic competitiveness of the United States as well as represent an unwarranted governmental restriction on self-expression.

HEADLINE: Refugees Returning To Bosnia

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Some were so afraid that they dared not even look at the road in front of them. Still, the 750 refugees slowly began to cross into Bosnia, their homeland.
Behind them was a refugee camp in Croatia that they said was no longer tolerable; forward lay a country where they were hated rebels. 
 These refugees took part in a rebellion here in northwest Bosnia against the Bosnian Government, killing thousands of Government troops, many their own neighbors and family members, and maintaining a semi-independent state for most of the last two years.
While in other parts of Bosnia it was Croats and Serbs who rebelled against the Muslim-led Government, here it was fellow Muslims who took up arms. And though the agreement reached in Dayton, Ohio, last month requires that any of the 1.3 million refugees who wishes to go home be allowed to do so, right now this is the only place in Bosnia where the side in control is permitting substantial numbers of former enemies to come home. The return here began last week and has already brought some 3,000 people from a camp of about 21,000.
Today, refugees moved forward past glowering Bosnian border guards. First a few buses, then the chugging tractors with families perched on them and towing homemade wagons with the families' few possessions.
Finally, the poorest of the refugees came through on horse-drawn carts. They looked worn out and fragile, bundled in blankets and shaking in the freezing fog.
Senad Sakanovic, 24, once a soldier in the rebel army, stood next to his horse, both of them sweating from the effort of a 15-mile journey through the snow-covered mountains from the camp, yet shivering from the biting cold. He said: "The only possible future for all of us is to overcome our differences. We will have to learn how to do that one step at a time."
To help both sides learn reconciliation there are more than a dozen international relief organizations here, including various branches of the United Nations. The Bosnian Government has replaced most of the local military units that fought the rebels here with police officers from other parts of the country.
In addition, the Government is allowing the work of those police officers to be monitored by a unit of 200 police officers comprising Croats, Bosnians and Turks.
Still, the local commander of the United Nations Civilian Police, which has had a post here through most of the war, is skeptical. The commander, Inspector Kurt Bannerhoff, said that as long as the international community is vigilant it will be difficult for officials to act against the returning refugees, but there is probably no way to protect them from revenge at the hand of their neighbors who supported the Government.
"This project is a good idea, maybe it will succeed, but personally I doubt it," he said. "There will be serious problems in the future."
When Yugoslavia began to tear apart in 1991, people in this region here increasingly turned for leadership to the most prominent local citizen, Fikret Abdic.
Mr. Abdic's business combine provided most of the jobs for the approximately 50,000 residents, and though he was convicted of embezzlement in 1987, he became the economic and political strong man. Then he became a warlord.
In 1993 Mr. Abdic accused the Government in Sarajevo of being dominated by Muslim fundamentalists. He declared the way to peace was through political and business deals with the Croatian and Serbian governments and with the local military forces those governments were fostering.
The Bosnian Government disagreed. But in this region most people followed Mr. Abdic, even when he effectively seceded from Bosnia and set about making hugely profitable business alliances with Croats and Serbs and, to protect his remote dominion, initially successful military alliances with them as well.
That turned him and his followers into Muslim rebels against the mostly Muslim Government.
Last August, after the Croatian Government and local Croat militias became Bosnian allies, Bosnian Government forces recaptured the area controlled by Mr. Abdic. People who had fled because they supported the Government returned as victors and Mr. Abdic's supporters fled to the camp in Croatia.
He is now reported by diplomats to be running his remaining businesses from Croatia. But here in Velika Kladusa, and the dozens of surrounding villages, people who four months ago were on opposite sides of the firing line are now faced with the challenge of how to be neighbors again.
Relief workers say so far the reintegration has gone well enough, despite scattered threats by Government supporters and reports that several hundred returning men found themselves almost immediately conscripted into the Government army.
Even so, watching today's group of refugees returning, Fatmira Keseravic, an elderly woman who supported the government, did not sound very forgiving. "Well, if someone has done something wrong, they might have reason to expect trouble," she said.
Husein Sadikovic, 62, who said his son had joined the Abdic army while he supported the Government, predicted that the hostility would be controlled here in town but not in the rural areas.
"In villages it will be much worse," he said. "No government will be able to control that, even with all these international forces here."
That is also the fear of many of the relief workers in the camp, especially, they say, as the mandate of the United Nations is to expire in mid- January and with the question of what responsibility NATO and other foreign forces will exercise over reconciliation efforts still unclear.
But the ultimate responsibility belongs to the people here, said Burhan Tansu, the commander of the Turkish police unit. "My men tell them, sooner or later you will have to live together," he said. "You are a family. We will leave someday, but this is your country."

HEADLINE: Europeans Buy Home PC's At Record Pace

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 10

 BODY:
An avid keyboard player, Mario Tronco paid $2,100 six months ago for a personal computer that he hooks up to a 48-track digital recording system to produce mesmerizing music for his band, Avion Travel. When Mr. Tronco is not composing, his wife uses the computer, a simple I.B.M. clone, for her translation business.
Growing up two decades ago in Caserta, a workaday town outside Naples, the 32-year-old musician attended schools with no computers. 
 "Computers?" The idea made him laugh. "They didn't have central heating," he recalled. But his cousin's 5-year-old son, Nicola, growing up in Caserta today, "turns the family computer on and off, perfectly at ease," Mr. Tronco said.
The bets of Europe's computer industry are riding on the likes of Nicola. With improvement in European economies in the last year or two, sales of personal computers have boomed, growing at rates of 25 percent to 30 percent in each of the first three quarters of this year, after years of erratic growth.
Feeding the boom is a fierce price war, as personal computer makers from Europe, Japan and the United States flood the market with fancier and cheaper machines intended to woo computer-shy Europeans.
The European divisions of American companies are getting their share of the action. Compaq and the International Business Machines Corporation are the No. 1 and No. 2 suppliers, respectively, and Apple Computer, Hewlett-Packard and Dell rank in the top 10.
Europe's manufacturers are struggling hard against the American assault. Siemens Nixdorf and Escom A.G., in which the German industrial giant Siemens A.G. holds a 10 percent stake, have had to cut prices steeply to increase their share of the market. Olivetti of Italy lost $162 million on personal computers last year, and though it is fighting back with a new home computer system called Envision, some industry experts fear it may be the European computer war's first fatality.
What fuels the hopes of PC companies is that far fewer Europeans than Americans own home computers. Nearly 4 in 10 American households have a computer, but Europe is another story. In technology-minded Germany, slightly less than 20 percent of households have a computer, about the same percentage as in Britain. In France, postal authorities gave out small home terminals, called Minitels, virtually free of charge in the 1980's to turn Frenchmen into computer enthusiasts. Yet today, only 15 percent of French households have upgraded to a personal computer.
As the rate of increase in the sale of home computers begins to slow in the United States, the companies that make them are spending millions to convince Europeans that their future, and their children's, should have a computer in it.
They have learned that with computers, as with most other consumer products, the cost of having one is greater in Europe than in the United States. Fewer Europeans than Americans are exposed to computers in schools, and fewer use them at work. More Americans work at home or bring work home from the office than do Europeans, who more passionately defend the line between home and the workplace, according to a recent survey by Inteco, a market-research firm near London.
Europeans, the computer makers have learned, have less access than Americans to the global Internet, and when they do, government telephone monopolies make them pay more for them. And while the market for CD-ROM's is growing apace, Europe's fragmentation into relatively small language groups makes the cost of producing them greater than in the United States.
Over the last two years, I.B.M. has spent millions of dollars overhauling its personal computer division, the C.P. Company, and used television and print ads to get Europeans to try computers. The ads typically show fathers, mothers and children working or entertaining themselves at a home computer screen.
And big manufacturers like I.B.M. and Compaq are banking on brand recognition, hoping that parents who use their products at work will buy the same brand for their children to do their homework. The companies, accustomed to providing big corporations with computer systems, are tailoring new models to home use.
"We used to sell only Ferraris," said Aldo Meneghelli, chief of Compaq's Italian unit in Milan, which is pushing Compaq's Impresario multimedia system. "But you don't sell a Ferrari to someone who's satisfied with a Fiat."
The manufacturers are getting a run for their money. Recently, aggressive competitors like Escom, Hewlett-Packard and Dell have cut prices as much as 20 percent to gain market share. In the third quarter Escom catapulted into third place, from seventh, by acquiring a chain of 200 retail stores in Britain, outside its home German market, then undercutting competitors' prices by about one-third. So many producers are rushing in that some analysts fear a glut in the market.
"These are still quite high-ticket items for every household to have one," said Charles Smulders, who follows the personal computer market for Dataquest in London. "Yes, penetration of the market is higher in the United States, so the opportunity is here in Europe." But, he added, there may always be a gap between the American enthusiasm for computers and that of Europeans.
Apartments in Europe are generally smaller than American homes, with less space available for computers and peripheral equipment. And with computers somewhat more expensive here, their purchase is more heavily tilted toward the wealthy than in the United States. American consumers now spend $1,500 to $3,000 for a typical personal computer system, while prices in Europe generally begin around $2,000 -- a bigger chunk of usually lower salaries than in America.
Moreover, with fewer high-volume discount outlets, Europeans often buy their computer equipment in small retail stores, where operating costs and rent are higher per unit than at the big American discounters. The value-added tax, a kind of sales tax at each stage of production and distribution, adds as much as 20 percent to the cost of a computer.
"It's not just computers, but hi-fi's and television sets, too," said Miles Thistlethwaite, a computer analyst at Inteco. "You simply pay more in Europe."
Cost plays a role in other ways, too. Many CD-ROM's for education or entertainment -- films, encyclopedias or children's educational aids -- are American items produced in English, and the cost of having them translated and sold in relatively small European markets is high. These costs, passed along to the consumer, discourage Europeans from buying them in sufficient quantities to make their production profitable.
Beyond all that, the high cost of telephone calls and on-line services often stifles purchases of computers and modems. The European Commission has proposed directives that demand full market deregulation by Jan. 1, 1998, but with many telephone systems still run by state monopolies for now, service in Europe is costlier than in the United States.
Heiko Schmidt, a 20-year-old economics major at the University of Bonn, logs onto the Internet free of charge through the university's access system. Were he to use the German post office's BTX access ports, he would pay a $15 monthly fee, plus the cost of the call. "Their system is very slow, so you wait hours," he said.
In most countries, on-line access is only available in big cities, requiring those elsewhere to make expensive long-distance calls for access. Mr. Schmitt, for instance, is discouraged from joining Compuserve because the nearest access ports are in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf, 50 to 100 miles away.
Despite the improvement in computer sales, the tempo of market growth slowed in the second and third quarters of this year. But manufacturers hope that the Christmas season will revive home PC sales.
Elio Franci, who operates 15 Arcipelago Sparta computer stores throughout northern Italy, part of Sparta S.p.A., said that the two months of November and December generally accounted for 40 percent of sales. But echoing store owners elsewhere in Europe, he noted signs of a new European economic slowdown -- something that would not bode well for products like home computers.
Others, paradoxically, believe that even a slowdown might provide a sales stimulus, as parents seek to equip their children for an increasingly tight job market.
"Parents think kids need one," Mr. Thistlethwaite of Inteco said. "It makes them more attractive for getting a job. They need skills."

NEW YORK CITY
 
Suspect in Harlem is Identified
The gunman-arsonist who killed himself and seven other people in Harlem was identified by the police as Roland James Smith Jr., a 51-year-old laborer with an arrest record for charges relating to gun possession, war protests and draft dodging. [Page A1.]
As services at the United House of Prayer for All People took place in a makeshift sanctuary in Harlem, questions were raised about the church's role in the planned eviction of the Record Shack store. [B3.]
The motivation behind the Harlem fire may be rooted in another neighborhood quarrel: last year's heated turf war between store owners and illegal vendors. [B3.]
Victory Is Set to Reopen
The oldest theater on 42d Street, the Victory, is to reopen after an $11.4 million restoration, the first stage in the fulfillment of a promise to reclaim all of the street's historic theaters that goes back to the announcement of a major urban renewal plan for the area in 1981. [A1.]
Token Clerk Dies From Injuries
Harry Kaufman, the subway token clerk who suffered devastating burns and lung damage two weeks ago when two men turned his Brooklyn booth into an exploding inferno in a botched robbery that replayed scenes from the movie "Money Train," died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. [B1.]
All Eyes on a Union Leader
Stanley W. Hill, executive director of New York City's largest and most powerful municipal employees union, is under pressure as never before. In the wake of the defeat of the teachers' contract, all eyes are on Mr. Hill to see whether he can rescue the agreement he negotiated for his union. [B1.]
Behind the Teachers' Vote
Members of the United Federation of Teachers voted down a contract because many said they felt they had nothing to lose. And with the Mayor up for election in two years, many figured they might have something to gain. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]
Jews Honor Yitzhak Rabin
Nearly 15,000 Jews crowded into Madison Square Garden to honor the memory of Yitzhak Rabin. The response from American Jews was so great that several thousand people had to be turned away at the arena's doors. [B1.]
The Power of Words
As thousands of New York Jews went to Madison Square Garden to honor Yitzhak Rabin, and as mourners filed past the incinerated shell of Freddy's clothing store in Harlem, a question was raised: are the two communities connected by the same thread of hate? NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B3.]
A Helping Hand in Brooklyn
Two years ago, Gerardo Aponte's life had caved in, and he came to a realization: "If you don't take care of yourself, nobody will." With the help of a vocational training program, he learned the supermarket trade, and now works at a Pathmark in Brooklyn. He credits his success to his family and the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the organizations helped in part by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. [B4.]
An Affinity for 'Makropulos'
"The Makropulos Affair" is an elusive member of the standard operatic repertory, for most a familiar name but not a familiar face. So how odd it is that two of America's leading companies -- in New York and Chicago -- have taken it into their heads to offer Janacek's 1926 stage piece in new productions separated by barely a month. [C11.]
 
REGION
 
Pataki Unveils Welfare Plan
Governor Pataki unveiled a wide-ranging plan to reshape the state's welfare programs by sharply cutting benefits and creating a new system for delivering them. Monthly checks would be set by a simpler formula, localities could play a greater role and, in a potentially contentious proposal, drug testing for recipients might be mandatory. [B5.]
Frigid Weather Hits the Region
The first frigid day of the season hit the New York City area, with strong winds and temperatures dropping to 16 degrees in Central Park. The National Weather Service said the cold weather is expected to remain in the New York area until at least Thursday, when there is a chance of snow. [B5.]
On Living in Connecticut
A large majority of Connecticut residents think the state's living standards have worsened in the last five years and most expect them to continue declining, according to a new survey. [B5.]
4 Killed in Head-On Collision
Four men -- three brothers and a cousin -- were killed in Baldwin, L.I., when their car was hit head-on on the Sunrise Highway, apparently by a drunken driver. [B5.]

HEADLINE: The Wages of Winning;
Social Worker Turned Labor Leader Tries Conciliation

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
For Stanley W. Hill, executive director of New York City's largest and most powerful municipal employees union, this was supposed to be the year to shine.
With the retirement of the charismatic titans who had long dominated municipal labor, Mr. Hill would have his star turn, a long-awaited chance to wrest a generous contract from City Hall and win the adulation of his union's 125,000 members. 
 But that was not to be.
Instead Mr. Hill is under pressure as never before. Thrust into negotiations with a Mayor intent on cutting spending, Mr. Hill agreed to a labor pact that contains no new raises for the first two years of a five-year contract.
And after New York's public school teachers stunned the city by rejecting a similar deal, all eyes are on Mr. Hill to see whether he can rescue the agreement he negotiated for his union, whose members make up more than a third of the city's total municipal work force.
Known as an amiable conciliator, Mr. Hill, a former social worker, is a sharp contrast to the hard-nosed union leaders of the past whose strikes crippled the city. And now more than ever he finds himself on the defensive in trying to sell the agreement he negotiated with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Judging from the hostile welcome he received at a union delegates' meeting one recent evening, that will not be easy. As he entered, 700 municipal hospital workers who filled the back of the auditorium showered him with boos, paper cups, crumpled fliers and cries of "sellout."
They shouted that Mr. Hill had betrayed them not only because their wages would be frozen for two years but because the agreement offers no guarantees of job security for hospital employees while it promises no layoffs for three years to almost all other nonuniformed city workers. The lead heckler was James Butler, president of an 11,000-member hospital workers' local, who said: "He sold us out. He double-crossed us. I think he's holding hands with Giuliani."
Mr. Hill, normally an easygoing, self-effacing man, grabbed the microphone and shouted that he had negotiated the best contract he could -- after the two-year freeze, wages would increase 13 percent in the last three years of the pact.
"I've been fighting for you for years," he thundered at a meeting where union solidarity seemed an oxymoron. "I'm not going to take this." In the crowd, three fistfights erupted between opponents and supporters of the agreement.
The pandemonium notwithstanding, Mr. Hill emerged triumphant that night -- three-fourths of the 350 delegates at the meeting voted to recommend the contract to the rank and file. At least for the time being, he had saved the contract, and his hold on leadership, by doing his homework: he had assiduously courted the leaders of the 56 locals in his union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Despite the delegates' vote, many District Council 37 leaders predict that when the whole membership votes this month, more of them will oppose the agreement than any previous contract in the union's history. And some labor leaders who had predicted only last week that ratification would be a cinch are beginning to say a defeat is possible now that the 90,000-member United Federation of Teachers voted down its contract, 56 percent to 44 percent.
A rejection of the contract could cripple Mr. Hill's hold on power. For Mr. Giuliani, a rejection would undermine a stratagem to buy labor peace until after the 1997 election.
The key to ratification is Mr. Hill, a man known for working 16-hour days and chatting for 20 minutes with every union member he bumps into. On Thursday night, the night the teachers' rejection was announced, he met with four locals to try to sell them on the contract.
Each day, he records a message for a union telephone number that District Council 37 members can call to hear him argue for the accord. He has put out an eight-page newsletter and appeared on union-sponsored radio shows to push the contract.
"The idea of rejection is something I don't want to talk about," he said in an interview. In a candid moment, he acknowledged that what happened with the teachers' contract will make his selling job harder. The sense is that it will embolden many of his members, too, to vote no.
Making Mr. Hill's job more difficult, some people in the union, whose members are largely black and Hispanic, complain that he has become too close to Mr. Giuliani, far closer than he was to Mayor David N. Dinkins, whom District Council 37 helped to elect in 1989.
In many ways, Mr. Hill, 59, is different from his predecessor, Victor Gotbaum, the crusty unionist who helped navigate the city through its fiscal crisis in 1975 and selected Mr. Hill to replace him in 1987.
Unlike Mr. Gotbaum, Mr. Hill is considered extremely nice, a characteristic rare in the rough-and-tumble world of labor bargaining. This reputation has caused some members to suggest that he was not tough enough to negotiate a good deal, and that if Mr. Gotbaum had been the lead bargainer, the contract would be significantly better.
But from an office filled with awards and plaques from unions and civil rights groups, Mr. Hill passionately defended his record: "I've brought decent contracts back to my members," he said. "Since Mayor Giuliani is in office, we haven't experienced any layoffs. This contract gives job security to workers in mayoral agencies. We maintained our benefits despite demands for givebacks. And we got an economic package we can build on."
Mr. Hill predicts ratification because of his seven-days-a-week campaigning, because of his careful consensus building within the union, and because many city workers, whose salaries are often just a few steps above the poverty line, are delighted that the contract promises job security at a time of austerity.
Responding to Mr. Butler, Mr. Hill said that Mr. Giuliani had steadfastly refused to grant ironclad job security protections to workers in city hospitals. The Mayor insisted on maintaining flexibility to lay off hospital workers because of anticipated Medicare and Medicaid cuts and his plans to privatize municipal hospitals.
"I didn't sell out Jim Butler," Mr. Hill said. "We're going to continue to fight for job security for hospital workers."
Many days, Mr. Hill serves as a dart board for critics. From the right, business-backed groups attack him for failing to make concessions to improve productivity, making it harder to balance the city's budget over the long term. From the left, some advocates for the poor say he has won too many goodies for city workers, diverting money from the poor.
Such criticism rankles Mr. Hill, who says his years as a city social worker and his volunteer work for a dozen community groups demonstrate that he cares about the poor.
"My whole background and philosophy in life is to help the poor," he said. "Remember, I represent workers who earn on average $25,000. In this tough economy, many of them have to work two or three jobs to make ends meet."
Sandra Feldman, president of the teachers' union, said he cares not just about his members but about the good of the city. "He was a kid who grew up on the city streets, and he really identifies with the people who receive the services his members provide," she said.
What praise there is comes from two quarters. First, his nominal adversaries, City Hall officials, heap praise on him as a tough negotiator, no doubt wanting to convince District Council 37 members that he obtained the best contract he could. Praise comes as well from labor leaders who know how hard it is to negotiate a satisfactory contract during a fiscal crisis, and then sell it to the members.
Barry Feinstein, the retired teamsters leader who upstaged Mr. Hill in the 1991 contract talks, praised Mr. Hill's bargaining, noting that "this was the first time a New York mayor agreed there would be no layoffs for a set time frame."
Mr. Hill asserts he is as tough as the situation calls for, but he admits he favors conciliation over confrontation. That, he said, stems from his growing up black on the Lower East Side, where there were few blacks, making him learn how to get along with people different from him.
"Ironically, dealing with all kinds of people prepared you for leadership," said Mr. Hill, whose father was a truck driver and mechanic.
He also learned from playing basketball, first as a guard at Central Commercial High School, and later at Iona College. "My role on the court taught me communication and consensus building," he said.
Oddly enough, these communication skills are working better with the Republican Mayor than they did with Mr. Dinkins, with whom Mr. Hill repeatedly clashed. He criticized Mr. Dinkins for breaking promises and laying off hundreds of well-paid park workers and replacing them with lower-paid employees.
He is kinder to the current Mayor, and praised his budget for providing "balance, fairness and hope," adding, "Once you negotiate with him, he keeps his word."
Relations are so solid with the Mayor that District Council 37 bought two $1,000 tickets to a Giuliani fund-raising dinner and invited him to speak at a union convention.
Mr. Hill defends his ties to the Mayor, saying labor leaders need to maintain good relations with the city's most powerful man. But he says he will continue battling the Mayor in many areas, like the plans to privatize hospitals. And like Ms. Feldman, he criticized Mr. Giuliani's push to raise his own salary: "The timing was very bad because it comes when I have to sell a contract with two zeroes to my members."
The way political analysts see it, Mr. Giuliani has wooed Mr. Hill with the aim of attracting black supporters and perhaps neutralizing District Council 37's political clout in the 1997 mayoral race.
Norman Adler, a political consultant to the union, explained their closeness this way: "There's a white Republican mayor and a black Democratic union leader. It's like two sticks. One leans left and one leans right, and they both get to stand up a long time."

HEADLINE: Today's Music Men, Playing Old Acts For New Markets

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
It was 30 years ago today that Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. But in 1995, the Beatles are still very much in style. In fact, they're the hottest thing in the record business.
For an industry that caters to youth and thrives on fresh talent, that is no reason to smile. To some music executives, the runaway success of the new Beatles album, more than two decades after the band broke up, is a fitting coda to a year marked by creative ennui, lackluster sales and unprecedented management turmoil. 
"As a whole, we didn't put out enough good records," said Doug Morris, the new chairman of MCA Music Entertainment, a unit of the Seagram Company. "You can have a great economy, and if you don't have any hits, you'll do lousy."
Mr. Morris played a central role in the industry's topsy-turvy year. In the last 18 months, he was promoted, dismissed, hired by a rival company and promoted again. Along the way, two of the largest record companies, MCA and the Warner Music unit of Time Warner Inc., ousted their top executives. Warner Music went through a couple of chairmen.
Meanwhile, the Sony Corporation last week dismissed Michael P. Schulhof, the president of its American operations and the executive who oversaw Sony Music Entertainment, and people familiar with the company said it could be in for further shake-ups.
Record executives generally attribute the corporate bloodletting to politics and personality clashes in individual companies, rather than to structural problems in the industry.
But the turmoil of 1995 lays bare several fundamental shifts, which could spell deeper trouble for the $35 billion worldwide music business. As a new generation of leaders takes the helm at some of the largest record companies, several experts question whether these new bosses are any better equipped than their predecessors to navigate the industry through a rapidly changing landscape.
For the first time since the compact disk came out in 1983, sales of recorded music in the United States are likely to be flat for the year. The CD, which revived the industry a decade ago by enticing people to replace cassettes and vinyl records, has matured as a format.
Moreover, the foreign market -- which, with the CD, was the twin engine of growth for the industry -- has become far more challenging. Sales in some overseas markets like Brazil and Malaysia are booming, and the industry is plowing into new territories like India and China, but once-robust markets in Europe and Japan are flagging.
The torpid growth comes as entrepreneurs like David Geffen are starting new record labels and conglomerates like Viacom Inc. and the Walt Disney Company are thinking about jumping into the business.
On the retail side, the explosive growth in record stores has glutted the marketplace. Big chains like the Musicland Stores Corporation have struggled to remain profitable and new players like the MCI Communications Corporation are bypassing stores by selling music to consumers through toll-free phone numbers.
"We have too much money chasing too few acts," said Val Azzoli, the new president of Time Warner's Atlantic Records, "At this rate, we're going to blow our brains out."
Mr. Azzoli actually had a great year, thanks to an obscure but memorably named college band, Hootie and the Blowfish. Hootie's full-bodied rock-and-roll made it the monster new act of the year; Atlantic has sold nearly 13 million copies of its debut album, "Cracked Rear View."
But Mr. Azzoli, a shaggy-haired executive who helped manage the Rolling Stones' "Steel Wheels" concert tour, understands better than most that hits like Hootie are few and far between. Aside from Warner Music, few other distributors introduced a significant new star in 1995.
To ride out these dry periods, the industry relies on established artists like the Rolling Stones or Elton John, who sell CD's year after year in dozens of countries. With the exception of the Beatles, though, the warhorses are not selling as well anymore. New albums from Michael Jackson, Elton John and Rod Stewart all were disappointments this year.
With sales growth in the United States at a crawl, the overseas record business is becoming ever more critical. And that is where the management turmoil of 1995 raises an intriguing question: How qualified are the new music impresarios to compete globally?
The executives ousted by Warner, Sony and MCA all concentrated on the overseas end of the business. Robert J. Morgado, the former chairman of Warner Music, built a vast network of foreign record labels to complement domestic labels like Atlantic.
At Sony, Mr. Schulhof visited the foreign labels' offices and cultivated a friendship with the company's biggest global pop star, Michael Jackson. And at MCA, Mr. Morris replaced Al Teller, a longtime record executive who expanded a parochial American company into 27 countries.
Mr. Morgado, Mr. Schulhof and Mr. Teller also embodied a more corporate style of management that spread through the industry in the 1980's, as it came under the fold of six vast conglomerates.
But these three executives were perceived as weak in the bread-and-butter business of finding and signing hits. By contrast, Mr. Morris and Thomas D. Mottola, the president of Sony Music, epitomize the old style of record executive, the kind who built labels by hanging out in clubs, spotting new artists and signing them before the other guy.
Mr. Mottola used to manage Daryl Hall and John Oates, and is married to Sony's biggest female pop star, Mariah Carey. Mr. Morris started as a songwriter and produced the 1970's hit single, "Smokin' in the Boys Room."
"It's very curious," said Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. "The new generation is the old generation."
Mr. Morris freely acknowledged that he must learn the overseas record business from the ground up, while Mr. Mottola only wrested control of Sony Music's overseas arm from Mr. Schulhof two years ago.
Warner Music, meanwhile, is now under the control of two film executives, Robert A. Daly and Terry S. Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers film studio, who have never worked in the music industry. Ramon Lopez, the chairman of Warner Music International, said this was not a drawback because both have ample experience in selling films and videos around the world.
Mr. Mottola and Mr. Morris both insisted they were qualifed to manage global businesses, too. As a manager, Mr. Mottola said he helped take Hall and Oates overseas. He said he would spend 30 percent of his time next year touring the offices of Sony's international labels.
For his part, Mr. Morris said that he would employ the same skills he used as president of Atlantic Records to turn MCA into a global player. "Markets are opening up, and American culture is fascinating to people all over the world," he said.
But making money overseas is no longer simply a matter of distributing Michael Jackson's latest album in 30 countries. Alain Levy, the chief executive of the Polygram unit of Philips Electronics N.V., said that in countries like Japan and Italy, consumers now choose local artists over English-language imports.
In background and temperament, Mr. Levy may be the closest thing to a genuinely global record executive. Born in France, educated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and based in London, Mr. Levy has cultivated local artists throughout Asia to help build Polygram into one of the top three record companies, along with Time Warner and Sony.
Mr. Azzoli, who was a protege of Mr. Morris at Atlantic, dismissed the idea that the record industry has gone in the wrong direction with its lastest breed of top executive. While managers like Mr. Morgado built a global infrastructure, he said, the industry now needs leaders to return the business to its roots: Hit making.
Several of his colleagues agreed. "The U.S. executives have been spoiled by the huge growth from the conversion of cassettes to CD's," said Thomas E. Freston, the chairman of MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom.
Mr. Freston and other executives said that the big companies had lost a step in spotting and popularizing new musical trends, like grunge rock or hip hop, as they have become global bureaucracies. That role is now being filled by independent labels, which have raised their combined market share from 14.6 percent in 1993 to almost 20 percent this year, according to Sound Scan, an industry research firm.
"The major companies have become like fast-food outlets," said Walter Yetnikoff, the former chairman of CBS Records, who is raising money to start an independent label.
The global scale of the music industry, however, guarantees that it will continue to be dominated by a handful of giants. The challenge for the industry, according to several executives, is to resolve the tension between traditional record people and global managers.
Michael J. Fuchs, the former chairman of Home Box Office who replaced Mr. Morgado as head of Warner Music, sees the turmoil as a sign that music is making the transition from a domestically focused, loosely managed business into a professionally run worldwide industry.
"It's not a matter of domestic versus foreign," said Mr. Fuchs, who was himself criticized by record executives as an outsider and lost his job in a power struggle last month.

HEADLINE: Panel in Hawaii Recommends Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
A state commission in Hawaii will recommend to the Legislature this week that it grant marriage rights and responsibilities to couples of the same sex.
Coming from a panel appointed by the Governor, the recommendation is another step in a legal contest over marriage in Hawaii that began in 1993, when the State Supreme Court opened the door to same-sex unions. 
 The report, which also calls for the recognition of domestic partnerships, will provide ammunition for advocates of same-sex marriage.
"It is historical and unprecedented," said Daniel R. Foley, a lawyer for the three couples who brought the case decided by the State Supreme Court.
But no one expects the report to sway the Legislature, which last year banned same-sex marriages. It acted after the Supreme Court had found that the denial of marriage licenses to gay couples would be unconstitutional unless the state demonstrated a compelling interest for doing so.
It sent the case back to a lower court, which postponed its hearing to await the recommendations of the Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law, whose members were appointed by Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, a Democrat.
On Friday, by a 5-to-2 vote, the commission concluded that the denial of a marriage license to two men or two women deprived the applicants of important legal and economic benefits on the basis of their sex.
Among those benefits are the right to have joint parental custody, obtain insurance and health benefits, file joint tax returns, receive alimony and child support, inherit property automatically and visit a spouse or child in a hospital.
"This is an equal-protection question, and they should not be denied this right on the basis of their gender," said Thomas P. Gill, the commission chairman. He is a lawyer, a former Democratic member of Congress and a former lieutenant governor who joined the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1940's.
About gay couples who sought civil recognition for their unions, Mr. Gill said: "These are people. We have a lot of them. And they have rights. Let's keep this an open society."
Another commission member, Bob Stauffer, a writer and lecturer at the University of Hawaii, said, "I hope, I pray we'll see the end of this apartheid against our gay and lesbian citizens."
The commission said the state had not demonstrated a compelling interest in withholding marriage licenses.
"The opposition can't come up with a compelling state interest other than Leviticus 18," Mr. Gill said. (Verse 22 of that chapter declares, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.")
"Procreation is used as an argument," Mr. Gill continued, "but interestingly enough, no heterosexual couples are asked that question. If two 75-year-olds walk in for a marriage license, they don't say, 'What the hell are you doing here?' "
Mr. Gill was in the House of Representatives when the civil rights bill of 1964 was debated. "Many of the arguments I'm hearing now sound very much like the arguments we heard in the early 60's -- 'blacks are inferior,' et cetera," he said.
For opponents of the recommendation, the issue is not civil rights but the fabric of society itself, which they see being torn apart by the destruction of the traditional family.
"Heterosexual and homosexual coupling are not equivalent," said Lloyd James Hochberg Jr., a commission member who voted against the recommendation. He is a former president of the Hawaii office of the Rutherford Institute, a conservative legal group specializing in religious liberties cases.
"Since homosexuality is an emotional disturbance, according to many psychologists," Mr. Hochberg said, "why would we want to take a pathological condition and make it the equivalent of heterosexual marriage as a goal that society is teaching children? Once homosexual marriage or domestic partnership is permitted, the schools are going to have to teach that it's equivalent"
The staff lawyer for the commission, Pamela Bell Martin, said the report would be sent to legislative leaders this week.
Robert H. Knight of the conservative Family Research Council dismissed the report, saying the commission "was leaning toward gay activism from the first day."
"And I don't think it will effect the Legislature's views," Mr. Knight said, "because they already know too much about the issue to be taken in by it."

HEADLINE: UPBEAT ESTIMATES MAY GIVE LEEWAY FOR BUDGET DEAL

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
With a new deadline for Congressional action just five days away, lawmakers learned today that they would have more than $100 billion of extra money to help balance the budget because of new, more optimistic estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Congressional aides said the budget office had re-estimated the savings that would result from the Republican plan to balance the budget, which President Clinton vetoed last week. The original estimate showed savings of $1.13 trillion over seven years. 
 The new estimate shows that the bill "would have achieved more than $100 billion of additional savings, beyond what is required to reach balance," a Senate Republican aide said tonight. The estimate apparently assumes that inflation will be lower and economic growth a bit higher than in earlier predictions by the budget office.
The revised figures, to be presented to budget negotiators on Tuesday, could give them some new leeway. In theory, at least, the budget could still be balanced by 2002 if the cuts in the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid were somewhat smaller, and education spending was somewhat higher, than the Republicans have proposed.
On Medicare, at least, the Republicans are contending that they are already quite close to the President's position, even though the Democrats cite big differences in the rival proposals.
The budget flexibility offered by the new figures was addressed by Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the Budget Committee, on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "The economy's gotten a little bit better," Mr. Kasich said. "We're going to have a few extra dollars. And because of that, we'll be able to make some improvements in the plan that we currently have."
But even with the new savings identified by the Congressional Budget Office, Congress and the White House remain hundreds of billions of dollars apart. Even sharper disagreements remain on questions that do not lend themselves to splitting the difference, like whether the Federal Government should continue to guarantee health coverage under Medicaid to all poor Americans.
A temporary spending bill passed after last month's Government shutdown expires on Friday. Although few expect an overall settlement by then, the looming deadline is expected to add some urgency to the budget talks, which have limped along for the last two weeks.
President Clinton called Congress's Republican leaders, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, from Air Force One today to discuss the negotations. Both sides expressed optimism after the talks, and an Administration official said the Republicans had proposed a face-to-face meeting with the President on Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters later, Mr. Dole said: "We don't want to shut down the Government. We want to get it done."
However, both sides continued to use the impending deadline to jockey for political advantage. Speaking in Arkansas before returning to Washington, Mr. Clinton said the Republicans might try again to use the threat of a Government shutdown to force him to agree to their proposals.
"We ought to be able to agree on one thing: Nobody -- nobody -- should threaten to shut the Government down right before Christmas," Mr. Clinton said.
The Republican National Committee chairman, Haley Barbour, counterattacked on "Face the Nation," saying, "If the Government closes, it's going to be because Bill Clinton chooses for the Government to be closed."
The new Congressional Budget Office figures also do not resolve a deeper disagreement over the economic assumptions to be built into the projections of spending and revenue at the heart of the Republican's seven-year plan.
The Republicans assert that the Administration's new seven-year budget, which it released last week, is off by at least $400 billion because it relies on overly optimistic estimates compiled by the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
At the same time, Republicans have begun to argue that their differences with the White House on Medicare, the most politically explosive of the issues that divide them, have been overstated by the blizzard of numbers that have surrounded the budget talks. They now maintain that negotiators could move closer to compromise by focusing on the level of spending rather than the magnitude of proposed savings.
Democrats want to discuss the amounts to be saved, or cut, from Federal spending in the next seven years. They argue that this is the best way to describe how changes in programs like Medicare would affect people.
By contrast, Republicans want to emphasize what would actually be spent. To do otherwise, they say, is to play politics with numbers.
In Medicare, as in many other programs, spending would continue to increase from year to year under both the White House and the Republican proposals, but the rate of growth would be reduced.
Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Barbour say Mr. Clinton has exaggerated the differences between the two parties on Medicare. But White House officials counter that the Republicans are trying to undo the political damage they have inflicted on themselves with unpopular proposals to redesign Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
In fact, the levels of spending proposed by Mr. Clinton and by the Republicans are much closer than the amounts of their proposed savings. The Congressional Budget Office says Medicare spending would total $1.65 trillion in the next seven years under the Republican plan, while the Clinton Administration says spending would total $1.68 trillion under its plan. That is a difference of $30 billion, or less than 2 percent.
The two sides use very different projections of what Medicare spending would be in the next seven years if the current law is not changed, and those projections are the benchmarks from which proposed savings are measured.
Last week, as in June, Mr. Clinton said he wanted to cut projected spending on Medicare by $124 billion, or 6.6 percent, in the next seven years, while the Republicans want to cut $270 billion, or 14.4 percent. The Republicans, Mr. Clinton said, would turn Medicare into "a second-class system."
But Mr. Barbour, who has immersed himself in the details of domestic policy more deeply than his recent predecessors, said in an interview: "In actuality, there is only a $30 billion difference between what we spend and what the Democrats want to spend over the next seven years. Democrats are deliberately trying to exaggerate the differences to deceive people so people think the Republicans are making massive cuts in Medicare spending. Otherwise, how could Clinton claim our proposal would destroy Medicare?"
Mr. Gingrich went further, saying the Democrats' concentration on the contrast between $270 billion and $124 billion showed "the systematic mendacity of our opponents."
The White House disagrees. Lawrence J. Haas, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget, said: "Our focus is on how these proposals affect average Americans. Looking at aggregate numbers masks the very real effects that a $270 billion cut in Medicare over seven years will have. We are interested in the human impact. We think the human impact will be profound and, in many respects, devastating."
For some Democrats in Congress, even the President's proposals go too far. Many Democrats voted for proposals to limit Medicare savings to $90 billion over seven years. Ellen C. Dadisman, a spokeswoman for Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for Medicare legislation, said that he would "prefer to stay at $90 billion."
While the Republicans propose to spend less than Mr. Clinton, the effect of their proposals is magnified by the fact that they have a different starting point. The Republicans use estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, while Mr. Clinton uses projections by the Office of Management and Budget.
The Congressional agency says that, under current law, Medicare and many other programs will grow more rapidly than the White House budget office expects. These different projections, when stretched to cover seven years, add up to large amounts of money. But by proposing deeper cuts from a higher estimated starting point, the Republicans end up with a plan that would spend just 2 percent less over seven years than Mr. Clinton's plan would.
Mr. Kasich said last week that in comparing the Republican and Democratic proposals, "we must look at the bottom line: how much do they plan to spend on Medicare, and how much do we plan to spend?"
But Administration officials frame their Medicare proposals in terms of saving, not spending. "We are committed to a specific amount of savings," said Chris Jennings, a White House aide. "You should focus on the savings numbers, not the outlays."
Even if the two parties could agree on Medicare numbers, they still have major philosophical disagreements over the direction of the program.
The dispute over Medicare illustrates the confusion that can occur when different agencies insist on using different starting points, or baselines, to assess proposals. "We tear our hair out over multiple baselines," Mr. Jennings said.
The first director of the Congressional Budget Office, Alice M. Rivlin, established the agency as an authoritative, nonpartisan source of information on Federal spending and the economy. Congress is required by law to use many of its estimates. But now, as director of President Clinton's budget office, Ms. Rivlin has repeatedly challenged the forecasts and estimates of the Congressional agency she once headed.
Congressional Democrats have been even more critical of the agency. The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said, "Today, I think, it's a Republican-orchestrated, Republican-run, Republican-dominated organization that can't be relied upon as a bipartisan resource any longer."
Mark G. Desautels, a spokesman for the Congressional Budget Office, said that June E. O'Neill, the office's director, rejected Senator Daschle's criticism and said that she had "conducted herself in a thoroughly nonpartisan manner" since taking office in March.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "No amount of manipulation of the figures can disguise the fundamental differences between the President's priorities and those of the Republicans."

Teachers Play Hardball Poker (No Bluffing)

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
AND the moral is: Never underestimate a New Yorker's talent for outpoliticking the politicians.
Why, for the first time in 35 years, did members of the United Federation of Teachers reject a deal negotiated and defended by their leaders? Because they figured they had nothing to lose. And maybe a lot to gain. 
 A signed contract would have stalled teacher salary increases for two years, anyway. So why not wait it out, they figured? Especially since two years from now both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, will be facing re-election.
"They'll be under more pressure then," explained Louis Howort, a teacher at the High School of the Humanities, in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. To Mr. Howort, the union chapter chairman at his school, the contract failed for an obvious reason: "Teachers can sit back and wait two years and break even. Can they?" he asked -- referring to Ms. Feldman and Mr. Giuliani.
Many other teachers at Humanities said much the same last Friday. The school, on West 18th Street, seemed a good place to examine post-vote sentiment, since about 80 percent of the school's teachers voted no, according to Mr. Howort. Citywide, teachers voted 56 to 44 percent against the deal.
THE result caught many by surprise because outsiders judged the five-year settlement to be quite handsome. It included a no-layoff pledge for three years, an 11 percent salary increase (13 percent including benefits) with payouts starting in the third year; relief from cafeteria and hallway duty; a top salary of $70,000, and no significant concessions or "productivity savings," despite the Mayor's pledge to make unions more efficient.
The contract was so far from meeting the standards Mr. Giuliani had set that it drew criticism from the ever-frowning Citizens Budget Commission, from editorial boards, and from this and other columns. But to teachers, the avoidance of "productivity savings" has merely a theoretical ring, while "wage freeze" is Economics 101: the rejected contract meant no new increase for two years, and even after five, New York's teachers would still earn less than those in most neighboring communities.
It was clearly that freeze -- and not the impending raise in the Mayor's own salary -- that killed the contract. Ms. Feldman said Mr. Giuliani's support for his own raise and pay increases for managers and other elected officials "tipped it." But many teachers at Humanities insisted they would have rejected the deal anyway, and complained louder about Ms. Feldman's U.F.T. salary of $156,963. Let Mr. Giuliani and others get their raises, they said. But they want theirs, too, and never mind the city's poverty pleas.
"I AM 64 and I cannot retire until I am 150, not with that contract," complained Hilda Aronson, language coordinator at the High School for the Humanities.
Other teachers also said it would have been unfair to defer 5 percent of every new teacher's salary for four years, and considered the no-layoff pledge an empty gift; with 20,000 new students turning up every year, why would anyone be laid off? Even the relief from cafeteria duty was not appreciated; it was packaged with new authority for principals to tell teachers how to use their free "professional" periods. And since few teachers believe that the Mayor's plan to have welfare recipients patrol cafeterias will ever succeed, they figured they would be risking more than they gained.
The same might be said of the majority's vote last week. Given the Mayor's inordinate fondness for getting his way, the teachers may be risking more than they're counting on. For now, Mr. Giuliani refuses to reopen negotiations. But the rebellious teachers on West 18th Street are convinced that they have the initiative. Their union has 68,000 teachers, and many live and vote in the city. They predict that with his re-election bid looming, Mr. Giuliani will have to listen to them. So will Ms. Feldman.
Several disgruntled teachers consider the union president too chummy with the Mayor, too willing to greet his education cuts with only mild complaints.
Not so, Ms. Feldman has steadily maintained. In any case, she and the Mayor have been exchanging fairly nasty comments since last week. And in a noticeable change in tone, Ms. Feldman's statement about the contract rejection referred to "horrendous" and "horrible" conditions in the schools -- which presumably were horrendous and horrible before last week.
That's politics. So is Mr. Howort's prediction that the teachers will eventually obtain a more attractive deal. "It's because of the election. That is the political reality."
Any New Yorker knows that. Maybe, by now, even the politicians.

HEADLINE: Most Residents See a Drop in Standard of Living, Study Finds

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 10

 BODY:
A large majority of Connecticut residents think the state's living standards have worsened in the last five years and most expect them to continue declining, according to a survey conducted for a Fordham University research group.
The survey, part of a report on the state's social health commissioned by the General Assembly and the William Caspar Graustein Memorial Fund, found that 71 percent of the people polled thought the average Connecticut resident's chances of finding a satisfying job were poor. 
 Forty percent said they had been unable to buy something they considered necessary or important in the last year because they could not afford it. And 83 percent said it was difficult to provide for themselves and their families.
"There have been times when conditions were declining but the effects were not yet perceived by people," said the report's author, Prof. Marc L. Miringoff, director of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at Fordham. "Here you have a perception by residents that things are not improving and that in fact most things are worsening."
The report is the second annual study of indicators of social health, from income and housing costs to infant mortality and child abuse, prepared by the Institute as a guide to policymakers.
The first report, published last year, found that on a scale of 0 to 100, Connecticut measured 40 on the Institute's index of social health in 1992, 21 points lower than in 1984, and barely above the national index. According to this year's report, the state's index rose to 43 in 1993, the last year for which statistics were available, but that remains well below the level of the mid-1980's.
In addition, Dr. Miringoff said, the survey of 1,000 residents, conducted Sept. 8-15 by Yankelovich Partners, a public opinion research group based in Westport, Conn., shows that the state is still experiencing the effects of a weak economy that began with the recession in the late 1980's.
The telephone poll of adults selected at random has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, Dr. Miringoff said.
The study found that four measures of social health had improved over the last several years: infant mortality and births to teen-agers fell; wages rose and housing became more affordable in a declining real-estate market.
Other categories, however, worsened: violent crime, child abuse, youth suicide, unemployment and health care costs all rose; the percentage of students completing high school fell and the disparity between rich and poor in the state widened.
These measures, dependent on statistics that often lag two to three years behind events, were confirmed by the survey of residents' attitudes, Dr. Miringoff said.
A majority of those polled said that living standards, job opportunities and public safety had all declined in the last five years, and more than two out of five expected further decline in the next five years.
Sixty percent of the people surveyed, however, said the quality of health care available in the state was good, and 72 percent said the quality of education that the average child received was good.

HEADLINE: Chilling With the Speaker

 BODY:
We are entering the second week of Newt Gingrich's chill-out. The Speaker said he benched himself, but he had a right to be shaken by the enthusiasm with which the Republican House members have now embraced the idea of a less Newtonian universe. While he is resting, Mr. Gingrich has time to think about a potentially exquisite dilemma. Should he bless a budget deal between Republican and Democratic moderates, even if it risks a rupture with the flame-throwing freshman Republicans in the House?
For the past few days, the Republicans have been surprisingly outspoken about Mr. Gingrich's excess. You almost expected Christopher Shays and John Boehner to say, "Our long national brow-beating is over." Many of their colleagues were dismayed by Mr. Gingrich's petulance about his treatment on Air Force One and by his comments linking a grotesque murder in Illinois to the modern welfare state. A torrent of questions about possible financial irregularities and election law violations has also undercut his authority with G.O.P. reformers. Meanwhile, the polls have shown that the haranguing oratory that brought the Republican agenda so far is now frightening the voters. 
 The Speaker, of course, cannot always help himself. He and his associates say it's the old professor in him. Whatever, you never know when the dark Newt is going to jump out. Last week, Mr. Gingrich looked cuddly and discreet, assuring Barbara Walters that deep down he was just a guy who worries about a beer belly and loves T. rex teeth. But suddenly, when President Clinton used President Johnson's pen to veto the Republican budget-balancing plan, Mr. Gingrich snapped that "the Great Society is dead." So much for the G.O.P.'s focus-group spin that it was going to save Medicare, not bury it.
For all the name-calling and posturing by both the White House and the Republicans, the elements of a bipartisan compromise on getting a balanced budget in seven years are there. They are, principally, a much smaller tax cut, curbs on the growth of Medicaid and Medicare that do not traumatize the nation's health care system, a reduction in the annual inflation adjustments for Social Security and tax brackets, and fewer cuts than Republicans want in domestic programs, particularly welfare, food stamps and education. The Congressional Budget Office seems likely to provide some negotiating room if it releases more optimistic revenue and spending projections tomorrow.
To be sure, a budget deal would require some more movement by President Clinton, as this page has advocated, particularly in scaling back or eliminating his proposed tax cut. But no matter what happens, a budget agreement that comes from the center of both parties will probably not be backed by the extreme of either.
Perhaps a hundred Republicans say they will not vote for anything that has less than a sweeping tax cut, and a like number of Democrats may not vote for a budget with the kinds of cuts their own President has endorsed, such as cuts in many domestic programs and abandonment of the 60-year-old concept of welfare as an entitlement. Mr. Clinton has broken with his colleagues to the left, but Mr. Gingrich has yet to get out in front of the true believers in his party in the same way.
Conciliatory signals on the budget have been coming from both Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Representative John Kasich of Ohio, chairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees. We may soon see whether Mr. Gingrich is not just being muzzled but pondering the right moment to forge an accord that falls short of the demands of his right flank. In short, the moment that he is leader of his zealots and not merely a captive of them.

HEADLINE: An Old Jewel of 42d Street Reopens, Seeking to Dazzle Families

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
When the big, glaring marquees and the sleazy, garish storefronts are taken down, the most astonishing thing turns out to exist on West 42d Street: architecture. Tonight, the street's oldest theater, the Victory, reopens after an $11.4 million restoration, the first stage in the fulfillment of a promise to reclaim all of 42d Street's historic theaters that goes back to the announcement of a major urban renewal plan for the area in 1981. And the effect is to transform the city's roughest street into one of its gentlest.
 Renamed the New Victory, the 500-seat theater between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, an ornate, domed house that opened in 1900 as the Republic, will serve as the city's first full-time performing-arts center for children. It will be a kind of Lincoln Center for families, bringing a mix of plays, dance events, operas and film to a street that until recently was the last part of the city that anyone would associate with children. 
 The theater will serve as a New York home for children's programming by such organizations as Theater for a New Audience, Theaterworks/USA, the Metropolitan Opera Guild and Cirque Eloize, the Canadian circus that will be the first company in residence, with performances from Dec. 19 through 31. The circus will be one of several groups on tonight's opening-night bill. The show will also include performances by Patrick Stewart, Bill Irwin, Audra McDonald and the Muppets. It will be followed by a party next door at the Academy, the former Apollo theater, next door to the New Victorywhose main entrance is now on 43d Street.
 The opening of the New Victory thus marks both the creation of a new cultural institution and the start of the long-planned reclamation of 42d Street's historic theaters: architectural treasures that had deteriorated into seedy showplaces for action films and pornography. It comes roughly six months after the Walt Disney Company agreed to renovate the New Amsterdam, 42d Street's grandest theater, for legitimate use as a commercial Broadway house.
The New Victory will operate as a nonprofit performing-arts center under the auspices of the New 42d Street, another nonprofit organization that was set up in 1991 under the leadership of Cora Cahan to oversee restoration of several of the street's theaters as part of the ambitious 1981 urban renewal plan for Times Square and West 42d Street. That plan, widely criticized, called for the construction of four huge office towers around Times Square and a merchandise mart and hotel at Eighth Avenue as a means of paying for the restoration of the street's historic theaters.
After 14 years, the towers and mart have yet to be built, thanks to a complicated mix of political pressures and forces in the real estate market. But the tail of 42d Street's renewal is managing to come into being anyway, even without the dog that was supposed to wag it. The developers of the office towers were required to make good on a commitment to contribute $18.2 million toward theater restoration even though the towers themselves have been indefinitely postponed. Restoration or renovation of seven of the block's nine theaters is now under way or committed. Some, like the New Victory, will be for nonprofit arts activities; others, like the Empire and the Lyric, will be integrated into commercial projects.
If the way the New Victory has turned out is any indication, the tail is clearly the best part of the 42d Street dog. To see 42d Street with the New Victory's exquisite facade restored -- and the gross marquee of the Lyric Theater next door removed to allow the historic New Victory some breathing space -- is to rediscover not only a single building but an entire block. Suddenly the urbane quality of this whole block becomes visible.
Forty-second Street turns out to be less a street of signs than a street of faded, elegant buildings. The New Victory is the most striking, its facade a curious combination of the grand and the ordinary, with a stunning monumental staircase running up and down the dull brick exterior, lots of brownstone ornament and 10 elaborate globed standing lamps, each a work of sculpture. But two doors down, the Times Square theater, with a long Corinthian colonnade, has an austere grandeur of its own.
The architect Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates has renovated the New Victory in a sensitive but not slavish manner, supporting its original architecture while allowing plenty of room for the late 20th century to show through. The New Victory, built originally by Oscar Hammerstein and extensively renovated two years later by David Belasco, is an exquisite jewel on a street of gems. Few who saw the building during its worst period, as a shabby theater showing pornographic films, or even as a Minsky's burlesque house in the 1930's, would have noted it, but the New Victory's domed auditorium is one of the city's most delicately detailed and joyously wrought public rooms.
It has now been reconstructed to look almost as it did in Belasco's time, except for the addition of modern lighting and sound and projection equipment. And except for the absence of an arched colonnade that once stood atop the cornice, the facade now bears a striking resemblance to what Hammerstein unveiled in 1900, when the theater opened as the Republic, with Lionel Barrymore starring in a play called "Sag Harbor."
Between the facade and the auditorium, however, Mr. Hardy has put aside illusions and inserted a series of modern lobbies and public areas, and built a new loading dock and dressing-room area on West 43d Street behind the theater in space formerly occupied by a bar and a delicatessen. (The rear of the original theater was "landlocked," cut off entirely from street access, which is why small structures behind the building had to be removed.)
Mr. Hardy's approach to restoration is part archeological, part conjectural. He rejects the idea of bringing the building back precisely to its former appearance. "Even if you wanted to do that, what period would you restore it to?" he asks. "There is the original Hammerstein theater, then Belasco changed it all. And the building has to be made to work today."
Making the building work today involved not only adding the latest technological equipment and backstage support space, but also changing the nature of the public space that is not within the theater auditorium itself. Most of New York's older theaters, however elaborate their auditoriums, were tight, almost meanly wrought little buildings, and the Victory was as tight and mean as any. Its site was originally occupied by four brownstones, and there was virtually no lobby: the back of the auditorium was almost at the street. The theater was not only inaccessible to the disabled, the space was so tight it was barely accessible to anyone else.
The renovation reduced the number of seats from 700 to 500, eliminating the rear of the auditorium to allow for a small entry lobby. A lower-level concession area and lounge has been added as well, partly in newly excavated space. And since there was no space within the building for an elevator shaft, it was slipped into an alleyway at the eastern end of the building.
If the facade now comes fairly close to its appearance when the building was opened by Hammerstein, the two-balconied auditorium has been restored to more closely resemble the theater's somewhat more ornate Belasco phase. There are splendid carved putti covered in gold leaf surrounding the central dome; wrought-iron stanchions with carved bees, a pun on Belasco's initial, at the end of each row of seats, and ornate tiers of boxes topped by golden domes, little baldacchinos, in the front corners of the auditorium.
The colors are deep reds, gold, and tiny hints of purple and green. By pulling in the rear wall, Mr. Hardy has made the room, intimate to start with, feel even smaller. It is unusual in its proportions: at roughly 50 feet long, 50 feet wide and 50 feet high, this theater is almost a cube. And it is as sensual and lush a cube as exists anywhere in New York.
The overall idea, then, is to deal in architectural illusion on the street and inside the auditorium, where trying to approximate the original appearance has been the rule, and to keep things plain and straightforward in the lobbies and service areas, where there was little or nothing to restore in the first place. This creates the striking rhythm of walking through layers of time: the past in the street facade, then a pause in the present in the lobby, then a return to the past in the auditorium.
It's a rhythm that adds, rather than detracts, from a sense of authenticity. For part of the architectural notion here is to keep illusions in check -- to have no illusions about illusion, so to speak. The New Victory is dazzling, yet no one will mistake it for a trip into the past. This is not 42d Street as theme park, not a total environment designed to fool us into thinking that we are in a Times Square of the past. It is a restoration that uses the architecture of the past to create a viable 42d Street for today, and that is a different enterprise altogether from the architecture of make-believe.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES;
For Stanley Crouch, Democracy Is a Lot Like Jazz

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

THE ALL-AMERICAN SKIN GAME, OR, THE DECOY OF RACE
The Long and the Short of It, 1990-1994
By Stanley Crouch
267 pages. Pantheon Books. $24.
Before he became a contributing editor to The New Republic and a columnist for The Sunday News, Stanley Crouch was a jazz critic for The Village Voice. So his oldest love is jazz, and his book, "The All-American Skin Game," reflects this in a variety of ways. 
 For one thing, some of the speeches, essays and reviews collected in it have titles like "The B & J Blues" (the initials referring to Blacks and Jews), "Black Power Redux Blues" and "Another Long Drink of the Blues: The Race Card in the Simpson Case." For another thing, the most considered and best-written pieces in the book are essays on Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Wynton Marsalis.
More significant, Mr. Crouch roots his celebratory vision of American democracy in a comparison of that system to jazz, which he calls "the highest American musical form because it is the most comprehensive, possessing an epic frame of emotional and intellectual reference, sensual clarity and spiritual radiance."
Extending the comparison, he writes: "The demands on and the respect for the individual in the jazz band put democracy into esthetic action." He continues: "The success of jazz is a victory for democracy, and a symbol of the esthetic dignity, which is finally spiritual, that performers can achieve and express as they go about inventing music and meeting the challenge of the moment."
This is the ground on which Mr. Crouch praises such heroes of his as the writers Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray, both of whom he reveres for pulling in "all of the highest intellectual aspirations and achievements from the world over" and combining them with "the democratic complexities so inherent to our nation." And it is the ground on which he attacks those he considers his enemies: on the one hand those who define "Afro-Americans as a long lost group uninformed by the African cultural principles that supply the best defense against an irrevocably hostile white world"; on the other hand "Marx's descendants," who argue that "we take our position in a sentimentalized proletariat, not just victimized by class but also racially excluded from getting a grip on the means of production."
Mr. Crouch loves the stew of American democracy, the ferment of nationalities; what he calls the "gumbo" of our culture and "our miscegenated identity as Americans." This allows him to answer the question raised by Charles Murray in "The Bell Curve" of whether "the majority of Negroes," in Mr. Crouch's words, "are doomed by their genes to be less intelligent than white people." Mr. Crouch simply asserts that "no matter your definition of Afro-American culture, there is, quite frankly, no Afro-American race."
This outlook also permits him to belittle the threat of black anti-Semitism on the theory that "Negroes and Jews" share a "tragicomic sensibility, as it has translated itself into music, dance, comedy and drama." He argues that one reason "the ranks of the Nation of Islam don't swell" is "that Negro-Americans are not puritanical and have never been attracted to religious orders that frowned upon joy." He adds, "The members of the Nation of Islam are a dour bunch -- far too dour to ever appeal to more than a cult faction of the black American community."
Finally, Mr. Crouch's love of jazz is most evident in sentences he writes that roll on and on, dipping and soaring like a trumpeter laying out a lick. For instance, of Dizzy Gillespie, he writes, "He rose from the position of an odd fish to a star surfer riding the high, high curving water of a trend, sank into the position of those miracles taken for granted, but periodically returned to view, dripping with new wisdoms, beckoning as others followed him on the thin boards of art and entertainment that those who make their name in jazz must ride, atop the roller coaster waves of public taste, swinging all our blues in a fickle brine where they are forever at peril."
This improvisatory style works well for him when it takes surprising turns, like pulling in a quote from Thomas Mann's 1938 book "The Coming Victory of Democracy" to illustrate his point about the convergence of jazz and democracy. Or like citing Isaiah Berlin's book "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" to compare Afrocentrism's attitude toward Western culture with German mistrust of France at the time of the Thirty Years' War.
But Mr. Crouch's style can also go astray. Occasionally the metaphors grow overripe to the point of spoiling: "The coming to power of Christendom led to Jews being demonized by the dark and poisonous side of the udder from which drips also the milk of Western civilization."
And you wish he would elaborate on certain observations instead of sounding them as mere riffs. What exactly does he mean when he writes that "like our economy, our cities, and our universities, our long fiction has been in trouble for years"? What is he getting at when he writes that where Picasso "enriched Western plastic art with African abstraction," Marlon Brando "brought into our cinematic iconography the posings and simmerings of the Negro facial expression that we associate with people like Miles Davis"?
Still, you come away from "The All-American Skin Game" fired with new enthusiasms. Mr. Crouch makes you want to see films like Albert and Allen Hughes's "Menace II Society" and Leon Ichaso's "Sugar Hill." He makes you want to listen to Wynton Marsalis's composition "In This House, on This Morning." He makes you want to reread Saul Bellow's novel "Mr. Sammler's Planet" for subtleties perhaps missed the first time around. He challenges your assumptions and arouses your curiosity. And that is what a good cultural critic is for.

HEADLINE: France Finds a Reading Test Incomprehensible

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 10

 BODY:
People of the land of Racine and Moliere, of Hugo and Balzac, of Proust and Sartre, frequently can't grasp what they read, according to a new study that concludes that some literacy skills in France are far worse than those in the United States.
But the French need not worry about being embarrassed by the report. When French officials studied its preliminary conclusions two months ago, they were so incensed that they insisted that all references to France be excised from the 200-page document, "Literacy, Society and Economy," published here last week. 
 The survey, which set out to test how literacy skills relate to job success and economic performance, judged reading comprehension in the form of, say, an office memorandum, of documents like tables, nutritional charts and train schedules, and of day-to-day mathematical calculations.
"The results show that a disturbing proportion of adults in all countries have low literacy skills," said the report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
But the results varied widely by country. For example, in the portion of the study examining the ability to understand and use written information, 7.5 percent of adults in Sweden, 10.5 percent in the Netherlands, 14.4 percent in Germany, 15.3 percent in Switzerland, 16.6 percent in Canada and 20.7 percent in the United States scored in the lowest of five proficiency levels.
By these same criteria, 40.1 percent of France's adult population were placed in the lowest level, only marginally better than Poland, with 42.6 percent, according to the left-leaning Paris daily, Liberation, which first reported France's withdrawal from the study. The section featured questions on articles ranging from topics like movie reviews to disposable diapers.
The newly expurgated study reported only the results of detailed tests of some 1,500 to 1,800 adults between the ages of 16 and 65 in seven countries -- Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the United States and Poland.
"Only the French censored the results, which is tantamount to refusing to acknowledge the truth staring you in the face," Liberation said.
Albert Tuinman, a survey organizer at the OECD's education and training division, said he was puzzled by the French reaction because France was the first country to commit itself to participate in the survey. He added that even though France fared poorly overall, it ranked first in the 16-to-24 age category, which he said confirmed the quality of its educational system.
But the elimination of France from the results made it impossible to determine the country's position in two of the survey's categories, the ability to interpret tables, charts and graphs, and the quantitative portion, which asked individuals to calculate, for example, the percentage of calories in a Big Mac that come from fat.
Claude Thelot, a director in the French Education Ministry, rejected the findings because he said the methodology was flawed. This, he said, gave him serious doubts about the reliability of the statistics comparing different countries. "I was all the more convinced of the flaws when I saw the results," he said, "particularly since each country defined its own control conditions."
Mr. Thelot said all evidence suggests that general literacy in France continues to rise, with only one in seven children entering first grade without having already achieved basic reading skills. As for the report, "it's an interesting and novel study, but it has certain weaknesses," he said. "From the start, the rules were that any country could pull out."
He also said that the tests were influenced by what he called "Anglo-Saxon culture," meaning that the French were asked "things the French don't learn."
"Different societies and cultures emphasize different things," he continued in a telephone interview. "For example, one exercise with a recipe asked how many eggs were needed to bake a cake for four people. It then asked how many eggs were needed to bake a cake for six. This is not an exercise used in French schools." Adding a Cartesian twist, he said: "Anyway, if you make a mistake of one egg, your cake may not be spoiled."

HEADLINE: Faltering Strike by Pilots' Union Stirs Loyalty in Federal Express Workers

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Federal Express has been good to Bill Satterlee. Now Mr. Satterlee, a pilot with the overnight delivery company for 16 years who earns as much as $200,000 a year, intends to return the favor.
After Mr. Satterlee, 51, had triple-bypass heart surgery last year, Federal Express, instead of putting him on disability, gave him a job training other pilots until he was well enough to return to the cockpit. The company also picked up the tab for about $10,000 in expenses for tests to recertify him for flying. 
 So when the leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association organized a job action late last month intended to disrupt delivery of packages and letters in the midst of the busy Christmas season, Mr. Satterlee -- like hundreds of other pilots at Federal Express who are not union members -- did not just refuse to join in. Instead, he volunteered to fly extra overtime.
The pilots union's slowdown, aimed at forcing management to sign a contract offering higher pay, better retirement benefits and improved job security, could backfire. Rather than winning converts to labor's cause in this metropolitan area of roughly a million people where unions have rarely made significant inroads, it has led most employees to embrace the company even more tightly.
Last week, several thousand employees rallied in downtown Memphis to express their support for the company, which employs 24,000 people at its headquarters and primary hub here. And a group saying it represented a vast majority of the 110,000 Federal Express employees worldwide took out full-page advertisements in several newspapers to tell customers that the pilots union did not enjoy widespread backing.
"A.L.P.A. is misjudging the culture here," said David Sanders, the chairman of a rival group that is seeking to replace the national union with a local independent union. "They have really dug themselves in a hole." A third group of pilots wants no union at all.
The pilots union's action highlights the quandary facing the American labor movement these days as it seeks to recover from years of retreat by adopting a more militant edge. Even as John Sweeney, the new president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., vowed recently to make inroads outside of labor's traditional bastions of strength in heavy industry and among public employees, leaders of the United Automobile Workers conceded on Dec. 3 that their 18-month strike against Caterpillar Inc., based in Peoria, Ill., had failed and sent the remaining strikers back to work.
And the pilots union, which has represented Federal Express's 2,900 pilots since 1993 but receives dues from just over half of them, faces even more daunting challenges. Federal Express's other workers are not organized, and there appears to be little sympathy for the affluent pilots, who earn an average of $128,000 a year. Many employees are part time and have relatively low pay, and lots of others started that way.
"This is a home-grown company," said Doris Waller, who has risen in her 12 years with Federal Express from a part-time package sorter to a full-time crew travel auditor, "and it's disheartening when you've always been a team and a family, and you have a group who's trying to wreck it."
Still, there is an outside chance that the organized pilots will disrupt operations enough during the Christmas rush, when the number of packages exceeds three million a day, to persuade Federal Express to present a better offer that the union could hold up as a breakthrough.
Federal Express, which was founded 22 years ago by Fred Smith -- probably Memphis's second-favorite son after Elvis Presley -- is by far the largest private employer in town. "Let me put it this way," said John Threadgill, a spokesman for the local Chamber of Commerce. "When Fedex sneezes, Memphis gets a cold."
Indeed, Federal Express is so closely identified with the city and its thriving local economy that few employees can imagine supporting anything that might damage the company's reputation for reliable service.
"I don't see how my future is being secured by scaring business away," said Fred Olmstead, a pilot who joined the carrier in 1989 after he lost his job at Eastern Air Lines. And Mr. Satterlee warned that the Air Line Pilots Association was threatening to "wreck the confidence of the customer." He said, "That's the core of the company."
Those types of views underscore the risk for the union, which enjoys most of its strength outside Federal Express's home base here. If it escalates its confrontation with the company in hopes of putting a serious dent in the company's business, it might alienate so many pilots that it could lose the right to bargain at all with Federal Express. But if it backs away from the fight without gaining much, it would be yet another setback for labor in its bid to overcome the stagnant wages and shrinking benefits that have hit most workers in recent years.
Union leaders said they recognized they were walking a fine line. "We're trying to take a stand in a measured and calculated way to get the attention of management," said David Webb, a member of the union's Strategic Preparedness Committee.
Federal Express said that with support from pilots like Mr. Olmstead and Mr. Satterlee, it had been able to keep nearly all its fleet of 200 planes active in delivering the roughly 2.5 million parcels it handles each day. Although the union said deliveries had slowed and some major customers had switched some business to other air cargo carriers, outsiders said the union had so far caused only minor problems.
"There certainly have been some disruptions," said David Guthrie, an analyst who follows Federal Express for Morgan Keegan & Company, a local investment firm. "But none of them has been real meaningful."
The divisions among the pilots reflect the company's history. The pilots primarily distinguish themselves as either "purple" or "silver." The purple pilots are generally those who joined the company, whose colors are purple and orange, in its early years when it was exclusively a domestic carrier. The silver pilots are those who became part of the company in 1989, when Federal Express bought Flying Tigers, a failing international air cargo carrier whose handbook was silver, and acquired its overseas routes.
The silver pilots, who are concentrated in such bases as Newark, Oakland, Anchorage and the Philippines, tend to be much stronger union supporters. But most of the purple pilots have been nurtured in the cooperative Federal Express corporate culture, in which it is not uncommon for pilots to help load packages and pitch in on other tasks when nasty weather or other problems threaten to disrupt deliveries.
Talks broke down on Nov. 25 between the union and the company, which then implemented parts of its own contract. That contract included a 4 percent pay increase but also called for work rules that many pilots object to. One clause allows the leasing of outside aircraft and flight crews to handle emergencies and surges in volume.
While Federal Express is known as a company that enjoys extraordinary loyalty among its workers, it is also known as not being reluctant to use a stick. The carrier put four pilots on leave with pay -- two have since been reinstated -- to serve as a warning against delays.
The company recently leased seven Boeing 727 aircraft and crews from small airlines to use as backups if the Air Line Pilots Association should increase the pressure.
"We don't want to use them unless we are forced into it," said Theodore L. Weise, the senior vice president of operations.
The hardball tactics of the company have bolstered the resolve of many union pilots. Jeffrey Hanson, a 35-year-old 727 pilot who has been with the company for seven years, said the old spirit inside the company was rapidly disappearing with its growth into a global giant. There are both good and bad sides to the change, he said.
"If they could replace me with someone cheaper, they would," Mr. Hanson said. "I want Fred Smith to run the business and do well. But I don't want him to baby us and be our father."

HEADLINE: In Peru, a Fight for Fresh Air

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: ILO, Peru

 BODY:
Every night before she goes to bed, Anna Gilapa gets down on her knees and stuffs cloth in the cracks around her doors and windows to protect her family from the acrid smoke released by the nearby smelter of the Southern Peru Copper Corporation.
Mrs. Gilapa fears for the health of her 1-year-old son, Brian, who suffers from severe respiratory problems and often coughs up thick mucous. And for that, she and other residents of this bleak coastal town 580 miles south of Lima blame the largest local company, Southern Peru Copper, which environmentalists say spews 2,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into the air each day, or 10 to 15 times the limit for similar plants operating in the United States. 
 At times, the smoke from the smelter is so thick that it hovers over the city like a heavy fog, forcing motorists to turn on their headlights during the day and sending residents to hospitals and clinics coughing, wheezing and vomiting. On those days, children are told to play indoors.
"All we want is an end to the pollution," said Ilo's Mayor, Ernesto Herrera Becerra, who said emissions from the smelter had ruined agriculture and fishing in the area. "This situation would not be allowed to exist in the United States."
But officials of Southern Peru Copper, which is controlled by three big American companies -- Asarco Inc., the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Marmon Group -- maintain that their smelter is not to blame for the town's health problems and that their workers have never complained. Nevertheless, Southern Peru will spend $151 million on environment projects in the region.
Environmental groups concede the plant complies with Peruvian environmental standards but say that is precisely the problem. All too often, they say, the absence of strong laws in many developing countries enables giant multinationals -- especially in the mining and chemical industries -- to play fast and loose with the local environment and the local population's health.
"I'm afraid these countries are at the mercy of the multinational corporations," said Kenny Bruno, a toxins investigator for Greenpeace, the environmental group.
Although some multinational corporations have voluntarily adopted policies that require their overseas operations to comply with the same environmental standards they must follow in the United States, there are currently no agreements between industrialized nations or policing mechanisms to insure compliance, Mr. Bruno noted.
As a result, foreign corporations often come under attack from political and environmental activists in the third world, accused by them of putting profits ahead of ethics.
For example, Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's largest oil company, has been denounced in both Nigeria and abroad for participating in a $3.8 billion natural gas plant in Nigeria, despite international condemnation of the military Government for the recent executions of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent Nigerian playwright, and eight other critics of Shell's environmental record and of the Government.
Nigerian courts convicted the nine for involvement in four killings. The men had insisted they were innocent and had been framed to silence their criticism of the oil industry's environmental record. Shell has defended its role in Nigeria.
In addition, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides insurance and financing for American companies doing business overseas, last month canceled Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc.'s political risk insurance for a huge mining project in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya because of supposed environmental problems.
Environmental groups say that the company, a unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc., which is based in New Orleans, has done little to contain the runoff of toxic wastes that they contend have killed fish in nearby rivers. They also say that local villagers can no longer drink water from the river. The company strongly denies the mine tailings are toxic. In newspaper advertisements that appeared recently, it accused "foreign special interest groups" of conducting a smear campaign against it.
For its part, Southern Peru Copper denies that a health problem exists in Ilo. In a recent interview at the company's offices in Lima, Hans A. Flury, its vice president for legal affairs, said that in the 30 years the company has operated in Ilo, it had never received a complaint from any of its 2,000 workers. That alone, he said, was proof that the environment is healthy.
But in several early-morning interviews with Southern Peru employees waiting for company buses to take them to their jobs, dozens of workers said that they and their families suffered respiratory problems, including difficulty in breathing, coughing up heavy mucous and vomiting in reaction to the smelter's smoke.
The workers, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said they had reported these ailments to supervisors to no avail. They said they continued to work for Southern Peru because there were no other jobs available.
Asked how the company accounted for Ilo's health problems, Mr. Flury, the vice president, said: "I don't live in Ilo so I don't know. I have not been there on one of those smoky days." He also declined to comment on environmentalists' estimates of the magnitude of the smelter's discharges, saying the company had made no studies on the subject.
The company has recently made some gestures to the local residents, including the announcement of a project to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. But Ilo residents said Mr. Flury's cavalier response was more typical of the way Southern Peru Copper had responded to their cries for help. So they have filed a lawsuit against the company, its owners and its creditors in a Texas court, seeking damages for what they say are decades of environmental harm. Residents said that previous suits filed in Peru had been dismissed or were stalled in the courts.
Robert Hilliard, a lawyer who filed the suit for Ilo residents, said that Southern Peru Copper had "visited environmental terrorism on the families of Ilo" and that the company had destroyed a 12-mile stretch of coastline by dumping 30 million metric tons of untreated mining wastes into the ocean each year.
Southern Peru declines to comment on the lawsuit. But a walk along Ilo's beaches is an excursion that few local residents make: A narrow stream of blackened water flows into the ocean while a bleak terrain of slate-colored silt stretches in both directions, reflecting fluorescent hues of green, yellow and blue.
Still, Ilo residents face an uphill struggle in their legal battle.
Though the provincial health ministry said that respiratory ailments are the leading health problem reported among the people of Ilo, there are no medical studies showing a direct link between the town's health problems and Southern Peru Copper's operations. The ministry declined to release specific figures, but said that the incidence of respiratory ailments, cancer, urinary diseases, and diseases affecting the circulatory system has risen steadily in the last five years.
Meanwhile, Southern Peru, the eighth-largest copper producer in the world, remains a vital part of the Peru's economy, providing 5,500 jobs and 17 percent of the country's export income.
The company's main owners -- Asarco Inc. of New York, with a 51.8 percent stake; the Phelps Dodge Corporation of Phoenix, with 13.4 percent, and the Marmon Group of Chicago, which is controlled by the Pritzker family, with 16.7 percent -- all declined to comment on the lawsuit and the mining company's practices. The remaining 17.3 percent of the company is traded on the Lima Stock Exchange.
Southern Peru Copper's profits have boomed recently as copper prices have risen. Net income increased last year to $110 million from $43.6 million in 1993. Revenues in the same period increased to $677 million from $450 million.
Charles Preble, Southern Peru's president, took a more conciliatory attitude toward Ilo's residents than his vice president. In an interview, Mr. Preble said that Southern Peru Copper had always operated within the confines of Peruvian law. While he acknowledged that Peru does not set limits on emission rates, he said his company had been "a good corporate citizen," providing workers with housing, education, electricity, water, medical care and food.
Southern Peru has also announced plans to spend $151 million on environment projects, including a $108 million sulfuric acid plant to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at Ilo, a tailings dam near Toquepala, and a water treatment plant and a retention wall to keep waste from entering the Pacific at Ilo.
"We have a good relationship with the community, and I'd like to comment further but I can't because of this lawsuit," Mr. Preble said.
Corrine Schmidt, editor of Equilibrio, an environmental newsletter based in Lima, said that Southern Peru "is being disingenuous to say that they didn't know what was going on." She added: "They knowingly did things that they shouldn't have done but were allowed to do. But the question is who's to blame, the Government or Southern? Probably both."
The company gets a mixed review from a local environmental group. Jose Luis Lopez Follegatti, director of the Association of Civil Labor, said that once built, the tailings dam and the retention wall should eliminate Southern Peru's pollution of the ocean. But he said that the sulfuric acid plant was expected to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by only 15 percent.
Southern Peru has built a village for its mostly American and other foreign engineers and executives and their families in Ilo's hills. It has ranch houses, a hospital, school, playground, cinema, and verdant trees and lawns, in sharp contrast to the arid streets of the town itself.
Women who work as maids in the village say their employers often complain about the smoke and sometimes wear masks in their homes when the smoke is heavy. "They are comforted by the fact that they only have to spend a few years here and then they move back to the States to clear their lungs," said a maid who identified herself as Suzy. "We are not so lucky."

HEADLINE: Speaker Seeks Ethics Inquiry Into Pataki Inaugural Group

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Speaker of the State Assembly ordered two legislative committees today to investigate whether any laws were broken by the private corporation that financed Gov. George E. Pataki's inauguration, setting up a confrontation between the Democratic Assembly and the Republican Governor.
Saying that the corporation operated under a "cloak of secrecy," Speaker Sheldon Silver told the committees to use their powers to subpoena records and hold public hearings to find out whether the corporation violated state election or ethics laws when it raised more than $500,000 for Mr. Pataki's inaugural events. Mr. Silver estimated that the corporation, N.Y. Inaugural '95, raised as much as $1.4 million. 
 Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said he was particularly interested in finding out why Mr. Pataki's aides decided to keep the names of inaugural contributors private after having initially promised to publicly disclose the names. Mr. Pataki's aides also broke a pledge to keep donations to the inaugural corporation within state campaign contribution limits.
"At the outset, he said it would all be disclosed," Mr. Silver said of the Governor. "Now he's saying there is no disclosure. It looks like he's hiding something. And we have a right to find out what he's hiding."
The Governor's inaugural corporation was the subject of an article in The New York Times last month that described how the corporation accepted at least five corporate contributions that were in excess of the state's $5,000 campaign contribution limit on private companies. The article also said that the corporation gave $25,000 to the New York State Republican Committee.
Mr. Silver also ordered the two committees, Governmental Operations and Elections, to investigate the activities of a separate corporation, N.Y. Transition '95, which helped finance Mr. Pataki's transition. And he asked the Assembly Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigations to help in the inquiries.
The Assembly's investigations come on the eve of the 1996 election season, when the Democrats will try to retain their 94-56 advantage over the Republicans in the lower house. In preparation for what are expected to be well-financed Republican challenges in dozens of districts, the Democrats have been developing a strategy to attack the ethics of the Republicans in general and the Pataki administration in particular.
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications, said the inaugural corporation did not violate any laws. Referring to Mr. Silver, she said, "He seems to have confused his role of Speaker with his role as the Democratic political operative. Past Democratic speakers have been able to put aside partisan politics. It's unfortunate that he can't."
Mr. Pataki's top campaign fund-raising officials created N.Y. Inaugural '95, a for-profit corporation, to raise money for three days of inaugural events that began on Dec. 31.
Robert E. Boyle, who had been Mr. Pataki's campaign treasurer, became treasurer of the corporation. Charles A. Gargano, who had been Mr. Pataki's chief campaign fund-raiser, became chairman of a committee that organized inaugural events, including a $1,000 per person inaugural fund-raising dinner held on Dec. 6, 1994.
Mr. Boyle is now president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and Mr. Gargano is the State Commissioner for Economic Development. When the corporation was created, Mr. Pataki's aides said that it would voluntarily hold all contributors to state campaign finance limits and would disclose the names of all donors.
But last month, in response to inquiries from The Times, Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, announced that the corporation had decided not to disclose the names of contributors so that Mr. Pataki and his aides would not know who had helped on the inauguration. In that way, Ms. Mucha said, administration officials would not feel obligated to help inaugural contributors.
Many of the companies and individuals who contributed or raised money for the inauguration have business with the state, whether as regulated companies or as vendors holding state contracts.
While many other governors and presidents have raised money privately to finance inaugurations, they have usually disclosed the names of contributors. In several states, including Massachusetts, inaugural committees are required to follow state campaign finance rules.
That is not the case in New York, where N.Y. Inaugural '95 is under no legal obligation to release the names of its contributors. State Senator Richard A. Dollinger, a Rochester Democrat, has proposed legislation that would require inaugural committees to comply with state election laws, which would include disclosing the names of contributors.
Mr. Silver asked the investigating committees to give him their final reports by March 1.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Plan to Dismantle Lilco Is Criticized at a Public Hearing

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to break up the Long Island Lighting Company and cut electric rates on the Island by 12 percent drew criticism at a public hearing last night, particularly from workers at the utility concerned about the fate of the company.
Under the Pataki plan, Lilco would sell its gas business and power plants to private companies, and the Long Island Power Authority would buy the Lilco transmission and distribution system. The state would issue more than $4.5 billion in tax-free bonds so it could pay its debt on the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant. 
 At the hearing, the audience applauded when a Lilco gas worker talked about the need to maintain reliability if the gas system was sold. When he likened Lilco workers to a family, he drew more applause.
In an effort to assure the employees that the plan would protect them, James F. Gill, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said, "I'm not the enemy."
Joseph W. McDonald, a vice president of Lilco, said the company would not to take a position on the plan tonight.
"We are waiting to get more information from LIPA so we can evaluate their proposal," he said. "We need to have the assumptions they used so we can see if this plan achieves the Governor's objectives."
Earlier today, the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, endorsed the plan.
"Compared with previous proposals, this is, by far, our best chance of experiencing real rate cuts in the future, and removing Lilco's choke hold on local residents and business," Mr. Gulotta said.
Mr. Gulotta said that the Pataki plan made it clear that Nassau residents would be compensated for the overassessment of the former Shoreham nuclear plant by Suffolk County. Mr. Kessel's plan called for forgiving the Suffolk debt.
Suffolk owes Lilco $83 million for the overassessment, and faces an additional payment of more than $400 million in a pending case.
The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, is still reviewing the plan, a spokesman said.
Mr. Gulotta said the plan would protect Lilco employees by assuring them jobs with Lilco's successors. But at news conference today, leaders of two electrical workers union locals representing 3,600 Lilco employees attacked the plan, saying that it does not protect jobs and will damage Long Island's economy.

HEADLINE: Panel Faults Education Of Disabled

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
Hoping to set in motion the biggest effort in New York City's history to change how students in special education are treated, an independent panel yesterday recommended taking tens of thousands of children now in separate schools or classrooms and returning them to regular schools, where they would receive extra help.
While the framework of recommended changes was announced last May, the final report outlines in detail the legal and financial dimensions of making the changes. The proposal, by a panel of New York University educators appointed by the Board of Education, does not offer a cost estimate, but an official familiar with the report said it could be $100 million during the three to five years that it would take for the changes. Most of the money would be used to train teachers. 
 The recommendations will test the resolve of political leaders to bring about changes in what is widely regarded as a bloated and costly special-education bureaucracy. "In the long run, it will turn out to be more economical, but there's going to have to be an expenditure up front," said Carol Gresser, the Board of Education president. "It's a far-reaching report."
Both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the new Schools Chancellor, Dr. Rudy Crew, have called for reform in special education. Yesterday, Peter J. Powers, the First Deputy Mayor, described the plan as a "creative but feasible way" to stem the growing population of special education students, who now number more than 130,000.
"We think it's a good proposal," Mr. Powers said. "It's one that warrants further study by the board. It's certainly worthy of them trying to take it to the next step. You've got to look at the endgame. The endgame is to do the best job of educating children who need it, and if you can keep children mainstreamed that is a good thing."
The system now consumes more than 22 cents of every education dollar in New York City, includes one quarter of all school employees and funnels a disproportionate number of black and Hispanic boys into dead-end, segregated classrooms. About 60 percent of children classified in special education are segregated, three times the national average.
Susan Amlung, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, said the high expense of the plan "might, in fact, be its death knell." Much of the plan hinges on changes in state financing formulas that currently reward schools for placing mildly and moderately handicapped children in special education.
The plan also recommends negotiating a state waiver to maintain the system's current spending for at least five years. The report also calls for extra money to train teachers and school staffs to handle an infusion of special education students.
"Reform is rarely cheap," the report's authors wrote. "Systemic reform of the magnitude that we propose will help to enrich students' lives but is unlikely to save money."
The report envisions a system that would shift special-education money to regular schools, which would use that money for extra teachers and aides to help children with mild and moderate disabilities. The special-education bureaucracy would shrink to serve only the most severely handicapped children.
Most special education students in the system are not deaf, blind or classified with any other readily defined disability. Instead, 70 percent are labeled "learning disabled" or "emotionally handicapped," terms many academics say are loosely applied and provide cover for a teacher who wants to get rid of a troublesome student. Once referred to special education, students almost never return to regular education.
The panel has added a section in the report on protecting the most severely disabled children, including the autistic, blind and multiply handicapped, representing about 5 percent of special education children. Efforts to redesign the system have been fiercely opposed by a litigious group of parents of these children.
The plan has received cautious support from the teachers' union and parent and student advocates who have resisted previous attempts at reorganizing special education.

HEADLINE: Orders for Computer Chips Fall Along With Book-to-Bill Ratio

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., Dec. 11

 BODY:
New orders for computer chips declined in November, the Semiconductor Industry Association said today, indicating that demand could be slowing.
The trade group's book-to-bill ratio, a closely watched gauge of demand for computer chips, fell to 1.14 in November from 1.18 in October. 
 The ratio had been expected to decline slightly as sales of some computers slowed and inventories rose before the holiday sales season.
The ratio measures the strength of the chip industry in North America by comparing the value of new orders to the value of chips shipped each month. A ratio of 1.14 means that for every $100 in orders shipped by chip makers, they received $114 in new orders.
The ratio is computed using a three-month moving average and is seasonally adjusted. A ratio higher than 1 means that the market is expanding.
Orders in November fell 1.5 percent from October, to $5.03 billion from $5.11 billion. Orders were up 54 percent from the $3.27 billion reported for November 1994.
Shipments in the month rose 2.2 percent from October, to $4.41 billion. Shipments in November were up 43 percent from a year earlier.
The worldwide market for computer chips is expected to increase 26 percent in 1996, a slower rate than the 44 percent increase expected for this year, the trade group said.
The industry will see sales rise to $185.1 billion next year from an expected $146.4 billion this year, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, which gathers the data for the semiconductor association.
The North American market is expected to increase 40 percent, to $47.1 billion in 1995 from $33.5 billion last year.

HEADLINE: Budget Games

 BODY:
Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican Party, thinks he has found a rhetorical device to fend off White House attacks on the G.O.P.'s proposed cuts in Medicare. People should focus, he says, not only on how much the two sides want to cut but on how much each wants to spend. The G.O.P. wants to spend $1.65 trillion over the next seven years. The White House would spend $1.68 trillion. Mr. Barbour concludes that the difference -- $30 billion or about 2 percent -- is too small to matter and that President Clinton's vicious attacks on the Republican plan amount to demagoguery.
Mr. Clinton has wrongly ridiculed the G.O.P. for proposing modest hikes in subsidized premiums. But Mr. Barbour's rhetorical thrust is little better. The two plans differ by amounts that the $30 billion figure does not begin to capture. 
 Consider the following example. The White House and Republicans agree to spend the same amount, say $300 billion, on Medicare in 2002. But they disagree now much Medicare will cost in that year under current law. The Republicans estimate Medicare will cost $500 billion. The White House estimates $400 billion. Despite Mr. Barbour's contention that the two plans are the same because they will spend the same, the Republicans would have to cut Medicare by twice what the White House would cut to hit the common target.
These very different economic projections, in turn, would require quite different cost-cutting strategies. Once those policies are in place, they would hit hospitals, physicians and enrollees no matter whose projections turn out to be more accurate. Indeed, the G.O.P.'s plan would cut payments to hospitals and physicians by about $100 billion more than the White House's would.
Can the gap between the two plans be bridged in time to reach a budget agreement this year? A compromise is within reach. Mr. Clinton could, for example, agree to the G.O.P. plan to raise premiums by about $50 billion. The Republicans, in turn, could agree to cut hospital and physician payments less -- with a "look-back" procedure that would increase those cuts if budget targets were exceeded.
The Congressional Budget Office announced yesterday that budget-cutting can be about $135 billion less onerous than previously estimated in order to reach balance in seven years. Most of the windfall ought to be used to save Medicaid, food stamps and tax credits. Some could also be used to bring the White House and G.O.P. together on Medicare.
The fight over Medicare is not, as Mr. Barbour argues, over scraps. But Congress and the White House are unlikely to find compromise if one side insists the differences do not exist.

Fed Officials' Remarks Curb Gain in Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday, as comments by Federal Reserve officials held back buying.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 4/32 , to 11115/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.04 percent, from 6.05 percent on Friday. 
 Many market participants chose not to take any large positions amid budget talks in Washington and ahead of a policy meeting of the Federal Reserve next Tuesday.
Gains yesterday were limited by comments from two Fed officials, which dampened expectations that the Fed will lower short-term interest rates this month or next. A Fed governor, Edward W. Kelley Jr., in an interview with the Dow Jones news service, said he thought the economy was very strong.
But another Fed governor, Susan Phillips, told reporters yesterday afternoon that "the U.S. is starting to experience some firming of wages, but that it is not pronounced."
With Fed governors giving mixed opinions, Doug Bourtnick, a fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that "there is nothing to hang your hat on."
In addition, traders and analysts were awaiting a number of important economic reports this week. Today the Government is scheduled to release its Producer Price Index for November. In October, producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent, and analysts expect the November index will show an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent.
Tomorrow the market will get a glimps of retail sales and on Thursday the Government will report on inflation at the consumer level in November.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst with MMS International in San Franicsco, said trading was quiet yesterday, with the market waiting for some news from Washington about a budget accord. "We've gotten some encouraging reports recently, but the market was not trading on any fundamentals today," he said. "Right now it is only on the lookout for a Fed easing or a budget deal."
A number of short-sellers sought to cover positions ahead of the producer prices report, Mr. Hale noted. A short-seller sells a borrowed security hoping to buy it back at a lower price, and thus make a profit. But if prices rise, instead of fall -- which is what has tended to happen after recent weaker-than-expected producer price reports -- the seller must still buy back securities to limit his losses.
At the Treasury's weekly sale of new three- and six-month bills, rates were up slightly, with solid retail demand. The average discount rate rose one basis point, to 5.30 percent for the three-month bill and 5.20 percent for the six-month bill. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
While supply is thin this week with only bills available, the Treasury does plan to announce tomorrow the size of next week's auctions of two- and five-year notes. Mr. Hale expects the Treasury to increase the amounts of the auctions to get a leg up on the huge jump in maturing issues expected next year.
Following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.660	97.371	Discounted Rate	5.30%	5.20%	Coupon Yield	5.46%	5.43%	High Price	98.663	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.29%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.45%	5.42%	Low Price	98.660	97.371	Discounted Rate	5.30%	5.20%	Coupon Yield	5.46%	5.43%	Accepted at low price	76%	79%	Total applied for	$66,852,474	$46,459,222	Accepted	$14,051,108	$14,092,587	Noncompetitive	$1,448,677	$1,226,522	
 
Both issues are dated Dec. 14, 1995. The three-month bills mature on Mar. 14, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on June 13, 1996.

Sizzler International announced today that it was reducing its administrative staff by 30 percent, or 72 workers, in a revamping intended to save $5 million a year. The low-price restaurant chain, which grew rapidly for decades, has suffered in the 1990's, in part because of weakness in the California economy and locations too close together. The company operates or licenses 592 Sizzler restaurants worldwide; 91 Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and one Italian Oven restaurant in Australia, and seven Buffalo Ranch restaurants in the United States.

Money's Funny Ways

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Everybody with enough sense to look over his shoulder when walking down a dark alley is now familiar with the stock market's spooky response to news that a lot of human beings have been fired in another industrial "downsizing."
The stock market booms. 
 From this you might sensibly reason that a new high for the Dow Jones is terrible news. (More people out of work, more unpayable consumer debt, fewer buyers for the products of capitalism's great engines.)
So why are rises in stock-market indicators always treated as good news? Television's network anchors faithfully announce each day's Dow Jones average as though it told us something important. What this might be is seldom explained. On banner days, though, when the Dow Jones breaks 3,000, or 4,000, or 5,000, the anchor always manages to sound as though something splendid has occurred.
Here is one of the mysteries of economics which explain why it used to be called "the dismal science" before governments and newspapers began taking economists as seriously as economists took themselves. The mystery in this case is one of those "plain-as-the-nose-on-your-face" exercises.
Wherever you go nowadays you meet people worried about their jobs. Economists of course don't care much for the testimony of people. "Anecdotal evidence," they call it, suggesting it is worthless listening to mere people.
However, there are polls -- serious, scholarly, scientific polls free of odious anecdotal taint -- and they tell the same story: people fearful, unable to keep up, discouraged about the future.
Then there are statistics. Everybody loves statistics. The statistics show people, in fact, are not keeping up. What's plain as the nose on your face is that the economy is in the dumps.
So why are these ever-rising market averages hailed as good news? The market would seem to be cheering about another 10,000, or 15,000, or 25,000 workers being fired by yet another great American corporation.
It's all right for markets to cheer the advance of human misery. Markets are supposed to be tough guys, steel-whiskered guys, take-no-prisoners guys. It takes insouciance, though, for most of us to applaud the Dow's latest leap when it so obviously honors another mass firing.
You hear Tom, Dan or Peter tell of another great Dow day in Wall Street, and it's tempting to not cheer at all, but to think, "By George, they might get me in the next batch."
Ah, the mysteries of economics . . .
For instance, do these Washington budget-balancers really believe they can plan seven years ahead with any chance of not being 10,000 percent off their estimates when Time and Chance doth get through happenething to us all?
You and I, friend, may not be Methuselahs, but we have seen enough to know that seven years will almost always produce so many unanticipatable changes that this talk of seven-year budget-balancing schemes must be childishly innocent.
How long did it take for the oil embargoes to destroy the old dollar and produce the tremendous inflation that changed the character of American economic life? It was done in a couple of brutal years. The amazing Reagan budget deficit that haunts us still was designed and adopted in a single Congress.
These preposterous economic upheavals happen constantly. Expecting the preposterous to restrain itself from happening for the next seven years is surely asking a lot of whimsical Miss Destiny.
It's a lively possibility, in fact, that a single year or two may see the public passion for budget-balancing run out of steam as voters go back to asking their statesmen, "What have you done for me lately?" In the enduring words of Fats Waller, "One never knows, do one?"
Another mystery: All Americans supposedly yearn to scalp and pickle any politician who dares raise taxes. So would somebody please explain the readiness of politicians to slather public money on professional sports-team owners?
These birds of prey are ever ready to move their sweaty assets wherever a fresh batch of rubes is ready to empty the treasury for the joy of having professional jocks in town. Only the wretched, perhaps, deserve to be kept away from the booty.

HEADLINE: Big Labor Can Only Dream of Higher Wages

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your Dec. 7 news article on John J. Sweeney, the new president of the A.F.L-C.I.O.: 
 Mr. Sweeney went before 400 business executives to plead for a "social compact" between America's corporations and workers. Mr. Sweeney suggests that corporations voluntarily raise workers' wages. Does he really think any would do that? In this highly competitive market economy, it would be corporate suicide. Who will volunteer to be the first to jump overboard?
Mr. Sweeney talks about building bridges between labor and management. While French workers man the barricades, Mr. Sweeney begs at the corporate altar. Does he really think it will make a difference?
Mr. Sweeney is the former president of the Service Employees International Union. He now boasts of how his low-paid janitors blocked a bridge in Washington in September to protest low wages. That's like the captain of the Titanic boasting of his good aim. His aides say he is going to focus on the growing wage gap. It would be interesting to know the gap between his wage and that of the janitors.

HEADLINE: New York's SoHo Is on the Verge of Losing Its Cultural Flavor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While the rest of "America Realizes the Arts Attract Tourists" (Arts pages, Dec. 5), New York presumably has a leg up on other cities "because culture has always been central to its image." You are wrong that "no one needs to promote SoHo." Perhaps not to the rest of the world, but someone needs to remind New York City not to look a gift horse in the mouth. 
 SoHo, a cultural asset, is close to losing what makes SoHo what it is.
SoHo was a gift to the city. Artists' "sweat equity" transformed this derelict neighborhood into a vibrant part of the city's economy and a world-class example of urban renewal at its best.
Now the neighborhood is under siege. Mall retailers are rapidly replacing galleries and other arts-related businesses, and by night this once-quiet residential neighborhood is being mindlessly transformed into a noisy bar strip for Generation X.
Meantime, the City Planning Commission contemplates a zoning change that would facilitate this transformation. SoHo's resource has been its artist residents. Rather than reward artists for their pioneering efforts, the city plans to strip away their sweat-equity investment in SoHo with a regulation that would severely devalue their improvements.
If the city continues to turn a blind eye to this cultural asset and to its artist residents, tourists will awaken to the fact that they don't have to travel to SoHo to find the same mall shopping and bar strips they have at home. Where goes the art, go the tourists.

HEADLINE: Panama Doesn't Need U.S. Forces to Remain

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Dec. 4 news article suggests that continued occupation of Panamanian territory by United States military forces after the year 2000 would be beneficial to that country's economic and political stability. A recent University of Panama debate showed such thinking to be misguided. 
 University economists, using World Bank and United States Southern Command data, observed that the $300 million the United States military "pumps" into Panama's economy amounts to less than 5 percent of the national gross domestic product. This is hardly an indispensable contribution, particularly since the bases constitute such a poor use of valuable land area.
The Colon Free Zone, an import-export facility run by Panama within the canal area, occupies less than 1 percent of the land area occupied by the U.S. military yet generates 6 percent of G.D.P. The much-touted job opportunities the Southern Command provides were also shown to be minuscule: the bases provide 1 percent of formal sector employment.
You do not mention the costs of military occupation, such as the billions of dollars in environmental damage resulting from hazardous wastes and lethal weaponry dumped throughout canal defense sites over the past 50 years. It is also worth noting that the cost to Panama of the Bush-Noriega "divorce" exceeded $2.5 billion, more than seven years' worth of U.S.military "investment."
It is the North American military presence that destabilizes Panama's political structure. Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's long collaboration with United States military and Central Intelligence Agency officials allowed him to brutalize civil institutions; his fall led to the death of perhaps thousands of Panamanians at the hands of United States forces.
The University of Panama debates showed no lack of dedicated individuals and organizations capable of articulating a rational development plan, free of military influence. The Panamanian people are not dependent children; further United States military occupation of their country impedes their aspirations to sovereignty and economic development.

HEADLINE: Arming Bosnians Adds to Violence

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re " 'Neutrality' Won't Protect Our Troops" (Op-Ed, Dec. 7): 
 Richard N. Perle, former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration and adviser to the Bosnian delegation at the Balkan peace talks, argues that the United States must "arm and train the Bosnians so that American forces can be honorably withdrawn in a year."
The Dayton peace agreement partitions Bosnia 49 percent-51 percent between a Serbian Republic and Muslim-Croat Federation. By implication, Mr. Perle would arm only the Muslim-Croat Federation.
Arming this half of the partitioned nation would provoke an immediate response in the other half, which would seek support from other Slavs, including Russia.
It would be impossible to create a balance that both sides would recognize as equitable and stable.
A 600-year history of instability and conflict in the region, capped by the barbaric savagery of the last four years, guarantee that more arms on both sides would not improve future prospects for peace.
The best that can be hoped for if more arms are introduced is an unstable armed truce in which the parties face each other across the zones of separation to be established and patrolled by NATO forces.
Since a one-year NATO presence cannot possibly resolve the fundamental political, ethnic, economic, religious and historic problems that drive the conflicts in Bosnia, withdrawal of these forces will unleash renewed violence at even higher levels of destructive force with new weapons.
Mr. Perle is correct to decry the fact that the planned NATO occupation of Bosnia will not bring enduring peace, but to add to the problems there by fomenting an arms race that will set the stage for even more violence would be the wrong thing to do.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Bill limiting shareholder suits is seen as only incremental change.

BYLINE: By Kenneth N. Gilpin 

 BODY:
PEOPLE in Washington describe securities legislation now on President Clinton's desk as a radical change that should deter frivolous lawsuits by investors who in the past have won billions of dollars from companies they say defrauded them.
But after analyzing the bill, the product of a four-year effort that brokerage houses pushed for, with major accounting firms, insurers and high-technology companies, many on Wall Street say that the changes are simply incremental. 
 The view on Wall Street is that the number of class-action suits will probably diminish over time. And while the bill is meant to encourage companies to divulge more information, Wall Street considers its application very limited. The bill's clearest effect is likely to be on the Big Six accounting firms, whose liability in class-action suits has been sharply reduced. They are expected to feel freer to take on some customers they formerly shunned.
The bill is a "modest improvement over current law," said Richard F. Ziegler, a securities lawyer with the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. "But it is not worth the ballyhoo that has accompanied it."
Stuart Kaswell, general counsel for the Securities Industry Association, characterized the legislation as a "thoughtful and modest step forward for investors, consumers and the economy as a whole." He said it was essentially "an attempt to curtail frivolous suits by lawyers trying to line their own pockets."
The bill was overwhelmingly passed by both houses of Congress last week, and President Clinton is to decide this week whether to sign it. He is considered likely to go along.
But despite Wall Street's characterization of the measure as a modest change, its opponents say that it will significantly limit well-founded suits by investors.
And there are some executives who wish that the measure deterred suits more aggressively.
"The risk is that the legislation does not go far enough," said Richard C. Breeden, who from 1989 to 1993 was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is now an international financial-services executive at Coopers & Lybrand. "No one since 1933 has trimmed back the relentless march of shareholders' litigation."
The protection the bill provides to big accounting firms makes it more likely that those firms will take on technology companies as clients, a group they had largely abandoned because of the potential risk of the accountants' being sued.
Vincent M. O'Reilly, executive vice chairman of Coopers & Lybrand, said the measure "will allow us, like the management of the companies we audit, to focus on our business, and not divert time and effort to defending ourselves against frivolous lawsuits."
As protection against suits, the Big Six firms have been adding a risk premium to their fee structure. Mr. O'Reilly said the bill, if signed by President Clinton, would have "some impact" on a decision to reduce charges to clients.
Experts said it remained to be seen how effective the measure's "safe harbor" protection would be against suits stemming from corporate forecasts on earnings, new products or other matters. In return for that provision, the bill's supporters hope that companies will increase the flow of information to the investing public. But Wall Street is not so sure.
"Most of these provisions are a series of small speed bumps, which cumulatively will make litigation less attractive," said John C. Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University, who advised the White House on the bill. "It will mean that in the marginal case, plaintiffs will be less likely to sue."
Mr. Ziegler of Cleary, Gottlieb said the "safe harbor" provision was subject to so many qualifications that its usefulness was questionable. The protection does not apply, for example, to statements made in initial-public-offering documents, or to statements made in a tender offer, or to beneficial-ownership reports under Section 13d of the Securities and Exchange Act.
"The safe harbor provision applies to a narrow subset of existing securities transactions," he said. "This does not affect many types of class-action lawsuits."
But Mr. Breeden, the former S.E.C. chairman, hoped that the added protection would ultimately encourage companies to be more forthcoming.
"The net result of the current system can be less disclosure rather than more," he said. "There is a lot to be gained if we can move forward. The only way to do that is to take some steps to try. If we don't try, we can never move forward."
Even though people on Wall Street contend that passage of the bill should not concern investors, it has attracted sharp criticism from some current and former state Federal and state regulators and consumer advocates.
"In my view, the changes proposed in this bill are not incremental, but fairly monumental," said Richard Roberts, a former S.E.C. commissioner who is now a managing director at PVR Securities, a Princeton, N.J., venture-capital firm.
As written, the legislation "definitely stacks the deck against the vast bulk of the investing public," Mr. Roberts said, "because it will be very difficult for anyone less than a substantial investor to initiate most cases. That will be a monumental difference."
And Philip A. Feigin, Colorado's Securities Commissioner, said that no matter how limited, the safe harbor provisions in the measure would make it "a lot harder to hold people accountable for things they say."

What Beijing Fears

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The top-ranked academic sent by Beijing to a conference of intellectuals from around the world asked for the floor to explain his Government's policy on human rights.
Shuqing Wu, president of Beijing University, spoke only five or six minutes, but with careful clarity. 
 By the time he finished it was utterly plain that the Chinese Communist Government was flat-out determined not to allow the Chinese people to take part in the historic movement spreading in Asia: the simultaneous development of prosperity and political freedoms.
This was what he had to say:
In colonial wars and imposed peace, the West brutalized China. In Shanghai, Europeans posted a sign at the gate to a park: "No dogs or Chinese." China had been prevented from developing economically. Now the task was economic development. Without that, there was no use speaking about developing what the West called human rights.
Early in the conference on "The Future of Hope," sponsored by the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity and by the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun, everybody had come to understand that this man only spoke officially. He never winged a word.
And outside the conference building, in the reality of Asia, was the proof that the Chinese rigidity toward human rights did not come from the injustices of the past but fear of the future.
No city in China, none in the world, was destroyed as was Hiroshima. Few countries were as devastated as Japan. But Hiroshima, Nagasaki -- the "other" city hit by an atomic bomb -- every Japanese city bombed out in World War II is glistening with modern buildings, commerce and technology. They make a New Yorker feel like a country boy.
They were rebuilt within political democracy. No forced prison labor, no gulag, no torture cell was part of the rebuilding of Japan -- as all have been for the half-century the Communist Chinese have been in power.
Political democracy and economic development are siblings in more and more countries in Asia. Ten years ago I traveled in countries that had been stagnating under despotism for decades, among them South Korea and the Philippines.
In 1961 I was in Seoul, watching the military overthrow of the country's first democratically elected Government. The U.S. looked on passively. Now South Korea is politically free and economically burgeoning and is arresting past presidents on charges of corruption and massacre.
In the Philippines, a democratic candidate supported by the U.S. ended the reign of Ferdinand Marcos, husband of the lady with the shoes. In Tokyo now, I read in The Wall Street Journal that Philippine workers are turning out the best cars made by Honda in Asia outside Japan, and the work force of the country has shaken off its "manana" reputation.
On Taiwan, the long dictatorship of the Chinese Nationalists is over. The campaign earlier this month for a new legislature was free and boisterous, which infuriated China. So is the economy. The cement mixer should be Taiwan's official flower.
India chose both national and political freedom on Aug. 15, 1947, the day of its birth. Unlike the Chinese, India does not impose abortion or vasectomies to deal with its biggest problem -- population growth that eats up economic progress. Still, its economy grows and India's computer specialists are among the world's finest.
Asians are proving -- if it ever needed proof except in the condescending West -- that they can handle economic and political growth at the same time, thank you.
But in Hiroshima there was Beijing's emissary letting 10 Nobel Prize winners and other scientists, writers and politicians know that while the Chinese are clever and able enough to leap into the high-tech age, the Politburo feels that dealing with a little freedom at the same time would be beyond them.
They know better, the Chinese Communists. But like all dictatorships they live in fear that their people will demand political and economic freedom -- together. When the Beijing Politburo members look out the window at Asia, it is not the past and foreigners but the future and their own people that chill the souls of the Politburo and the careful messenger they sent to Hiroshima.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ebbs in Thin Trading; Many Await Central Bank Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar declined modestly against the German mark and the Japanese yen in thin trading yesterday as dealers waited to see whether central banks in the United States and Europe would soon lower interest rates.
Trading stayed in a tight range against the mark and the yen, with the dollar moving just three-quarters of a pfennig and roughly half a yen. It finished mixed against other major currencies. 
 Dave Glowacki, a senior trader in Detroit with the NBD Bank, estimated volume at 30 percent of normal.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 101.09 Japanese yen, down from 101.30 yen late Friday. The dollar changed hands at 1.4443 German marks, down from 1.4475. However, the Canadian dollar lost ground to the United States dollar, selling at 72.377 cents, down from 72.648 cents on Friday.
In what another trader called "one of the slowest days we've seen all year," investors had no economic data, signs of political unrest or other explanations to guide their currency bets. They were also waiting for United States inflation data, to be released this week, and for the Friday deadline on a new Federal budget.
The only real move of the day occurred after comments in Zurich by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers. He said he was "more optimistic about the U.S. economy than at any other time in my career."
This bullish sentiment helped move the dollar upward, even as the Swiss central bank and Government said the Swiss franc was too strong, hinting at a possible rate cut. That spurred selling of European currencies across the board, said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
"This plays into the idea of lower rates going forward in Europe," Mr. Solin said, referring to anticipation of rate cuts by the Bundesbank and the Bank of England this week, followed next week by the American Federal Reserve.
Central banks lower rates to spur growth and borrowing, but that tends to reduce demand for a country's currency as investments denominated in the currency become less attractive.

HEADLINE: At Hotels, Fewer Holiday Discounts

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
While toy makers, clothiers and distillers live for the holiday season, the period from Thanksgiving through Christmas can be the dead est of times for the hotel industry. Occupancy rates in December typically tumble to about 50 percent, compared with a year-round average of 65.2 percent in 1994, and would fall even further without a wide array of discounts and other enticements.
Many of those enticements, often including free parking and free breakfast, are widely available again this holiday season. 
 But there are fewer discount rates than usual, and almost none in New York, Chicago and other cities where business and leisure travelers have filled hotel rooms for weeks on end recently. In New York, for example, most of the 65,000 rooms have been booked solid all fall, with the occupancy rate soaring to 91.9 percent in October, the city's second-highest monthly rate ever, according to PKF Consulting, which tracks the hotel industry.
Thus the hotel industry's determination this holiday season, after seven or eight bad years, to expunge the widespread perception that discounts are a permanent feature of booking a room.
"The discounting that hotels have had to do has confused customers, led to unrealistic expectations and weakened bottom lines," said Brian Stage, executive vice president of sales and marketing for the Radisson hotels, a unit of the Carlson Companies. "So our strategy during the slow season is to create value-added packages to attract customers who wouldn't ordinarily stay in the hotels."
Indeed, hotels are offering everything from room upgrades and transportation to and from airports and shopping malls to discounts for food and beverages and gift certificates toward items in lobby shops.
Because business travel slows during much of the holiday season, a prime target of hotels is couples and families within a radius of about 50 miles. Not to mention partygoers.
At the venerable Seelbach Hotel in Louisville, Ky., where the fictional Tom Buchanan rented an entire floor before his wedding to Daisy Fay in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," December is filled with Christmas parties, weddings and local social events. "This evening alone," Viola Sanders, the Seelbach's sales manager, said in a recent interview, "we have seven corporate Christmas parties."
As states have cracked down on drunken driving, partygoers are increasingly staying over at hotels -- and often qualify for some of the remaining discount rates.
"If they had their party here," Ms. Sanders said, "they would get a discount rate of $69 a night," compared with the usual corporate rate of $137. Similarly, most Radisson hotels offer party guests rooms at half price.
To fill their rooms, hotels are also trying to entice more holiday travelers to stay with them, rather than with family or friends.
The Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., has been aiming at affluent families with radio and television ads proclaiming, "Your Guest House for the Holidays." Radisson hotels in Minneapolis, Atlanta and Arlington Heights, Ill., have all run ads with the headline "At Radisson, Uncle Fred Can Snore as Loud as He Likes."
Group discounts are viewed in a more favorable light by hoteliers than discounts for individual travelers, because most groups stay longer, rent meeting rooms and spend more on food and beverages. In fact, group business is so sought after, especially during slow seasons, that sales and marketing departments refer to it as Smerf -- an acronym for social, military, ethnic/educational, religious and fraternal groups.
The Radisson Sand Piper Beach Resort in St. Petersburg, Fla., not only solicits family groups, soccer associations and youth football leagues. "At Thanksgiving time, we're always looking for Canadians who don't celebrate the holiday," said Drew Toth, the hotel's director of sales and marketing.
The trend away from discounting also does not normally extend to weekend rates at hotels that cater to business travelers, who are scarce on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. On the contrary, weekend rates are regarded as providing incremental revenue from rooms that otherwise would have been empty.
So weekend rates abound, including during the holiday season. Almost 150 ITT Sheraton properties in the United States and Canada are offering 6 to 25 percent off their usual weekend rates, with some restrictions.
The Cincinnatian Hotel in Cincinnati's downtown business district has long offered weekend rates (currently $125 a night, compared with the $160 corporate rate). But the hotel does not further lower those rates for the holidays, although at Christmas it offers an array of amenities that include holiday meals and afternoon tea.
"We would rather leave a room empty than lower the rate too far, and risk losing our image as a luxury hotel," said Marjorie Hermann, a spokeswoman for the Cincinnatian. "And in a luxury hotel there are costs beyond turning a key and opening a door. There's the wear and tear on the room."
The Cincinnatian is not alone in thinking it necessary to protect its image, and hotel analysts say that belief is likely to spread -- at least until the next economic slowdown.
"Nothing is more perishable than an unoccupied hotel room," said Stanley Turkel, a hotel consultant in New York who is generally critical of the policy of accepting unoccupied rooms rather than offering lower rates.
Still, some luxury hotels are offering holiday rates well below normal. The Ritz-Carlton Huntington in Pasadena, Calif., for example, offers a holiday package for $115 a night that includes two cocktails and a room that regularly costs $165. "But we end it Dec. 28," said George Lysak, director of sales and marketing, "because we're sold out for the Rose Bowl and Rose Parade" on Jan. 1.
One of the most unusual marketing efforts is that of the 527-room San Francisco Airport Hilton, which through Jan. 15 charges guests the same rate as the lowest temperature in the city that day.
"It's a real bargain for guests," said Laura Jung, the hotel's director of sales and marketing, who noted that the temperature was often in the 40's during last year's promotion. The hotel's regular corporate rate is $140.
"We drew about 250 people because of it," Ms. Jung said, "most of them from around here. And when you include what they spent on food and drinks, the hotel made out O.K."

HEADLINE: Israel Sells Out Bond Offering, First Without U.S. Guarantee

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After a whirlwind roadshow with American investors, David Brodet of Israel's Ministry of Finance was able to announce that Israel had sold all of its new bond offering, its first since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and its first without the backing of the United States Treasury.
The sale was an important test of whether Israel could raise money in the world's capital markets after Mr. Rabin's assassination and the continuing political turmoil among Israelis and Palestinians over the Prime Minister's policy of trading Israeli land for Palestinian pledges of peace. 
 "We are very pleased and we think it quite significant," Mr. Brodet, who is director general in the finance ministry, said in an interview on Friday at the Israeli Consulate in Manhattan. "The legend of the Israeli economy is coming true."
The outcome of the first market test last month of Israel's capacity to raise money was unclear. Koor Industries, a major conglomerate, sold $120 million of stock in an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, somewhat less than expected but probably because of the overall weakness of the Israeli stock market.
In the bond sale completed on Thursday, Israel raised $250 million, more than the $200 million originally planned, but far less than the $750 million that investors wanted, according to Salomon Brothers, the lead manager for the sale. Thirty-five large investors in the United States bought bonds.
Moreover, the sale of what are known as "Yankee bonds" was the first such sale backed only by Israel. Previously, investors could enjoy high interest rates from the bonds, plus the backing of the United States Treasury against default.
The 10-year bonds carry an interest rate of 6.49 percent, far lower than previous offerings because Standard & Poor's, the Wall Street bond rating service, raised Israel's rating to A- from BBB+. Similar United States bonds yield about 5.7 percent and are rated AAA.
Such changes in ratings are significant because of the interest savings involved. Mr. Brodet estimated that Israel saved as much as $5 million in interest costs because of the improved rating.
Mr. Brodet said that Israel's economy was still somewhat hobbled by high interest rates, but that inflation and growth trends continued to improve. Inflation in 1996 is expected to match 1995's rate of 8 percent, but is still above the Government target of 3 to 5 percent.
Israel's gross domestic product is expected to total about $88 billion this year, up from $78 billion in 1994, Mr. Brodet said.

High-Tech Attraction
A growing number of fashion retailers and designers are turning to computers and interactive television to draw customers. Last night, Macy's previewed its new Tommy Hilfiger shop, which features CD-ROM's and interactive television.
Mr. Hilfiger, from his television studio at his headquarters in Manhattan, conducted a 30-minute show with Don Nelson, the Knicks coach; the singer Jon Secada, and Russell Simmons, the entertainment executive. The show went on live in Macy's Herald Square and Macy's in San Francisco. Customers were able to speak with Mr. Hilfiger. 
 On Feb. 1, Saks Fifth Avenue will use satellite transmission to introduce Isaac, the new bridge collection by Isaac Mizrahi. An appearance by Mr. Mizrahi in the store here that evening will be simulcast to 18 other Saks branches. Saks introduced the format in September with Donna Karan. And J. C. Penney, after testing the concept in four stores earlier this year, began using computer kiosks this fall to sell bodywear in 14 stores.
But is there a future in luring reluctant shoppers electronically, or are the technological gizmos only a carnival sideshow?
Rose Marie Bravo, the president of Saks, said Ms. Karan's television appearance in 12 stores helped sales. "We know the same thing will happen with Isaac, and he will drive business and sell merchandise by explaining the philosophy of what the Isaac line is about," she said. "People want to know."
The idea is to entice shoppers with new-age toys, to save them time and to put them in touch with designers. "It will keep expanding because of the economics," said Robert Shavelson, the managing director of fashion for National Video, which develops retail concepts for video and computers. "Designers can reach a number of customers they couldn't in a month's worth of traveling."
 
Creative Director for New Line
Benny Lin, whose last job as fashion director for Macy's East had him straddling the worlds of high-concept fashion and value-conscious style, has been named creative director for the new Lauren-Ralph Lauren line.
As fashion continues its fascinating slide toward cheap chic, Mr. Lauren, the quintessential promoter of high living, is trying to interpret his designer style for the masses with Lauren, where a jacket will cost less than $200. For Mr. Lauren, who has exhibited a monk's devotion to marketing with admirable results, the step down will be a tricky balancing act. Over the years he has projected the life of the patrician, and his products -- with the exception of some Chaps items for men -- for the most part have had prices to match. Apparently, Mr. Lauren now recognizes that customers have never been readier for Ralph Lauren on the cheap, as it were.
Lauren is licensed to Jones New York and will be sold in stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Lord & Taylor. Mr. Lin will be based in Jones's New York offices and will oversee the development of in-store shops and co-ordinate merchandising for the division. "Mr. Lauren's products have tremendous appeal to a large segment of the population, and with these prices more people will be able to enjoy them," Mr. Lin said. "It's the next growth area."
 
Buying American
Clothing auctions have become a reliable indicator of the direction in which the fashion wind is blowing. A sale at the William Doyle Gallery in Manhattan last week provided one more signal that interest is slipping away from French fashion toward American sartorial tastes.
"Until recently, people were primarily interested in haute couture and elaborate eveningwear," said Caroline Rennolds Milbank, a fashion historian and consultant to William Doyle. "Now, they're interested in good tailoring. We have more people coming in to see seaming or how a sleeve is set, and tailoring is one of the hallmarks of American fashion."
The auctions are held twice a year; in recent seasons the work of Charles James, the late American couturier, has been among the most popular. A coat by him fetched a top price of $8,000 on Wednesday. Designers Claire McCardell and Adrian were among the top sellers.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
2 Families, 4 Years After the Layoffs

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The flow of good jobs out of America to cheap-labor countries has become a fact of American life, and "Living on the Edge" tells what that means for a few of the men and women left behind. Tonight's edition of "Frontline" grew out of "Minimum Wages: The New Economy," Bill Moyers's 1991 report on layoffs in Milwaukee. The producers returned in 1993 and again this year to see what was happening to two blue-collar families; they found some improvements at substantial costs.
Tony Neumann and Claude and Jackie Stanley are three of the thousands of workers laid off in recent years by Briggs & Stratton, Milwaukee's biggest employer. Tony and Terry Neumann are white, the Stanleys are black, but they have a lot in common. Since losing the jobs that had kept them in the fairly comfortable, seemingly secure middle class, they have been scrambling to stay afloat. It's been years of hard work, disappointments and a realization that things will never again be what they were a few years ago; once realistic expectations now seem wishful. 
 Despite current campaign noise, the problems of the Neumann and Stanley households have nothing to do with "family values." Those values seem remarkably intact considering the buffeting the families have been taking. The Neumanns have faced the possible loss of their home and for one bad patch were reduced to accepting charity. The Stanleys and their five children have all been working as hard as they can yet not advancing much.
The program chronicles their efforts to find new incomes, eke out time for the children from the increased time needed to support them and keep up spirits despite constant rebuffs. With two jobs and a lot of overtime, the Neumanns are earning more these days but are seeing less of their three children. Mrs. Stanley has had to borrow to keep her oldest son in college, and Claude, who now waterproofs basements, sees no prospect of ever retiring.
Yet even with the unremitting pressures, their energy and initiative do not seem to have flagged. They also hang onto the hope or faith not so much that things will get better but that they will not get any worse. Maybe they are overly optimistic: the hour ends with the news that Briggs & Stratton is eliminating 2,000 more jobs and that real wages are still going down around the country.

HEADLINE: As Crime Soars, South African Whites Leave

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 11

 BODY:
At the end of this month, Heidi Moller will move from South Africa to Germany, leaving the country she was born in without a hint of regret. Her husband's business was not doing well. The school system, she says, is disintegrating. But most of all, she says, she is leaving because fear had come to overwhelm her family.
Last year, her husband, Hans, a surveyor, was shot at from a passing vehicle while working in a Johannesburg suburb. A few months later, he was forced off the road by hijackers and was shot in the leg. One of Mrs. Moller's best friends was shot and her husband killed in front of their children. Her brother-in-law was shot at in his driveway as four men tried to steal his car, while his family watched helplessly from the house. 
 If she and her husband had tried to leave two years ago as South Africa was preparing for its first free elections, Mrs. Moller says her friends would have called them cowards and accused them of running away. But these days, she says, "All we find is that people are envious."
Experts say the white, wealthy and educated are leaving South Africa in growing numbers, draining the country of expertise when it is desperately needed. Most often, the move is a response to the rising violent crime that seems to have touched almost everyone.
While most of those departing have several reasons, and a bleak view of the role that white people can have in this country's future, it is violent crime that seems to lead the list. Reported crimes in some areas and categories have increased by as much as 75 percent in one year.
Much of the new terror is confined to the white suburbs of Johannesburg. These areas were well protected under the old government and the residents worried about crime little more than suburban residents do in the United States.
But these days, every house is a fortress, with burglar bars on the windows and a steel "rape gate" separating the bedrooms from the rest of the house for extra protection at night. Garden walls are topped by ever-evolving forms of razor wire, "cactus" spikes or electric wires that deliver a jolt as they set off an alarm. And, carrying a gun is ever more commonplace.
Dinner parties have become a frenzy of horror stories. Some are tales of what has happened to the well-known and powerful. Recently, for instance, a radio personality was held up during a daytime stroll with his daughter through Houghton, the wealthy suburb where President Nelson Mandela has a house. The robbers, apparently to amuse themselves, made them strip and left them naked. But most often the tales are first person. People talk softly of how their self-images have changed after they have cringed or begged or nursed a bullet wound.
"Someone close to you gets hurt and you think it could happen to me," said Ron Stern, who has a business selling window and doors, and who says he is considering leaving. "Should I stick around and risk my children's lives? You are in a constant state of limbo trying to figure this out. That's our daily existence. That's what we do."
The exodus has hit hard at some professions, perhaps none more than medicine. One doctor recently sent the photograph of his 1984 graduating class to a local newspaper, showing that at least 76 of the 186 graduates had emigrated. But moving-company executives say that whites from all backgrounds are leaving.
Government figures, collected from departure forms filled out at airports, show that peak emigration was in the first half of 1994, just before the elections, when the fear was of rioting or civil war. But recent statistics show that the exodus is hardly fading. During the first half of 1995, 6,030 people said they were emigrating, about twice the number of five years before.
Experts say those statistics vastly underestimate the problem because people lie on their departure forms, partly to evade restrictions on taking money out of the country. Moving companies and relocation specialists say they haven't been this busy since the late 1970's, when a wave of brutal riots started what is known in the business as the first "chicken run."
"When they give the statistics in the paper, I always laugh," said Estelle Sachavitz of Stuttafords Removals, one of the leading moving companies here. "Most people don't say they are leaving for good. As soon as they say that, their funds are blocked and things get very complicated. So people just go."
The long-term consequences for South Africa are unclear. Some emigrants will return, unable to make a go of it elsewhere. But for a country finally trying to improve the lives of a population and in need of jobs, health care and good schools, the loss of the educated elite is a blow. At a recent meeting with black executives, President Mandela said that accommodating whites is in the country's best interest.
"Why should we not pacify them?" Mr. Mandela said. "In putting aside the quarrels of the past we have a country which has the opportunity to acquire education, skills and expertise in many fields. We want this."
Mr. Mandela's administration has taken steps to address the crime issue. The police department, which functioned largely as a brutal enforcer of the apartheid laws under the old government, is being completely reorganized in an effort to turn it into a crime-fighting agency.
But with little money for training of officers and a shortage of vehicles that often delays officers responding to emergencies, the force remains largely ineffective.
To be sure, crime is not the only reason whites leave. Mrs. Moller said her husband is having a harder and harder time getting people to pay their bills and feels the whole country is becoming lawless. And there is talk of revamping property laws, in ways that will diminish the need for land surveyors.
At the same time, Mrs. Moller, says that her 5-year-old daughter, Melissa, will not be able to get a good education, now that the Government has ended segregated schools. The change has meant that some youngsters coming from the inferior system created for blacks are not as well prepared as their white counterparts. "The public schools are lowering their standards to accommodate the blacks," Mrs. Moller said. "They expect that everyone will come down to their level."
Most white South Africans go to Australia, England, the United States, Canada or New Zealand. Many have quietly kept up dual citizenship to make the departure easy.
Many of those who want to leave understand that their wealth will shrink overseas. But they say they are willing to trade small mansions, full-time maids and the employer-provided Mercedes for a sense of safety and the possibility that their children will be able to ride bicycles in the driveway.
"We'll never be able to match this," said one accountant, sweeping his hand across his property -- a five-bedroom house with a pool in the Bryanston suburb of Johannesburg. "We will have a basic house and a basic motor vehicle."
Still the accountant and his wife are determined to go to Australia. Last year, she was wrestled out of her car by four young men as she backed out of her garage. The incident began when one of them tapped frantically on her window.
"I thought someone was in terrible trouble -- he looked so panicked and I was ready to get out and help. And then, stupid me, I realized the only person in trouble here was me.
"You know," she continued, "last year I was so elated -- standing in the queues to vote was the most incredible feeling. It was the first time I could walk around and look everybody in the eye. I was acquiring my freedom too. But then with the hijacking I got my first taste of fear.
"For a whole lot of people, the changes in this country are going to be great. Life will get better. But not for us. And I'm not prepared to sacrifice my future and my children's future. I just don't want to live with this fear. To be so tense. To go out of the driveway and think: Is the alarm on? Is there anyone behind me?"

Wall Street Plays Down
Effects of Securities Bill
Wall Street sees the securities bill that passed Congress last week as a mild step toward quelling frivolous investor suits, not the radical advance as portrayed in Washington.
Lawyers, accountants and others say that the number of class-action suits will diminish somewhat, and that other aims, like greater disclosure, will have a limited application. Market Place. [Page D10.]
 
Administration Plans to Cut Time
Employers Hold 401(k) Money
The Clinton Administration proposed to reduce the time companies could hold workers' contributions to 401(k) retirement savings plans before turning it over to mutual funds or other investments.
To protect employees, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich proposed that the 90-day holding period be cut to the same time companies hold Social Security money -- generally one day to a month, depending on payroll size. [D2.]
 
Hoteliers Seek
Holiday Cheer
The holiday season is generally less than merry for the nation's hoteliers. Occupancy rates in December typically tumble to about 50 percent, compared with a year-round average of 65.2 percent in 1994. Consequently, hotel keepers are offering an array of discounts and other lures to guests. [D5.]
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb to Cut Costs
Bristol-Myers Squibb announced a three-year $2.5 billion cost-savings plan. It will involve closing an unspecified number of plants and result in a charge of $250 million to $300 million against fourth-quarter earnings. [D7.]
 
Orders for Computer Chips Decline
New orders for computer chips fell 1.5 percent in November from October, to $5.03 billion, an industry group reported. [D6.]
 
More Optimistic Revenue Projection
The Congressional Budget Office forecast that the Government could reap a $185 billion windfall over the next seven years, as a result of a stronger-than-expected economy. The forecast gave the Administration and Congress more room for maneuvering in their negotiations to balance the budget. [D22.]
 
Loyalty and Federal Express
A pilots union's slowdown at Federal Express, aimed at forcing management to make a better contract offer, could backfire. Rather than winning converts to labor's cause, it has led most employees to embrace the company even more tightly. [D22.]
 
Machinists to End Strike at Boeing
Negotiators for machinists and Boeing reached a tentative agreement to end a 67-day strike, the union said. Members are to vote on the four-year contract, which includes bonuses, pay increases and protection on subcontracting on Wednesday. [D22.]
 
Israel Sells
New Bond Offering
Israel sold its entire new bond offering, the first since the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and its first without the backing of the United States Treasury. The sale was an important test of Israel's standing in world capital markets. Salomon Brothers, the lead manager for the sale, said Israel raised $250 million. [D4.]
 
Book Advertising on the Upswing
Book publishers are figuring out new advertising methods. Television ads are becoming popular with cost-effective techniques like computer imaging, and the expansion of cable channels allows publishers to seek specific audiences. Advertising. [D9.]
 
Ziff-Davis and Yahoo Link Planned
Ziff-Davis, a leading publisher of computer magazines, and Yahoo, one of the most popular directories on the Internet's World Wide Web, are expected to announce a partnership today, executives familiar with the deal say. Ziff-Davis's quarterly, Internet Life, is to be renamed Yahoo! Internet Life, and a Web site called ZD/Yahoo! Computing is planned. [D9.]

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Climb, With Dow Up by 27.46

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks ended higher yesterday, bolstered by a strong rally in oil stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.46 points, to 5,184.32, recovering part of the ground lost in the two days since closing at a record 5,199.13 on Dec. 6. The broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.04 points, to 619.52, just short of its Dec. 6 record of 620.18. But the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.91 point, to 1,061.50. 
 Shares of oil companies rose after frigid temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast briefly sent the price of oil past $19 a barrel to a six-month high. The crude oil price later retreated to $18.66 a barrel. The weather, coupled with the companies' above-average dividends, led investors to bet oil stocks may outpace the rest of the stock market this winter.
The rally sent the Standard & Poor's International Oil Index up 13.34, or 2.5 percent, to a record 529.91. During the last six months, the index gained 12.6 percent, lagging behind the 16.7 percent gain of the S.& P. 500.
"Step outside -- there's probably some decent demand for heating oil," said Dirk van Dijk, equity strategist at Dean Investment Associates of Dayton, Ohio, which oversees about $3.7 billion.
Among oil issues that reached records, Exxon rose 2 3/8, to a record 84 1/8; Chevron surged 19/16 , to an all-time high of 52 3/4; Amoco rose 2 1/2, to a record 71 1/4; Texaco Inc. gained 3/4, to a record 79 1/8 and Mobil rose 3 1/8, to a record 113 5/8.
The gain in oil stocks was partly offset by losses in paper issues. Paper stocks fell amid concern that increased production to take advantage of high prices will eventually flood the market with too much product and cause prices to fall.
International Paper fell 1/2, to 36 1/2; Bowater Inc. fell 1, to 35 1/4; Georgia-Pacific lost 2 1/4, to 71; Champion International shed 1 5/8, to 42 7/8, and Louisiana-Pacific dropped 5/8, to 24 7/8.
Banking issues fell amid concern interest rates may not decline soon. When rates fall, banks can borrow money for less and keep more of the money they take in from loans.
Citicorp fell 21/16 to 67 3/4; Norwest fell 7/8, to 33 1/8; Nationsbank dropped 5/8, to 73; Fleet Financial Group fell 5/8, to 41 1/4, and Bank of Boston gave up 7/8, to 46 5/8.
Maybelline surged 5 1/4, to 36 1/4. L'Oreal S.A. of France said it had agreed to buy the company for $36.75 a share, or about $598 million.
Earth Technology rose 161/64 , to 753/64 . Tyco International signed a merger agreement under which it would make a tender offer for the environmental consulting company at $8 a share, or about $70 million.
Glenayre Technologies rose 5 3/4, to 59. The telecommunications equipment maker was raised to medium-term "above average" from "neutral" by Joseph Bellace, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company.
Microwave Power Devices Inc. jumped 1 7/8, to 13 1/2. The maker of power amplifiers said it had won a $20.3 million contract to produce and supply amplifiers for use in satellite communications systems.
Advancing issues outpaced decliners 1,207 to 1,133 on the New York Stock Exchange, where 344 million shares traded hands, up from 327.9 million on Friday.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Draws Protest to Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
Inside a warm, plush ballroom of the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan last night, about 400 revelers at the annual Louis Marshall Award Dinner greeted this year's keynote speaker with raised wine glasses, craned necks and discreet applause.
But outside, in the freezing cold, more than 250 protesters accorded him a reception that matched the harsh weather, hollering that he had no right to command the podium at one of the most important annual social events in the Conservative movement of Judaism. 
 House Speaker Newt Gingrich was in town, and controversy was typically fast on his heels.
"We believe that everything Newt Gingrich stands for -- the politics of blame and meanness, the destruction of the social safety net -- flies against the Jewish ethical tradition," said Rabbi Michael Feinberg, program coordinator for a nonprofit group, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, that organized the protest at a fund-raiser for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
"Last year, the speaker was Elie Wiesel," the rabbi noted. "How do you go from that to Newt Gingrich?"
That question has triggered considerable dissent and even a few diatribes from seminary students and leaders of liberal Jewish organizations since seminary officials announced the selection of Mr. Gingrich about nine months ago.
And last night, that question boiled over into a strident demonstration across Fifth Avenue from the Pierre, on the edge of Central Park.
Protesters said that Mr. Gingrich's staunchly conservative social policies are anathema to the traditionally liberal positions of many Jews on issues like poverty and immigration and that the seminary officials had given Mr. Gingrich what could be perceived as a Jewish seal of approval.
But seminary officials said Mr. Gingrich was invited not as a measure of endorsement but as a recognition of the important, influential niche he currently occupies in American politics. "He needs to be heard," said Gershon Kekst, the seminary chairman. Mr. Gingrich's supporters at the dinner further argued that some of Mr. Gingrich's core concerns -- for better education, for stronger families -- are also held dear in the Jewish community, and they praised his fierce advocacy for Israel.
"Newt Gingrich is one of Israel's best friends in the United States Congress," said Mayer Mitchell, chairman of the board of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.
Seminary officials acknowledged that they chose Mr. Gingrich in part because they felt he would be a potent and lucrative draw. They were right: the roughly 400 people who bought tickets for last night's dinner represented the largest crowd for the annual event in at least five years, and the $1.2 million that the dinner was expected to raise for the seminary was about $200,000 more than usual.
In response to an outcry from students over the invitation, seminary officials negotiated a half-hour meeting last night, from about 6:30 to 7:00 P.M., between Mr. Gingrich and about 16 representatives of the student body.
Gathering in a small annex of the ballroom just before the dinner, the students and Mr. Gingrich engaged in a polite airing of sometimes opposing views that was rendered even more amicable by the students' palpable humbleness in his presence and Mr. Gingrich's professorial patience with them.
While most of the students took issue with his policies, focusing alternately on welfare cutbacks, the environment and prayer in schools, a few applauded his conservative reforms.
Toward the end, Mr. Gingrich confessed, "I sat here almost with my stomach in knots."
His speech at the dinner touched on such topics as evil, personal responsibility and government bureaucracy. At one point, in what was clearly a planned gesture, a young man and a young woman shot out of their seats to shout at him, but guards hustled them away quickly.
The Louis Marshall Award, named for a widely respected Jewish leader who served as chairman of the seminary's board of directors from 1904 until his death in 1929, is bestowed annually by the seminary on men and women who have demonstrated outstanding commitment to their communities. Last night's honorees were Alex J. Mandl, an executive vice president of AT&T, and Dr. Sue Bailey, director of women's outreach for the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
The fund-raiser that has evolved around the award is a swank black-tie affair that features crepes and caviar and commands a price of at least $1,000 a plate, with many attendees donating more.
Back in September, after hearing that Mr. Gingrich would deliver the keynote address, one of Louis Marshall's grandchildren, Jonathan Marshall, wrote a letter to Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, the seminary's chancellor, asking that Mr. Marshall's name be removed from the dinner this year. Rabbi Schorsch denied that request.
In a subsequent telephone interview, Jonathan Marshall, who lives in Phoenix, said of seminary officials: "They're using my grandfather's name to raise money for a cause that is fine, but with a person he would find despicable. Mr. Gingrich is such a loud, abrasive person. My grandfather was subtle."

HEADLINE: Bill Would Cut Medicaid-Welfare Link

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Congressional experts today issued a brighter economic forecast that gave the Clinton Administration and Congress more room for maneuvering in their budget negotiations, but less flexibility than many had hoped.
The forecast, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, predicted that the Government could reap a $135 billion windfall in new revenue and savings over the next seven years from a stronger-than-expected economy. That is considerably more than the $100 billion that Congressional officials had said would accrue from the revised forecast. 
 The extra money would shrink by one third the $400 billion gap separating the plans that Republican leaders and President Clinton have offered to erase the Federal deficit over that period.
But, by a numerical twist of fate, the money might be worth less to the bargainers than that figure suggests. The bulk of the windfall would occur at the start of the seven-year span, and the remainder would dwindle over time until no new money would be left in 2002, the year the Government should be in fiscal balance.
That is the opposite of what the negotiators need, since their plans rely on spending cuts and savings that start small and accumulate to huge sums by the end of the period. The deputy director of the budget office James Blum, said tonight that perhaps $100 billion of the $135 billion might be usable by the negotiators. But the negotiators themselves did not seem so sure.
"The new numbers may help a little, but not a great deal," said the principal Democratic negotiator for the House, Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minnesota, after bargainers were briefed this afternoon.
The chief negotiator for the Senate Republicans, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, was slightly more sanguine. "Let there be no doubt: This has not put us in a position where we're cutting off negotiations," he said. But the forecast, he added, was a combination of "good news and bad news."
The director of the budget office, June O'Neill, said the added money comes largely from changes in this year's economic picture. They include higher corporate profits, and thus more tax revenues, and lower inflation and interest rates, which ease the cost of Government debt and some inflation-adjusted programs. Some of the gains were offset, though, by a slower growth of the workforce, Ms. O'Neill said.
The budget talks are aimed not just at erasing the deficit, but avoiding another shutdown of the Federal Government like the one that occurred last month. That shutdown ended after six days when the two sides agreed to pay for most Government operations until this Friday while they hash out their fiscal differences.
But while the deadline is almost here, little has been hashed out. Congress sent Mr. Clinton a bill financing the military's 1996 budget, which he reluctantly signed. But six other 1996 spending bills for agencies including the Departments of Commerce, State, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Labor remain mired in disputes between the House and Senate.
Congress also sent Mr. Clinton a seven-year budget bill that radically changed benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and farm subsidies. But Mr. Clinton vetoed that bill last week, saying it did not reflect his "values," and told Congress not to send it back until it did.
There matters stand. Technically, Mr. Clinton does not even have to sign the seven-year budget bill, because it revises programs that would continue unchanged should the bill not become law. But Republicans say they will not send Mr. Clinton any more spending bills, which must be signed by Friday to keep the Government running, until there is agreement on the seven-year budget.
Congress could enact another temporary spending measure to keep offices open while negotiations continue, and in fact, Republicans are preparing such a bill now. But Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chief negotiator for the House Republicans, said today that that measure will contain conditions limiting how the money can be spent. Mr. Clinton has promised to veto any spending bill that is too restrictive.
Republicans also could attach the spending bill to a new seven-year budget package that they are drafting this week, and hope to enact by Friday. That would present Mr. Clinton with a take-it-or-leave-it option: sign the entire package into law, or veto it and throw some 350,000 Federal workers off the job at the peak of the holiday season.
The weeks of talks have amounted to a collection of momentary highs followed by prolonged lows. After days of bickering over the agenda, the bargaining seemed to pick up on Thursday, when Mr. Clinton offered his own version of a seven-year balanced budget. It immediately slowed again when Republicans rejected the plan, saying it fell $400 billion short of balance, and threatened another Government shutdown should negotiators fail to make rapid progress.
The Congressional Budget Office will apply its new economic forecast to Mr. Clinton's seven-year proposal, making it directly comparable to the Republican plan, Ms. O'Neill said. But that may take time, because the Administration has not yet provided enough details of its proposal to allow a thorough evaluation.
Negotiators plan to meet again on Tuesday to mull over the new economic forecast. But there was little indication today that the fits-and-starts nature of the talks is about to change.
On one hand, Mr. Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, were said to be buoyed after President Clinton called them on Sunday to discuss the deadlocked budget talks.
But on the other hand, the Administration's principal bargainer, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said today that he doubts that a budget agreement can be struck this week. And he said the President will probably not take a personal role in budget talks this week, despite Republican requests, because he is preparing for a trip to Paris on Wednesday for the signing of the Bosnia peace treaty. 
 Because of a technical error, the article carried an incorrect headline in some editions. The headline, "Bill Would Cut Medicaid-Welfare Link," was intended for an article about new welfare legislation.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 13, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about budget negotiations between Congress and the White House misstated President Clinton's action on a military spending bill. He let it become law without his signature earlier this month; he did not sign it.

HEADLINE: Exemption Set In Clinton Plan For Crackdown On Tax Deals

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, which proposed last week to close what it said were billions of dollars of tax loopholes used in Wall Street financing, retreated ever so slightly yesterday.
Among the Administration's proposals was to deny tax benefits to corporate bonds issued for maturities longer than 40 years and to hybrid securities that go by names like MIPS and combine characteristics of debt and ownership. 
But in a three-paragraph clarification yesterday, the Treasury Department said companies that sold 100-year bonds and exotic securities the Clinton Administration seeks to eliminate could keep the tax benefits, provided that the companies had binding deals by last Wednesday.
The statement lifted a cloud over more than half a billion dollars of corporate securities sold on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday last week.
But the fate of several deals that were not quite complete, including a $500 million offering by the Pacific Telesis Group, the California and Nevada regional Bell company, remained uncertain.
Last week's announcement by the Treasury Department characterized 100-year bonds and various exotic securities as abusive practices outside the normal realm of corporate finance.
Yesterday, the Public Securities Association defended these financing instruments, saying they were neither abusive nor abnormal.
"These proposals represent an attack on capital formation at a time when this nation should be focusing its attention on increasing savings and investment," Robert B. McKnew, the securities association chairman, said in a statement. The association called the exotic securities innovative aids in strengthening the economy.
The association said that proposing major tax changes "outside the context of comprehensive tax reform is wholly inappropriate in our view." The Treasury Department has been careful to limit its drive on tax deductions to Wall Street, which, with its penchant for multimillion-dollar bonuses, may not have much sympathy from many Americans. "Everyone is going have to share in the burden of deficit reduction, not just working mothers making $30,000 a year," said a Treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Officials at four Wall Street investment houses agreed yesterday that whether a particular security was equity or debt was a legitimate subject for debate. But all took the same line as Mr. McKnew in saying that the issue should be handled as part of an overall debate on tax revision.
The definition of debt and equity has been at issue since the adoption of the 16th Amendment, which authorized income taxes. The Internal Revenue Code grants the Treasury Department authority to define equity and debt for tax purposes through rules and regulations.
Kenneth H. Heitner, a leading tax expert with the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said that "MIPS and the others are very popular instruments on Wall Street today because the bankers have convinced everybody that they are a relatively low-cost form of capital."
When a company sells bonds it can deduct the interest payments before calculating its Federal income tax liability, but dividends paid to equity owners are not deductible, he noted.
The hybrids have attracted buyers who want to mix the benefits of ownership, principally a higher return if the company prospers, with the predetermined interest paid on debt.
Mr. Heitner said that while the transitional relief helped some companies whose deals were priced before last Thursday, "I am aware of a number of issues that were ready to go to market that were deferred." He said those deals must now be redone and would result in higher costs for the capital raised.
Michael Schler, a tax partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, said that he was concerned about deals that were partly completed on Thursday, when the Clinton Administration made its proposals public. But he said he had hope that the Administration might look favorably on these deals because the transitional relief announcement included a promise to "work with Congress to determine the extent to which additional transitional relief is appropriate."
Two companies whose financings last week appeared to be in question said yesterday that they were satisfied they had been "grandfathered." Johnson Controls of Milwaukee sold $125 million of debentures with a 50-year term, a decade longer than the new rules would allow.
"We feel confident that we were grandfathered," said Ben C. M. Bastianen, the company treasurer. He said the securities were priced and sold on Tuesday.
At IES Utilities, the electric power company for much of northern Iowa, officials said they were also comfortable that their deal was safe. "This is debt and it's less than 40 years," said Bill Cherrier, a company financial analyst.
The Treasury may look on the deal differently because not only is the debt last in line, after $573 million of more senior debt, but also that company can stop cash interest payments for up to five years, provided it suspends dividend payments on common and preferred stock. Those terms may make the Treasury look upon the "quarterly debt-capital securities" as equity, especially since they were described in the prospectus as "shares."
 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 29, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 12 about the Clinton Administration's proposal to end favorable tax treatment of some corporate fi nancings included a company official's erroneous reference to certain securities being offered by IES Utilities. The securities are described in the company's prospectus as junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures; they are not shares.

HEADLINE: Bank of Boston and Baybanks To Merge in $2 Billion Deal

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Bank of Boston Corporation said last night that it would buy Baybanks Inc., the leading consumer bank in New England, for $2 billion in stock.
The combined bank, with assets of $55 billion, will be the largest bank in Massachusetts and the 15th largest in the nation. 
 The banks said that they would eliminate 2,000 of their 24,500 jobs, half through layoffs and half through attrition, and close 85 of their 400 combined branches.
The Bank of Boston agreed to exchange 2.2 of its shares -- worth $99.72 at yesterday's closing price -- for each share of Baybanks. Yesterday Baybanks' stock closed at $85, up 75 cents. Bank of Boston's stock closed at $45.325, down $1.25. The merger was announced after the market closed.
The merger agreement, which was signed at 4:15 P.M. yesterday in Boston, caps a year in which the Bank of Boston tried and failed to merge with a number of large banks including the Corestates Financial Corporation, the Mellon Bank Corporation, the Fleet Financial Group and the Bank of New York.
While Bank of Boston has successful operations in Latin America, it decided its domestic operations were too small to compete with the growing banking giants, especially Fleet, which bought the Shawmut National Corporation in January, forming the largest bank in New England.
Baybanks has long been the most obvious acquisition for Bank of Boston, which has lagged in serving the consumer market. In contrast, over the last 20 years, Baybanks' ubiquitous green sign and vast automated teller machine network have captured the business of Boston's university students, many of whom have stayed with the bank as they have grown to be affluent professionals.
Many other large regional banking companies have similarly had their eyes on Baybanks, and several, including Corestates, have made overtures.
All of these have been sternly rebuffed by William M. Crozier Jr., the crusty 63-year-old banker who has been chairman of Baybanks for 21 years, and styled its lively marketing more on the model of L.L. Bean than the stodgy examples set by other banks. He had long said that were he to sell, he would prefer an out-of-state buyer to Bank of Boston, in order to protect employees' jobs.
In an interview yesterday, however, Mr. Crozier said that in the current environment protecting jobs was less important to him.
"Times change," he said. "There will be job losses, but today we are growing, and the economy here is growing, and so protecting jobs is less important." Mr. Crozier emphasized that this deal would preserve another large banking company based in New England.
Mr. Crozier owns about 120,000 shares of Baybanks, worth about $12 million in the deal, and he has options to buy about 134,000 more shares.
Mr. Crozier will be the chairman of the combined banking company through 1998, and will look after its retail operations. Charles K. Gifford, 53, the chief executive of Bank of Boston will be chief executive and president until taking the chairman's title when Mr. Crozier retires. All of the top Baybanks executives will have senior jobs in the combined company.
The deal was initiated by Mr. Gifford, who became chief executive of Bank of Boston in August when his predecessor, Ira Stepanian, was forced out by the board of directors. Mr. Stepanian's abrasive style was blamed for the collapse of the previous merger discussions.
"We looked around and saw a combination with Baybanks as the No. 1 strategic option because it would combine what I think is the top consumer bank in the country with our strong corporate and international banking," said Mr. Gifford, who is known as Chad.
In talks that began last month, Mr. Gifford agreed to a number of concessions that smoothed the negotiations with Baybanks. The deal was arranged quickly and secretly, in deliberate contrast to Bank of Boston's highly public failed merger with Corestates.
Mr. Crozier said that the most important issue to him was the name and logo of the new company. The banks' branches throughout New England will go by the Baybanks name, displayed in its trademark green combined with the Bank of Boston's eagle logo. The holding company and the foreign and corporate banking operations will use the Bank of Boston name.
The price, of course, was lucrative as well, representing 2.2 times Baybanks' book value, relatively high for bank deals. The deal would give Baybanks' stockholders ownership of 30 percent of the combined company's shares.
Analysts said, however, that the price was not too high for Bank of Boston and that its per share earnings would increase as a result of the deal, once the cost savings were realized.
"The price is actually a little under what I thought Baybanks would go for," said Nancy Bush, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman who was critical of Bank of Boston's earlier proposed deals. "When you look at the options for Bank of Boston, this is far and away the best one," she said.
The acquisition is expected to eliminate $190 million in expenses, 11 percent of the combined banks' spending in the United States. The banks also expect $50 million in increased revenue. Bank of Boston will take a $140 million charge for the merger, which is expected to be completed in the middle of next year.
One potential problem that Bank of Boston will have in this deal is convincing the Justice Department that that there are no antitrust concerns. After this deal, Fleet and Bank of Boston will be by far the dominant banks in New England, with the next largest institutions -- State Street Boston and the Boston Company unit of Mellon -- focused on serving institutions rather than consumers.
Bank of Boston executives insist that the combination does not violate the Justice Department's rules. But some banking experts say that this interpretation requires the Government to treat all the savings banks in the region as equally competitive to commercial banks, an approach that is not always taken.
While some shareholders of Bank of Boston may be upset that it did not choose simply to sell itself to an out-of-state banking company, Mr. Gifford defended the acquisition.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
$2.3 Billion Deal To Give NBC Rights To Future Olympics

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
NBC cornered the Olympic television market yesterday by agreeing to spend $2.3 billion for the broadcast and cable rights to the 2004 Summer, 2006 Winter and 2008 Summer Olympics even before the sites of the Games have been determined.
The deal is the richest in television sports history, provides a stream of highly rated programming for NBC into the next decade and is a financial legacy for Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic Committee's president. 
 The deal pre-empted bidding from NBC's three rivals, further cementing the cozy relationship between the network and the I.O.C. NBC's payments of $793 million for the 2004 Games, $613 million for 2006 and $894 million for 2008 could have been higher if ABC, Fox and CBS had been allowed to bid.
The I.O.C. confidently swapped its removal from competitive bidding with a promise to split revenues with NBC after the network's advertising sales exceed the cost of buying and producing the Games. The arrangement is a variation on the formula adopted for next year's Summer Olympics in Atlanta, in which the I.O.C. started sharing when NBC's advertising sales topped $615 million. The I.O.C. has already begun collecting its share, and ad sales have reached $650 million.
The extraordinary spending promised by NBC comes just five months after it agreed to pay the I.O.C. $1.25 billion for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
The talks that spawned yesterday's deal began the day that the August package was announced. The I.O.C. executive board approved it last week.
NBC's enthusiastic Olympic futures trading means that by 2008, the network will have shown six consecutive Summer Olympics and five straight Winter or Summer Olympics, unprecedented even when ABC Sports ruled Olympic telecasting.
The maneuver will keep CBS, which was just acquired by Westinghouse, Capital Cities/ABC, which is in the process of being acquired by the Walt Disney Company, and Rupert Murdoch's Fox Network out of the bidding picture for a long time. The only coming Olympics that won't be shown by NBC will be the 1998 Winter Games from Nagano, Japan, for which CBS is paying $375 million.
NBC moved so quickly that the other networks may have been caught by surprise.
"They may have done some planning, but they weren't doing any talking," said Dick Pound, the chairman of the I.O.C.'s television negotiations committee.
David Hill, president of Fox Sports, said, "By pulling us out of the equation, it lets us strengthen our relationships with the N.F.L., N.H.L. and major league baseball." ABC and CBS declined comment.
NBC's rights fee is paid in several installments for each Games. First, the United States Olympic Committee gets a 10 percent cut of the total, or $79.3 million, for example, for the 2004 Olympics. The I.O.C. receives three payments: 30 percent, or about $214 million, four years before the Olympic flame is lighted, then up to 35 percent, or $249.7 million, one month before the Olympics start, and the remaining $249.7 million one month after the flame is doused.
NBC's wager is that the power of Olympic programming outweighs the risk of its future payments. With aggressive backing from General Electric, NBC's parent company, the network combined its experience in selling commercial time for the 1988, 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics, predictions about the advertising market, inflation, income from its stations and the value the Olympics add to the network's cable holdings, CNBC and America's Talking.
"But in the end, you're piling assumptions upon assumptions," said Bob Wright, the president of NBC. "It's a definite risk. There are scenarios where we'd be in a loss situation with a negative advertising situation."
Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports, said NBC smartly removed the Olympics from the competitive bidding that has forced steep increases in sports rights fees. He added: "The effect on the bottom line is not the question. It's the promotional value, the coupling of the NBC and G.E. names with an event that has known nothing but success for the past decade."
Jack Welch, the G.E. chairman, enthusiastically supported NBC's bid, Mr. Wright said. "He doesn't do a lot of flinching," he said.
NBC is counting on major I.O.C. sponsors to buy commercial time, yet such purchases are rarely made a decade in advance, said Steve Grubbs, senior vice president of BBDO New York. However, he said the Olympics' importance to advertisers will grow "because of their uniqueness."
The I.O.C.-NBC relationship is very close, largely because of NBC's Olympic bankroll: from 1988 to 2008, it will total $4.7 billion. Mr. Pound lauded NBC for its "corporate and cultural" devotion to the Olympics. One long-term connection between the two entities is Alex Giladi, an NBC Sports vice president who also serves as Israel's member of the I.O.C.
"We've carved out a love affair with the I.O.C.," said Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. "In August, we got engaged. Now it seemed reasonable to get married and open up a joint checking account."
Yesterday's deal continues the fiscal policy the I.O.C. began with last August's two-Olympics deal with NBC: swap potentially larger bounties from future negotiations for the financial stability promised by NBC's money.
"It enables us to plan ahead more effectively," Mr. Pound said. "It provides certainty for organizing committees; they'll know in advance what they'll get."
The I.O.C. distributes money to the host cities' organizing committees, national Olympic committees and international athletic federations.
The I.O.C. also accepted the inflation adjustments that swell NBC's huge payments: the $793 million payment for 2004 was determined by adding four years of 3 percent inflation over NBC's $705 million fee for the rights to the Sydney Games; the $613 million payment for 2006 is a similar adjustment from NBC's $545 million Salt Lake City fee; the $894 million fee is adjusted similarly from $793 million.
"We were willing to trade on inflation for revenue sharing," Mr. Pound said.
But one industry executive familiar with Olympic television negotiations said: "The I.O.C. is mortgaging its future. They're going for the sure thing rather than ride the marketplace. Multiple network competition has been driving the marketplace, and there's no reason to think the competition will decrease."
The I.O.C.'s deal with NBC coincides with a change in how the I.O.C. distributes its television money to local organizing committees, such as the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
Each organizing committee now receives 60 percent of the fee. But starting in 2004, that distribution will be shaved to 49 percent, giving Mr. Samaranch more money to pass out to his constituencies, which cannot harm his chances for re-election if he decides to run in September 1997.

HEADLINE: Singing the Steelworker Blues;
A Mini-Mill Deal at LTV Leaves Union Feeling Jilted

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURG HEIGHTS, Ohio

 BODY:
For seven long years, the steelworkers here say, they stood by the LTV Corporation as it fought its way back from the brink of collapse. Thousands lost their jobs, and the survivors made numerous wage and benefit concessions to ease LTV's load.
Today, with the company prospering again, the workers say they are reaping the fruit of their collaboration: betrayal. 
 The source of their anger lies 600 miles away, in Decatur, Ala., the heart of right-to-work country, where unions have never gained a firm foothold. There, LTV is joining two foreign steel giants in building a $450 million mini-mill, a high-technology wonder that will be able to produce 2.2 million tons of sheet steel a year with only 300 workers.
The company says nonunion mini-mills -- which do not require hot blast furnaces and eliminate many of the costly and labor-intensive aspects of steelmaking -- are the wave of the future and its only hope for staying competitive in the global economy. But the local steelworkers' union, based in this Cleveland suburb, sees it differently. It says LTV never consulted the union about the investment and is purposely pursuing a policy that will eventually lead to the shutdown of its aging mills in Cleveland and East Chicago, Ind., which together still employ 8,500 workers.
Many of the union's members are furious at what they view as LTV's greed and ingratitude. "When they were in trouble, the company called us 'brother' and was glad to have our help," said George Lapp, a member of Local 1098 of the United Steelworkers of America. "Now they are trying to stab us in the back."
Whatever its outcome, the dispute has wider implications than just the future of LTV's work force. Management and labor, particularly in the steel and automobile industries, made hard-won strides toward collaboration that helped revive industrial productivity and competitiveness during the free fall of American manufacturing in the 1980's. If workers widely judge that path to have been fruitless, analysts say, it could add ammunition to those in the labor movement who are preaching a new militancy to reverse decades of membership decline.
In October, the 13-million-member A.F.L.-C.I.O. elected a new president, John J. Sweeney, who vowed to take a much more aggressive approach to promoting workers' interests than his predecessor, Lane Kirkland. Mr. Sweeney promised to "pour our resources into organizing at a pace and scale that is unprecedented."
The United Steelworkers, whose membership has plummeted to 140,000 from 380,000 in 1979, is likely to prove a receptive audience to Mr. Sweeney's message.
For the moment, there does not seem to be much the union can do about the mini-mill in Alabama, which is scheduled to open in 1997. Michael Scarver, a former local union president in Cleveland who is now on the national organization's staff, says workers are following a rule-book strategy to slow production and are staging noisy demonstrations in Cleveland and Alabama to alert steel buyers that labor relations in the older plants are poor.
But LTV, cheered on by the rest of the industry, is determined to move forward with its plans. David H. Hoag, chairman of the company, said the joint venture would enable the company to cope with foreign competition and the technology revolution that together have forced the restructuring of American industry during the last decade. "It is important that this company grow, and grow profitably," he said.
LTV holds a 50 percent stake in the mini-mill venture, called the Trico Steel Company L.L.C., while Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. of Japan and British Steel P.L.C. each own 25 percent.
LTV is the first large American steel company to switch to mini-mills from the old integrated plants that have been the norm since the turn of the century. And analysts leave no doubt that its strategic reasoning is sound.
"Not only are these new mills less capital intensive, but they have production cycles measured in hours, rather than days," said Michael F. Gambardella, a steel analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. "That makes them more flexible in meeting shifts in the market."
He added that other traditional steel companies in the United States would have to move in a similar direction if they wanted to remain competitive.
The new mill could have a formidable cost advantage. Based on its planned output and announced manning level, Trico should be able to produce steel with less than half a man-hour of labor per ton. Even the most efficient integrated mills require at least two man-hours per ton.
LTV says that overall wages and benefits will be roughly the same for its workers in Alabama but that the pay package will be more flexible, with a lot of pay tied to incentives related to production. But if both companies pay $35 a hour in pay and benefits, Trico would have a labor cost of $17 a ton, compared with about $70 for a traditional steelmaker like LTV. With a product that sells for about $300 a ton, that arithmetic provides a compelling argument in favor of mini-mills.
Union officials argue that the new mini-mills are crowding into a business with too much production capacity already, particularly during the industry's periodic downturns.
"Mini-mills represent 25 percent of the capacity for making steel in the United States," said George Becker, president of the steelmakers' union. "The new mills are being built to take business away from the integrated companies and shut them down." While the industry is thriving now, that could happen in the next big downturn, union officials say.
For Mr. Becker, the company's abandonment of its workers would be the worst sort of ingratitude. LTV spent nearly seven years operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, paring away nearly 60 percent of its work force before emerging from bankruptcy in June 1993. In 1986, LTV's workers agreed to a wage cut of $1.60 an hour from an average wage then of $12 an hour and gave up a week of vacation and other benefits. The cuts were rescinded starting in 1992 and the company says that subsequent profit sharing has made up more than half the lost income.
"LTV survived the 1980's with the help of the workers," Mr. Becker said. "If the union had not convinced workers to give concessions, the company would not be in existence today."
Mr. Scarver echoed his boss's bitterness. He contends that the company has reneged on a solemn compact. "We worked out partnership agreements with LTV," he said. "We were going to get away from adversarial relationships and move into the 1990's."
But the company says the labor leaders are misguided. "The decision to invest in Trico had nothing to do with the union," said Mr. Hoag, the chairman. He said the products made at Trico, at least initially, would be low-priced sheet steel, which has little overlap with the more highly processed coils from the Cleveland and Indiana plants.
LTV officials acknowledge that the union's work-to-rule campaign is souring the atmosphere at the two Midwestern plants, but maintain that the protest is having little impact on production. "The most troubling part is that local presidents are not working with us to improve the productivity of our facilities," said A. Cole Tremain, the company's vice president for industrial relations. "They will not even come to safety meetings, which is shortsighted."
Though they say they deplore the deterioration of labor relations, LTV executives are refusing to support the union's efforts to organize workers at the Alabama mill. "The union ought to compete and make an effort at organizing Trico," Mr. Hoag said. "Unions have to be competitive like everybody else."
For Mr. Becker and others in the steelworkers' union, that stance adds insult to injury. They say big corporations in general have grown sophisticated in thwarting organizing drives, especially by screening out workers with pro-union attitudes. And they fear that the traditional antipathy in the South to unions can only play into the hands of LTV's management.
"A company that is willing to spend enough money can bust up an organizing drive," Mr. Becker said.
Contrary to the union's contention, Trico will produce a form of sheet steel that will not directly compete -- at least initially -- with LTV's products. But it may nibble away at the edges of the only market left to the integrated producers: the high-quality sheet metal that goes into automobiles and appliances.
LTV is the first American integrated steel company to get into the mini-mill business, but it is not the first to recognize the advantages of the process. Dofasco Inc., an integrated producer in Canada, is one of the investors in Gallatin Steel Inc., a mini-mill that began making sheet steel in northern Kentucky early this year. And Broken Hill Proprietary, an Australian steelmaker, is a partner in a mini-mill being built near Toledo, Ohio, that is to go into operation late next year. In all, more than a dozen new sheet-making mini-mills are in operation or under construction in the United States.
According to Mr. Hoag, it was the threat from the new mills plus a desire to get on the technology bandwagon that drove LTV to form Trico, despite a personal appeal from Mr. Becker not to build the mill. Under the terms of the latest contract between LTV and the union, which was adopted in 1994, the union has the right to name a member to the board of directors and to address the board on important issues.
"Within the next 20 to 30 years steel will be made by entirely different methods," Mr. Hoag said. "We are in a transition away from the capital-intensive ways of the past."
These methods may include making steel in one step from treated iron ore rather than relying on the multiple steps needed now, and casting liquid steel into its final shape, eliminating the costly rolling mills currently in use.
LTV has longstanding links with Sumitomo, one of its partners in Trico. The company operates two electrogalvanizing mills in Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio, that use the Japanese company's technology.
British Steel already operates a mill in Alabama, Tuscaloosa Steel, and is planning to move two iron ore preparation mills from Scotland to the Mobile area. The output of those plants, which is called direct reduced iron, could be used in the electric furnaces of Trico.
The Trico project is being closely watched by steel industry executives, particularly those in the older mills where the union is strong. "If Dave Hoag can stand up to the union and pull this off," said the chief executive of another company, who requested anonymity, "the whole industry will be in his debt."

HEADLINE: Environment Fight Kills Plan For Bridge to Carolina Island

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 12

 BODY:
A South Carolina coastal development agency today refused to allow the construction of a private bridge to Sandy Island, one of only two remaining South Carolina islands that bridges do not link to the mainland.
The decision, by the state's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, was a victory for environmentalists and some residents, who had raised fears that the bridge would promote extensive development detrimental to the island. 
 The outcome followed a three-year effort by the owners of 7,000 acres of wooded land on the island to obtain a permit allowing them to build the bridge, which, the owners had said, would be used solely to transport timber harvested there to the mainland. But opponents had remained skeptical of that stated purpose, calling it a ruse that would lead to construction of houses, condominiums and golf courses on the island.
The egg-shaped, 9-by-12-mile Sandy Island is nestled in the delta of the Waccamaw and Great Pee Dee Rivers on the coast, along a strip between Myrtle Beach and Georgetown that is experiencing some of the state's most explosive growth.
The island is currently home to some 135 black residents who are largely the descendants of rice-plantation slaves and who now travel by boat between the island and the mainland. The two-lane, 750-foot-long bridge, across a narrow inlet, would have led to the island's northern part, site of undeveloped land owned by a group that includes Roger Milliken, a textile magnate, and E. Craig Wall Jr., a wealthy South Carolina timber man.
In denying the permit today, the coastal management agency said Sandy Island Associates, the company representing Mr. Milliken and Mr. Wall, had repeatedly refused to survey the entire island for the bridge's effect on colonies of red-cockaded woodpeckers, an endangered species, and to develop plans to protect the bird's habitats.
The landowners, who had insisted that law required them to assess environmental impact only in the area of the proposed bridge and its approaches, refused to provide any further information to the coastal management agency or to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, whose satisfaction the state had required before issuing a permit.
"Because of the applicants' continued refusal to survey for endangered species beyond the project site," the state agency said today, "the project remains inconsistent with the policies of the Coastal Zone Management Program."
Christopher Holmes, a lawyer for the landowners, said his clients had not decided whether to appeal the agency's decision to the courts. He said environmentalists had tried to defeat the project in hopes of buying the land "at bargain-basement prices" to create a wildlife preserve in the area.
Joe Carter, a former developer in the region who is now a supporter of establishing a wildlife preserve in the Waccamaw Neck area, which includes the island and some of the mainland, said Sandy Island would sell for about $2,000 an acre without the bridge but for as much as $10,000 with it and other infrastructure development.
Sandy Island lies amid some 500,000 acres of colonial-era rice plantations and virginal blackwater swamps called the Winyah Bay Focus Area, which Mr. Carter, a number of environmental groups and some Federal agencies would like to see protected from extensive development. Roger Banks, an official in the Charleston office of the Fish and Wildlife Service, is a supporter of the plan, and his office repeatedly found the Sandy Island application incomplete.
David Farren of the Southern Environmental Law Center, a lawyer who represented residents challenging the bridge proposal, applauded the denial of the permit. He said the plan to build a $2 million bridge to transport timber with a value of $1.5 million a harvest had been all a trick to pave the way for extensive development.
"The owners took a narrow view of the process and just wanted to look at the environmental impact of the bridge footings and approach ramps, while we always took the position that you had to look at the impact of it on the entire island," Mr. Farren said. "We're pleased the agency finally saw it our way and now the bridge is dead in the water."

HEADLINE: As Mill's Ruins Smolder, Massachusetts Dream Is Doused

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: METHUEN, Mass., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Ever since Aaron Feuerstein moved his grandfather's sweater manufacturing business here 40 years ago, the Malden Mills textile complex has been a symbol of hope and pride in the blue collar mill towns of the Merrimack Valley. It was the anchor of the economy of northeastern Massachusetts and turned out one of America's most profitable lines of winter wear.
But on Monday night, wind-driven flames from an explosion sent Mr. Feuerstein's dream up in smoke and flame, and left Methuen and dozens of other small towns in the area in a state of shock and despair, barely three weeks before Christmas. 
 The furious blaze not only injured 25 people, nine of them critically, but left more than 1,400 workers out of jobs indefinitely. Like mourners, officials from the offices of Gov. William F. Weld to United States Senators John Kerry and Edward M. Kennedy made the sad trip to Methuen today, to examine the smoking ruins, and pledged to do whatever they could to support those suddenly out of work.
Governor Weld declared the fire a state emergency and praised Mr. Feurerstein, the owner of the mill, as "a great American hero" for promising to rebuild the factory in Massachusetts.
The fire also left the clothing industry wondering how it would manage to satisfy next year's demand among clothiers for Malden Mills' most famous product, Polartec, the popular fabric used by companies like L. L. Bean and Patagonia to line ski jackets and make other winter wear.
In recent years, when other textile plant owners packed up and moved their operations to the south, Mr. Feuerstein and Malden Mills remained committed to Massachusetts, and his workers remained committed to him.
Like other textile factories, Malden Mills suffered its share of slumps, including a spell in bankruptcy, but it persevered and in the early 1980's, its research and development team came up with "polarfleece," and then Polartec, the advanced fabrics that became the rage among skiers, hikers, campers and others who needed light-weight, but very warm, clothing.
Business boomed, and with $425 million in annual sales and upwards of $65 million in annual payroll, Malden Mills became the mainstay of the local economy and an anchor of community redevelopment.
In Washington this afternoon, the state's two Senators organized a meeting that included Labor Secretary Robert E. Reich and Andrew Cuomo of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. They telephoned Mayor Dennis A. DiZoglio of Methuen.
Mayor DiZoglio said Mr. Reich had released $1 million in emergency aid for the unemployed workers. He said Mr. Reich had also assured him of support for waiving the two week waiting period for receiving unemployment benefits. Mayor DiZoglio said the officials also promised to look into extending unemployment benefits because of the extraordinary circumstances.
The fire started at about 8 P.M. Monday with an explosion near the boiler room in a century-old textile building used for flocking, the first of several steps to turn fibers and chemicals into fabric. Within moments, the building, which lies along the Spicket River at the northwest corner of the mill complex, was engulfed. The flames, fanned by fierce winds of up to 45 miles an hour, bore down on three other buildings that sit in a row.
Chief Ken Bourassa of the Methuen Fire Department said the explosion knocked out the factory's sophisticated sprinkler system. More than a hundred fire fighters came to assist from neighboring towns but they were largely powerless.
"It was just a blow torch with that west wind coming in," said Walter Bickford, Malden Mills' director of environment, health and safety.
Company officials estimated that 400 to 500 people were on the job when the fire broke out. Most of them escaped unharmed, some were treated locally and the most seriously injured were taken by helicopter to hospitals in Boston and Worcester.
The fire was brought under control by morning but continued to burn throughout today as shell-shocked workers wondered collectively how they would make mortgage and car payments, put food on the table and presents under the Christmas tree.
At a news conference with Governor Weld, Mr. Feurerstein, who who will turn 70 next week, said that long ago he decided not to move his company to the South or to Asia as many other textile mills had done.
Mr. Feurerstein said the business, which was founded 90 years ago by his grandfather Henry, "will do everything in its power to get back in operation as soon as possible."
He predicted that at least some operations could be running within two weeks.
An account for contributions was set up by the Methuen Co-operative Bank, and George Whyte, the president of Dakotah Inc., a company in Webster, S.D., that is one of Malden Mills biggest customers, immediately donated $30,000 donated from himself and his workers.
Spokeswomen for several producers of outerwear that use the synthetic fleece said it was too early to gauge the long-term impact of the blaze.
This season, supplies of garments are complete, but next year becomes uncertain.
The stock price of a competing textile company, the Dyersburg Corporation, rose sharply today. Shares in the Dyersburg., Tenn., concern climbed as much as 35 percent during trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops by 9.40 and Other Indexes Also Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A slide in technology stocks, combined with diminished hopes for an interest rate cut by the end of the year, kept stock prices in negative territory yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.40, to 5,174.92. Broad market indexes also fell. Eastman Kodak, Allied Signal, United Technologies and Union Carbide all fell a point or more. 
 "The Dow has been up over 450 points in the last six weeks," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "It came a long way in a short time, and now we are seeing a little correction. It's a pause to refresh."
Declining issues led advances by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 349.9 million shares as of 4 P.M., against 344 million on Monday.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 0.37, to 329.80, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 0.74, to 618.78, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.11, to 535.54.
Weakness in technology issues sent the Nasdaq composite index down 9.43, to 1,052.07.
A barrage of weak economic reports in recent months has led many investors to believe the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on Dec. 19, a move that would make stocks more attractive relative to fixed-return investments like bonds. Lower rates would also cut corporate financing costs and thus push earnings higher.
But a Labor Department report yesterday showing a higher-than-expected gain in wholesale prices for November raised fears about inflation and in turn dampened hopes that a rate cut would soon come.
While lower rates would spur economic growth, they could also aggravate inflationary pressures.
The inflation "numbers at first gave the market the jitters," said Arthur Hogan, head of equity trading at Dean Witter, Discover & Company in New York. "Then people started looking at the facts and figures behind the numbers, and it didn't seem as bad."
"But many people are wondering if the Fed has enough evidence to lower rates," he added.
In addition, investors will be watching the budget talks in Washington and the release of a number of United States economic reports as indicators of whether the Fed will ease rates.
Banks and brokerage firms, which are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations, were lower. Citicorp fell 2, to 65 3/4, Republic Bank of New York dropped 1, to 63 3/8, and Morgan Stanley fell 1/2, to 85.
The market also came under pressure from a decline in technology shares, following the Semiconductor Industry Association's report late Monday that demand for computer chips fell slightly in November but remained ahead of last year's levels.
The technology group was also hurt after Soundview Financial Group, which tracks high-technology issues, reportedly said that pricing of memory chips could be weakening.
Intel was down 1 1/4, to 62 1/4; Motorola dropped 1/2, to 61 1/2, and Texas Instruments fell 1 3/4, to 54 1/2.
Paper and forest product stocks tumbled after Georgia-Pacific, the nation's largest maker of building materials, said that fourth-quarter profits would not meet analysts' forecasts because of soft prices and weak demand for pulp and containerboard.

HEADLINE: Attacks Against Asian-Americans On the Rise, Especially in California

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12

 BODY:
He chose his course of action matter-of-factly, as if he were deciding which color shirt to wear. "I'm going to kill me a Chinaman," is how Robert Page put it in his written confession to the police.
A few hours later, as Eddy Wu carried a bag of groceries from a supermarket in Novato, Calif., to his car, Mr. Page attacked, leaving Mr. Wu, 23, with stab wounds to his back and shoulder, and a punctured lung. 
 "He was looking for a victim based on his white supremacist beliefs," Jim Laveroni, a police sergeant in the affluent suburb about 30 miles north of San Francisco, said at Mr. Page's court hearing last month.
The assault on Mr. Wu is the latest in a series of recent race-based incidents directed against Asian-Americans, particularly in northern California.
A study released in July by the National Asian Pacific-American Legal Consortium, an organization representing 40 groups, calculated that there was a 35 percent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes nationwide to 452 incidents last year, up from 335 incidents, in its audit for 1993. In Northern California, the increase more than doubled to 83 last year, from 39 the year before.
The State Attorney General's first hate-crimes report, which was released today, counts 57 hate crimes against Asian-Americans in the last six months of 1994, involving 72 victims.
The crimes, as reported to various Asian-American organizations and to the police, include racist-graffiti on the offices of the Japanese-American Citizens League in Sacramento, an attack on a Chinese-American family in a Vallejo, Calif., amusement park, where they were taunted and told to return to China, and the fire-bombing of the home of a Chinese city councilman in Sacramento. In a significant number of incidents, attackers say, "Go home," or "Get out of my country," the report said.
The attacks have largely baffled the police in places like Novato, whose middle- and upper-middle class community is widely regarded as liberal and tolerant. And, compared with the rest of California, it has a small Asian-American population -- not large enough, residents suggest, to pose a threat to anyone.
The incidents have heightened fears among many Asian-Americans that increasingly blatant race-based harassment is on the rise and that those who commit these crimes seem to hate Asians without drawing distinctions between newly arrived immigrants and native-born Americans, or between Chinese, Japanese, Cambodians and other Asian nationalities and ethnic groups.
"Like most minority groups, we're accustomed to dealing with subtle forms of racism," Thanh Ngo, a lawyer with the Asian Law Caucus in San Francisco said about the attack Mr. Wu. "But it's striking to see such a blatant act. A lot of people are very frightened."
Like many of the more recent crimes, the attack on Mr. Wu involved a young white man.
Still at issue is whether Mr. Page is competent to stand trial. A psychologist hired by the public defender's office told a judge last week that Mr. Page was seriously disturbed, and a hearing has been set in January to determine his competency. Meanwhile, Mr. Page, who is being held in the Marin County Jail, has been charged with attempted murder with bail set at $1 million.
In another incident in May, across the bay in Los Altos, John Lee, 28, an American of South Korean ancestry, stopped at a gas station. There he was approached by a white man, Justin Adams, who began taunting him by putting his hands together and bowing "Buddha-like," squinting his eyes and mimicking an Asian accent. According to police and court records, Mr. Lee confronted Mr. Adams and two other whites, saying his antics were not amusing. Mr. Adams then punched him several times, kicking Mr. Lee to the ground. One Mr. Adams's companion's kicked Mr. Lee in the head, and the third man punched Mr. Lee as he lay on the pavement.
The three men were later arrested. Two pleaded guilty to battery. Mr. Adams pleaded innocent to charges of committing a hate crime. The case, which went to trial in October, resulted in a hung jury. The local District Attorney's office has announced plans to try Mr. Adams again.
National Asian Pacific-American Legal Consortium said in its report: "Many incidents begin as simple name-calling and escalate into further violence resulting in serious or fatal injuries. Further, racist hate messages alone cause real psychological and emotional damage on their victims."
Elaine H. Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and chairwoman of the comparative ethnic studies department, said Asian-Americans have faced a distinctive type of racism in the last 100 years, a feeling on the part of the white population that "you can't be here."
"My mother came to Hawaii in 1903 as an infant, and she could not become a citizen until 1952," Professor Kim said. "I think it's always tied to resentment. If you don't make it, you get kicked down. And if you make it, you get kicked down. It's really a Catch 22."
What is particularly unnerving for many Asian-Americans, community groups say, is that success has not bred tolerance; they have assimilated into many communities but are still the objects of hate. Rather, their financial and educational achievements may have engendered a new generation of hate crimes directed at them disenfranchised whites who are jealous.
One factor that may be fueling the upsurge in hate crimes, especially in California, has been the unparalleled influx of Asian-American immigrants in recent years. In San Francisco County, for example, Asian-Americans are now the largest minority group, exceeding in numbers the black population and people of Hispanic descent combined. Data from the 1990 census show that the 337,118 white residents of the county constitute 46.6 percent of the population; Asians, whose numbers total 205,686, constituted 28.4 percent; Hispanics totaled 100,717, or 13.9 percent; blacks were 76,343 or 10.5 percent, and the rest were American Indians, Eskimo's and Pacific Islanders.
But even as Asian-Americans are integrated into their communities, changing the character of those communities, they are still considered to be interlopers by some, and thus legitimate candidates for harassment. The consortium complained in its report, for instance, that "in best-selling novels and blockbuster movies, Asian-Pacific-Americans continue to be cast as untrustworthy foreigners, devious economic competitors or martial arts experts."
Perhaps an even bigger factor inciting anti-Asian sentiment, experts say, is what many see as growing nativism and racial intolerance exemplified by Proposition 187, the immigration-control proposal that has become one of California's biggest political disputes.
Diane Chin, a lawyer and co-chairman of the Intergroup Clearinghouse in San Francisco, a nonprofit group that assists victims of hate crimes, said that with Governor Pete Wilson's promotion of Proposition 187, "There has been a climate created by the established political leadership that devalues people of color, and gays, lesbians and bisexuals; they've established a climate that allows hate violence to exist."
Michael Wong, the co-chairman of Break the Silence, a San Francisco-based group that documents hate crimes against Asians and provides assistance to victims, suggested that the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes is linked to the Congressional debate over welfare cuts. "At a time when public benefits are being curtailed, there's a lot of talk of not having enough space and resources to protect our communities," Mr. Wong said. "There's a lot of scapegoating and pitting populations against one another."

HEADLINE: Wave of Optimism Lifts Budget Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Their differences narrowed by a new economic forecast, negotiators from the White House and Congress expressed optimism today that they could avert another partial shutdown of the Government this weekend and eventually reach an overall budget agreement.
But today's sunny mood was not based on the slightest progress in resolving their policy differences. Both sides cautioned that they were by no means out of the woods. 
 The most conciliatory note in a day of much talk and little action came from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. After he and Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke with President Clinton on the telephone, Mr. Dole said he would agree to a one-week extension of the Government's temporary authority to spend money to give the budget negotiators breathing room.
Under the agreement last month that ended the six-day partial shutdown of the bureaucracy, the Government's spending authority will end at midnight Friday. Unless an extension is approved, the many departments and agencies whose appropriations have not yet become law will have to close down beginning this weekend except for essential services.
Senator Dole's position, however, may not be the determining one. Republicans in the House are taking a harder line. Representative John R. Kasich, chairman of the Budget Committee, suggested that Republicans would make considerable demands on the President in return for agreeing to a continuation of spending authority.
Mr. Kasich said Republicans would send the President on Friday a measure that would keep the Government open and be "consistent with our plan to balance the budget."
"The burden of whether the Government stays open is not on our shoulders," Mr. Kasich added. "It's on their shoulders."
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton still wanted an extension of spending authority until Jan. 26 but that he would take a shorter one if that was all he could get from Congress.
On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin is expected to tell the House that he plans to sidestep the national borrowing limit in January by giving the Civil Service Retirement Trust Fund an i.o.u. instead of $14.5 billion in Federal securities as an interest payment. Under the quirky accounting rules that govern the debt limit, that i.o.u. does not count against the $4.9 trillion debt ceiling.
That maneuver will give Mr. Rubin enough operating room to make it through January. But after that, his easy options for avoiding default will be largely exhausted, and he will have to find other strategies, and other Government-held funds, to keep paying the Government's bills. Treasury officials say they are still working to devise techniques that could withstand legal challenge from Republicans who hope to use the debt limit crisis to win on the budget.
The problem is that 6 of 13 bills to provide money for the operations of the Government in this fiscal year have not become law. Among them are measures to finance the Departments of Health and Human Services, Commerce, State, Veterans Affairs, Labor and Housing and Urban Development.
The Republicans who control Congress are insisting that these bills be considered in the overall budget negotiations along with the long-range budget legislation President Clinton vetoed last week. That measure is supposed to balance the budget in seven years while reducing taxes and limiting spending on Medicare, Medicaid and dozens of other benefit programs.
In some cases, the Republicans have not been able to agree among themselves on the spending bills. In other cases, they do not want to give Mr. Clinton the positive publicity he might get for vetoing measures that would cut spending for popular programs like those involving education and the environment.
Negotiators from the White House and Congress met for two hours this morning to review a new economic forecast released by the Congressional Budget Office on Monday.
The new projections narrow somewhat the difference between Congress and the White House over how much spending must be limited in order to balance the budget by 2002. Both sides said today that the new figures gave them hope that a deal could be struck.
As usual, the negotiators met today in a closed room. But as has become their practice, they trooped to a bank of television cameras afterward and offered their assessments.
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said he was encouraged by the new economic projections and believed "we made some progress today."
Mr. Kasich was also upbeat. He and Senator Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said the Republicans would work on a new proposal taking the new economic figures into consideration.
"There are additional resources now on the table," Mr. Kasich said. "They afford us the opportunity to improve our product."
But both sides acknowledged that big differences remained and that little progress had been made in settling them.
Mr. Panetta, for example, said President Clinton was dead-set against the Republican plan to let the states set the eligibility standards and benefit levels for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor.
And Mr. Domenici said, "We're still fairly far apart."
Later, in an interview, Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, one of the Democratic negotiators, said nothing happened today to justify optimism. "We have not begun any negotiations," he said. "If this were a trip, we'd still be at the starting line."
While the official negotiations are under way, according to Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a group of about 15 moderate senators from both parties have been meeting regularly to see whether they can find a way to split the differences between their more ideological colleagues.
Even if the negotiators can ultimately reach a budget agreement among themselves, there is no guarantee it will become law.
One reason is that a filibuster in the Senate is now possible. Normally, under the rules, budget legislation cannot be filibustered. That means that measures can be passed in the Senate by a simple majority.
But parliamentarians say that the bill to which the no-filibuster rule applied is now dead because of the Presidential veto and that any new budget measure is subject to a filibuster that would take 60 votes to overcome.
A compromise could also be blocked in the House if the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats vote against it on the ground that their principles were being abridged. That is what happened in 1990 to the first compromise on the budget struck by President George Bush and the leaders of the Democrats who then controlled Congress.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Jump but Quirk Is Seen in Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
In a report that proved more startling than worrisome, Government figures showed today that wholesale prices jumped five-tenths of 1 percent in November, the heftiest increase since January.
The advance, which was about twice as much as expected, initially jolted the bond market because it seemed likely to dim prospects that an inflation-conscious Federal Reserve would ratify a cut in short-term interest rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday. 
 But closer study largely reassured economists and traders. The price surge was heavily concentrated in new cars and trucks, the new models of which, to the consternation of Government statisticians, were placed on sale a month later than usual this year. Moreover, analysts suggested, automotive sales have been so sluggish that rebates and other incentives are likely to erode posted prices significantly.
"The jump in producer prices does not indicate that inflation is suddenly coming back as a major problem," said Lynn Reaser, senior vice president and chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
In addition to the aberration in motor vehicles, she pointed to no change in the price of goods at the intermediate stage of production and to a second straight sizable decline in raw materials other than food and energy.
Nonetheless, Ms. Reaser added, today's report could raise doubts among Fed officials inclined to press for a December rate cut, especially if it is followed this week by reports of brisk retail sales for November and a burst in prices at the consumer level.
Ried, Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm, told clients that "arguments for and against a modest easing at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting are still balanced."
Separately, the National Association of Purchasing Management said in its semiannual economic forecast that members expected prices they pay for goods to rise a scant five-tenths of 1 percent during 1996, far under the 3.1 percent projected for 1995.
In the new year, 59 percent of the group's members predict an average increase of 3.2 percent, with the tobacco, textiles, primary metals, leather and printing and publishing industries experiencing the largest. The 29 percent of members expecting lower prices predict a 4.5 percent decline.
Over all, the purchasing managers project slower growth in 1996, with company revenues up 4.8 percent in current dollars compared with a 7.4 percent rise this year.
The Labor Department's report today of a November increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods reflected a 1.2 percent surge in food prices as well as bursts of 1.6 percent for light trucks and 1.3 percent for passenger cars.
Fresh eggs soared 22.6 percent while increases also accelerated for processed fruits and vegetables and roasted coffee, the report showed.
Finished energy goods declined five-tenths of 1 percent as gasoline fell 3.8 percent, its sixth straight decline, to offset an upturn for home heating oil and an acceleration for residential electric power.
The so-called core Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, typically the most volatile components, rose four-tenths of 1 percent last month, also the highest since January, the report showed.
Among intermediate goods, such as a bolt of cloth, prices were unchanged over all, with plywood and other durable items used in manufacturing down six-tenths of 1 percent and basic organic chemicals and other nondurables down nine-tenths of 1 percent.
As for crude goods, or raw materials, there was a jump of 1.6 percent over all but this was heavily concentrated in food and energy. Without these categories, crude materials tumbled 2.1 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline. Wastepaper plunged nearly 25 percent after a 32 percent dive in October.
"If the economy remains sluggish into 1996, consumers and businesses may do again what they've done consistently for the past three years -- refuse to pay significantly higher prices for goods," Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, declared. The finished-goods Producer Price Index gauges what the group's members pay the producers from whom they buy.
Still another report today, from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, showed its index of industrial activity declined further last month, to minus 13.1, with the prices received and prices paid indexes among the several declines.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Higher as Traders Foresee a Rate Cut in Germany

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday as traders speculated that slowing German economic growth would lead the Bundesbank to cut interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow.
The German Government said last week that the economy expanded 1.9 percent in the year that ended on Sept. 30, down from 2.5 percent in the year that ended on June 30. And the Bundesbank, the German central bank, reported yesterday that inflation in western Germany fell to an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the six months that ended in November, from 1.6 percent in the period that ended in October. 
 "Anticipation of a German discount rate cut is supporting the dollar," said Charles Spence, director of currency sales at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.
Lower interest rates hurt a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it less attractive.
The dollar was quoted at 1.4475 marks, up from 1.4443 marks on Monday in New York. It also rose against the Japanese yen, moving to 101.76 yen, up from 101.09 yen on Monday. The British pound slipped to $1.5330 from $1.5345 in New York.
There was talk in the market that the dollar was aided against the yen by dollar purchases from Caltex Petroleum, Mr. Spence said. The company, an oil refiner partly owned by Texaco Inc., last week said that it had agreed to sell its half-interest in a Japanese oil-refinery venture to its partner, the Nippon Oil Company of Tokyo, for 200 billion yen. Caltex officials were not available yesterday to comment on the speculation.
The dollar had dipped early yesterday after the Government reported that producer prices rose an unexpectedly high five-tenths of 1 percent in November. That gain was the biggest since January and exceeded economists' average forecast of a rise of two-tenths of 1 percent.
"It's a big surprise and may bring jitters into the market for the dollar," said Karl Halligan, a trader at CIC Bank New York. "We could get stagflation, and that is the worst thing you could have."
Stagflation refers to slow economic growth combined with high inflation. The economy grew at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the third quarter; analysts say that the rate this quarter has decelerated to a level between 2 and 3 percent.
Still, the economy is growing enough to keep the dollar rising, especially given the economic weakness in Europe, said Bob Gruber, senior currency salesman at Chemical Bank.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Shrank Over Summer

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit, which climbed to worrisome levels in the spring, shrank in the summer as American businesses were able to sell more overseas and Americans bought fewer foreign goods.
The Commerce Department reported today that the deficit in the nation's current account narrowed to $39.48 billion in the July-September quarter. 
 That was an 8.7 percent improvement from the April-June period, when the deficit had surged to $43.27 billion.
The current account is the broadest measure of America's trading performance, measuring trade in merchandise, services, investment flows and a category that includes America's foreign aid payments. Analysts were encouraged by the report, which reflected trends already evident in the Government's less-inclusive monthly trade reports.
Through the first nine months of the year, the current account is running at an annual rate of $162 billion, close to the worst deficit of $167.1 billion set in 1987.
But analysts said most of that deterioration reflected the severe economic problems of Mexico, an important export market. Many said they believed the second quarter represented the low point for the trade gap. Because the economy has slowed, demand is dropping for imported products.
Bruce Steinberg, economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, said he believed the trade deficit would continue to shrink at least through 1998.
"Exports have been growing a lot faster in the United States in recent years than in many other industrialized countries," Mr. Steinberg said. "That goes back to the rising competitiveness of U.S. companies and the leading roles they are playing in many technology industries."
The deficit in merchandise trade in the third quarter shrank by $5.37 billion, to $43.43 billion, as exports climbed by 1.7 percent, reflecting gains in sales of both manufactured goods and farm products.
America's surplus in services, including tourism and consulting fees, climbed to $15.9 billion in the third quarter, up by $545 million from the second quarter.
While merchandise trade and services contributed to an improvement in the overall deficit, the other two categories showed higher deficits in the summer.
The difference between what Americans earn on their overseas investments and what foreigners earn on their American holdings rose to $4.2 billion in the third quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the second. And America's deficit on unilateral transfers, the category that includes foreign aid, climbed to $7.8 billion in the third quarter from $7.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Kareem Brunner's Lesson

 BODY:
Kareem Brunner, a black security guard at Freddy's clothing store in Harlem, died last Friday with six co-workers in a fire set by a lone gunman who was apparently deranged by his hatred for white businesses on 125th Street. But Mr. Brunner still speaks. In an affidavit describing harassment by protesters picketing the store, he tells of being called a "cracker lover" and a "traitor" to his race.
The Freddy's affidavits describe a poisonous atmosphere, in which protesters shrieked about "bloodsucking Jews" and threatened to burn the store. Yet until the disaster, few people outside of 125th Street knew about the protests. Aides to local politicians contended that the demonstrations were so small they scarcely noticed them. "The only thing that came to us was a landlord-tenant dispute," said Representative Charles Rangel. 
 The protests were apparently not too small to inspire Roland Smith, a former street vendor, to shoot four men and set Freddy's on fire, killing himself along with seven workers. If this grim event teaches us nothing else, it should serve as another reminder that words of racial hate often lead to deeds of racial violence. Rantings that would incite only the deranged cannot be ignored, because the deranged live among us.
The outrage at Freddy's occurred at a time of encouraging economic signs in Harlem. But at the same time, racial tension has been climbing. The weakest entrepreneurs -- the sidewalk vendors -- were all black, and they had been swept away. Small black-owned businesses like Sikhulu Shange's Record Shack were being pressured out by rising rents. In their place came larger, better capitalized, mainly white and Asian businesses.
Every political leader or street cop in Harlem knew this story, and should have been aware that serious problems would arise. Community activists who wanted to protest the eviction of black business owners had a responsibility not to let their legitimate complaints turn into a racial vendetta against non-black merchants. Yet almost all of them targeted the white-owned clothing store as the culprit in the Record Shack's eviction, ignoring the fact that the building's owner, a black church, was the more important player.
Harlem politicians held a press conference yesterday to say that they would stage a show of support this weekend for Bargain World, another white-owned store on 125th Street that has been the target of protesters. The community leaders also pointed out, rightly, that the hatemongers were few in number and often "outsiders" who do not live in Harlem. The excuse of "outsiders" is irrelevant, however, if the community itself does not shun the troublemakers when they arrive. Harlem must make hate unwelcome, echoing the words of the Democratic leader Cedric McClester, who promised yesterday that he would "not let that happen again. I will speak up, no matter how unpopular it might make me for the moment."
Leaders of the Police Department made it clear yesterday that they had been discouraged by the owner of Freddy's from making arrests at the picket line. The police might not have been able to stop the crime with the utmost vigilance, since it occurred when the protesters were absent. But the police also did not reach out to any other city agency to warn them of problems on 125th Street. When protesters staged a similar demonstration in 1990 against a Korean fruit stand in Brooklyn, Mayor David Dinkins sent several agencies into the neighborhood to do community outreach. The demonstrations dragged on forever, permanently damaging Mr. Dinkins's reputation for leadership. But they did not result in any violence.
A grand jury will begin hearing evidence in the Freddy's case. If there was illegal behavior by protesters, it will be up to the police and the District Attorney's office to identify them. The rest of us will be left to contemplate Kareem Brunner's story, and find ways to avoid a repetition.

HEADLINE: Have Schools Failed? Revisionists Use Army of Statistics to Argue No

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
Though conventional wisdom holds that the nation's educational system is in persistent, debilitating decline, a dissident chorus has of late been making an intriguing but unfashionable argument: Maybe American schools are not so bad after all.
Almost no one contends that American schools, particularly poor urban and rural ones, do not need improvement. Few doubt that the worst of those schools are a disaster. 
 But, in an escalating debate clouded by a blizzard of conflicting statistics and the currents of politics, a vocal core of scholars and educational revisionists has created a stir by arguing that there has been no broad decline in American education and that the notion that schools are failing miserably has as much to do with politics as reality.
Finally, they say, the undeniable and alarming failings that do exist in some schools are less the fault of incompetent educators or lax standards than of underinvestment in education and of broad social ills like poverty and urban decline.
At issue is not just the argument over the quality of schools, but also the steps needed to improve them at a time when rising concern about education is colliding with budget pressures to cut spending on it.
On the one side are those who argue that the notion of a broad crisis in American education was overblown from the start and has unfairly undermined confidence in that education. The attacks on education, these critics say, are part of a conservative effort to pave the way for vouchers for private schools or other conservative education policies.
"There's a marvelous indoor sport of attacking the schools that goes back to the turn of the century," said Bruce J. Biddle, director of the Center for Research in Social Behavior at the University of Missouri and co-author with David C. Berliner of "The Manufactured Crisis -- Myths, Fraud and the Attack on America's Public Schools (Addison Wesley, 1995).
"People have consistently said how rotten the schools are, and somehow we've built the atomic bomb, we've gone to the moon, we've become the dominant power in the world. It's utterly mind boggling what we've done despite the fact that we've had such rotten schools. And the reason is the schools were never rotten to start with."
Those on the other side say the alarms sounded most conspicuously in the Department of Education's 1983 report, "A Nation At Risk," were on target and that the country would ignore them at its peril. The report called American education "an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament imperiling the nation's economic health."
"Ever since 'A Nation at Risk,' " said Chester Finn, a fellow at the Hudson Institute research group and a former official in the Reagan Education Department, "there's been this little band of wishful thinkers and revisionists who've denied there's been a problem and who have been enormously popular within the education profession because of that denial. They get lots of prizes and speaking engagements from educators, but everyone else ignores them completely."
Revisionists argue that for more than half a century critics of the schools have harkened to a mythical golden age of learning.
Gerald Bracey, a psychologist and former director of research and development with the Virginia Department of Education, likes to point to one of the critics' examples of how little American students know, a report that found that "a large majority of students showed they had virtually no knowledge of elementary aspects of American history."
But, Mr. Bracey said, the report was based on a test of college freshmen conducted in 1943 by the history department of Columbia University.
A similar assertion that American schools were failing was made in the early 1950's, the revisionists note, and peaked in the aftermath of the Soviet Union's launching of the Sputnik satellite in 1957.
Mr. Bracey and others point to statistics that bolster their case. For instance, they make these points:
*Scores on seven of the nine trends in the widely respected National Assessment of Educational Progress in reading, mathematics and science are at all-time highs.
*The proportion of students scoring above 650 on the Scholastic Achievement Test mathematics test is at an all-time high, even before the scores were adjusted upward last spring. Much of the decline in scores registered in the 1960's and early 1970's has reversed.
*The number of students taking Advanced Placement tests, a measure of course difficulty, has risen to 448,000 in 1994 from 98,000 in 1978.
*American 9-year-olds had the second-highest average score among 31 nations in a 1992 international comparison of reading, conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, a research group.
The revisionists agree that S.A.T. scores declined markedly in the 1960's and early 1970's -- central to the case against the schools -- but they say that was mostly due to a rapid expansion of the pool of students taking the test as a college education went to a broad-based phenomenon from an elite one.
Similarly, they note that the reported decline of American education has come at a time when the percentage of Americans who graduate from high school has risen to 82 percent in 1993 from 34 percent in 1950, meaning that a much broader array of Americans are being educated than ever before.
Those who defend "A Nation at Risk" and the attendant sense of crisis say the point is not whether Americans are doing better. It is whether they are doing well enough.
"If you say the schools are doing as well as they were 20 years ago, so what?" asked Diane Ravitch, a senior research fellow at New York University and a former Assistant Secretary of Education.
"The world has changed in 20 years, and the schools 20 years ago were considered to be in a state of crisis. We have very serious problems in our schools, and it's a tremendous misrepresentation to say that our students are out-achieving their parents. They're not."
Ms. Ravitch and others marshal their own statistics:
*S.A.T. verbal scores fell from a high of 478 in 1963 to the low 420's by the late 1970's and stood at 423 in 1994. In 1972, 116,585 students, or 11.4 percent of test takers, scored above 600 on the verbal test. In 1994, only 79,606 or 7.6 percent did.
*A series of international assessments in math and science showed American students performing poorly, seldom rising above the median, and often scoring near the bottom.
*American students have shown dismal results on recent national tests in geography and history. On the National Assessment of Educational Progress history test, for example, 57 percent of 12th graders were unable to reach even the "basic" level of achievement.
In fact, given the multiplicity of tests and the enormous variety of the United States' decentralized and wildly disparate schools, there is truth in both arguments.
Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley said that the direst view of education decline ignored the remarkable shifts in the 1960's in which educational opportunity expanded as schools integrated and rates of graduation rose. In that sense, Mr. Riley said, the notion of a precipitous drop in standards and achievement is unfair and inaccurate.
But the Secretary also said the alarms of the "nation at risk" report reflected a changing society in which the blue-collar jobs of the past were disappearing and the schools were not adequately training students for new ones.
"Whether there was as much of a crisis as some said or not," Mr. Riley said, "I don't think was as important as what the needs of the nation were. What we needed was to notch up education, increase standards."
He said American students had increased by one full grade on national tests in math and science since the 1983 report, although they still fared poorly on most international comparisons.
The worst failing of the "nation at risk" report, some critics said, was that it wildly overstated both the nature of the problem and the schools' impact on the nation's economic health.
Lawrence Cremin, an educational historian at Columbia, has said that the nation's economic competitiveness rests overwhelmingly on decisions about monetary, trade and industrial policy. Blaming economic decline on the schools, Mr. Cremin contends, is "at best a foolish and, at worst, a crass effort" to distract attention from those most in control.
Some defenders of the nation's schools also cite a recent study showing that the vast majority of the increased spending on schools has come in special education. That, they say, is a powerful refutation of the argument that the nation has thrown money at its schools with little to show for it.
The revisionists' idea of a right-wing effort to discredit schools is less compelling, most experts in education say. "If you think that Clinton and Bush and the National Governors' Association and Al Shanker put their heads together and conspired to concoct a crisis," Ms. Ravitch said, "then I have a bridge I want to sell you."
And many of the same experts say nothing would be worse for the country's schools than a sense of complacency, which they contend the revisionist argument could engender.
"What you're hearing is an argument not to reform," said Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform, a private research group. "The 'nation at risk' report was a wake-up call that change within the system would not work unless you start holding kids accountable, holding schools accountable, holding educators accountable and putting consequences there for people who don't succeed."
Still, with the fixation on test scores and economic productivity, some skeptics wonder whether the real purpose of education is still being lost by both sides.
"What's going to hold this nation together isn't the G.N.P. or cyberspace and computers," said Richard Gibboney, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "It's really the democratic quality of our society.
"We should be talking about the cultivation of intelligence, but as soon as I say that half the people listening would fall asleep. Basically, our society has the schools it wants, ones that credential, certify, grade and sort people. But we're still tapping a small percentage of the brain power and emotional power that kids have. We're still boring them to death."

HEADLINE: Who's Queen of the Met? Her Fans Know Who

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
On Monday morning at the Metropolitan Opera, a tour group of students walked through the Dress Circle promenade, looking at costumed mannequins in display cases and listening to a guide tell stories of the company's glorious past.
Yet at that moment, living history was standing just one flight below. For the first time in almost 20 years, Renata Tebaldi, one of opera's near-legendary sopranos, was back in America, back at the company that was her primary artistic home during the height of her career. 
 Some of the students peered down over the railing, wondering who that lady was on the Grand Tier staircase posing for a photographer. For Miss Tebaldi, now 73, it was a very emotional experience, as she later explained.
"As soon as I walked in," she recalled, "I said to myself, 'This is my theater!' For many years I was 'la regina' here. The queen. It was sad. But I know how to dominate my feelings."
Few people who know about the matter would contest that during Miss Tebaldi's years at the Met -- from 1955, when she made her debut as Desdemona in "Otello," with Mario Del Monaco in the lead and Leonard Warren as Iago, until 1973, when she sang her final Met performances in the same opera, with a still-green 29-year-old maestro named James Levine on the podium -- she was indeed "la regina."
As a singer, Miss Tebaldi was thought to have had it all. Her solid musicianship was built on years of studying the piano in her youth. (Her mother did not want her to be a singer, Miss Tebaldi said: "She thought the theater was a place of perdition!") Miss Tebaldi also had stylistic understanding, temperament and one of the most lustrously beautiful lirico spinto voices ever. Her acting, though not demonstrative, was effective. "What made her performances so moving," Mr. Levine said recently, "was the generous presence that she exuded. As Desdemona, she honestly projected that character's innocence and tenderness."
What brings Miss Tebaldi here is the release of a biography by Carlamaria Casanova, published by Baskerville Press, and a week of attendant events organized by the Metropolitan Opera Guild. Yesterday afternoon some 1,200 people showed up at the Met's gift shop, where Miss Tebaldi signed copies of the book and her many recordings on the London label. At one point, the line stretched out the Met, across the plaza and up Broadway to the 66th Street subway station.
There will be two more autograph sessions: tomorrow from 2 until 4 P.M., at HMV Records on Fifth Avenue at 46th Street; and on Saturday from 3 until 5 P.M., at Barnes & Noble in Lincoln Square. Yesterday she received a proclamation from that longtime Tebaldi fan at City Hall, Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani. Tomorrow she will attend the Met's production of "Un Ballo in Maschera." But she is saving quiet time to see some old friends, Carol Burnett and Van Cliburn. And on Friday she will meet students and faculty at Juilliard.
It's a busy week and the weather is bitter cold, but Miss Tebaldi is in radiant good health and enjoying it all. Over coffee at the offices of the Metropolitan Opera Guild the other day, she reflected on her life since retirement, on her new book and on the state of singing today.
In recent years Miss Tebaldi has been living quietly in Milan, tending to her home, seeing friends and listening to her own records, something she could never bear to do during her active career. "I cry when I hear the records," she said. "Now I understand what happened during my performances. I feel the same thing. Not because I know I am Renata Tebaldi, but because I can be objective."
As for the new book, even from its title, "Tebaldi: The Voice of an Angel," one gathers that it is not exactly a hard-hitting analysis. "Renata loved dogs and wanted one of her own," begins one section. In a question-and-answer chapter, Miss Tebaldi fields such questions as, "From an economic standpoint, should a singer have a manager?"
Yet the book includes a valuable list of her complete performances, a discography, a generous selection of photographs and a CD offering some rare early performances (for example, a 1949 performance of the "Jewel Song" from "Faust," sung in Italian, with scintillating coloratura.)
Unlike many similarly puffy biographies, this one provides some revealing accounts of matters Miss Tebaldi has seldom discussed in public: her near-fatal bout with polio as a child; her father, who abandoned the family and showed up only after his wife had died, a stranger seeking reconciliation with his now famous daughter; and a frank account of her affair with the inconstant Arturo Basile, an opera conductor whose workaday career briefly prospered because of Miss Tebaldi's loyalty.
Her long success, she feels, was due to her ability to draw limits, an ability she says today's singers lack.
"They want to sing everything right away!" she said. "One night they sing 'La Sonnambula.' The next they pretend to sing 'Aida.' This is impossible. You must move step by step, and never sing roles unsuited to your voice."
Another self-imposed limitation that she does not regret is remaining single. "I was in love many times," she said, laughing at the memories. "This is very good for a woman. You have to test everything. But how could I have been a wife, a mother, and a singer? Who takes care of the piccolini when you go around the world? Your children would not call you Mama, but Renata. This I could not do. I could not sing if my mind was in another place."
The book recounts the rivalry, stoked for years by the opera press, between Miss Tebaldi and Maria Callas, a singer who was the "first one to make this mistake of thinking that everything is possible." But in person Miss Tebaldi grew wistful remembering their last meeting.
It was 1968. Miss Tebaldi had just finished a performance of "Adriana Lecouvreur" at the Met. Rudolf Bing asked if she would greet an old friend. Into the dressing room walked a teary Maria Callas, whose singing career was basically over even though she was one year younger. This was just after Callas had suffered the humiliation of being rejected by Aristotle Onassis, who wanted to marry Jacqueline Kennedy.
"It was very sad," Miss Tebaldi said. "We embraced. Maria said I must come see her in Paris. After her career was over, she was very sad and very gentle with me. But I never saw her again."
Knowing when to stop was critical to Miss Tebaldi's great legacy. She was just 54 when she gave her last performance in New York, a recital at Carnegie Hall in February 1976. "Did you hear my last concert?" she asked, expectantly. "It is now on CD. It is wonderful. They had to cut the applause, there was so much."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
NBC's Triple Play Bolsters the I.O.C. and Its Chief

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
NBC's $2.3 billion shopping spree yesterday has lent financial certainty to the International Olympic Committee for a dozen years and given additional political security to the committee's 75-year-old president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, should he decide to run for re-election in 1997.
Since assuming the presidency in 1980, Samaranch has worked vigorously to rid the modern Olympics of any vestige of amateurism, from participants to marketing. College stars are out in basketball and ice hockey, professionals are in. Corporations pay $40 million each to become worldwide sponsors of the Winter and Summer Games. 
 Samaranch has drawn criticism for the ills of greed, corruption and doping that tarnish the Olympic luster. But he can also point to the undeniable success of economic strength in the private sector at a time when governments are increasingly unwilling or unable to write a blank check to be host for the Winter and Summer Games. The Olympics have no host cities for the 2004, 2006 and 2008 Games, yet they have guaranteed television money from the movement's financial power, the United States.
"This provides a tremendous vote of confidence in the strength and future of the Olympic movement," Michael Payne, the I.O.C.'s marketing director, said in a telephone interview from Lausanne, Switzerland. "In 1980, most commentators questioned whether the Olympic movement could survive, whether it was too big, too political and had no mechanism to finance it to the end of the century. Fifteen years later, we have a classic turnaround."
Under a worldwide marketing program that involves all 197 Olympic committees, Samaranch has made the Olympic rings "the most widely recognized symbol outside of a religion," said John Krimsky, the chief fund-raiser for the United States Olympic Committee. And with a view toward the financial horizon, Samaranch has turned the bidding for television rights from a quadrennial auction to a long-term package deal.
Cities bidding on the 2004, 2006, and 2008 Games will know exactly what is available from their largest single source of income -- American television. And Samaranch knows there will be more money for the I.O.C. to spread around to various international sports federations and Olympic committees that it nourishes. A point worth noting: beginning in 2004, host cities will receive only 49 percent of the international television money, instead of the current 60 percent.
With his political support shored up by yesterday's announcement, Samaranch, the former Spanish ambassador to the Soviet Union, now seems certain to run for a fourth term in 1997. Last summer, he maneuvered to have the mandatory retirement age for I.O.C. membership raised from 75 to 80 and has become the most formidable figure in Olympic circles since the late Avery Brundage, who served as I.O.C. president from 1952 to 1972 and resisted opening the competition to professionals.
"He's staying," one prominent Olympic official who asked to remain anonymous said of Samaranch. "If there was any confusion, this should clear it up."
Samaranch's unfulfilled ambition is a Nobel Peace Prize. His supporters have campaigned as if he were running for office. If he can bring the Olympics to Africa for the first time, or open up China to the world through the Summer Games, his chances of a Peace Prize would markedly increase, his supporters say.
"He has believed for some time the Olympic movement deserves it," said Anita DeFrantz, one of two I.O.C. members from the United States.
Beijing has until Jan. 10 to bid on the 2004 Summer Games. Samaranch has said that he does not expect a bid from China, which lost narrowly to Sydney, Australia, as host of the 2000 Summer Games. The 2004 Games will be awarded in September of 1997. This will be a sensitive time for China, as it gains control of Hong Kong from Britain and is sure to face increased scrutiny over human-rights issues. Beijing may be reluctant to bid and lose again, I.O.C. officials said. But perhaps NBC's guarantee of $793 million will prove too alluring to ignore.
Absent Beijing, Cape Town has been considered the leading contender. But South Africa's need to rebuild society may prove more urgent than the need to build sports facilities, I.O.C. officials said, delaying that nation's chances until 2008. That may leave Rome, host of the 1960 Summer Games, as a leading contender for 2004 in a field that includes: Buenos Aires; Istanbul, Turkey; Rio de Janeiro; Seville, Spain; St. Petersburg, Russia, and, perhaps, San Juan, P.R., Stockholm and Lille, France.
"If you're NBC, Rome has the history, architecture, European boulevards and ambiance that Americans loved about Barcelona," one Olympic official said.
NBC will have no say in determining Olympic sites, said Dick Pound of Canada, the I.O.C. member who negotiates television rights in North America.
"I think today will end being neutral in the selection process," Pound said. "The event is at a point where it surpasses the location."

HEADLINE: Yale Teaching Assistants Vote for a Grade Strike

BYLINE: By DAVIDSON GOLDIN 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Dec. 10

 BODY:
An organization of Yale's graduate teaching assistants has voted not to submit grades for this term, raising the possibility that some undergraduates will not receive grades on time and that some seniors might have incomplete transcripts with their graduate school applications.
Yale officials stressed that they would not tolerate a grade strike, and did not rule out the possibility of seeking to expel teaching assistants who withhold grades. 
 The group, the Graduate Employees Students Organization, has been seeking to become a labor union for graduate students in the humanities and social sciences since 1990. It wants higher teaching stipends, lower health care costs, smaller class sections and their own grievance procedure for complaints against the university. Graduate students normally receive stipends of $4,970 for each semester of undergraduate teaching, and 90 percent of them receive fellowships for full Yale tuition.
As at most large research universities, graduate students at Yale teach and grade undergraduates in almost every discipline. While professors handle most smaller courses, generally known as seminars, graduate students have the main responsibility for teaching discussion sections and grading students enrolled in large lecture courses. In some cases, graduate students teach their own courses.
Because of heavy workloads, the organization said, graduate students spend 25 hours a week on teaching, rather than the 17 1/2 hours the stipend was intended to compensate. "Yale has grown to depend on us for a lot of work," said Thomas Thurston, a Ph.D. candidate in American Studies from Albuquerque, N.M., "and that's where we're in a position of strength."
But Yale has been firm in refusing to negotiate. "The graduate school provides fellowships and stipends, and the students are supposed to grade and teach," said Jonas Zdanys, associate dean of the graduate school. "We don't intend to compensate every single nickel and dime of their cost of living."
It was not clear this week how many students would be affected by a grade strike. Classes ended last week, and final examinations begin Friday.
Professors and administrators said they would do all they could to make sure students received grades. Students said that in some classes, professors had asked them to complete forms listing their grades from earlier tests and papers.
The graduate group is seeking to formally represent Yale's 1,500 graduate students in the humanities and social sciences, 389 of whom are teaching assistants this semester. The organization has threatened a full strike next semester, and leaders of the two unions representing Yale's 3,600 clerical, maintenance and technical workers said they expected to honor any picket line set up by the group. A strike by those unions in 1984 virtually shut the campus down for 10 weeks.
On campus here this week, there seemed to be little support for the grade strike.
"I find it unfortunate, lamentable and completely inappropriate," said Mary Miller, the chairwoman of the art history department. "These graduate students have a responsibility to the undergraduates, and teaching is part of their training as future faculty."
Ms. Miller said that graduate students from her department who participated in the grade strike would probably not be hired again as teaching assistants.
A dozen students studying for final exams in Cross Campus Library were unanimously unsympathetic to the planned grade strike.
"A lot of people sacrifice a great deal to come to Yale, whether it's financially or the amount of work they do," said Darin Johnson, a junior from Neighborville, Ill., who is majoring in political science and economics. "It seems unfair that after all these efforts, that you may not be able to get grades at the end of the semester."

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports A Rebound In Retail Sales

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Retail sales rebounded last month, the Government reported yesterday, but analysts said consumers remained anxious and they continued to predict a brutally competitive Christmas for retailers.
According to the Commerce Department's early estimates, retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, more than expected, to a seasonally adjusted $197.9 billion. 
 But the impact of the increase, the largest monthly gain since June, for the most part was offset by downward revisions for the previous two months. October's figure was revised to four-tenths of 1 percent, and September's to one-tenth of 1 percent.
Given those revisions, and the volatility inherent in the initial data, analysts warned that the size of the increase reported yesterday might ultimately be pared.
"I am very hesitant to cheer," said Susan Herring, a senior economist at Salomon Brothers. "Looking at the average of the past three months, retail sales are slowing, from more than a 4 percent rate of growth in the third quarter to less than 2 percent now. But at this stage of the business cycle, I don't think people should be shocked if consumers adopt a more conservative posture."
Most analysts had projected that the report would show that retail sales rose by six-tenths of 1 percent, and initially the stronger-than-expected figure was not well received in financial markets. But the stock market shrugged off the numbers and the Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record high of 5,216.47, up 41.55 points. Bond prices were down only slightly for the day.
While Wall Street analysts were skeptical, representatives of the nation's retailers said the figures were a hopeful sign for the critically important holiday shopping season.
"We are encouraged," said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, a trade association.
The spending statistics are "an indication the consumer is beginning to get into the holiday spirit," Ms. Mullin added. "We think consumers are shopping a little later in the season, and that that trend is continuing."
Thus far, however, analysts said December sales had been disappointing.
"Holiday sales have been weak," said Robert Buchanan, senior retailing analyst at NatWest Securities. "And absent a further round of discounting, which we very well may see, they are likely to remain that way."
Among individual categories, colder weather and aggressive discounting helped to bolster apparel sales, which rose by 2.8 percent in November. But analysts said the gain did not signal a revival.
"Apparel sales went up because everything is being sold at distressed levels," said Sandra Shaber, a senior vice president at the WEFA Group, economic forecasters in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "This is not the start of a new trend."
Elsewhere, the Commerce Department said that car sales rose four-tenths of 1 percent in November after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in October. Excluding autos, retail sales climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent, after a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in October.
Economists are not expecting big things from consumers because in addition to high debt levels, growth in the labor force is slowing and anxiety about potential layoffs remains.
"Consumers are tapped out; they have borrowed as much as they can," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence Inc. "Credit is not going to be a source of growth in terms of spending power."
Mr. Yardeni, who figures the odds on a recession at about 1 in 3, said policy makers at the Federal Reserve Board should not view yesterday's figures as an excuse for not cutting interest rates next week.
It may take bigger rate cuts than might otherwise be seen as prudent or necessary to induce consumers, including baby-boomers, to start spending again, Mr. Buchanan of NatWest Securities said.
"Consumer debt is a problem, but it has been a problem for some time," he said. "What is new now is that the boomers have many more commitments than they once had, and don't have a lot left over to spend on an extra sweater. Because of the changing demographics, I think it will take a lot deeper rate cuts to get things moving than it has in the past."
Ms. Herring at Salomon Brothers said, "We have been counting on some moderation in consumption, based on the notion that the level of interest rates to consumers is still a little on the high side." Loans based on bank prime rates are still high, he said, "and relief on auto loans is still quite small."

The dollar also drew some support from a stronger-than-expected report on retail sales, which could discourage the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates. 
 "We have a lot going on in the background of this market, but many of the issues have not come to a head yet," said David Solin of Foreign Exchange Analytics in New York. "Many people are taking cautious positions just in case."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4500 marks, up from 1.4475 marks on Tuesday.
The British rate cut had little effect on the pound, which ended the day unchanged at $1.5327.
And the dollar dipped to 101.68 Japanese yen from 101.76 yen.
Lower American interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated holdings less attractive to investors, but lower rates outside the United States are likely to make assets denominated in dollars more appealing.
The Bank of England, in lowering its lending rate to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent, led some traders to believe that the German central bank would ease rates at its meeting today. "The rate cut in England was in line with the general expectations that there will be rate cuts around Europe," said Steve Flanagan, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York. "And the next cut to come will probably be Germany."
The prospects for an American interest-rate cut next week dimmed today as the Commerce Department said retail sales rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, higher than analysts' estimates. The report followed a report on Tuesday that wholesale prices rose an unexpected five-tenths of 1 percent last month, stirring inflation worries.
With both reports in hand and the Federal budget debate continuing in Washington, Mr. Flanagan said that "U.S. rates may stay put" when the Fed's policy-making committee gathers next Tuesday.
Russian elections and a European Union meeting to discuss the single currency, both occurring this weekend, also kept some traders on the sidelines. "We have several big events to deal with in upcoming days," Mr. Flanagan said. "Each of them could have their own impact on this market. Some people are just watching their moves with these things in mind."

Bonds Decline After a Surge In Retail Sales

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices retreated yesterday after the Government reported an unexpected surge in November retail sales.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond dropped 14/32 of a point, or $4.38 for $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.07 percent from 6.05 percent. 
 Bond prices tumbled immediately after the Labor Department reported a jump of eight-tenths of a percent in sales at retail stores for November. But the market recovered somewhat after a closer look showed the retail industry was not as strong as figures seemed to show.
The Government revised downward initial estimates of retail sales for the two previous months -- to declines of four-tenths of a percent in October and one-tenth of a percent in September.
"The relative strength in November's numbers was offset by the downward revision to both September and October," said Anthony Karydakis, senior financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets.
Still, bond prices resumed drifting lower in a lightly traded market that was increasingly uncertain if Federal Reserve policy makers would cut interest rates at their meeting next Tuesday.
Until recently, a rate cut seemed quite likely. But mixed reports on the strength of the economy and uncertainty over budget negotiations between President Clinton and Congress could prompt the Fed to wait on any rate cut, analysts said.
Of particular concern to investors was the cumulative impact of recent economic news. The report on November retail sales came one day after the Labor Department reported that producer prices shot up an unexpectedly sharp five-tenths of a percent in November as food and motor-vehicle prices soared.
Today, the Government will report on consumer prices in November, and investors are concerned that further hints of inflation combined with signs of economic strength will discourage the Fed from cutting rates at this time.
Uncertainty over Washington budget bargaining has kept bond market trading quiet in recent days, as negotiators struggle to avert a partial shutdown of the government.
Also, many investors are hesitant to stake out new market positions before the end of the year.
Elsewhere in the market, prices of short-term Treasury securities dropped 1/32 point and intermediate maturities ranged from 3/32 point to 1/8 point lower, Dow Jones Telerate Inc., a financial information service, reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, dropped 1.67 point, to 1,285.85.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.26 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills rose two basis points, to 5.20 percent. The discount rate on one-year bills rose one basis point, to 5.06 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 12017/32 , down 3/16 from late Tuesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.70 percent, up from 5.68 percent.

Planned Cutback at Refinery Lifts Unleaded Gasoline Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Prices for unleaded gasoline jumped yesterday after the Tosco Corporation said that it expected to cut output by 20 percent at the 190,000-barrel-a-day refinery it planned to buy from British Petroleum P.L.C.
On other markets, soybeans and coffee rose. The Commodity Research Bureau index gained 0.68 point, to 244.65. 
 Tosco's move to cut production at the refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., was part of a plan to raise the refinery's profit, and would leave 130 of the plant's 525 workers without jobs.
Negotiations with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International union are deadlocked over the issue, and B.P. said it would shut down the refinery on Jan. 1, when it transfers ownership to Tosco, if the two sides do not reach an agreement.
Even a temporary closing could upset the market, with inventories close to their lowest in 24 years. Gasoline stockpiles in the United States are now 17.7 million barrels, or 7.6 percent, below a year ago, the American Petroleum Institute said.
Unleaded gasoline for January delivery soared 1.97 cents a gallon, to 57.55 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. January crude oil prices rose 27 cents, to $19 a barrel, the highest price since June 14.
Heating oil prices gained after the Colonial Pipeline Company said it had halted new shipments of heating oil from Texas to the Eastern United States because of high demand.
January heating oil rose 0.88 cent, to 57.69 cents a gallon, the highest price since March 25, 1993.
Soybean prices rose, extending a two-week rally on concern a drought in Brazil would lower output there, the world's second-largest grower of the crop after the United States.
The market "just isn't going to go down until it rains" in Brazil, said Joel Karlin, vice president of commodities at Everen Securities Inc. in Chicago. "We're talking about a good 10 million tons that are in jeopardy," the equivalent of 17 percent of the entire United States harvest.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A lot of money spent on nuclear arms was wasted, a study shows.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
NUCLEAR deterrence has worked for a half century: no atomic weapon has been detonated in anger since 1945. But did America get its money's worth from 70,000 warheads, 67,000 missiles, 4,000 bombers, 59 strategic missile submarines and 1,041 test explosions, plus the equipment to keep track of enemy nuclear arms and to prevent accidental war?
The Central Intelligence Agency's disclosure last week that KGB disinformation had led Washington to overestimate the Soviet threat implies that not every last penny was well spent. And a preliminary report by the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Project, excerpted in the fall 1995 Brookings Review, goes further. A close look at the quarter of all defense outlays that has gone into nuclear weapons suggests that a good portion was wasted. 
 In the early 1950's, The Bomb was seen as the way to get more bang for a buck. "If we mass- produce this weapon," Senator Brien McMahon, chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, said at the time, "the cost of a single atomic bomb will become less than the cost of a single tank."
As nuclear weapons got cheaper and tanks came to resemble props from the "Star Wars" movies, Senator McMahon's prediction almost came true: a mere $5 million buys a hefty warhead these days. But the Senator and just about everyone else at the time underestimated how many bombs the armed forces would want. In 1957 the Army alone asked for 151,000. And while the military settled for less, the total bill for warheads has reached $375 billion. (This and other figures are in 1995 dollars.)
More important, they underestimated how much more expensive the razor would prove than the blade. Since World War II, America has spent $200 billion on strategic bombers. An additional $371 billion went into 50 varieties of nuclear missiles, including 3,160 ICBM's and 2,975 strategic sea-launched missiles. Missile-carrying submarines came to a bit less than $100 billion. Adding most of the cost of the vast "dual purpose" aircraft and ship fleet to the nuclear column brings the total above $2 trillion.
Controlling these weapons and defending against nuclear attack probably cost another trillion. Command, control and communications ran to $182 billion. Strategic air defense and antimissile systems -- remember the DEW line? -- cost a bit more than $400 billion. Spy satellites clock in at $270 billion, while other intelligence-gathering came to $230 billion.
The study estimates that the cost of retiring obsolete nuclear weapons and coping with nuclear waste will ultimately add $400 billion to the total. Throw in weapons security, antisatellite projects, civil defense and antisubmarine warfare, and pretty soon you are looking at real money -- $4 trillion to be inexact.
The emphasis is on "inexact." Critics of the study could no doubt identify a trillion dollars or so of questionable allocations -- for example, investments in intelligence and dual-purpose weapons delivery that serve nonnuclear as well as nuclear defense.
But the largest error in the nuclear accounting probably goes the other way: the failure to count the full "opportunity cost" of resources committed decades ago. A billion dollars diverted to nuclear weapons in, say, 1970, would have doubled if it had been invested in assets with a real economic return of 3 percent. "We went out of our way to be conservative," said William Weida of Colorado College, the project's economist.
The accounting itself is striking. It does not, however, go to the heart of the matter -- the portion that was wasted.
With hindsight, it is clear that dozens of weapons programs -- among them, the antiballistic missile defense, the B-70 bomber, the nuclear-powered bomber, the nuclear depth charge -- were nonstarters. And it is likely that even the most useful nuclear weapons cost too much to build for the same reasons the Pentagon pays too much for toilet seats and canned ravioli.
But by far the largest questionable sums went into awesome redundancy of bombs and delivery capacity. In part, "overkill" was part of a plausible strategy for deterring a Soviet first strike. But most of it was committed on the questionable assumption that a nuclear weapon would be needed to vaporize every Soviet cow pasture that could serve as an emergency landing strip.
"In 1985, there were 16,000 designated targets," said Bruce Blair, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Minuteman launching officer. "Sixty were pointed at Moscow alone."
Why, to this day, is there no serious debate over how many nukes are enough? Everyone claims expertise on welfare reform, trade policy and Medicare, but defense policy is seen as, well, rocket science. "Government is too big, government is irresponsible," said Stephen Schwartz, a guest scholar at Brookings and the author of the preliminary report. "But with defense you can never spend enough."

British Trim Key Interest Rate; Germany's Bank Meets Today

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
With economic growth apparently weakening and inflation restrained, Britain lowered its official lending rate today to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent.
The reduction in the Bank of England's minimum lending rate to commercial banks came a day before policy makers at Germany's central bank are to meet and six days before the rate-setting committee of the United States Federal Reserve gather. Like their British counterparts, they will consider whether to ease credit at a time when statistics indicate that their economies are losing steam and inflation is under control. 
 Today was the first time in 22 months that Britain lowered interest rates. The Bank of England, this country's central bank, had raised rates three times since February 1994, from 5.25 percent, in an effort to keep inflation in check while the economy grew.
Even if the central banks of Germany and the United States do not reduce their own lending rates over the next week, economists said they would almost certainly do so in the next month or two.
"All these decisions are linked by the simple fact that the world economy has slowed down," said Michael O'Hanlon, an economist with Kidder, Peabody in London. "On both sides of the Atlantic, the impact of fiscal restraint is a major issue. If you don't have much fiscal flexibility, the only way to relieve economic pressures is monetary policy."
The British economy grew 4.1 percent last year and is estimated by the NatWest Group to be growing at a 2.4 percent rate this year. Inflation is running at 3.4 percent and is projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 1996.
In addition to the economic arguments for a cut, the Conservative Government of Prime Minister John Major was under intense political pressure to reduce rates. The Conservatives badly trail the opposition Labor Party in the polls, and are counting on a healthy economy with low interest rates and low inflation to swing voter sentiment in their favor before the next election, which could be called in the next year and must take place within 18 months.
In Britain, unlike the United States and Germany, monetary policy is controlled by the Government. Today's decision to cut the lending rate was made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke. The governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, supported the quarter-point reduction.
The central bank here does have influence, its role that of a monitoring and advisory agency. Mr. Clarke and Mr. George clashed earlier in the year, when Mr. George recommended raising rates again to choke off inflation and Mr. Clarke refused to do so.
The interest-rate cut today, which was matched by reductions in the minimum lending rates of commercial banks, had been widely anticipated in the financial markets, although most economists expected a bigger reduction -- of half a percentage point. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 issues closed with a gain of 7.50 points, at 3,662.40. The pound, which the Bank of England feared might fall sharply if lending rates were cut half a point or more, rose slightly with the reduction kept to a quarter-point.
The decision to keep the rate cut small suggested that British policy makers maintained at least some doubt about just how much the economy had slowed and about the outlook for inflation. The Government reported today that the unemployment rate fell slightly in November, to 8 percent from 8.1 percent in October, the lowest level in four and a half years. Other recent statistics, including retail sales, also suggested that the economy was not weakening as quickly as some believed.
"I was satisfied that one-quarter percent was right in all the circumstances," Mr. Clarke said.
In Germany, the Bundesbank has been gradually lowering the securities-repurchase rate, the chief money market rate. Although it did not push that down further today, it did inject more cash into the money markets than had been expected.
This step added to some speculation in the financial markets that the bank's policy-making council would reduce official interest rates when it meets on Thursday. But others predicted that the Bundesbank would put off a rate cut until January.
The discount rate, which sets a floor under German money market rates and effectively dictates interest-rate levels elsewhere on the Continent, stands at 3.5 percent. The Lombard rate, the ceiling on money market rates, is 5.5 percent.
Because interest-rate cuts in a country tend to weaken that country's currency, any easing by the Germans on Thursday may help the French franc, which traded today at its lowest level against the German mark in a week. The franc has been badly hurt by nationwide strikes by French public workers and concern that Prime Minister Alain Juppe would bow to union demands to abandon the proposed changes in social-service and pension payments that set off the strikes.
In the United States, the Federal Reserve's key committee is to meet next Tuesday amid speculation that it, too, will reduce interest rates. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent in November, more than expected. Although the size of the increase was viewed as an aberration, some analysts said it could increase doubts among some at the Fed who had been inclined to press for a rate cut next week.

HEADLINE: Stocks at Record Again, With Dow Rising 41.55

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks reached another record high yesterday as computer-driven buy programs lifted prices ahead of Friday's triple expiration of options and futures contracts.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.55 points, to 5,216.47, topping a record close of 5,199.15 set last Wednesday. Two broader indexes also rose to new highs. 
 "The gains are concentrated in the big-name stocks, and that typically is somewhat symbolic of program trading," said Don Hays, the director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher Singer, Inc. in Richmond. "The broad market is just barely up. It's not a wonderful day, unless you're in the big blue-chip stocks."
Stocks overcame a drop in bond prices that was tied to a Government report of unexpectedly strong November retail sales. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32 and the yield rose to 6.07 percent from 6.05 percent.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancers led decliners by 3 to 2. Volume was moderately heavy at 415.3 million shares, up from 349.9 million Tuesday.
Blue-chip stocks are often volatile ahead of the quarterly "triple witching" expiration of stock options, stock index options and stock index futures, which often prompts investors to buy or sell the entire Dow index.
The Dow industrials were led higher by Boeing, up 2 1/8, to 76 1/2; AT&T, up 1 7/8, to 68 1/8; Allied Signal, up 1 3/4, to 49 1/2; Merck, up 1 7/8, to 65 1/8, and Philip Morris, up 2 1/4, to 91 7/8.
Investors were anticipating an end to a two-month-old strike at Boeing.
The Big Board's composite index and the Standard & Poor's 500 composite both rose to record levels, with the New York Stock Exchange index up 1.37, to 331.17, and the S.& P. up 2.91, to 621.69.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.47, to 1,056.54. The American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 3.32, to 538.86.
Stocks floundered early in the session, after the Commerce Department said retail sales rose eighttenths of 1 percent in November. Analysts had expected a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent.
The report followed Tuesday's news that wholesale prices rose an uncomfortably high five-tenths of 1 percent last month. Both reports stirred investors' fears that the economy may be growing too fast to justify an interest-rate cut next week by the Federal Reserve.
Bonds sank sharply on the retail sales report, recovered most of their losses but then dipped again.
But stocks recovered and kept going, amid aggressive buying of big-company and blue-chip names.
Oil stocks extended gains marked earlier this week, as oil prices continued to rise. A Dow industrials component, Exxon, rose 1 3/8, to 85 7/8; Chevron added 5/8, to 53 3/8, and Texaco gained 1, to 80 1/8.
Despite the rise in oil prices, airline stocks made strong gains, pushing the Dow transportation average up 13.76 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,084.54. The gains were led by airline freight companies. Federal Express, was up 1 3/8, to 81 5/8, and Airborne Freight rose 1 1/4, to 29. Federal Express said after the market closed that its second-quarter profit rose to $1.57 a share from $1.53 a year ago.
In addition, the overall sentiment on airline stocks has been quite strong because of high margins, good demand and strength from restructurings, said Leon Brand, global markets strategist at NatWest Securities.
Computer-related stocks were mixed. On the Big Board, I.B.M. fell 7/8, to 94 1/2; Hewlett-Packard dropped 2 3/8, to 80 3/4, and Seagate Technology lost 1 7/8, to 51 1/4.
But Micron Technology gained 1/2, to 53 5/8, in heavy volume of 5.8 million shares, even after a lawsuit was filed contending that Fidelity Investments improperly touted the stock even as it was selling it this fall.

HEADLINE: VERDICT IN BEIJING: THE OVERVIEW;
Beijing Sends a Strong Warning With Long Sentence for Dissenter

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 13

 BODY:
By convicting Wei Jingsheng in a closed trial today of "conspiring to subvert the Government" and sentencing him to 14 years in prison, China again silenced the most powerful pro-democracy voice in the country and sent a strong warning about the limits of dissent.
Mr. Wei, 45, a onetime electrician at the Beijing Zoo who helped father China's democracy movement in 1978, was also denied his political rights for three years beyond the prison term. The harsh sentence drew expressions of anger and indignation from members of Mr. Wei's family, human rights organizations and governments around the world. 
 [The Clinton Administration criticized China but stopped short of threatening specific retaliatory action. But some members of Congress warned that Mr. Wei's imprisonment could lead to renewal of the linkage that Washington once made between trade privileges for Beijing and its rights record. Page A20.]
The verdict comes at a time when China's Communist Party leadership has reached a peak of sensitivity and defensiveness in foreign and domestic affairs, in part related to a struggle for pre-eminence among potential successors to Deng Xiaoping, China's 91-year-old paramount leader, who is in extremely frail health.
Over the last 12 months, Beijing has taken increasingly belligerent or intransigent positions on a range of issues from human rights and trade negotiations, to religious freedom in Tibet and political developments in Hong Kong and Taiwan. In the case of Taiwan, China has threatened more explicitly to go to war to recover its estranged province than at any time in decades.
The judgment against Mr. Wei sends a powerful signal to a nation in the midst of an economic revolution that any public talk of political revolution, democratic reforms and democracy can be considered seditious.
To many in China, these constraints are not as burdensome as they seem to many foreigners. Free speech, even criticism to senior leaders, is tolerated as long as it is private. Millions of Chinese crave stability and are not interested in the politics of confrontation that marked the democracy movements of the 1980's.
Outside of intellectual circles, Mr. Wei may be less a symbol and more a curiosity, but the Communist leadership fears that his attack on Communist rule and passion for democracy could take hold among the millions of disaffected Chinese who are not taking part equally in the fruits of China's economic boom.
Thus, Mr. Wei is the largest and most obvious target for this new Government crackdown.
His mordant style first drew public attention and outraged some party leaders when he scrawled it on a poster and hung it on a stretch of wall in Western Beijing that came to be known as Democracy Wall. Mr. Deng was among the first to feel his barb in 1979, and Mr. Deng is believed to have ordered Mr. Wei jailed and Democracy Wall torn down.
After serving 14 1/2 years of an initial 15-year sentence, Mr. Wei emerged in September 1993 with the same fearlessness to take on Mr. Deng again, as well as his potential successors.
"The present leaders were the most outspoken group of men, shouting their support of human rights and democracy before they ascended to power," he wrote in an essay on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in November 1993. "But their subsequent dictatorship made clear that they have no intention of making good on the promises they once made to the masses."
In April 1994, after a number of run-ins with the authorities, Mr. Wei was rearrested.
With the dispatch of Mr. Wei back to a prison cell, where he has spent all but six months of the last 16 years, China's security services have now jailed or placed under close control all of the prominent pro-democracy leaders who remain from the Democracy Wall or Tiananmen periods.
Wang Dan, a student leader of the pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, whom the Bush Administration invested great effort to free, has been held without charge since May. So has the writer Liu Xiaobo.
Chen Zeming, one of the so-called "black hands" behind the Tiananmen uprising, was released in May 1994 as a special concession to President Clinton, but Mr. Chen, who is suffering from cancer, was abruptly jailed again last June. Another student leader who was released last summer, Liu Gang, lives as a virtual prisoner in his home in Liaoning Province.
In Beijing today, many democracy campaigners awoke on the day of Mr. Wei's trial to find themselves under house arrest.
At a courthouse swept by the first snow of winter here, Mr. Wei made an appearance at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court and spoke on his own behalf during the six-hour trial. Although Mr. Wei was represented by a respected private attorney, Zhang Sizhi, and was allowed to present his defense, the verdict was preordained by the Communist Party leadership, Chinese and Western experts say.
"Wei was defended by a lawyer hired by Wei's relatives, and was allowed to represent himself fully," a Government statement said tonight. "After debate between the opposing lawyers, Wei made his closing statement."
Under today's ruling, Mr. Wei would not be able to publish another essay about democracy in China, criticize the Communist Party regime or speak to a foreign reporter until the year 2012, assuming that he survives another long prison term.
No record of today's proceedings at the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court was made public, but tonight, China's Government-run central television and press agency issued a statement that was extraordinary in its acknowledgment that Mr. Wei was engaged in nothing more sinister than publishing and fund-raising activities in support of China's democracy movement.
"The court's investigation showed that Wei, in attempting to overthrow the Government, developed a plan of action," the Government statement said, "which included establishing an organization to raise funds to support democratic movement activities, purchasing newspapers, setting up a company in charge of organizing cultural activities, and organizing non-governmental painting exhibitions, performances and publications with the aim of setting up a propaganda and liaison base, attempting to raise a storm powerful enough to shake up the present Government."
The Government statement made no assertion that Mr. Wei had formed a group, or written a charter or manifesto with the stated aim of toppling the Communist Party or overthrowing the Chinese Government. Moreover, there was no assertion that Mr. Wei advocated violence or any activity beyond publishing and cultural performances in support of democratic reforms in China.
"The trial and sentence are an outrage, and a clear effort by Beijing to subvert the rule of law," Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
Outside the courthouse, several dozen foreign reporters and photographers gathered in hopes of witnessing the proceedings, or at least recording the coming and going of the unidentified few Chinese who were allowed to witness it. But Public Security officers kept foreign journalists more than 100 feet away from the gate of the courthouse.
Some members of Mr. Wei's family were allowed to attend the trial, but their telephones were not working afterward.
Two of Mr. Wei's personal friends who came to the courthouse despite earlier warnings by the police to stay away were arrested after they mingled with journalists and expressed their concern for Mr. Wei's fate.
"As Wei's friends, we are concerned about him," Jin Cheng said. "I think all dissidents are deeply concerned about the trial. If Wei is convicted, we don't know what's going to happen to us."
Mr. Jin chatted as plainclothes policemen, who later arrested him, stood close by seeking to overhear or record his comments to reporters.
"What is more important," he continued, "is that Wei is the symbol of China's democracy movement and we are concerned about the fate of the movement."
Reached in Washington, one of Mr. Wei's sisters also expressed her alarm over the verdict.
"This verdict shows how shameful the Chinese Government is," said Wei Shanshan, who is lobbying for White House and Congressional support on her brother's behalf.
"The only thing he did was speak out his thoughts, and this is not a violation of the Chinese Constitution," she said, adding, "he hasn't formed any anti-Government organizations or engaged in any anti-Government activities."

HEADLINE: With Iraq's O.K., a U.S. Team Seeks War Pilot's Body

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A Pentagon team is on a secret mission to Iraq, searching the desert for the remains of the first American pilot downed in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
The mission, undertaken with the approval of President Saddam Hussein, represents a small but potentially significant step in Iraq's attempts to end its deep isolation. Since the end of the gulf war, Iraq has been an international pariah, subjected to strict economic sanctions. 
 Though the mission is under the leadership of the International Committee of the Red Cross, it represents the first official visit of American military officers to Iraq since the war's end. American military and diplomatic officials acknowledged that the Iraqi Government had made a humanitarian gesture by allowing 11 American military officers to join 4 Red Cross officials on the search.
The search began this week in a remote section of western Iraq, where a Navy FA-18 fighter-bomber crashed on the first night of the gulf war nearly five years ago. The pilot, Lieut. Comdr. Michael Scott Speicher, 33, was the first American combat casualty of the war. He left a wife and two infant children.
Commander Speicher took off from the aircraft carrier Saratoga in the Red Sea on the night of Jan. 16, 1991, flying northeast toward Baghdad. Shortly after he entered Iraqi airspace, his plane disintegrated in midair. Navy intelligence officers were never sure why. They later concluded that he either had a freak midair collision with an Iraqi MIG-25 or that the enemy plane shot him out of the sky.
He crashed in a wasteland, far from civilization. Though Commander Speicher's status was changed from missing in action to killed in action in 1991, he remains the only American pilot downed in the war whose body has not been recovered.
In the fall of 1994, an American spy satellite photographed the crash site. Intelligence officials conveyed the images to the P.O.W./M.I.A. office at the Defense Department. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Pentagon officials then approached the Red Cross, which has an office in Baghdad, and sought its help.
"This whole mission is a humanitarian effort," said Frederick C. Smith, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security affairs. "The reason we undertook this was our commitment to determine the fate of all missing U.S. service members lost in conflict."
The Red Cross notified Iraq's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and on March 1 the Iraqi Government approved the request that a Red Cross team with Pentagon personnel be allowed to search the site. After months of haggling over details of the mission, final approval came last month. Defense Department officials said they believed the request was personally approved by President Hussein.
American officials offered a very slight tip of the hat to Iraq today.
A State Department official called Iraq's decision "a positive humanitarian gesture." But he added: "They did the right thing, but they did it for reasons of self-interest. If they think it's the first building block in a grand edifice of better relations, they need to think again."
Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat who helped win the release of two Americans held prisoner in Iraq in July, said he had been discussing the mission with Iraqi officials since then. "Now, hopefully, they will start dealing more aggressively with other issues, such as the nuclear issue and human-rights concerns," he said.
Iraq's efforts to build weapons of mass destruction remain a sticking point with the United States and the United Nations.
With the go-ahead from Iraq in hand, 11 military officers gathered last week at the Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii to prepare for the trip. The team, led by a forensic anthropologist, has conducted several expeditions in Southeast Asia to identify the remains of American servicemen missing in the Vietnam War. Using technologies including DNA identification techniques, high-gauge magnification instruments and computerized dental X-rays, such teams have identified missing servicemen using no more than a fragment of bone or tooth.
The team flew to Amman, Jordan, last weekend and crossed the border into Iraq, traversing the Amman-Baghdad highway and turning off into the desert toward the site, whose exact location remains a secret. They located the site through the Global Positioning System, a constellation of satellites that tells users precisely where they are on an electronic map of the world.
The team made camp and began staking out the site, spreading out in a radius of a mile and a half from the point of impact. Commander Speicher's jet was traveling at several hundred miles an hour when it crashed, and thousands of pieces of debris from the crash are scattered through the desert. Like archeologists on a dig, the searchers are sifting through the ground, looking for shards of metal and bone.
They are expected back in Amman on Friday. Pentagon officials said they were awaiting word on whether the mission was a success.
Commander Speicher lived in Jacksonville, Fla., where he grew up, went to high school and later taught Sunday school, near a base that is home to hundreds of Navy fliers.

HEADLINE: Saudi With Key Role in War Calls for End to Iraqi Sanctions

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A senior member of the Saudi royal family who played a leading role in the war against Iraq in 1991 called today for ending sanctions on the country because, he said, they have only reinforced President Saddam Hussein's hold on power while starving the Iraqi people.
The criticism of the sanctions and a call for alternatives came from Prince Khalid bin Sultan, a nephew of King Fahd and son of Saudi Arabia's Defense Minister. 
 "The sanctions have not achieved their aim and we must look for another way," Prince Khalid said in Cairo after meeting with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who has also indicated his desire for a review of the sanctions with the goal of ending them.
"I am not against ending the sanctions on Iraq, but they are based on United Nations conventions and resolutions."
The world "intervened to save and feed the people of Somalia," Prince Khalid continued, "so why don't we think of something to save the Iraqi people?"
His comments were made against a backdrop of growing debate among Arab nations about the direction of relations with President Hussein nearly five years after the Persian Gulf war.
Calls for an end to the sanctions were made two months ago by the leaders of two other countries that were staunch allies of the United States in confronting Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990: Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar.
Prince Khalid made similar comments this year when he published his memoirs of the gulf war, in which he served as joint commander with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, with principal responsibility for supporting the allied troops based in Saudi Arabia.
Calls for revising the sanctions or establishing a schedule for ending them have also come from Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia
Within the gulf region, only Kuwait, with some lukewarm support from Saudi Arabia, argues that sanctions must continue against Iraq until it fulfills all United Nations resolutions.
The stand is widely seen as a desire to use sanctions as a method of bringing down the Iraqi Government -- a position shared by the United States.
Despite Washington's repeated efforts to scotch any talk of lifting sanctions on Iraq, the issue has resurfaced time and again in the last six months as a majority of Arab countries appear to be leaning toward an end to them.
In the past, Prince Khalid's statements were dismissed as a solitary and maverick position, influenced by his irritation at being removed from decision making after the gulf war by King Fahd, who essentially pushed the prince to retire instead of putting him in command of the Saudi Army.
But they also do reflect, according to well-informed Saudi officials, a view that is shared within the Saudi ruling establishment by a growing number of princes.
Their fear is that the miseries reportedly inflicted on the Iraqi people by the sanctions are now building up hatred of the gulf countries among Iraqis that could come back to haunt Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S RATINGS OVER 50% IN POLL AS G.O.P. DECLINES

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
President Clinton has emerged from the Federal budget standoff with his highest public ratings in nearly two years, while House Republicans, particularly Speaker Newt Gingrich, have lost much of the good will they enjoyed after their sweep of Congress last year, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Virtually every finding showed striking evidence of renewed political strength for the President: Mr. Clinton's job approval level has broken 50 percent for the first time in The Times's polling since February 1994. Americans have begun to give him more credit for a healthier economy. And they perceive Mr. Clinton as far more earnest than the Republicans in trying to find a solution to the budget impasse. 
 And in more heartening news for the President, his rebound has come at the expense of Republicans. The Democrats have, at least for now, succeeded in convincing many Americans that Republican budget remedies would carry harsh consequences for the public. Still, Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader and leading candidate for President, appears relatively unscathed; it is Mr. Gingrich whose standing has plummeted.
Sixty-one percent of Americans say Mr. Clinton is really trying to find a solution to the budget crisis; only 43 percent say the Republicans in Congress are really trying. And 47 percent approve of the way Mr. Clinton is handling the economy, up from 41 percent in October.
One of the most significant findings is that the Republicans' long-held advantage as the party most trusted for balancing the budget has completely dissipated. The public is evenly divided, with 41 percent trusting the Republicans in Congress and 41 percent trusting Mr. Clinton.
But just a year ago, after the Republican triumph in the midterm elections, 60 percent said they trusted the Republicans more in balancing the budget and Mr. Clinton drew only 28 percent. In the poll, 1,111 adults nationwide were called Dec. 9 to Dec. 11. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
The reputation of Congress has, in fact, fallen close to the levels it was at before Democrats were ousted from Congress in 1994. Twenty-six percent approve of how Congress is handling its job; in November 1994, 20 percent approved of how Congress, then controlled by Democrats, was handling itself.
The slide in approval for the Republican Congress has roughly paralleled Mr. Gingrich's ratings, which are the lowest since he has been Speaker. Only 29 percent of Americans approve of how Mr. Gingrich is handling his job, down from an already low 34 percent in October.
One reason for Mr. Gingrich's declining fortunes is that many Americans are uncomfortable about the Republican agenda. Fifty-two percent say the Republicans' proposed Medicare changes would be bad for the country; 27 percent say they would be good.
Specifically, a sizable proportion of Americans believe the Democrats' contention that Republicans are driven to reduce growth in Medicare spending as a way to cut taxes. Thirty-six percent say cutting taxes was the Republicans' overriding motivation; 34 percent to balance the budget and 16 percent to preserve Medicare. Republicans say they are mainly trying to save Medicare. There is far more support for the Republicans' welfare proposal, with 48 percent saying it would be good and 30 percent saying it would be bad.
In the budget battle, 54 percent of the respondents said Mr. Clinton was more concerned about doing what is best for them and their families, while only 36 percent gave such credit to Congressional Republicans. This is important given that the battle for President next year may be waged over the loyalties of middle-class swing voters.
But the negative ratings of Mr. Gingrich and Republican lawmakers in general seem not to have rubbed off on Mr. Dole, who may in fact look appealing when contrasted with the unpopular Speaker. Fifty-two percent of the public approves of the way Mr. Dole is handling his job, up from 45 percent in October. And the Senator remains the front-runner for the nomination with 47 percent support among registered Republicans; the other Republican candidates are in single digits in the nationwide matchup.
Despite Mr. Dole's relatively strong showing, Mr. Clinton appears in an even better position as the Presidential primaries approach early next year. Fifty-two percent of registered voters say if the general election were held today, they would vote for Mr. Clinton, while 40 percent favor Mr. Dole. This represents a turnaround for Mr. Clinton since August, when Mr. Dole led Mr. Clinton, 48 percent to 42 percent. Even with Mr. Clinton's new-found popularity, the poll shows that Americans remain evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives.
Democrats should not be too jubilant, however: Four years ago President George Bush seemed safely ahead of a "generic Democrat" opponent, but his advantage dwindled, and then evaporated, by early 1992.
Even as Mr. Clinton's ratings climb, most people still think it is Congressional Republicans who are setting the issue agenda in Washington. Fifty-eight percent say Republicans will have more influence over the direction of the country; 32 percent said Mr. Clinton will. Opinions are mixed about changes Republicans are trying to bring about: 40 percent say they are good, 34 percent say they are bad.
Yet, people worry about Republican proposals to cut or slow the growth of many social programs in an effort to reduce the deficit. Forty-nine percent say these proposals go too far; 11 percent say not far enough and 32 percent say they are about right.
On the issue of Medicare, Americans accept the idea that the Government should do more, but resist specific proposals that affect their pocketbooks. Seventy-eight percent of Americans say they agree with the proposal, advanced by Republicans, that people with higher incomes pay a greater share of their medical costs. In addition, as both parties encourage Medicare recipients to enter health maintenance organizations or other managed care programs, 60 percent say that would be acceptable.
But only 31 percent find acceptable a Republican plan to raise the monthly Medicare premium by the year 2002 to about $90 a month from the current fee of $46.10.
The one sign of trouble for Mr. Clinton in the poll was in Bosnia. Only 36 percent say Mr. Clinton's sending American troops to enforce the peace agreement there was the right thing. Even so, the Bosnia situation does not seem to be significantly hurting Mr. Clinton's popularity.
The poll also found that even as Ross Perot has formed a third party, his public appeal has further diminished. In a hypothetical three-way contest, Mr. Perot draws 16 percent of registered voters, with 44 percent for Mr. Clinton and 32 percent for Mr. Dole. But Mr. Perot has a growing negative image with the public; 53 percent say they have an unfavorable opinion of him, a notable increase from 36 percent unfavorable in August.
Mr. Clinton's approval rating of 51 percent was significant because it was the first time since February 1994 that he had registered so high in the Times/CBS poll. (He has had temporary surges over 50 percent in several one-night quick reaction polls taken separately by CBS News after dramatic events like the Oklahoma City bombing and the President's speech on Bosnia last month.)
The Republican Presidential field appears to be set, as Friday is the deadline for candidates to compete in the New Hampshire primary. But while the poll found that people say they are beginning to focus on the Presidential race, they are not particularly aware of the Republican field except for Mr. Dole.
Among Republicans, 47 percent say they have a favorable opinion of the Senator.
Yet, Mr. Clinton is now even more popular in his party. Seventy-five percent of Democrats say they have a favorable opinion of the President -- his highest rating in his own party since he was elected. Perhaps realizing that no challenger has emerged within the party, 75 percent of Democrats say Mr. Clinton should be renominated, a 12-point jump from August.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 9 to 11 with 1,111 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of active residential exchanges in the country. The list of more than 36,000 residential exchanges is maintained by Marketing Systems Group of Philadelphia.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for either Democrats or Republicans taken as a group and six points for independents.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Poster Boy For a Drop In Crime;
The Out-of-Town Press Makes Bratton a Hero

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
He was a brassy, bigger-than-life Police Commissioner until last February, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vetoed his idea of a police parade down Broadway on his birthday, cut his press staff in half and made it clear that he should reduce his public profile.
But while William J. Bratton now projects a more modest profile in New York, limiting reporters' access to his activities and allowing the Mayor to take credit for the city's drop in crime, the Commissioner has still managed to become something of a national and international media star. 
 His face has recently appeared in news magazines and newspapers in Australia, Japan and Norway and on television in Brazil and Italy. In the last few weeks, Mr. Bratton has made a series of speeches in Boston, Washington and Bermuda, and his aides say he wants to make a European tour to tout his crime-fighting accomplishments. The Europeans certainly seem impressed. "He has brought a new lexicon to law enforcement," an article in the British magazine The Economist said, comparing Mr. Bratton to Theodore Roosevelt, New York's Police Commissioner in the 1890's.
Mr. Bratton has been host to a Saudi Arabian prince and Government officials from around the world at his twice-weekly crime strategy meetings, with the hope that his techniques would serve as a model well beyond the five boroughs. He invited journalists from China, Hungary, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, the Netherlands, Israel and Belgium to the highly restricted police Operations Room for a personal briefing.
"Let the word go forth," said Peter LaPorte, a Deputy Police Commissioner who acts as Mr. Bratton's liaison to national and international news organizations.
"The word" is shorthand for a crusade Mr. Bratton is waging to convince criminologists and fellow police executives that the success of his strategies in reducing murder, auto theft and robbery by better than 30 percent since 1994 can be applied by every police department, in North America and beyond.
For their part, the out-of-town reporters and guests have expressed a near-endless fascination with the story of how a city known for mayhem has managed to drive down crime to levels not seen in the city since the early 1970's. And Mr. Bratton seems happy to tell the story, not only because he loves the limelight. Some have speculated that he may be promoting himself as a model manager -- The Economist called his style "N.Y.P.D. Inc." -- because he has made no secret that he would like eventually to move into the corporate world.
"This is not self-projection or aggrandizement," Mr. Bratton said in an interview this week. "You can take our strategies anywhere."
Mr. Bratton explained that strategy in a paper he delivered to a conference of the National Institute of Justice in Washington several weeks ago. "Contemporary criminology maintains a longstanding belief that police activities have little or no appreciable effect upon crime," he wrote. "What we have done in New York City is to radically alter the face of policing by empowering the agency and its officers. If we start to use police resources strategically and efficiently, we can cut crime by 20, 30 or even 50 percent in the space of several years."
The Commissioner's crusade comes as Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bratton have reached an uneasy truce over their respective public profiles. On arriving in New York from Boston in 1994, Mr. Bratton took his cue from Mr. Giuliani's campaign to improve the city's "quality of life." He immediately made a splash by tossing a panhandler from the subway his first week. And he turned the scandal in the 30th Precinct in Harlem into a positive media event for himself when, before television cameras, he personally confiscated the shields of officers accused of corruption. A stream of glowing profiles followed, which police officials said rankled the Mayor.
It took many months for Mr. Bratton and Mr. Giuliani to patch up their relationship after John Miller, Mr. Bratton's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information, quit in protest of staff cuts last February. Tom Kelly, who was handpicked by Mr. Giuliani, replaced Mr. Miller.
These days, publicity shots of Mr. Bratton clinking glasses with his aides at Elaine's or sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden no longer appear in local newspapers.
In times of crisis, like the investigation of last week's arson case in Harlem, Mayor Giuliani shares center stage with his Commissioner. But when good news is announced, or when police strategies are unveiled, news conferences are held at City Hall, not Police Headquarters.
Mr. Bratton's senior aides conceded privately that they were nervous about Mr. Giuliani's reaction to the recent global attention accorded the Commissioner. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said City Hall officials raised objections before Mr. Bratton's trip last month to speak before leaders in Bermuda.
Anticipating such friction, the aide said police officials notify City Hall only at the last minute before Mr. Bratton takes such a trip.
"We don't send things over in a timely fashion," the aide said. "It's the most political environment I've ever seen."
Mr. Bratton, on the other hand, said that Mr. Giuliani supported his attempts to promote New York City as an exciting laboratory for better policing. He said any perception that there was tension between him and the Mayor was subjective, and that the Mayor deserves much credit for the drop in crime.
While the Mayor's press office did not return calls seeking comment, the First Deputy Mayor, Peter J. Powers, said he was behind Mr. Bratton's efforts. "Any time New York City gets publicity for the good things, including the historic reduction in crime, it's a good thing," he said.
Mr. Bratton is not the first New York Police Commissioner to project himself outside of New York. Lee P. Brown, Mayor David N. Dinkins's first Police Commissioner, was known inside the department as "Out of Town Brown." But Mr. Bratton is perhaps the most intrepid.
Police executives around the country acknowledge the gathering impact of Mr. Bratton's emphasis on mapping crimes by computer every day, deploying officers to crime hot spots and focusing on chop shops and fences to attack car theft and burglary.
"The message big-city police chiefs are getting from Bratton is that crime analysis works," said Lawrence Sherman, a University of Maryland criminologist, "and driving police operations in a military fashion based on clearly identified and mapped targets is the best way for police to reduce crime."
Mr. Sherman said that police departments in Washington, Boston, St. Louis and Maryland are already copying from Mr. Bratton's playbook.
The Indianapolis Police Department has studied the strategy meetings, in which precinct commanders are challenged to come up with tactics to solve specific problems. The Indianapolis Police Chief, Donald E. Christ, said he planned to institute a similar exercise in his city.
"He's become the leader challenging other city administrators and police commissioners to look at crime in a different light," he said.
Such accolades have also become a staple of news articles in publications from Sydney to Rio de Janeiro about the drop in New York crime. According to an article in The Sunday Times of London, "In a city famous for its murders, muggings, ghetto gunfights, subway anarchy, drug gangs, junkies, rapists, winos, pickpockets and every other form of seething urban desperado, Bratton is turning the tide."
The international attention has instilled a conspicuous headiness among Mr. Bratton's inner circle. Noting that five senior South African police officials flew to New York just to attend a strategy meeting last month, John Maple, the Deputy Police Commissioner of Crime Strategies, said: "South Africa would be a ground ball. They're ready for us."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
If the Yankees Leave, Mayor Faults Ferrer

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
They play baseball only from April through October, but politics lasts all year long.
With the fate of Yankee Stadium hanging in the balance, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx have spent much of the last few days attacking each other over the city's efforts to keep the Yankees in the Bronx, or at least in New York City. 
 At a town hall meeting at Lafayette High School in Brooklyn on Tuesday night, Mr. Giuliani accused Mr. Ferrer of making it "much more difficult" to persuade the Yankees to stay by criticizing the team's owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d. And he even suggested the blame would fall on Mr. Ferrer if the Yankees moved away.
The attack on Mr. Ferrer, a Democrat who, it just so happens, has started raising money for a possible challenge to the Republican Mayor in 1997, came as Mr. Giuliani offered perhaps the clearest indication yet that the Yankees are intent on finding a new home after 72 years in Yankee Stadium.
"I can't guarantee, although I would like to, that I can keep them in the Bronx," he said. "One of the main reasons I can't guarantee it is because of the attitude of the Borough President."
Mr. Ferrer, in turn, yesterday accused the Mayor of "insulting New Yorkers' intelligence" by trying to blame him for what he sees as the administration's failures. He said that the Mayor was bowing to Mr. Steinbrenner's desire to move the Yankees out of their longtime home while at the same time refusing to acknowledge the fact for fear of political fallout. "I thought it was fairly disingenuous," he said of Mr. Giuliani's remarks. "If the Mayor is the midst of negotiations to move the Yankees to another site, he should be candid and say so. He's looking for a fall guy. And I'm not it."
Nothing new has happened in the city's courting of the Yankees to provoke this latest squabble. Election Day, however, is only 23 months away. And Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Ferrer appear eager to try out a few planks in their platforms.
The Yankees' future has enormous economic and cultural significance for a city that lost the Dodgers and the Giants, not to mention the Jets and the Giants football teams. But it also has political significance that could come to haunt Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Steinbrenner has set a deadline of Opening Day next April -- well before the Mayor's presumed re-election campaign -- to decide where the Yankees will play once the team's lease expires in 2002. He has already rejected 13 proposals by the city to renovate the stadium and is talking with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority about a new stadium in the Meadowlands.
In October, the city and the state agreed with the Yankees to review the feasibility of building a new stadium at three other sites, two in the Bronx and another in the West 30's of Manhattan that is now said to be a front-runner. That study is under way and expected to be completed in the next couple of months.
Losing the Yankees to New Jersey would unquestionably scar Mr. Giuliani, a champion of economic development and a devout Yankee fan since his boyhood in Brooklyn. He himself alluded to the political risks, noting that the city would build a new stadium if that was what it took.
He also pointed out that New York had lost the Brooklyn Dodgers to California in 1957 because the city refused the request by the late Walter O'Malley, the team's owner, to build a stadium. "I guarantee you," he said, "we learn from the mistakes in the past."
But keeping the Yankees could come at a price, too. Moving them to Manhattan risks dismaying nostalgically inclined fans and outraging residents of the Bronx, including a large Hispanic bloc that Mr. Ferrer represents and Mr. Giuliani hopes to court.
Mr. Ferrer, who has criticized Mr. Steinbrenner before, started the fight on Sunday when he appeared on the WNBC-TV program "News Forum" and declared that the Yankees had been "playing New York politicians like a violin" by threatening to move to New Jersey.
He said the city should make a best offer to renovate the stadium and refuse to spend taxpayer dollars on a new stadium in Manhattan or anywhere else. "That's too much to pay for vanity," he said, a barely veiled barb at Mr. Steinbrenner.
The Mayor said remarks like that simply undercut the city's efforts.
"Despite what you think of George Steinbrenner or the Yankees, they're a business organization," he said. "And if they think they're going to be in a place where the political leadership of that place is going to attack them, this is a very, very valuable franchise that a lot of places would like to have."
The Yankees, for their part, remained above the fray. "I don't think it's useful for the Yankees to get caught up in whatever rhetorical skirmish took place," said David W. Sussman, the team's executive vice president and general counsel.
Prof. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, played down the politics of a move, saying other factors could sway more voters. "It's more important," he said, "for the Yankees to win the pennant."

On 125th St., Patrons Reject Race Boycotts

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
EVERY now and again, something happens in New York City that brings to mind that old children's game, the one that asks, "What's wrong with this picture?" The evolving story in Harlem is the latest such event.
If the residents of Harlem are so hostile to whites, if the racial tensions on 125th Street run so deep, then why was Freddy's -- the store destroyed in a murderous attack that took eight lives -- intent on expanding? And why are Korean-, Hispanic- and Jewish-owned stores routinely attracting black customers? 
 Several hours on 125th Street this week suggest an answer: that the racial animosity directed against the Jewish-run Freddy's clothing store by black protesters did not reflect deep-rooted racism in Harlem. Rather, it expressed the sentiments of about a dozen protesters.
Harlem surely has its quota of racism and anti-Semitism and politicians who need the prod of a mass murder to denounce prejudice. But most people on 125th Street do not go around demanding a merchant's pedigree. "If blacks only shopped in black-owned shops, all the others would be out of business, right?" said Phyllis Locus, the black manager of black-owned Rainbow Music. "I think that was an isolated incident."
WAS it? That is always the question when there is a racially tinged eruption in New York. For instance, the Crown Heights violence in 1991, set off when a black child was accidentally killed by a Hasidic driver, was no shock. It reflected a deep and longstanding split between blacks and Hasidic Jews.
There is a long history of racial friction in Harlem, too, where blacks for generations suffered the insults of discrimination by white store owners. But now a recent survey showed that of 322 stores on West 125th Street, 158 were black-owned. The rest are owned by Asian, Jewish and Hispanic storekeepers. And so many black people work in the stores that it is difficult to tell who owns what.
Not that most customers seem much to care. When several black shoppers were asked the other day if they thought about the race or religion of storekeepers, they looked puzzled, as if to say, get real.
"As long as you got the item I want and got the right price, I don't care what color you are," said Robert Witherspoon, who was buying his daughter a down jacket at the Jewish-owned H and M Sneaker Center. Of course, people are going to be on their best behavior after a tragedy, especially talking to a white reporter. Still, the response was the same at the Ecuadorean-owned Garces Shoes, and in a Korean grocery store nearby, and at Bargain World, another Jewish-owned store that has been picketed by the same group of black protesters as Freddy's. "If there's something I like, I'm going to buy it," said Michelle Denson, in Bargain World.
Larry McNeely, a business consultant, said: "I'm not into that much race relations. It's a commodity being sold. It's ludicrous what this guy did, this maniac." He was referring to Roland J. Smith, who the authorities said shot himself to death after setting the fire at Freddy's.
ARTHUR ROSEN, whose father started Bargain World in 1938, insists he has never felt himself a target of anti-Semitism in Harlem. "In all countries, you have people who go off the deep end," he said. "There's one here, one in Israel, one Unabomber."
Mr. Rosen called the destruction of Freddy's "the result of a lot of things compounded -- the rabble-rousers, the Sharptons, the Powells," referring to Morris Powell, a leader of the protests, and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who must not have done his homework before joining the protest against Freddy's expansion into a space occupied by a black-owned record shop next door. A black church owns the building.
Mr. Rosen suggested that greed motivated the protesters. Mr. Powell's interests are not just racial. He has an economic stake. He and other vendors sell goods in a store next to Bargain World and may well look upon picketing as a profitable sideline. A flier urging a black boycott of Bargain World -- citing Mr. Rosen's support for moving street vendors off 125th Street -- directs shoppers to Mr. Powell's business next door. "Buy black," the flier urges.
Horace Sao doubts many will follow that dictate. "All I know is people love bargains and good prices," said Mr. Sao, who sells Happy Kwanzaa cards and Million Man March T-shirts at Mart 125, an indoor mall. He said he understands the charge that shopkeepers take money out of the community, even figures that points to him (he lives in the Bronx). But racial shopping? No.
"They don't go asking about color," he said. "To most people I know, it's all about shopping."

HEADLINE: Douglas Corrigan, 88, Dies; Wrong-Way Trip Was the Right Way to Celebrity as an Aviator

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Douglas Corrigan, a brash, errant aviator who captured the imagination of a Depression-weary public in 1938 when he took off from Brooklyn on a nonstop solo flight to Los Angeles and landed his improbable airplane in Dublin a day later, died on Saturday at a hospital in Orange, Calif. He was 88 and had been lionized for more than half a century as Wrong Way Corrigan.
The few people who were at Floyd Bennett Field when Mr. Corrigan took off at 5:15 on the morning of July 17, 1938, were baffled when the 31-year-old aviator turned into a cloud bank and disappeared to the east. 
 According to his flight plan, he should have been heading west.
As they and the world learned when his jerry-built, overloaded secondhand airplane touched down at Dublin's Baldonnel Airport 28 hours and 13 minutes later, Mr. Corrigan had not only known what he was doing, he had also flown straight into the hearts of the American people.
"I'm Douglas Corrigan," he told a group of startled Irish airport workers who gathered around him when he landed. "Just got in from New York. Where am I? I intended to fly to California."
Although he continued to claim with a more or less straight face that he had simply made a wrong turn and been led astray by a faulty compass, the story was far from convincing, especially to the American aviation authorities who had rejected his repeated requests to make just such a flight because his modified 1929 Curtiss-Robin monoplane was judged unworthy of more than an experimental aircraft certification.
Unmoved by evidence that he had not checked weather reports for the North Atlantic before his flight and had carried charts showing only his supposedly planned route to California, the authorities deemed his plane so unsafe and his flight so illegal that it took a 600-word official telegram to detail all the regulations he had violated.
But if Mr. Corrigan had such a twinkle in his eye when he told his story that he appeared to be trying to suppress a wink, the authorities had trouble stifling a wink of their own.
Although his pilot's license was instantly suspended, Mr. Corrigan, who returned to the United States by ship, did not miss a minute of flying time. He served the entire suspension at sea. The license was reinstated as soon as he and his crated-up plane sailed into New York Harbor aboard the liner Manhattan on Aug. 4, and received a tumultuous greeting.
There was an even larger welcome the next day when an estimated one million New Yorkers lined lower Broadway for a ticker-tape parade that eclipsed the one given for Charles A. Lindbergh after his solo flight to Paris in 1927.
Mr. Corrigan's 3,150-mile flight was an immediate sensation, pushing depressing economic news and grim international reports aside on the front pages of American newspapers and dominating radio broadcasts across the country.
Although half a dozen well-known pilots, among them Amelia Earhart and Wylie Post, had made solo flights across the Atlantic since Lindbergh had blazed the trail in the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927, none struck such a chord with the American people as Mr. Corrigan did.
That was partly because he was seen as an engaging and impish young pilot who had boldly thumbed his nose at authority, then baldly denied it, and partly because he had made the flight not in a state of the art aircraft with cutting edge instruments, but in a rickety plane so precariously patched together that it was variously dubbed an airborne crate and a flying jalopy.
Among other things, Mr. Corrigan, who had bought the plane in New York as a wreck for $310 in 1935 and nursed it cow pasture by cow pasture back to California, had ripped out the original 90-horsepower engine and replaced it with a 165-horsepower model cobbled together from two old Wright engines. He had also installed five extra fuel tanks, which completely blocked his forward view, and various parts, including the cabin door, were held together with baling wire.
Mr. Corrigan, who was born in Galveston, Tex., and grew up in Los Angeles, had been dreaming of a flight across the Atlantic for a long time. Enchanted with aviation at an early age, he had become a barnstorming pilot, flying instructor and an aviation mechanic who helped build Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis in San Diego. It was Mr. Corrigan, in fact, who pulled the chocks away from the wheels when Lindbergh took off from San Diego on his flight to New York in 1927.
Mr. Corrigan, who had speculated openly with friends about making an unauthorized trans-Atlantic flight, flew his plane to New York on July 10, 1938, setting a solo nonstop record of 27 hours, 50 minutes for the 2,700-mile flight.
When he took off a week later, ostensibly to return to California after accepting his failure to win permission for a trans-Atlantic flight, he carried a few chocolate bars, two boxes of fig crackers and a quart of water.
Within months of his feat he had made a triumphant American tour, endorsed wrong-way products like a watch that ran backward and signed lucrative contracts for an autobiography and a movie, "The Flying Irishman," in which he played himself.
He was a test pilot during World War II and later operated an air freight service. In the 1950's, he bought an orange grove in Santa Ana, Calif., but was forced to sell most of it in the 1960's. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1966.
After a son was killed in a plane crash on Catalina Island in 1972 he became increasingly reclusive, until 1988 when he was lured back into the limelight by an offer to display his plane at an air show.
Mr. Corrigan, who had taken it apart in 1940 and stored it in his garage, was so enthusiastic that the show's organizers became alarmed.
Although Mr. Corrigan had not flown since 1972, the organizers found it prudent to station guards on the plane's wings during his appearance at the exhibition and even discussed anchoring the tail of the plane by rope to a police car.
He is survived by two sons, Douglas, of Santa Ana, and Harry, of Apex, N.C., and a sister, Evelyn, of Santa Ynez, Calif.

HEADLINE: U.N. Says North Korea Faces Danger of Famine

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 13

 BODY:
North Korea is in danger of a widespread famine, but so far most Western nations have been unwilling to pledge aid to prevent it, United Nations officials said today.
The World Food Program, a United Nations agency, said it would have to stop emergency delivery of food to North Korea if Western countries did not quickly pledge funds. 
 North Korea issued its first appeal for help from the international community after floods devastated farmland in August.
United Nations officials estimated that 1.5 million tons of grain were lost in the floods, which they called the worst in 100 years.
Last week, United Nations relief officials in North Korea described scenes of hungry residents foraging for roots to eat in plowed paddy fields, and children barely surviving on weak corn porridge.
Some 500,000 people were left homeless by the floods, and sub-zero winter weather is approaching.
"Because of acute food shortages, Government rice and cabbage rations have been drastically reduced and famine conditions have already begun to take hold in some of the worst-hit provinces," the agency said.
Those provinces are Chagang and North Pyongan, in the rural northwest, and North Hwanghae in the west.
So far, the World Food Program's appeal for $8.8 million in food aid has yielded little more than $200,000 from Denmark and Finland.
Japan and South Korea have also given North Korea aid on their own this year.
A South Korean newspaper reported today that Chinese leaders think the famine and other economic difficulties could prompt North Korea to start another war with South Korea to divert potential unrest.
The Chosun Ilbo newspaper cited a Chinese Government report suggesting the deteriorating economy and failing health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could prompt the North into military adventurism.
Francis Mwanza, a spokesman for the Rome-based agency, said that if one last appeal for donations fails, the agency will start shutting down its North Korea operation next week.
"It's a very worrying situation," he said. "There are still a half-million people in need of food. There's going to be starvation."
The United Nations agency already borrowed more than $2 million from an emergency fund to pay for an initial aid shipment.
Mr. Mwanza said his agency's program was the first time North Korea allowed any international group to monitor relief supplies.
Michael Ross, a World Food Program spokesman in New York, said agency workers in North Korea were dealing well with the North Koreans.
"If we pull out, we will be missing a very rare opportunity to break down the last 'Berlin Wall' in the world," he said. "It appears the international community does not want to pay for the ladder."
Nearly 17 months after the sudden death of North Korea's longtime ruler, Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il has failed to take full power, triggering speculation of challenges and health problems.

HEADLINE: Whitman Ties Cigarette Tax To Coverage For Children

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman announced today that she would seek to enroll nearly 100,000 uninsured children in a state-subsidized health insurance program financed in part by an increase in the state's cigarette tax.
The program now offers subsidized health insurance to 18,000 New Jersey residents who do not have employee-sponsored coverage and are not eligible for Medicaid. Under the Governor's proposal, the state would enroll no additional adults but instead would sign up uninsured children in a program emphasizing preventive care. 
 Governor Whitman said the proposed increase in the cigarette tax -- 25 cents a pack -- was needed to help pay for the expanded children's insurance program and also to help replenish the state fund that pays for hospital care for the poor.
The Governor and the state Legislature are facing a Dec. 31 deadline to come up with money for that fund, which distributed $400 million this year to reimburse 84 hospitals for charity care. Authorization to draw on the state's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund for this purpose is expiring, and organized labor and the business community are both pressing the state to find alternatives.
By publicly announcing that the focus of the state's subsidized insurance program would change to emphasize children, Governor Whitman is seeking to build support for her plan to bring money in to the charity fund by raising the state cigarette tax to 65 cents from 40 cents.
"I am well aware that some people have criticized me for using a cigarette tax to help us pay for the Children First and charity care," the Governor said at a news conference at United Hospital Medical Center/ Children's Hospital of New Jersey in Newark. "I have a very, very simple response for them: This tax will help us bring our children in out of the cold and into the health care mainstream."
While departing Assembly Speaker Chuck Haytaian, a Republican from Warren County, joined Governor Whitman yesterday to show his support of the tax increase to pay for charity care, her plan is facing opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate. In general, New Jersey politicians are reluctant to support any new taxes since the Democrats lost control of the Legislature for approving former Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package in 1990.
The Whitman administration and the State Legislature are seeking to come up with $300 million for charity care and an additional $100 million for the subsidized health insurance program.
Under the Whitman administration proposal, which needs legislative approval, the tax increase would pay for $125 million of the state's charity care program. The remaining $275 million would come from the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
The Assembly minority leader, Joseph Doria, a Democrat from Hudson County, said: "The Governor should not be pitting children against adults, while pushing through a bill that raises taxes and raids a trust fund for the unemployed."
Rae Hutton, a spokeswoman for the Senate Republicans, declined to comment on the proposal.
Under the state's present six-month-old program to provide subsidized health insurance, a family of four with an income up to $37,875 is eligible to purchase insurance. There are an estimated 700,000 uninsured individuals in New Jersey. State officials said that almost 18,000 people have obtained health insurance through the program, which cost the state $50 million this year.

HEADLINE: European Parliament Admits Turkey to Its New Customs Union

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Turkey's long campaign to enter into a customs union with Europe ended in victory today, as the European Parliament voted by a wide margin to lift remaining trade barriers with Ankara.
The vote in Strasbourg, France went far beyond the economic benefits the trade union is expected to bring both sides, and was closely watched in Washington, where Turkey's bid had strong support. 
 For Turkey, the customs union was a test of its acceptance by Europe as a political as well as economic partner, and as a possible step toward full membership in the European Union. For critics of Turkey, it was seen as an endorsement of a human rights record that, while improved, still falls short of European standards.
The intense lobbying campaign that preceded the vote had focused not on economic issues but on human rights, particularly the Turkish security forces' campaign against Kurdish separatists.
But in the final debate, a majority of European parliamentarians were swayed by Ankara's argument that rejection would jeopardize Turkey's recent democratic reforms, and encourage an anti-Western mood on the eve national elections, scheduled for Dec. 24.
The customs union, which is due to go into effect on Jan. 1, is expected to produce a boom in European imports to Turkey, and double exports to Europe of Turkish textiles, now one of the country's largest foreign currency earners. Business interests in Europe, as well as Turkey, actively campaigned on Turkey's behalf, lobbying their governments and appealing for popular support with full-page newspaper ads.
The Turkish Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, who had put acceptance of the trade deal at the heart of her party's platform, triumphantly broadcast the news of the Strasbourg vote from loudspeakers atop her campaign bus in Istanbul today. The final vote was 343 to 143 with 36 abstentions.
"Now we have begun a national struggle on the road to full membership in the European Union," she told a crowd of cheering supporters.
For Turkey, a secular nation with a population that is 99 percent Muslim, the custom unions vote became a kind of test of national identity. Although regarded as an economic boon overall, it could threaten some of Turkey's heavily protected state industries, and many voters, now feeling the crunch of the Government's austerity plan, may be ambivalent about its value once it takes effect.
In addition, European pressure on human rights has been deeply resented by some Turks, who viewed the West as being insensitive to Turkey's precarious position in a volatile region. Others welcomed the pressure for reforms.
Last summer, the Turkish Parliament adopted a series of constitutional amendments that broadened political participation, and in the fall, it amended an anti-terrorist law that had been widely used to silence critics of the government's 11-year-old battle with Kurdish separatists in southeastern Turkey.
The customs union deal has been supported by a succession of Turkish Governments ever since it was first broached in 1963. Turkey formally applied for European Union membership in 1987 but it is not included on the list of countries that have been told they can join the union in the near future.
Even so, diplomats say the customs union will bind Turkey more closely to its European partners, by expanding the number and level of regular contacts.

HEADLINE: Jordanian Has a Goal: Shirtmaker To the U.S.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: AL MUKHABLAIN, Jordan, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Jad Maqdah, a shirtmaker, hopes that his "made in Jordan" label will find a place at the base of thousands more American necks.
In this resource-barren country, Mr. Maqdah must import every button, thread and shred of cloth that his Jordan Clothing Company needs to produce a simple cotton shirt. But of the more than one million shirts cut and sewn this year in his rudimentary factory here on the outskirts of Amman, more than one in four was destined for the United States. 
 Until the Persian Gulf war of 1991, Jordan relied almost wholly on a very different market, oil-rich Iraq. But with that outlet still barred by United Nations sanctions, this country and its entrepreneurs like Mr. Maqdah now look on stores like Macy's, a unit of the Camdev Corporation, and Kmart as potential routes to new prosperity.
At best, the record remains mixed. While Jordan's new peace with Israel has won a powerful American endorsement for its quest for development, new investors and contracts have been slow to materialize. Within the Middle East, potential trade routes to neighbors like Syria remain largely blocked by trade barriers.
Even for Mr. Maqdah, whose company is Jordan's largest retailer, the transformation has required adjustments. In Jordan, the company is licensed to make and sell high-quality shirts under the Van Heusen label owned by Phillips-Van Heusen, but it has found a steady American buyer only for cheap flannel garments.
But Jordan, not blessed by the oil that has enriched its Arab neighbors, is in no position to be picky. After five years in which the official closing of the Iraqi market has sent the unemployment rate to an estimated 25 percent, the unexpected flow of shirts to American shelves has given rise to hopes that the country's low labor costs and relative stability may hold some economic promise.
Mr. Maqdah, 44, the company's managing director, described the 300,000 shirts that his company sent to the United States last year as "only the beginning" of its export drive.
"To establish your credibility," he said of the company's willingness to concentrate for now on low-end politics, "sometimes you have to start from the bottom up."
Established in 1949 by Mr. Maqdah's father, the Jordan Clothing Company has long been the country's largest retailer, with 20 stores in Amman. Along with robes, T-shirts and pajamas, it still sells 60 percent of its shirts in Jordan.
But now nearly 500 workers, most of them veiled women from Al Mukhablain itself, work every day but Friday in the six-story factory to keep pace with the surge of export business, 70 percent of it to the United States.
Mr. Maqdah's mother, Suhaila, has taken over as the company chairman, and his two younger brothers, Samir and Mazen, have hurried home from jobs abroad to help manage the export boom.
Made from cotton imported from Pakistan and thread from Sri Lanka and stitched on German-made machines, the flannel shirts that Mr. Maqdah makes for an American middleman for as little as $50 a dozen are Jordanian only by toil. With a "made in Jordan" tag and a Woodlawn label, most are sold in Kmart and other budget stores.
With a major port in Aqaba and labor costs among the lowest in the region, just one-tenth those of neighboring Israel, Jordan is seen by many economists here as well positioned to become a light-manufacturing center.
Only two years ago, it did not export a single shirt to the United States. But now its textile exports total $40 million a year, and diplomats like to compare Jordan to the Israel of 20 years ago, before that economy exploded into the fastest-growing in the Middle East.
Among Jordan's four million people, there also remains a widespread yearning for simpler days, and many here still clearly hope that the search for new opportunities need only be temporary. Before the gulf war, some 80 percent of Jordan's exports went no further than Iraq, a trade so lucrative that the United Nations sanctions against Baghdad have cost Jordan $300 million to $400 million a year. Even now, with Jordan adopting a tougher line against the Iraqi Government, it has continued to call for a lifting of those trade barriers.
At the factory in Al Mukhablain, some of the nostalgia for more profitable days was renewed by an American buyer's offer that would have doubled the company's exports, but at an unacceptably low price.
In conversations, members of the Maqdah family wondered how their company could compete in the long run with manufacturers from the Far East, where labor is even cheaper and materials closer at hand.
"Back when we used to sell to Iraq," Suhaila Maqdah said, "things were very very good."

HEADLINE: Russia's Unruly Democracy

 BODY:
The course of reform in Russia has been disorderly, and there is no reason to think it will be less so after Sunday's parliamentary election. A dizzying array of parties and candidates is competing for the 450 seats in the State Duma, or lower house. Many of them are committed to slowing reform, some are sworn to ending it. The Communist Party, so recently disgraced, seems positioned for a comeback. Nationalist candidates look strong in many districts. The centrist political party of President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin seems as sickly as its leader.
This is not the straight line to stability that Russians might have wished for when the Soviet Union disintegrated four years ago, or that Americans might have imagined as they watched Russia discard centuries of autocratic rule. 
 But as some of Russia's erstwhile allies in Central Europe have already shown, the passage from tyranny to democracy is going to be long and uneven, and democratic elections will not always produce democratic leaders. Communists of one stripe or another have returned to power through elections in Bulgaria, Hungary and, most recently, in Poland. Russia could be next.
This is cause for concern, but not despair. Russia is not in danger of slipping back to Stalinism, nor is the cold war about to resume, even if the Communists win the largest bloc of seats on Sunday. Political and economic reform has already transited sufficient ground to make some change virtually irreversible, including the transfer to private ownership of much of Russia's economy and property.
For better or worse, every major political party has a stake in the widespread redistribution of wealth that is going on in Russia. As John Lloyd of The Financial Times observed at a recent symposium organized by Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, the election is really about who will control that redistribution, not whether it will stop.
The elections themselves are the surest sign that reform is sticking. The Communist Party will only do as well on Sunday as Russian voters say. That is not a system Lenin would have endorsed.
Russians, like Americans, are anxious about economic uncertainty, and there is much to be uncertain about in Russia today. Although inflation has stabilized and the economy shows some signs of growth, income inequities are glaring and widening. Some Russians have made a fortune in the free market or through the acquisition of government assets. Many others live austere lives, and too many, especially the elderly, have fallen into desperate poverty.
The discontent over economic hardships has been compounded by a loss of national pride as Russia's international status has slipped from superpower to second-rate power. Crime of all kinds is rising. Add to that Mr. Yeltsin's erratic leadership, particularly his disastrous military campaign in Chechnya, and it is not hard to see why many Russians would be drawn to the soothing promises of Communists and nationalists, who preach order and a revived empire.
Under Russia's new Constitution, Parliament is overshadowed by the presidency. Unless one party or a coalition of parties can control two-thirds of the seats, the number required to override presidential vetoes, the legislature cannot itself change the direction of Moscow's domestic and foreign policies. But in tandem with presidential elections scheduled for next June, the vote this Sunday will help determine whether Russia is ready to accelerate or slow reform.

HEADLINE: David Marshall, 87, Opponent Of Singapore Authoritarianism

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec. 14

 BODY:
David Marshall, one of the founding fathers of Singapore and one of the last Singaporeans brave enough to speak up against the authoritarian Government now running the city-state, died on Tuesday at his home in Singapore. He was 87.
He had been suffering from lung cancer, a family spokesman said. 
 Mr. Marshall, who gained early fame for his passionate oratory as a criminal defense lawyer, was chief minister in Singapore's first elected Government in 1955. He resigned the next year when talks broke down with Britain over terms for self-government for the former British colony.
Although he lost his parliamentary seat a few years later and eventually returned to the law, Mr. Marshall remained a stinging critic of the People's Action Party, which took power in 1959 under the leadership of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
Mr. Lee retired as Prime Minister in 1990 but in his new role as Senior Minister he is still considered the most powerful man in Singapore, and his party retains a tight hold on the reins of Government, silencing critics through defamation suits and other forms of intimidation.
While Mr. Marshall was always careful in public settings to praise Mr. Lee and his party for converting Singapore into one of the most prosperous nations in Asia, he would also condemn their repressive tactics, using language that few others in Singapore would dare even consider.
"I stand in awe, genuine awe, of what they have achieved," Mr. Marshall said last year of the People's Action Party. But the country's economic progress was achieved at the cost of a sense of humanity, he said, describing Mr. Lee as "at base a fascist" and Singapore as a nation with a "plastic heart."
Mr. Marshall was one of only a handful of Singaporeans willing to criticize the Government publicly over the caning last year of an American teen-ager, Michael P. Fay, who had pleaded guilty to vandalism. He said the lashing was "grossly excessive."
He often belittled Mr. Lee's assertion that there should be different standards for human rights in Asia and the West. In a letter last year that the Government-run newspaper, The Straits Times, refused to publish, Mr. Marshall noted that authoritarianism had repeatedly brought chaos to China.
"We should keep in mind the horrors of the Cultural Revolution, brought about by the cult of subservience to authority and primacy of society over the individual, before we point the accusing finger at those who believe that respect for the individual is the basis of human civilization," he wrote.
Mr. Marshall, the son of Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Iraq, was born in Singapore in 1908 and earned a law degree in Britain. A soldier in the colonial army in World War II, he was taken captive by Japanese forces in 1942 and was forced to work in the coal mines of Hokkaido, Japan.
He was freed in 1945 and returned home, where he was quickly recognized as the most effective criminal defense lawyer in Singapore, winning over juries in what appeared to be hopeless cases.
It was commonly said in legal circles that "Marshall never loses," and his success in the courtroom was cited by the People's Action Party when it eventually decided to abolish the jury system.
His involvement in the movement against British colonial rule led him into politics, and in 1955, he came to power as chief minister when his Labor Front party swept to power in elections for a transitional government.
He remained active in opposition politics until 1972, when he was accused by the local bar association of misconduct -- supporters said the case was entirely trumped up -- over his defense of a group of newspaper executives detained under Singapore's draconian internal security laws.
It was a sign of the high regard still held for Mr. Marshall that in 1978 he was made Ambassador to France, a post he held until two years ago, when he returned to Singapore and returned to work in a law firm. Many Singaporeans say Mr. Marshall was given the post in France in order to get him out of the country -- and away from political debate.
There was an outpouring of tributes to Mr. Marshall this week, including several from members of the People's Action Party. "He has contributed much in the service of Singapore," said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who praised Mr. Marshall for his "wit, insight and eloquence." Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said Mr. Marshall was "a great man."
Mr. Goh's predecessor, Mr. Lee, was notably silent. A spokesman for Mr. Lee said today that the former Prime Minister had so far issued no statement about the death of his great rival.
Mr. Marshall is survived by his wife, Jean, and their four children, Ruth, Sara, Joanna and Jonathan.

HEADLINE: Environmental Study Center Created to Honor Late Senator

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The family of the late Senator H. John Heinz 3d has donated $20 million to establish a research center in his name where experts from universities, industry, government and advocacy groups will join to seek firmer ground for environmental policies in science and economics.
The sponsors said the gift was one of the largest single philanthropic grants ever offered in environmental circles. 
 They said the new center, the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, would offer nonpartisan, innovative and credible ideas in a field constantly riven by politics, where government policies are often masterminded by muddling through.
Already, the center has won support -- and drawn members of its fledgling board of directors -- from quarters including the Environmental Defense Fund and the Nature Conservancy, the Aluminum Company of America and the Enron Corporation, and four major universities: Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Princeton and Stanford.
Its president is William J. Merrell Jr., an oceanographer and former vice chancellor of the Texas A & M University System. The professional staff, ensconced in a downtown Washington office, is expected to grow to about a dozen this year, with a budget of $1.7 million, he said.
But the real strength of the organization, its founders said, will be drawn from companies, schools, environmental groups and the government, whose experts will assemble to work on knotty, emerging problems that the center believes will move to the forefront of the policy agenda in two to five years.
The founders said that they were keenly aware of the intensely political nature of environmental decision making and that the center would remain independent, even as it reached out to all sectors involved in the environmental debate.
Teresa Heinz, the widow of Senator Heinz and chairwoman of the Heinz Family Philanthropies, said in an interview that she believed the intense drive by Republicans in the 104th Congress to radically reshape environmental policies would wane and a more centrist approach would emerge.
"When that happens, there have got to be some well-thought-out alternatives," she said.
Senator Heinz, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania who died in a plane crash in 1991, first sought in the 1980's to develop a bipartisan effort to harness market forces for environmental protection, an idea he pursued along with Senator Tim Wirth, a Democrat who now is the Assistant Secretary of State for Global Affairs, the top environmental post at the State Department.
Mrs. Heinz, who this year married Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, is an active environmentalist and vice chairwoman of the Environmental Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group that has made a mark developing approaches, like the trading on financial markets of pollution permits, that use financial incentives to lower the costs of protecting the environment.
Mrs. Heinz controls a family fortune worth several hundred million dollars, originally derived from the Heinz food company.
The donation to establish the Heinz Center comes from the Vira I. Heinz Endowment, one of the Pittsburgh-based philanthropies, with combined assets of about $1 billion, associated with the family.
The board of the Heinz Center includes Mrs. Heinz; Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York; Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of the Enron Corporation, an energy company; Simon A. Levin, a biologist and director of the Princeton Environmental Institute at Princeton University; Robert Mehrabian, president of Carnegie Mellon; Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Company of America, and John C. Sawhill, president of the Nature Conservancy.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Confession Of Weakness

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
In a cynical time, we Americans long for heroes. If we were less parochial, less culture-bound, we would see one: a man of extraordinary vision and courage. On his own, alone, he has challenged the greatest tyranny on earth. Though he had little formal education, he brilliantly expounded the meaning of freedom. Imprisoned, brutalized, silenced, he will not yield.
Wei Jingsheng is his name. Because he is Chinese, relatively few Americans recognize his heroism. But he is as remarkable a figure, in his way, as Andrei Sakharov was in the years of Soviet tyranny or Nelson Mandela under apartheid. 
 In 1978, when he was an electrician at the Beijing Zoo, he wrote an essay on democracy that was posted on the so-called Democracy Wall. Reading it today, one can only marvel at its understanding -- and its daring.
"In our People's Republic," he wrote, some people "live like gods and hold dominant power." Instead, "we want to be masters of our own destiny. We need no gods or emperors."
For that essay he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. At his trial in 1979 he explained that his aim was "free, unrestricted inquiry, seeking the truth from facts."
"Leaders are only human," he said. "It is only when they are brought under the critical supervision of the people that they will make fewer mistakes. . . . Criticizing unreasonable people and things is the intrinsic right of every citizen, and is also his unavoidable responsibility."
To an American, that language rings of the democratic theory of Alexander Meiklejohn, who said the citizen in a democracy had the duty to criticize. Justice William J. Brennan Jr. embraced the idea in 1964 in his opinion for the Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan, speaking of the duty of "the citizen-critic of government."
Wei Jingsheng was released from prison in 1993. Again he called for democracy. Six months later he was re-arrested. Now, in a mockery of a trial, he has been convicted of trying to overthrow the Chinese Government and sentenced to 14 more years in prison.
The trial was closed to foreign correspondents and diplomats. Afterward the Government described it in a statement. Investigation, it said, showed that Wei Jingsheng had engaged in "purchasing newspapers, setting up a company in charge of cultural activities and organizing nongovernmental painting exhibitions, performances and publications with the aim of . . . raising a storm powerful enough to shake up the present Government."
Organizing painting exhibitions: There is a dangerous crime. As thus described, the trial was an unwitting demonstration of how weak and vulnerable the Communist Chinese oligarchy feels. Prof. Merle Goldman of Boston University, a China scholar, put it:
"A 14-year sentence for Wei shows you how fragile the present leaders' grip on power is. They have no legitimacy. It's absurd to think that one individual could possibly destabilize a country of 1.2 billion people."
The second trial of Wei Jingsheng sends a signal about the nature of the regime in Beijing. Many have hoped, or even believed, that economic liberalization in China would lead to political liberalization. But the regime, we know now, fears that even one free voice would threaten its power.
What can we do about the Chinese tyranny? Some believe the Beijing Government does not care what the world thinks, but that is plainly wrong. It eased up on dissidents when its most-favored-nation trade status in the United States seemed threatened -- and has been much more brutal since President Clinton de-linked the two issues last year.
Mr. Clinton should speak out himself about Wei Jingsheng's new imprisonment, as he has not yet done: That is one thing. His Administration should begin now to rally votes in the United Nations Human Rights Commission to condemn China -- a condemnation that Beijing urgently wants to avoid. It should oppose financing for Chinese projects in the World Bank.
Most of all, we should get over the notion that we must not offend China. Speaking truth to its power will in fact help those inside the regime who oppose its growing intransigence.
It is time to show our indignation at the brutalities of Beijing. It is time to respect the courage of Wei Jingsheng.

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Sector Needs Professionals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Woeful '95 Leads U.S. Charities to Introspection" (news article, Dec. 10): 
 I was astounded to read that nonprofit organization leaders are concerned about increased professionalism in the field. Your article suggests that participants at a New York conference questioned the role of professional managers in running nonprofit hospitals and foundations, citing loss of the small volunteer managerial ethic as a problem.
It is not surprising that the nonprofit sector, of which I am a part, is in trouble with thinking like this. Professionalism is what the nonprofit corporate world needs to regain the organizational and spiritual respect of the public.
The nonprofit community and the public must accept that hospitals, educational facilities and social service and arts organizations are big businesses that need to be run efficiently in order to fulfill their societal mission.
The public should not confuse philanthropic scandals with attempts to bring more professional, bottom-line managers into the nonprofit sector: just the opposite, it is the lack of professional, experienced financial and organizational managers that creates a breeding ground for scandal and abuse.
If an individual is intent on taking advantage of an organization, what better opportunity exists than in an organization that is in the dark ages of organizational management and financial accountability?
To maintain its role in American society, the nonprofit community had better accept the managerial principles the rest of the country respects.

INVESTMENT BIKER
On the Road With Jim Rogers
By Jim Rogers
Illustrated. 402 pages. Random House. $25.
Memorializing a journey is like investment counseling in one sense: if you're going to do it, you have to do it well to make it worth the risk to your clients. Jim Rogers, who made "millions" (as he puts it) as a Wall Street fund manager and retired at the "ripe old age of 37," must be a brilliant investor. In his literary endeavors, however, this account of a two-year globe-girdling motorcycle trip with his girlfriend pays off occasionally but not nearly often enough to make the reader very rich. 
 The first hundred or so pages, which take Mr. Rogers and his friend, Tabitha Estabrook, east across Central Asia and China, then west through Siberia, are so full of astonished banality that the account nearly becomes a parody of itself. One problem is that Mr. Rogers's writing is unexceptional and pedestrian. Another is that he is overimpressed by the depth of his insights.
 "I realized as we came down out of the mountains and onto the plains," he writes, as though making a great discovery, "how often borders followed geographical features and changes such as rivers, mountains, lakes, deserts."
"The other thing Tabitha and I noticed throughout the Central Asian republics were the number of Muslims," Mr. Rogers adds somewhat later, hastening to suggest that everyone would be surprised. "In America we tend to think Muslims are a people centered in the Middle East, not realizing that they run from Morocco to the Philippines."
When he gets to China, Mr. Rogers continues to share his putatively deep knowledge of history and the world. His quick analysis of the Tiananmen Square student demonstrations in Beijing in 1989 reveals him as a man who does not know that he does not know. When he arrives in the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union, he provides more trailblazing insight: "The real crime here was the perversion of human nature, the original Communist notion that the natural way of trade and commerce that had existed throughout the world for thousands of years was somehow evil."
The idea of Mr. Rogers's worldwide jaunt is to combine a good time, the adventure of a lifetime, with professional observations of local economies and a search for investment opportunities. And so, as he and Ms. Estabrook roar through countries on their BMW's, Mr. Rogers expatiates on economic conditions, more often than not bemoaning the stupidity of governments that try to control prices or the flow of goods and currencies.
Mr. Rogers's lessons on the international economy are easy to digest and might well be interesting and even useful to those with little knowledge of these matters. They would seem elementary to any reader of the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which follows a similar free-market philosophy, though what Mr. Rogers often does well is link that philosophy to concrete illustrations.
"Gas here wasn't expensive, simply unavailable, the way it had been cheap and hard to get in Siberia and Russia," Mr. Rogers remarks after several failed attempts to fill up at Zairian gas stations. "But this made sense: fix a price too low, and no one wants to supply it -- not individuals, not corporations and not governments." When Mr. Rogers and his friend take their bikes to Africa for the Tunis-to-Cape-Town run, his skills as a diarist improve, in part because he simply tells, in a breezy, conversational style, what he saw and what happened rather than interpreting the meaning of it all. In Africa, too, the travelers have a few genuine adventures. In Zaire, a once-rich country wrecked, as Mr. Rogers notes, by the regime of the strongman Mobutu Sese Seko, the motorcyclists, forced off their bikes by flooded roads, spend 13 days in a convoy of 11 barges being pushed by a single tugboat down the Congo River, which provides Mr. Rogers with a rare occasion to write interestingly about local life.
Also in Zaire, he comes into conflict with a young Frenchman he hired in North Africa to drive a truck accompanying them as they make their way on their motorcycles toward Cape Town. The Frenchman, a randy bon vivant, is always asking for more money, and Mr. Rogers finally cuts off the flow. This leads the Frenchman to chase Mr. Rogers through the grounds of a missionary compound with a bowie knife, which lands all three foreigners in the viselike grip of local officials who extort money from them.
When Mr. Rogers, trapped and unable to leave without paying up, tries to send a letter to the American Embassy asking for help, the postman coolly tells him: "You can't mail this. We don't send letters to that embassy." Giving in to local custom after several days, Mr. Rogers dips into his capital.
As he and Ms. Estabrook make their way along their 65,000-mile route through Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, an odd fact becomes increasingly clear: their trip, at least from the reader's point of view, is more absorbing when they are not on their motorcycles. Or perhaps that is not so odd. Motorcycles are fun. They are exhilarating. But they are, almost by definition, isolating instruments that get you close to but not into the lives of the people who live in the places you are visiting. From the literary point of view, trains, buses and barges are better.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE OVERVIEW;
Balkan Foes Sign Peace Pact, Dividing An Unpacified Bosnia

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 14

 BODY:
In somber silence, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia signed a peace agreement today, even as scattered violence in Bosnia made clear that real peace was not yet at hand.
Today's ceremony, presided over by President Clinton and other international sponsors, cleared the way for the deployment of 60,000 NATO peacekeeping troops and the commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild the country after nearly four cruel years of war. 
 "My Government is taking part in this agreement not with any enthusiasm, but as someone taking a bitter potion of medication," President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia said after the formal signing of the accords reached with American mediation in Dayton, Ohio, last month.
Though the agreement preserves his country in name, it also ratifies the ethnic division of Bosnia that Mr. Izetbegovic's Muslim-led Government had fought to prevent, dividing the territory between Government and Croatian forces on one side and Serbs on the other.
The plan signed today, with its calls for a new confederation of the rival parties and free movement of peoples within, represents a desperate gamble that peace can be forged from this savagely splintered remnant of the former Yugoslavia.
Before the signing, President Jacques Chirac of France said, "Real peace remains to be built in people's hearts and minds, along with democracy, human liberty and reconciliation."
Mr. Clinton, who flew in for the ceremony in the chandeliered ballroom of Mr. Chirac's residence, Elysee Palace, this morning and flew out this evening, told the former belligerents: "You have seen what war has wrought. You know what peace can bring. Seize this chance and make it work." [Excerpts from speeches, page A20.]
On paper, the 19-page accord leaves the multi-ethnic Bosnian state whole, and it was officially recognized as Bosnia and Herzegovina today by the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. But on the ground, the NATO peacekeeping force provided for in the accord will have the job of keeping apart the forces of Bosnia's two newly created components -- a Muslim-Croat federation and a Bosnian Serb republic.
Most of the NATO force, including 20,000 American troops, will be in place in northern Bosnia by February. As those troops keep the peace, the United Nations and other groups will take on such tasks as rebuilding the economy and resettling hundreds of thousands of refugees.
There were no tears of relief, no emotional scenes of reconciliation as Mr. Izetbegovic, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia filed in under the gilded cherubs in the Elysee ceiling to seal the accords.
They signed without saying a word, put the caps back on their fountain pens and shook hands perfunctorily, staring straight ahead and seldom applauding as speakers urged them to think of the tens of thousands of people killed by followers of these same men after the collapse of the Yugoslavia in 1991.
Then Mr. Clinton and the leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Russia and the European Union signed as sponsors, and Mr. Clinton shook hands with the three Balkan leaders.
It was the first time he had met Mr. Milosevic, who encouraged the Bosnian Serbs in their violent attempt to carve out a piece of Bosnia for themselves. [Later, in an interview on CNN, he said of the handshake, "I'm reminded of what my friend, the late Prime Minister Rabin said, 'You don't make peace with your friends.' "]
More than any of the others, Mr. Clinton has tied his political fate to the success of the agreement, by committing American soldiers to the NATO force over considerable opposition from Congress and at the start of his campaign for re-election.
In Bosnia, sporadic violence today underscored the potential risks. There were reports of explosions in Sarajevo -- apparently shells fired by Serbs who feel betrayed by the agreement -- while Government troops fired on a French United Nations helicopter and Croatian forces clashed with pro-Government Islamic fighters. There were no reports of casualties.
Mr. Clinton assured the three Balkan leaders in meetings before the signing ceremony that the NATO force, commanded by Gen. George A. Joulwan of the United States, would act impartially. He also asked them to do all they could to insure that the NATO peacekeepers were not attacked as the United Nations peacekeepers so often were, American officials said.
Mr. Milosevic of Serbia warned, "The key to success in the mission is even-handedness, even as the basis of its failure is partiality."
He and the Bosnian Serb forces -- which he had initially sponsored, then broke with after suffering years of international economic sanctions -- were blamed for setting off the war in early 1991 to create a Greater Serbia out of the ruins of Yugoslavia. Mr. Milosevic accepted terms today that fell far short of that.
Mr. Tudjman, whose army drove more than 100,000 Serbs out of Croatia last summer and set the stage for the American negotiating push that led to the peace agreement, spoke in terms that brooked no admission of responsibility for the war.
The former Yugoslavia, he said, had collapsed for deep historical reasons. Summarizing nearly two thousand years of events culminating in the Versailles Treaty that created Yugoslavia after World War I, he said: "It was established within the scope of the Versailles order from peoples belonging to different cultural spheres, in an area which first witnessed, in ancient times, the division of the Roman Empire, followed by the rift between the Western-Roman and Eastern-Byzantine parts of the Christian world, and, in the Middle Ages, partial Islamization occasioned by the Ottoman invasion."
Under the agreement, which was largely brokered by Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, Bosnia and Herzegovina remains one country with its existing international borders. An elected group presidency is to be established, along with a national currency.
But reflecting battlefield reality, the territory will be divided into two sub-entities, with about half governed by a Bosnian-Croatian federation and half by a Bosnian Serb republic. Among the major questions are whether the Bosnian Muslims and Croats -- former enemies -- will cooperate with each other, and whether the Serbs will in effect secede, joining the Serbian motherland.
In a country where more than a million people have been forced from their homes, the plan also lays out ambitious, some think fanciful targets for rapid elections, repatriation of displaced people, compensation for property losses, protection of human rights and economic rebuilding.
Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Izetbegovic exchanged letters in Mr. Clinton's presence at the American Ambassador's residence here this morning, an American official said, pledging to exchange ambassadors between Mr. Milosevic's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Mr. Izetbegovic's Bosnia and Herzegovina within 60 days.
But Croatia and Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro, did not recognize each other today. The leaders did agree to choose Jacques Klein, an American diplomat, as head of the United Nations transitional authority in the Serb-occupied Croatian province of Eastern Slavonia, which the Serbs have agreed to give back to Croatia.
Because of tremendous traffic jams created by a three-week-old public transport strike, dignitaries had to helicopter in from Orly Airport and make their way to a lunch at the French Foreign Ministry.
Mr. Chirac insisted on having the signing ceremony at Elysee Palace despite the strikes, in part to stake a French claim to credit for the agreement. France has lost 56 soldiers in Bosnia, and French diplomats complained that Mr. Holbrooke had run roughshod over his European colleagues in Dayton.

HEADLINE: BALKAN ACCORD: THE OUTLOOK;
History vs. History: Foes in Bosnia Invoke the Past

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The Bosnian war was long sustained by the manipulation of history, used by the parties to justify acts of barbarism and by Western powers to explain their prolonged inaction. Today, as a treaty was signed here to end the worst conflict in Europe since World War II, history was once again a theme and the varied allusions to it suggested the fragility of the peace.
President Clinton, abruptly changing his views on Bosnian history, tried to portray a society long distinguished by understanding between different ethnic and religious groups. "Bosnia," he said, "once found unity in its diversity," adding that the lives there of Muslims, Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats and Jews were "woven together by marriage and culture." 
 It was a remarkable turnabout for the President who, as recently as the June summit of the world's major economic powers in Canada, portrayed the Bosnian war as intractable because rooted in hatreds going back "at least to the 11th century."
In fact, the truth about Bosnia lies somewhere between the history of harmony elaborated today by the President and his earlier allusions to a 1,000-year-old war. It would take a considerable stretch of the imagination to see Bosnia's past as a natural beacon to peace.
A terrible civil war, which took hundreds of thousands of lives, was fought within Bosnia during World War II. Revolts racked the area in the 1870's. The movements of Croatian and Serb nationalism that have marked Balkan history over the past two centuries have long caused moments of unease as the Croats and Serbs of Bosnia wrestled with their identity.
Above all, the country has no recent independent history of peaceful existence on which to build: for centuries it has been ruled by outside imperial powers or by the Communist authorities of Yugoslavia.
Thus the settlement today is really an attempt to usher a new country into being. Independence in April of 1992 led immediately to war: the state never came to life because it immediately came under assault from the Serbs. This war has destroyed and polarized a unique society, one that has indeed known the harmony President Clinton described, but also one that has not governed itself in peace for centuries.
This reality gives a measure of the challenge facing the 20,000 American troops who are going now to Bosnia as part of a NATO force to police the peace. Even greater, perhaps, will be the challenge facing the international civilian authorities who will try organize democratic elections and put in place a police force that can assure security for refugees returning home.
They will be working in a Bosnian state that officially has two armies -- one Serb and one of the Muslim-Croat federation -- but in reality has three: one Serb, one Croat and one mainly Muslim. They will be also working in a state where words like "democracy" and the "rule of law" are more slogans than conditions that people understand. After World War II, Germany was there to be rebuilt; after this war, Bosnia has to be formed.
The reluctance of these different forces to come together to form the single multi-ethnic Bosnian state backed by the United States and western Europe was evident in the words of Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President. At a moment of peace, he chose to devote almost all his speech to an account of Balkan history that dwelt heavily on division and violence.
Thus, he dismissed the former Yugoslavia as a failed attempt to bring together "peoples belonging to different cultural spheres." These divergent spheres, he argued, were evident as early as the the Roman Empire, whose line of division between what he called "Western-Roman and Eastern-Byzantine" parts ran through the Balkans.
In plain English, what Mr. Tudjman was saying was that the Catholic Croats and Eastern Orthodox Serbs never belonged in the same state and were culturally incompatible.
That, in Mr. Tudjman's argument today, is why Yugoslavia fell apart during World War II and why only the Commuist authority of Tito could hold it together after that. Communism's collapse in Europe led in turn to what Mr. Tudjman called a "Yugo-Communist aggression" aimed at creating "a Greater Serbia" that swooped down on Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Turning to his nominal allies, the Muslims of Bosnia, Mr. Tudjman was disparaging. He described them as a religious group that had been reinvented as a "separate ethnic entity" by Tito in an attempt to use them as a buffer between Serbs and Croats. This attempt, he added, was a failure.
The bits of history that Mr. Tudjman left out were perhaps as interesting as those he chose to dwell on. These included the genocidal assault on Serbs by the Nazi puppet Croatian state during World War II and his own provocations to Croatia's Serb minority before the Croatian war. But all the history -- averred and unspoken -- scarcely suggested a future of Balkan harmony.
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, was less concerned with history, but nonetheless ready to edit it to his ends. Having roused Serbs into a violent national fervor in the late 1980s and so destabilized Yugoslavia, he declared today that only "civil and humane" means should be used to settle disputes "at the end of the 20th century."
Just four years ago, in March 1991, as Yugoslavia was disintegrating, Mr. Milosevic declared, "If we have to we will fight," adding that Serbs may not "know how to work and do business but at least we know how to fight."
Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President, said he would work for peace but suggested that the historical struggle for a united Bosnia was not over. The bitter history of the war would not lead to a quest for vengeance, he said, but "the guilty must be punished because guilt does exist." His words were full of a bitterness reflecting the deep suffering of Bosnia's Muslims and suggesting that conflict still lurks just below the surface.
As for the French, the hosts to the signing in the Elysee Palace, they have been engaged in their own argument over history with the Americans. This has centered on who should take credit for the peace agreement, hammered out in Dayton, Ohio, and forged by Richard Holbrooke, an Assistant Secretary of State. The French object to the fact that the settlement is widely referred to as the "Dayton Accords."
Today, Mr. Chirac praised the Americans but dwelt more heavily on the sacrifices of French soldiers -- 56 of whom died as peacekeepers in Bosnia -- and on the work of Alain Juppe, the Prime Minister, whose ideas, he said, laid the basis for the success in Dayton.
The French President also tried to make a historical point through the exploitation of protocol. He placed Mr. Holbrooke in the fourth row, an anoymous figure toward the back of the gilded room. Such a figure, the French were saying, could not have been the central figure in the successful push for peace.

Hospital Care Bill Is Stalled

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
A bill backed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman that would have financed hospital care for indigent patients was stalled yesterday in the Assembly Budget Committee when Democrats opposed raising cigarette taxes by 25 cents. Republican committee members had enough votes to pass the bill, but they wanted to share responsibility for a tax increase, said Assemblyman Walter Kavanaugh, a Republican of Somerville, who heads the panel. 
 The Legislature has until Dec. 31 to find a way to pay for charity care, which is now financed by diverting money collected through the unemployment insurance fund.

Germans Reduce Both Key Interest Rates

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Germany's central bank cut its main lending rates to their lowest levels in more than seven years today, taking a step that could help sputtering European economies and make it easier for the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the United States.
The Bundesbank said it lowered the discount rate and the Lombard rate half a percentage point each because growth in the German money supply had fallen far below the bank's target, there was no danger of rekindled inflation, and the mark was strong. 
 Bank officials denied that the rate reduction was directly aimed at stimulating the German economy. But by lowering the cost of borrowing, economists said, the bank would prevent the economy from stagnating in 1996 and keep the country's troublesome unemployment from rising faster.
At the same time, the economists said, the impact of the central bank's action would be felt across Europe. Because Germany's economy is the biggest in Europe, the Bundesbank essentially sets monetary policy for all of Europe.
"You have inflation under control in Germany; you have a struggling business, a weak labor market," said Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland here. "So why not cut rates?"
The Bundesbank reduced its discount rate to 3 percent from 3.5 percent and the other key index, the Lombard rate, to 5 percent from 5.5 percent. The discount rate, which is charged on loans the central bank makes to commercial banks to meet their liquidity needs, sets a floor under German money market rates. The Lombard rate is charged on emergency loans made to banks and acts as a ceiling.
The central bank also cut the securities-repurchase rate, a money market rate at which it does most of its lending to commercial banks, to 3.75 percent from 3.98 percent. In the last few months, it has been pushing down the repurchase rate gradually.
Announcing the rate cuts, the bank raised its target for growth in the broad measure of the German money supply to a range of 3 percent to 7 percent next year, from the current range of 3 percent to 6 percent.
After the German rate reduction, the central banks of Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria and Ireland lowered their interest rates. The Bank of Switzerland cut interest rates today before the Bundesbank acted, and Britain trimmed its official lending rate on Wednesday.
Today was the third time this year the Germans reduced their key interest rates. In March and August, they lowered rates one-half a percentage point.
In taking such action, the bank hopes to make borrowing by businesses and consumers less costly, stimulating economic activity. Because lower interest rates make the mark less attractive, the Bundesbank is also hoping to weaken the strong currency, which has made German exports expensive in terms of other currencies.
However, the dollar fell against the mark after the rate cut was announced yesterday. The Bundesbank's action had been widely expected, so currency levels already reflected lower German rates. Traders also said they thought that today's action would be the Bundesbank's last cut for some time.
Besides Germany, one of the immediate beneficiaries of the rate cut is likely to be France.
Lower German interest rates will allow the French central bank to lower its own rates at a critical time. France has endured more than three weeks of strikes by public employees over planned tax increases and cuts in social spending to reduce the nation's deficits. Lower interest rates will make it easier for President Jacques Chirac's officials to meet budget goals, reduce unemployment and generate tax revenue.
The cut also comes at a propitious time for Europe more broadly. The national leaders of the 15 European Union countries are to meet in Madrid on Friday and Saturday at their semiannual conference. At the top of the agenda will be how quickly they can move toward creating a single currency in Europe, in particular whether France and other nations will be able to reduce their budget deficits enough to be included in the first round of monetary union.
Lower rates will presumably reassure them that the Bundesbank is not about to work against their efforts and that there may be a chance of meeting the Jan. 1, 1999, deadline.
However, Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's president, insisted today that the rate cut had nothing to do with the Madrid meeting or with France's problems. "We decide when we think it's correct," he said at a news conference. "The E.U. summit had no influence. We don't base our decisions on the reaction in any country."
In three previous meetings, Mr. Tietmeyer said, bank policy makers had discussed whether to cut rates and had decided to hold off until they were able to readjust the target for money-supply growth at the same time. He emphasized the Bundesbank's independence, saying there had been no formal agreement with other countries' central banks about when it lowered rates. Mr. Tietmeyer added, though, that Bundesbank officials were in "constant contact" with those institutions.
While the German central bank had a reputation in the early 1990's of being insensitive to the economic problems of neighboring European countries, under Mr. Tietmeyer it has shown more of a sense that it is part of a greater Europe.
Still, Germany's guiding concern is its own lagging economy. While the year began with great hopes of growth above 3 percent, output is now rising at an annual rate of only 1.5 percent.
Economists expect similar growth through much of 1996, and some predict that the economy will enter a mild recession by the end of the year. With the mark strong, German businesses have entered an oddly grim period in which measures of pessimism are near record highs and unemployment is rising.
Mr. Tietmeyer denied that there was any prospect of a recession. "Various indicators point to the fact that a recession is not threatening," he said. "We expect the continuation of economic growth. This rate cut should contribute somewhat."
While economists said the Bundesbank's rate cuts would not figure directly in any decision by the Federal Reserve, the American central bank, to lower rates, it underscored a general agreement among central bankers that inflation was under control and that the primary threat was too little growth, not too rapid growth. The Fed's rate-setting committee will consider reductions at a meeting starting on Tuesday.

Rate Outlook Keeps Bond Prices Steady

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Bond prices were steady yesterday as economic reports failed to raise expectations that the Federal Reserve would reduce interest rates next week or early next year.
The Treasury's 30-year bond was little changed, as its yield edged up to 6.08 percent, from 6.07 percent Wednesday. 
 Bond prices initially rose after the Government said consumer prices were unchanged last month for the first time in almost five years. But they pulled back after other reports reflected enough economic growth to raise doubts over whether the Fed would take action at its policy-setting meeting next week.
"There's really no reason to shift one direction or the other until we see what happens," said Jan Faller, who helps manage $4 billion in bonds at Panagora Asset Management in Boston.
Optimism about a possible interest rate cut fostered a bond market rally that drove Treasury yields to a two-year low of 6.02 percent by Dec. 4 and handed bond investors the best returns in a decade.
"If we don't get a rate cut now, you can't continue to have this kind of market," said Tom Seay, who manages $500 million of bonds at the Lexington Management Corporation in Saddle Brook, N.J.
The Federal Reserve is to hold its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday and its following meeting on Jan. 30 and 31. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy arm, have not cut interest rates since July, when they lowered the target for overnight loans between banks a quarter percentage point, to 5.75 percent.
Expectations that the Fed will cut rates were bolstered by the Bundesbank's decision yesterday to lower German bank rates and Wednesday's rate cut in Britain. "You have people thinking the Fed is the next one to fall into place, and that global interest rates are heading down," said Joseph LaVorgna, a money market economist at Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York.
Moreover, he said, inflation is restrained enough to keep it from becoming an immediate issue at Tuesday's Fed meeting. "If you wanted to use the C.P.I. to make your case against cutting rates, you can't do that now," Mr. LaVorgna said.
But other analysts said the Fed could be dissuaded from cutting rates by a Labor Department report that claims for unemployment benefits tumbled 37,000 last week, more than the 6,000 drop anticipated and the biggest decline in almost five months.
"In light of this resurgence in the labor market, it will be very difficult" for the Fed to cut interest rates, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus Ohio.
In another sign of brisk economic growth, the Fed reported that output at factories, mines and utilities rose two-tenths of 1 percent in November, more than the steady reading economists expected. Production declined three-tenths of 1 percent in October.
"The economy isn't rolling over, so there's no momentum to drive the bond's yield through 6 percent," Mr. Seay of Lexington said.
And Kevin McClintock, head of taxable fixed-income investments at the Dreyfus Corporation, said the inability of bond yields to drop below 6 percent, even with yesterday's good news on inflation, suggested that "we're close to the end of the bond market rally."

Dollar Falls on Profit Taking After German Interest-Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday in what was regarded as a round of profit taking, after the German central bank reduced its key interest rates, a move many traders had anticipated.
The action by the Bundesbank would typically give the dollar a lift, since lower rates often hurt a currency by making investments denominated in it less attractive. 
 But the opposite happened yesterday because traders had already assuming a German rate cut by early next year at the latest. And the prospect that the Federal Reserve might cut rates in the United States next week left little incentive to buy dollars, analysts said.
"The interest-rate differential for the dollar has gotten as good as it will get in the near term, and so it fell," said Richard Koss of MFR Inc., a money-management and consulting firm.
The dollar was last quoted in New York late yesterday at 1.4377 German marks, down from 1.45 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also slid to 101.50 Japanese yen from 101.68 yen. The declines were exaggerated by low trading volume.
In other currency dealing, the British pound rose to $1.5433, from $1.5327 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.1633 Swiss francs from 1.1751 francs and to 4.9519 French francs from 5.0061 francs.
The Germans reduced their discount rate, which sets a floor under their money market rates, by half a percentage point, to 3 percent, the lowest level since July 1988. The Lombard rate, its ceiling for money-market rates, was also cut half a point, to 5 percent.
In Washington, a Government report that American consumer prices were unchanged in November for the first time since March 1991 also encouraged speculation that the Federal Reserve would cut rates when its policy-setting panel meets on Tuesday. With numerous signs that economic growth is flagging in the United States, the absence of a significant risk that inflation might accelerate could persuade the Fed to act, analysts said.
While that would narrow the interest-rate difference with Germany, the overall economic outlook for the United States -- steady, if slow growth with low inflation -- could make the dollar more attractive.

NEW YORK CITY
 
Banner Year for Hotels
This holiday season in New York, hotel rooms are as hard to come by as cabs in the rain. Given a bolstered economy, a weak dollar overseas, cheap air fares and an event-filled fall season, the entire city was effectively sold out the first two weekends in December. [Page A1.]
 

Man Arrested in Subway Fire
An 18-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested in last month's fatal attack on a subway token clerk in which the killers set fire to his booth after spraying it with a flammable liquid. As many as four others are still being sought in the attack. The man told the police that robbery was the sole purpose and that he knew nothing about a similar incident in the movie "Money Train," officials said last night. [B1.]
 
A Death and a Diary
A grand jury indicted George Delury of Manhattan on manslaughter charges for helping his chronically ill wife commit suicide last summer. The charge itself was unusual, but still more remarkable was the release of Mr. Delury's diary, a three-month chronicle of his agonizing deliberations on how to deal with the partner who had become the focus and burden of his existence. [B1.]
 
Voice of Vendors' Leader
Morris Powell, a vendor of pies and oils on 125th Street in Harlem, has long cried out to be heard. In language that veers between reason and polemic, he argues the need for Harlem's black community to embrace its own and support black-owned businesses. Now his words are being listened to, closely, by investigators of the fatal arson attack on Freddy's clothing store. [B1.]
The emergency water supply to the sprinkler system had been disconnected before the store was set afire, officials said. [B6.]
The Jewish Action Alliance has emerged at the forefront of the controversy swirling around the fire in Harlem. [B6].
 
City Cloaked in Indifference?
The coat in the basement no longer fit. These things happen. So Kenneth Piech left it with New York Cares, at its dropoff point in Penn Station, to be given to the homeless and others in need. By New Year's, the agency hopes to hand out 75,000 of them. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Repeated Hospital Stays
The homeless man charged with stabbing a child with a hypodermic needle spent time at two psychiatric institutions after escaping from a third hospital upstate, the Manhattan District Attorney said. [B3.]
 
The Mayor Takes a Thrashing
It happens these days at every town meeting and on every radio show: Mayor Giuliani gives his explanation of how mayors and Council members and commissioners have not had a raise in eight years, but the crowds have heard it all before and are not buying it. [B3.]
 
The Most Eligible Highchair
Much of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's personal property, including the desk on which a nuclear test-ban treaty was signed in 1963, a 40-carat diamond ring she received from Aristotle Onassis and John F. Kennedy Jr.'s highchair, is to be auctioned at Sotheby's beginning April 23. [C3.]
 
REGION
 
Surprising Superintendent
Lottie L. Taylor, a respected educational consultant, was at the center of a bitter dispute between the Roosevelt Board of Education and the state panel overseeing the district's recovery -- and then she emerged as Roosevelt's interim superintendent. [B5.]
 
Authority to Keep Airport
The Port Authority decided not to turn Newark International Airport over to a management company, saying none had experience in running such a large airport. [B5.]
 
A Slog for Commuters
Even though only an inch or two of snow fell in most parts of the metropolitan area, turning to rain in many places by early afternoon, commuters faced a slog. [B5.]
 
Insanity Defense Rejected
A former probation officer, Ray J. Macaro Jr., 52, accused of faking insanity for almost seven years, was convicted of killing his father and two elderly aunts in their Westchester County home. [B5.]
 
Pataki Proposing Job Cuts
Governor Pataki's new budget is to propose reducing the state workforce by 7,400 employees, mainly through buyouts and early retirement programs, which his aides say may save at least $225 million. [B4.]
 
An Offer They Didn't Refuse
What if a company made a buyout offer to its employees and everybody took it? That is nearly what happened at the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, which is in a hurry to trim its work force before a merger early next year. [D1.]

HEADLINE: A Gambling Boom Pits a Church Against Biloxi

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss.

 BODY:
Thirty-two years ago, Back Bay Mission waded into controversy when its staff tried to help integrate this resort city's whites-only beaches. Vandals broke the mission's windows, someone burned a cross outside, and members deserted its church, which soon closed.
The mission itself, a church-affiliated provider of social services, survived, but controversy has found it again. This time, in a sign of how much life on Mississippi's Gulf Coast has changed since the state legalized dockside gambling in 1990, the issue is not race but real estate, and gaming's importance to this city. 
 Specifically, in a local economy that has suddenly been thrust into high gear by the legalization of casino gambling, what fair price should the mission receive in exchange for surrendering its property to a big new casino, scheduled to open next summer, and to a municipal government eager to see that casino thrive?
So broke five years ago that it could not afford new tires for its police force, Biloxi, a melange of graceful beachfront homes and tourist-trapping T-shirt shops, now boasts eight casinos, built atop immense barges moored to the shore. Together they paid local taxes of about $11.5 million in the last fiscal year, nearly a fifth of the city's budget. These days Biloxi is flush enough to buy 82 new police cruisers.
A mile north of the beaches, the mission's modest compound sits well away from most of the action. Founded in the 1920's to give medical care to poor families who worked in seafood processing factories, the mission, affiliated with the 1.5-million-member United Church of Christ, no longer holds religious services and does not house the homeless. Instead, it is a charitable incubator that creates and nurtures nonprofit social service centers: a health clinic, a shelter for battered women and a counseling center for people with H.I.V.
But what the mission is now best known for is its location, on two acres of land next to a bayside tract owned by Imperial Palace of Las Vegas, which is erecting a $120 million casino complex including a 29-story hotel that will be the tallest building on the Gulf Coast between Tampa, Fla., and New Orleans.
The battle of Back Bay Mission began when the casino tried to buy about 80 percent of the mission's acreage, and the city, wanting to widen the road into the casino's parking lot, exercised its power of eminent domain by claiming the rest.
The mission resisted. The bottom line was not so much morals as money: the mission, citing the rise in local land values that gambling had brought, said the offers -- $1.2 million by the casino, under $500,000 by the city -- were far too low.
Talks between the mission and the casino ultimately ended. But the city pursued its claim in a county court, and a jury earlier this year settled on a price of $514,000, little more than what the city had offered in the first place. Now bulldozers engaged in the road-widening project have moved in and demolished two of the mission's nine buildings, only four of which are to be left standing under the city's plans.
The mission remains defiant. While pursuing an appeal to the State Supreme Court, it says that regardless of the outcome it will hold on to its remaining property, which it values at some $3.2 million, and continue operations in the shadow of the casino.
"It's not going to be a pleasant place for them to be," said Britt R. Singletary, a local lawyer for Imperial Palace. "There's going to be 16,000 cars a day going by that place."
The mission's lawyer, Virgil Gillespie maintains that "the city has not gone about this in the right way" and that indeed "this mission has been abused."
"Of course they would sell if the price was right, if they could make themselves whole at another site," Mr. Gillespie said. "But the advent of the gaming industry has made it so that buying a piece of comparable property can't be done for a song today. They need more money to move."
But Mr. Singletary argues that the mission and other Biloxi landowners have "gone crazy as far as market values -- whatever people think they can extort from a casino."
The drama here is one of many played out around the country as a result of gambling's rolling from coast to coast during the last decade. Once banned by the Federal Government, lotteries are now offered by 37 states. Casinos, once limited to Nevada, have sprung up on city blocks, riverboats and Indian reservations in more than 20 other states. With gross revenue of $40 billion a year, gambling is being eyed hungrily by communities as an eminently taxable growth industry.
Here in Biloxi, officials jumped at the Imperial Palace project, which planners say will bring more than 2,000 jobs and about $4 million in annual tax revenue.
The man offering the city these riches is a colorful Las Vegas entrepreneur, Ralph Engelstad. A former North Dakota contractor, Mr. Engelstad built the Imperial Palace 20 years ago and turned it into a money machine that generates an annual cash flow of $50 million. Last year Forbes magazine listed him among the 400 wealthiest Americans.
Mr. Engelstad, whose collection of classic automobiles includes the 1938 Mercedes-Benz that was Hitler's parade car, acquired brief notoriety nearly seven years ago, when Nevada's Gaming Control Board determined that he had hurt that state's image by holding parties for his Las Vegas employees on Hitler's birthday in 1986 and 1988. At the time, Mr. Engelstad denied that he held Nazi sympathies and apologized for what he called "theme" parties intended to boost employee morale. But he agreed to pay $1.5 million in fines.
What no side in the Biloxi battle disputes is that gambling has changed the face of the city.
Casinos have rendered Biloxi a place of visual paradoxes, with a waterfront that juxtaposes upper-crust Southern graciousness with come-all Nevada-style glitz. Beauvoir, the neatly preserved estate of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, stands within sight of the flashing neon lights of the President Casino.
Gambling flourished here once before, but on a smaller scale and without legal sanction. Thirty years ago Biloxi served as a shady playground for New Orleans, the sort of place where a friendly bartender could guide eager day-trippers to slot machines and backroom card games. Federal investigations shut that down, with help from Hurricane Camille, which turned Biloxi's beachfront to matchsticks in 1969. Tourism took a nosedive and stayed down for 20 years.
Now, city officials say, the Gulf Coast is roaring back on a gambling boom, drawing tourists from Florida, Louisiana and Texas. Building permits are up, unemployment is down, and Mississippians who quit the coast during its long recession to make a living in Las Vegas are flocking home.
Among them is Bruce Nourse, a Gulf Coast native who is senior vice president for government affairs and compliance at Casino Magic, a 100,000-square-foot operation on the city's oceanfront.
"The City of Biloxi," he said, "has done a very good job of being a partner with this industry and understanding our needs and getting adequate infrastructure in place."
Mr. Nourse is a former investigator for the Nevada Gaming Control Board and also former executive director of Mississippi's gaming commission. In 1992, that commission issued a report predicting that legalized gambling would bring $100 million in capital investment to the state. Instead, Mr. Nourse said, casino companies have now built properties worth $2 billion, with more to come.
The resulting rise in land values has not escaped the notice of Back Bay Mission's president, the Rev. Paul E. Baumer of Columbus, Ohio, who earlier this fall wrote Mr. Engelstad's chief aide in Las Vegas to tell him that the mission property not already claimed by the city was worth $3.2 million, not the $1.2 million Imperial Palace was offering.
Talk of a sale ended there. But next to the mission, work on the casino goes on. A sign out front promises that 100 of Mr. Engelstad's classic cars will be on display.
In the meantime, the war between the mission and the city continues. The mission's appeal to the State Supreme Court maintains that the city's eminent-domain action violated a Federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which provides that governmental interference with religious practice must demonstrate a "compelling interest."
The appeal also maintains that eminent domain was improperly exercised in this case because it was invoked on behalf of a private interest, the casino. Not so, said David Nichols, Biloxi's chief administrative officer. "The bottom line is a public safety issue," he said. "That's the only reason we're widening the road."
The dispute has left all sides frustrated.
For his part, Mr. Nichols said he had "lost sympathy" for the mission. "They're using us to facilitate their financial gain," he said, "and I'm tired of it."
The mission's executive director, the Rev. David E. Stephens, responded by saying: "Any private landowner would have been expected to get the best price. But somehow the church was seen as behaving in an unseemly way by trying to get the best price. It comes across as, 'You're trying to cheat this poor casino out of money.' "
Mr. Stephens said he would advise the mission's directors to keep it operating on what will remain of its property, essentially continuing its work in Imperial Palace's front yard.
Casino officials too feel frustrated, at their inability to reach accord with their neighbor. "There's a number out there that should be acceptable to both parties," Mr. Singletary said. "But I don't know that it exists."

HEADLINE: A Bountiful Season for New York City Hotels

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
The Samuelson family, visiting from Boston, had set aside an entire week to see friends in New York and go to the theater. But they were not able to get reservations for either of the weekends they planned to be in the city. So they have been splitting their time between the Marriott Marquis in Times Square on the weekdays and hotels in Stamford, Conn., on the weekends.
"It wasn't a big deal," said Robert Samuelson, a 25-year-old graphics designer who is in town with his parents, about the inconvenience. "We know people in Connecticut. I probably wouldn't do it again, though." 
 What the Samuelsons are experiencing is no different from what thousands of others are enduring this holiday season in New York, where hotel rooms are as hard to come by as cabs in the rain.
Indeed, New York hotels are finishing what looks to be a banner year. And with a confluence of factors in its favor -- a bolstered economy, a weak dollar overseas, a rash of cheap air fares and an event-filled fall season -- the holiday season, hoteliers say, may be the best in more than a decade.
Since the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau began keeping track of occupancy records in 1988, "there's never been a holiday season like this in New York," said Steven Morello, president of the bureau.
The entire city was effectively sold out for the first two weekends in December, according to the bureau. With holiday shopping, this is traditionally a strong time anyway. But the last two weeks of the month -- ordinarily a slow period because business travel declines during the holidays and many leisure travelers want to be at home -- are looking rosier than usual: reservations indicate that the drop-off that occurs at this time will be less precipitous this year.
A peak season telephone line established in October by the visitors' bureau to help travelers find rooms has been taking more than 800 calls a day.
"We're busier in our traditional downtimes," said Paul O'Neil, the managing director at both of Manhattan's Sheraton hotels. "When typically in the week before Christmas it would be very, very slow, now we're just going to be slow. And between Christmas and New Year's, when it would traditionally be extremely slow -- historically, we run 50 percent occupancy -- we're going to be busy, closer to 75 percent."
A year ago, the occupancy rate for the entire month of December, 76.2 percent, was the highest December figure in the 1990's, and this year, reservations are running high enough that hoteliers say they expect that figure to be surpassed.
While firm statistics for November and early December have yet to be compiled, analysts say that so far this month more than 90 percent of the city's 58,000 or so hotel rooms have been slept in -- or at least paid for. And it is likely that November will top last year's record 82.2 percent. In October, the city's 231 hotels reported an occupancy rate of 91.9 percent, the second-highest monthly figure ever.
This season, hotels have been helped partly by the calendar; both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Mondays, giving people the chance for long holiday weekends. But it's also true, hoteliers say, that visitors are coming later than they might have because they were not able to find a place to stay earlier, with the city crowded because of events like the papal visit, the New York City Marathon and the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.
Continuing the turnaround that began in 1994, when the hotel occupancy rate for the year leaped nearly sixpercentage points over the previous year, hotels in New York are predicting that the final figure for 1995 will increase another percentage point, to 76.5 percent, even as the average room rate rose $6, to $150 per night.
"It's the best occupancy New York hotels have had in 15 years," said Robert Diener, president of Hotel Reservations Network, a reservations service that books more than 150,000 room nights in the city annually.
Jonathan M. Tisch, president and chief executive of the Loews hotel chain, which has four hotels in Manhattan, concurred.
"In the early 90's, we hoteliers were looking at each other wondering if we should check into each other's hotels," he said, adding that this year, rates increased from 5 to 12 percent at all his New York properties -- the Loews New York, the Regency Hotel, the Howard Johnson and Days Inn -- and all have become more profitable.
Other businesses, of course, have also benefited from the influx of visitors. According to the entertainment trade weekly Variety, attendance at Broadway theaters the week after Thanksgiving (the most recent figure available) was up 5 1/2 percent over the same week a year ago. At the Rainbow Room, the restaurant and nightclub high above Rockefeller Center, business since Thanksgiving is up 27 percent.
The reasons for the overall upturn are manifold, industry experts say. For one, the weakness of the dollar abroad has lured foreign tourists. For another, the message that both the tourist industry and the Giuliani administration have been striving to get out -- that crime is down and the city is one of the nation's safest -- is indeed getting out.
There was also a proliferation of low airline fares to New York this year, spurred by the emergence of smaller carriers like Carnival Air, Kiwi Air and Tower Air. And last, but probably not least, is the reduction of six percentage points in state and city taxes on hotel rooms that took effect last year, which has helped the city sell itself as a destination to businesses, which tend to negotiate bulk rates at hotels for their employees and convention attendees.
Julie Marker, a Baltimore travel agent who could not find a hotel room for two top clients, can testify to the surge.
"We needed four nights, Dec. 5 through Dec. 9," Ms. Marker said, "and a week prior, we tried easily 60 hotels, and then beginning on Monday I'd call at least 25 every morning. I managed to find my clients rooms for two nights. But then they were stuck out in East Rutherford, N.J., for the last two."
In the end, Ms. Marker landed two rooms for the last two nights at the New York Helmsley, for $320 a night per room. "These people were willing to pay whatever, for a suite, whatever," she said, "and when the sky's the limit, well, I've been in the business six years and I've never had that problem."
One afternoon this week at the Marriott Marquis, there were rooms available for the night, but desk clerks did not expect that to last: more than 500 reservations had not yet checked in.
Irene Diekmann and Berndt Fuhrmann, first-time visitors to New York from Germany, said they had made reservations in October and the Marquis was the last of the 20 or so hotels they tried.
"It was so terrible," said Ms. Diekmann, a college professor from Potsdam. "I asked them all, 'Why is it so hard?' and they said it was because this was shopping time in New York. I didn't understand, but now I do. Everyone is shopping."

GERMAN CUT OF 2 KEY RATES COULD AID AN EASING BY FED
The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, cut its main lending rates to their lowest levels in more than seven years, a step that could help sputtering European economies and make it easier for the Federal Reserve to lower rates in the United States. 
 The Bundesbank cut the discount rate and the Lombard rate half a percentage point each, saying that growth in the German money supply had fallen far below the bank's target, that there was no danger of rekindled inflation, and that the mark was strong.
 
The Bundesbank move would typically have given the dollar a lift, but traders had already assumed a German rate cut. In New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.4377 marks.
 
NBC FINDS AN ALL-NEWS ALLY IN A DEAL WITH MICROSOFT
Microsoft paid NBC $220 million for a half-stake in a new cable channel intended to challenge the Cable News Network and in an interactive on-line news service. But plenty of questions remain, ranging from whether the cable industry will embrace a direct competitor to CNN to whether there is enough audience to support two all-news networks.

SOMETHING LOST IN TRANSLATION?
Nokia, the Finnish maker of cellular phones, has got a lot of explaining to do to Wall Street. Investors are fuming because in recent statements, Nokia executives had been saying that business in key market segments was healthy. Yesterday, though, Nokia informed investors that it was restructuring a consumer electronics business it called a likely money-loser, and that growth in its mobile phone business was "slightly weaker than predicted."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Flat In November

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Consumer prices remained unchanged in November, the first time since the end of the 1990-91 recession that American households suffered no inflation, Labor Department figures showed today.
The report, in contrast to one earlier this week that showed producer prices surging last month, helped restore the confidence of a number of economists that the Federal Reserve would relax monetary policy next Tuesday at its final meeting of the year. 
 Several recent economic measures have shown that the economy is slowing markedly, with the Commerce Department adding fresh evidence today with a report that business inventories climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in October, the biggest rise since April, to the highest point relative to sales in two years.
"With the really good inflation news and the decelerating economy, the Fed has plenty of latitude to ease," said Veronika C. White, an economist at First Fidelity Bancorporation in Philadelphia. She predicted the Fed would cut it target rate for overnight bank loans by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, and repeat this action at the following meeting in January.
Two additional sets of figures published today were a bit stronger than expected, however, and a sizable group of analysts remains unconvinced the Fed will act, especially before Congress and the Clinton Administration reach a budget agreement.
"It's a close call," said Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro in New York. "But I don't think the Fed will want to provide stimulus with the economy growing at a moderate rate" and unemployment only about 5.5 percent.
Industrial production, the Fed reported today, rose two-tenths of 1 percent in November following an October downturn, while first-time claims for unemployment insurance dropped by 37,000 last week.
Although the consumer prices report was surprisingly positive, today's economic news had little lasting impact on the bond and stock markets, since many investors are now waiting to see what the Fed will actually do. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond edged up slightly, to 6.08 percent from 6.07 percent. [Page D13.] And stocks fell in late trading, pulled down by a selloff in technology issues. [Page D6.]
Although the price of items in their unvarying market basket did not rise last month, many consumers are increasingly pinched. The Labor Department calculated today that real average earnings fell four-tenths of 1 percent last month on a combination of shorter weekly hours and a slight decline in hourly earnings.
Indeed, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, expressed uneasiness about consumer debt today at a forum of the House of Representatives. While praising what he called the democratization of consumer credit, Mr. Lindsey pointed to households, many of them newer recipients of credit cards, that may be overextended.
Among the five reasons he cited for being "troubled" were depressed income growth, a smaller share of spending on goods that enhance wealth, high numbers of distressed consumers at a time of general prosperity and a mismatch between people making big profits in the stock and bond markets and the people who are most indebted.
Two of the major factors that kept the Consumer Price Index from rising for the first time since March 1991 were a nine-tenths of 1 percent decline in the price of energy and a 4 percent skid in airline fares.
Air fares jumped 20.4 percent in the first half of the year but have now reversed course and fallen 7.6 percent since June.
New cars, with 1996 models picked up by the statistical system over a three-month period, rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent. By contrast, cars and trucks contributed heavily to the jump of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index published Tuesday.
Food prices were lower by one-tenth of 1 percent after rising an average of four-tenths of 1 percent in September and October.
The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes the erratic energy and food components, edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, the best performance of the year, the report also showed.
New York City's higher subway fare helped push overall prices in the metropolitan area up one-tenth of 1 percent last month to a level that was 2.8 percent higher than in November 1994, slightly higher than the 2.6 percent 12-month increase posted by the nation at large.
The Commerce Department report of higher inventories for October, combined with an upward revision for September and a four-tenths of 1 percent decline in business sales, lifted the inventory-sales ratio to 1.43 months, matching July's two-year peak.
"The accumulation in inventories is involuntary," commented Debbie Johnson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence. "Look for production cuts up ahead."
The Fed's report of a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in industrial output last month was buoyed by the response of utilities to the demands of unusually cold weather but held back by the strike at Boeing. Factory output moved up two-tenths of 1 percent, reversing October's decline of that size.
Industry operated at 83.1 percent of capacity last month, down one-tenth of a point for the month and two full points below the peaks of last December and January.
The drop in first-time jobless claims was to 341,000 from 378,000 in the week ended Dec. 2, with the four-week moving average down 7,250, to 366,000. While analysts could not point to particular quirks in this notoriously volatile series, they said they doubted that it reflected actual strengthening of the labor market.
The Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, which now stands 53.6 percent above its 1982-84 average, showed services up two-tenths of 1 percent in November and running at a 2.9 percent annual rate for the latest three months compared with 3.1 percent for the three months ending with August.

HEADLINE: U.S. Again Tries a Trade Issue as a Carrot and Stick for Beijing

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
With pressure growing to respond to China's imprisonment of its best-known dissident, Clinton Administration officials said today that it would be politically impossible to support Beijing's demands for admission to the new World Trade Organization while it continues to repress dissent and to ignore a key trade accord with the United States.
In interviews today, a day after the one-day trial of Wei Jingsheng, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison for his advocacy of democracy, Administration officials continued to defend their policy of "constructive engagement" with China. They insisted that their decision not to link trade issues to an improved human rights record last year remains the best hope for influencing China's behavior over the long term, although that policy has come under renewed attack in Congress. 
 As a matter of practical politics, President Clinton's aides said, China's increasingly belligerent positions on human rights and trade issues are effectively linking the two subjects anyway.
With Congress threatening to revoke China's preferential trade status with the United States, officials said that the Administration is not likely to make the case that China should be given the ultimate economic reward: inclusion in the worldwide trade agreement that went into effect at the beginning of this year.
"It may be a moot issue, because China has still not met the commercial standards for admission," said one senior official, who insisted on anonymity. "But we are now sending them the message that while human rights is not explictly part of the negotiations, it is part of the atmosphere, and they are ignoring that at their peril."
The decision not to link human rights and trade was an emotional and hard-fought battle within the Administration in early 1994.
Those supporting the decision argued that stronger links between China and the West would ultimately encourage the democracy movement by bringing commerce, fax machines, computers and the Internet to the Chinese population -- forces the central Government would not be able to control.
But the results in the last 18 months have not been encouraging. More dissidents are imprisoned now than at any time since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Inside and outside the Clington Administration, opponents of the policy are beginning to stir.
For Beijing, admission to the World Trade Organization has become a major goal. While Washington is only one voice in the decision, it is the most influential, and so far it has blackballed China's candidacy while expressing a willingness to negotiate.
Among other steps, it has insisted that China must open its markets dramatically and enforce existing agreements -- including a hard-fought accord with the United States to protect music, software and movies, among other goods, from piracy. China has periodically responded that the American stance was part of an effort to contain Beijing's growing economic power.
Until a few weeks ago, Administration officials were saying they were encouraged by China's efforts to change its ways. But in the last few weeks, that optimism has been reversed. Now Mr. Wei's sentencing has changed the politics of the trade issues.
"We feel we went out on a limb for the Chinese, and they sawed it off," a senior official who advises Mr. Clinton on economic issues said today. "They refuse to get the message."

HEADLINE: It's Time to Reinvent Freud

BYLINE: By Richard A. Shweder; Richard A. Shweder, professor of human development at the University of Chicago, is currently a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
There is a panic inherent in the anticipation of professional extinction that is the dread of Freud's disciples these days.
The announcement by the Library of Congress that it would shelve an exhibition titled "Sigmund Freud: Conflict and Culture" coincided with the winter meeting of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, prophetically titled "Is There a Place for Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture?" -- thereby confirming the fear of many psychoanalysts that the answer may be "no." 
 The library's half-hearted decision to put the great guru in cold storage left some analysts in a sweat, feeling defensive, unloved and full of self-doubt about their prospects in the intellectual and economic marketplace. The delay is probably less important than it seems. The authority of curators to be unchallenged arbiters of taste has evaporated over the past decade. In this age of "identity politics" and hotly contested points of view, the very idea of "public culture" has become an oxymoron.
And one does not need a degree in economics to figure out that if exhibitors cannot be highly selective, discerning and partial, then any display or narration about a controversial subject is probably going to be too expensive to mount. The library was just spineless and poor.
The declining mental health of our nation's psychoanalysts, however, is a real matter for concern. Is there a place for psychoanalysis in contemporary culture? What should we tell them to do about their dread?
For starters, let's not deny their reality. Freud has many intellectual enemies. And they are far more numerous and varied than the 42 critics (including Gloria Steinem and Oliver Sacks) who signed a petition urging the Library of Congress to shower the Viennese doctor with venom rather than just glory.
Here is the short version of the enemies list. Sociobiologists don't like Freud because they think family members have no sexual interest in one another. Cognitive scientists don't like Freud because they think the "unconscious mind" is a rapidly firing network of widely distributed neurons, with no mind of its own. Behavioral geneticists don't like Freud because they really think biology is destiny and that early childhood experience has very little to do with your life.
Postmodernists don't like Freud because they think that interpretation is merely free association, while Freud believed that by studying free association he might uncover the true meaning of a "text." Feminists don't like Freud because they think he discounted reports of sexual abuse, disparaged the female body and collaborated with his buddies against his female clients. They think Freud was a patriarch.
Even academic psychologists and philosophers of science don't like Freud. The academic psychologists think that the study of the mind has nothing to do with sex, religion, literature, mythology or the history of civilizations, while Freud, bless his heart, made those topics the core of his curriculum. And the philosophers of science come in two kinds: those who think Freud's tenets are untestable and hence unworthy of scientific consideration, and those who think his tenets are testable and have been shown to be false. So the rap on Freud is not very good.
The word is out in the medical world. It takes too long to "know thyself." Increments of personal insight are hard to measure or reimburse. Moreover, medical interns get nervous when they have to speak to their patients. They know all too little about the body and even less about a broken heart, or the history of civilization, which is why we need Prozac. Freud once wrote: "However philosophy may bridge the gap between physical and mental, it still exists for practical purposes, and our practice on each side of it must differ accordingly." Freud may have underestimated our practicality and overestimated our sense of purpose, but he was right to worry that the marriage of psychoanalysis to medicine would one day end in disaster.
He might even have been pleased to discover that in contemporary American culture the major interest in psychoanalysis is found in schools of theology and on Broadway. Psychoanalysis has a popular appeal, not because it is a form of medicine or alternative therapy but because it is a secular religion that tries to address the deeper meanings of life. This is a time for psychoanalysis to discover its true identity. It is time for a divorce from medicine. It is time for a remarriage with theologians.
Freud taught that to be happy one must maximize pleasure (the id), be moral (the superego) and survive (the ego). I am not worried about the survival of psychoanalysts. I think their fears of extinction are largely irrational. I just hope they have the guts to do the right thing.

HEADLINE: Plume of Hope Rises From Factory Ashes

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

DATELINE: METHUEN, Mass., Dec. 15

 BODY:
The wind-blown fire that destroyed much of the Malden Mills textile complex here on Monday night and put 1,400 people out of work barely two weeks before Christmas was a reminder that in some parts of America, a factory and its workers are still everything to each other.
In Methuen and in the surrounding blue-collar towns of the Merrimack Valley near the New Hampshire border, this has been a week of heartbreak and heroism, of hopes dashed and raised. And no one knows the ups and downs better than Jeffrey Marks, a 23-year-old machine operator from Derry, N.H., who works on the Malden Mills flocking line. 
 Last Sunday, Mr. Marks was looking ahead to a long work week with lots of overtime that he had asked for so he could earn extra money for Christmas presents. On Tuesday, after the fire, Mr. Marks, whose fiancee also works for Malden Mills, wondered how he would pay his rent, feed their 2-year-old daughter and make car payments.
On Thursday, he sat in the crowded gymnasium at Central Catholic High School in Lawrence, Mass., and cheered as the owner of Malden Mills, Aaron Feuerstein, promised to keep the paychecks coming for at least another month.
This morning, Mr. Feuerstein, stood before another crowd of several hundred employees and promised, as he has done countless times in recent days, that everything would be all right.
In the four days since the fire gutted three factory buildings and crippled Malden Mills, which makes one of the country's most popular fabrics for winter wear, Mr. Feuerstein has captivated the hearts and imaginations of his workers and much of Massachusetts with his enthusiastic resolve to rebuild and his pledge to continue paying salaries for as long as possible.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for those out of work have been pouring in from across the state. There have also been donations of Christmas presents for children, frozen turkeys and tickets to see the Nutcracker.
Gov. William F. Weld declared the destruction of Malden Mills a state emergency and the State Legislature passed an emergency waiver of the two-week waiting period normally required to receive unemployment benefits. And the Federal Department of Labor has prepared a $3.7 million aid package for career counseling, job retraining and other emergency assistance.
But all week long, Mr. Feuerstein has promised that Malden Mills will get back on its feet. And fast. His pledge has been the latest sign of his loyalty to Massachusetts and his workers. The workers know that the fire presented only the latest opportunity for Mr. Feuerstein to move his operations elsewhere.
Methuen, which was founded in 1726 and prospered as a mill town throughout the 1800's, began to fade in the early half of this century as mill owners seeking cheap labor headed south and then on to Asia. In fact, when Mr. Feuerstein moved his grandfather's sweater manufacturing business to Methuen 40 years ago, he took over an abandoned mill.
"When people saw the devastation on television, they were positive that the 70-year-old owner would collect whatever insurance he could and say 'bye-bye,' " Mr. Feuerstein told the crowd of mid-level managers and other nonunion employees this morning. "We don't operate that way. We are going to continue to operate with whatever strength that we can until we have again established Malden Mills as the leader in the industry."
The path to the top of the industry is one that Mr. Feuerstein has followed before. In 1981, after a major decline in the fake fur industry, Malden Mills filed for bankruptcy. The company was millions of dollars in debt. Hundreds of workers were laid off. But the company persevered. Its research and development team designed "polarfleece" and later Polartec, an advanced fabric that is used to make extremely warm but lightweight clothing. Today Polartec accounts for half of Malden Mills' $425 million in annual sales and Polartec items are sold by major clothiers like L. L. Bean and Patagonia.
On Monday night, as he watched flames devouring the business that his grandfather, Henry, started almost 90 years ago, Mr. Feuerstein said he had to remind himself again and again not to cry. "I told myself no tears, no crying," he said. "Crying isn't going to help myself." Instead, he said, he thought of Shakespeare's King Lear, who promised that his heart would "break into a hundred thousand flaws" before he wept. "I was telling myself I have to be creative," he said. "Maybe there's some way to get out of it."
No one had to remind him that shutting down the factory would mean putting entire families out of work. Like so many of his workers, Mr. Feuerstein has relatives in the business. His wife, Louise, heads an upholstery division. His sons, Daniel, 41, and Raphael, 39, and his son-in-law, David Greenberg, also work for Malden Mills.
Mr. Feuerstein's 37-year-old daughter, Joyce, has been visiting about a dozen workers who were injured in the fire and remain hospitalized. In all, 25 workers were injured in the blaze, which started with an explosion near the boiler room in a century-old factory building.
Teams of investigators are working to determine the cause of the explosion, including officials of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Massachusetts State Fire Marshals. The officials have not classified the fire as suspicious but are investigating to determine if Malden Mills followed all required safety rules.
Recent snowstorms have hampered the investigation. "Due to weather conditions and conditions at the fire scene, we have not yet been able to go in and examine all of the physical evidence," said Robert Fawcett, the factory's director of corporate security. He said investigators had interviewed more than 70 people and were waiting to interview some of those who were still in the hospital.
With 2,500 employees, Malden Mills is the largest employer in Methuen. And nearly everyone in town feels any changes that happen at the factory. Perrault's Diner, across the street from Malden Mills, used to be open 24 hours a day, said Francis Dumont, the manager of the diner. But he said that when Malden Mills opened a cafeteria in the 1960's, the diner had to cut back its operation.
The cafeteria burned down in the fire, so places like Perrault's and Motta's Broadway Pizza and Subs down the street, are doing more business now.
Mr. Feuerstein has said that Malden Mills will resume manufacturing Polartec by Jan. 2. Keeping the union employees on the payroll will cost about $1.5 million a week, he said. The decision to continue to pay the workers and to extend their health benefits for at least 90 days was met with surprise and appreciation.
"This my father told me as a little boy," Mr. Feuerstein said, quoting Hillel, the ancient rabbi. "In a situation which is devoid of morality, try to be a man and do something worthwhile."
Mr. Feuerstein, who grew up in Brookline, Mass., and still lives there, is an observant Jew. And this afternoon, as his staff continued to plan how to get the business moving again, he left to observe the Sabbath.
Outside the factory, Jim Sweet, a 48-year-old director of safety in the woven fabric division, was shouting to friends about a flatbed truck that had arrived with new equipment. "Did you see the two shears on the truck?" he asked. "They just brought in two P & W Shears. It's a joy to see the shears come in. We can say we're going to rebuild but when you see two shears coming in, that's reality. We are going to be all right."

HEADLINE: New Push for Budget Accord Dissolves in Finger-Pointing

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Stepped-up negotiations between the White House and Republicans to balance the budget by 2002 ended in acrimony only hours after they began yesterday, with each side angrily criticizing the other's proposal.
Within hours of the breakdown, efforts to work out a deal for a temporary spending bill to replace one that expired at midnight also fell apart, and various Government agencies prepared to shut down today for the second time in a month.[Page 12.] 
 Both sides said they hoped to return to the negotiating table and were willing to do so at any time over the weekend. But neither side said when that might occur, and each blamed the other for the impasse.
While the stakes are high, involving questions as broad as the role of Government in American life and as specific as whether wealthy investors will get tax cuts, both sides also have much to gain or lose politically. For purposes of next year's elections, Republicans need to show, at least on paper, a balanced budget by the year 2002. Democrats are determined to be seen by voters as protecting Medicare and Medicaid from destruction. [Page 12.]
Demonstrating that, both sides took to the microphones to unleash a war of words yesterday. On the floor of the Senate, there was angry partisan sniping, with several Republicans coming close to calling Mr. Clinton a liar and Democrats leaping to their feet to defend him.
In a late-afternoon appearance in the White House press room, President Clinton blamed the Republicans for breaking off the talks.
"They wanted us to agree to deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid just as a condition to talk," Mr. Clinton said. "Once again, they are threatening to shut the Government down if I do not accept their deep cuts.
"The idea that we should abandon the commitment we made and they agreed to as a condition of talking is wrong and we will not do that."
The President's comments brought an irritated response from Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican majority leader.
"I don't think he's telling the American people the truth," Mr. Dole said on the Senate floor, "and if he thinks he is engaged in serious budget negotiations, he ought to look at the budget."
Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, rose to challenge Mr. Dole's account of the negotiations.
"His version of the truth and mine could not be more different," he said. "My version is that it was the Republicans this afternoon who got up and walked out of the room."
The Republicans said at mid-afternoon that they would step up separate budget negotiations over the weekend with conservative Democrats in the House and in the Senate. Those informal talks have been under way for a week.
As for a new temporary spending bill, called a continuing resolution, to keep the Government operating, the Republicans set a condition. They said it would come only when Mr. Clinton called to say that he was ready to offer a budget that would be brought into balance in seven years, based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the country's financial picture.
"The minute we get that call, we will voice-vote a C.R.," Representative John R. Kasich, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said yesterday. "After midnight tonight, it is up to the President to come to us in good faith."
Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff and the leader of the Democrats' side in the budget negotiations, said that the White House offered yesterday to reduce spending by $125 billion, compared with the budget it submitted last week. He said the Democrats' offer also included a guarantee of a five-year tax cut in the seven-year plan, with tax cuts in the two final years tied to the performance of the economy.
"They said essentially that the price for continuing these negotiations would be the Administration putting cuts in Medicare and Medicaid on the table," Mr. Panetta said, "and that is not a price we are willing to pay."
But the Republicans said the White House budget was bogus. A principal negotiator -- Senator Pete V. Domenici, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee -- said the offer the Democrats brought to the table included a $75 billion deficit in 2002, the seventh year of the plan.
"We are right back where we started," Mr. Domenici said at a news conference. "They just want to use optimistic and rosy assumptions and to cook the books. We cannot find anything they did serious."
The biggest changes proposed by the Republicans yesterday involved Medicaid and Medicare.
New calculations released this week by the Congressional Budget Office showed that the budget measure approved by the Republicans and vetoed by the President last month would have saved $226 billion in Medicare costs and $133 billion in Medicaid costs over the next seven years. Earlier calculations had put the savings higher, at $270 billion for Medicare and $164 billion for Medicaid.
The proposal that the Republicans offered yesterday, which they distributed, reduced their demand for savings in Medicare to $200 billion and in Medicaid to $119 billion. It called for cutting $5 billion of the proposed $245 billion tax cut.
The Congressional Budget Office also identified $135 billion in additional savings over the next seven years. Republicans offered to allocate $25 billion of that money for additional spending for education, environmental programs, veterans' health care and job training.
"We have responded to their concerns only to find out that they showed up and didn't keep up their end of the bargain," Mr. Kasich said.
Shortly after Mr. Dole delivered his assessment of the negotiations, about a dozen stern-faced Republicans huddled around Mr. Domenici on the Senate floor as he briefed them on the breakdown in the talks.
As the budget negotiations were getting started, Republicans were pressuring the President to sign one of the more politically contentious spending bills for the 1996 budget year, the $12.2 billion appropriation for the Interior Department. The Republicans said yesterday that they would send the Interior bill to the White House today.
Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto the bill, along with the $80.6 billion spending bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which Congress sent to him last night. Congress sent a third spending bill, for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State and for the Judiciary, to the White House on Thursday. The Administration objects to the Interior bill because it includes cuts in environmental and Indian programs.
President Clinton has signed 6 of the 13 spending bills for 1996, covering the Departments of Agriculture, Transportation and Energy, the Treasury, Congress and military construction. The national security and defense appropriations bill became law on Dec. 1 without the President's signature.
Based on the seven spending bills that have become law and the jobs that are deemed essential, about 300,000 Federal workers are expected to be affected by the shutdown.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Off Nearly 5% On Signs of Growing Supply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Copper futures prices plunged nearly 5 percent in New York yesterday on signs that near-term supply problems were easing.
The London Metal Exchange reported a sharp increase in warehouse inventories of copper, particularly in the United States, prompting speculation that the bull market in copper was over. 
 "This basically gave people the impression that maybe things aren't as tight as they had been, that there is metal starting to move to the market in greater quantities at a time that demand is maybe starting to pull back," said Stephen Platt, an analyst at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices surged. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities fell 0.86 point, to 244.95.
Copper for December delivery plunged 6.75 cents, to $1.3315 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a drop of 4.8 percent. January deliveries sank 4.35 cents, to $1.301 a pound.
Prices tumbled after the London Metal Exchange, the world's largest copper futures market, reported that copper in exchange-monitored warehouses had surged 13,100 metric tons in a week. The exchange reported sharp increases of 5,100 metric tons in its warehouses in Long Beach, Calif., and 2,100 metric tons in St. Louis.
The gain reversed a long-running decline in the exchange's stocks and eased concerns about availability. Copper traded at a six-year high of $1.461 a pound in July.
Bette Raptopoulos, a metals analyst at Prudential Securities, said the sharp rise in warehouse stocks suggested copper prices had risen high enough to prompt selling by users with excess supplies on hand.
Elsewhere, oil prices rose after OPEC estimated its output fell in November to 24.81 million barrels a day from 25.17 million in October. January deliveries of light sweet crude oil leaped 40 cents a barrel, to $19.51, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading, Aided by Europe Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against other leading currencies yesterday, benefiting from interest rate cuts in Europe, where more signs of an economic slowdown are emerging.
Trading was relatively light, as many traders were waiting for a resolution of the budget dispute between the White House and Congress. 
 "I believe the markets have put on their little Santa hats and focused elsewhere," said Kevin Lawrie, vice president and manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4432 German marks, up from 1.4377 late Thursday. The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 102.00 yen, up from 101.50.
The British pound, meanwhile, fell to $1.5360, from $1.5433.
The dollar strengthened despite news that the European Union had settled a contentious part of its plan for a unified currency by selecting a name: the euro. The decision might have bolstered European currencies, given the previous squabbling this fall about whether all countries would meet strict monetary criteria to form a monetary union.
But France's general strike makes that country a "wild card, creating havoc for unity," said Charles Spence, director of treasury sales at Standard Chartered Bank.
"When you have people rioting to save their social programs, that doesn't bode well for France meeting the stringent qualifications," Mr. Spence said. "Without France, you might as well call the E.U. 'Germany.' "
Europe's economic weakness was further evident yesterday when two more countries, France and Portugal, cut important interest rates, following two days of rate cuts by six other countries, including Britain and Germany. Central banks cut their rates to spur lending and growth.
But lower interest rates in those countries make investments denominated in their currencies less attractive to international investors. Moreover, the weakness in Europe's economies makes the currencies of stronger economies like the United States' more attractive to many investors.
"As you go around the globe, you see the U.S. still performing O.K. from an economic standpoint," Mr. Spence said. "The U.S. looks like one of the safer places to invest right now."

HEADLINE: Bonds Little Changed in Budget Uncertainty

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended a quiet trading session with little change yesterday, as the breakdown in the Federal budget negotiations added to the bond market's uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates next week.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond slipped 5/32 of a point, or $1.56 for $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposition direction, rose to 6.09 percent from 6.08 percent late Thursday. 
 Budget talks between the Clinton Administration and Congressional Republicans broke off abruptly yesterday, setting the stage for another partial Government shutdown.
The on-again, off-again negotiations have unnerved buyers of Treasury bonds.
"The market sold off after the budget talks broke down," said Dan Bernzweig, a money market trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York.
But, he added, "The way politicians go, they say one thing one minute but within the next hour or day they have positions completely reversed."
Trading was slow as investors held back from taking new positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting on Tuesday.
"Everybody is kind of sitting and waiting to see what the Fed will or won't do on the 19th," said Marilyn Cohen, a California-based money manager of about $60 billion in bonds.
Expectations that central bankers will cut interest rates to invigorate a sagging economy has fueled a powerful bond-market rally in recent months. But bond prices stalled this week as new reports portrayed a mixed picture of the economy.
Inflation at the wholesale level surged last month, but consumer prices remained tame. Retail sales, an important measure of economic growth, jumped sharply in November but so far the Christmas shopping season has turned out to be disappointing.
Moreover, the Fed may hold back on any interest rate reductions until the White House and Congress agree on a plan to reduce the Federal deficit.
Still, some market participants expect a modest reduction in short-term interest rates of about one-quarter percentage point, which would give a small spur to the economy.
Elsewhere in the market, prices of short-term Treasuries rose 1/32 point and intermediate maturities were unchanged to down 3/32 point, Dow Jones Telerate Inc. reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.04, to 1,285.80.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 5.81 percent, down from 5.82 percent late Thursday.

 BODY:

Europeans Choose Name And Timetable for Currency
 European leaders picked the name Euro for the unified currency they are struggling to achieve for the 21st century. They also agreed on a timetable for introducing it by 2002. The agreement reflects a growing momentum among many European leaders to forge a single currency and a broader economic and political integration of the Continent that they hope will invigorate its flagging economy and insure greater political stability and peace. The Euro is to replace many of Europe's main currencies eventually, but many skeptics doubt the single currency will ever be issued. 
 The blueprint commits governments to slash spending and raise taxes by the end of 1997. For many Europeans leaner budgets will bring cuts in social programs. [Page 1.]
 
French Rail Workers End Strike
 French railway workers voted to end their three-week-old strike, signaling an end to the country's most serious labor unrest in a decade. The crisis eased after the Government made significant concessions this week in its austerity plan, especially to the railway workers, who played an important role in paralyzing the nation. [1.]
 
Budget Talks Become Angry
 Stepped-up negotiations between the White House and Republicans over a seven-year, balanced budget ended in acrimony only hours after they began. Within hours of the breakdown, efforts to work out a deal for a temporary spending bill also fell apart. Various Government agencies prepared to shut down operations for the second time in a month. [1.]
 When President Clinton failed to present a plan for a balanced budget and when the Republicans insisted on big Medicare savings, the negotiations screeched to a halt. [12.]
 The breakdown of budget talks added to the bond market's uncertainty over whether the Federal Reserve would cut rates next week; Treasury prices ended with little change. [42]
 
Utilicorp Seen in Merger Talks
 Utilicorp United, a utility based in Kansas City, Mo., with businesses in natural gas and independent power, is said to be in merger talks with Kansas City Power and Light, a more traditional utility that supplies electricity to 429,000 residences. [43]
 
A TV Executive for Disney
 Capital Cities/ABC hired Geraldine B. Laybourne from Viacom's Nickelodeon to run its cable television programming. When Disney's purchase of Cap Cities is completed next year, Ms. Laybourne will become president of Disney/ABC Cable Networks, assuming responsibility for all nonbroadcast programming except ESPN, including the 24-hour cable news network that ABC plans to create. Ms. Laybourne built Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite from an obscure cable channel to one that will have 1995 revenue estimated at $380 million. [41.]
 
A Familiar Look to Christmas
 Christmas shoppers seem to yearn for tradition. The hottest products this year mostly involve cuddling up and sitting around the table playing board games. Cashmere is popular again. Grapefruit bath gels are selling well. And Monopoly is making a comeback. [41.]
 
Sprint Plans Are Approved
 The F.C.C. approved plans for Sprint to sell a 20 percent stake to two phone companies in Germany and France for $4.1 billion. Sprint shareholders are to vote on the deal on Jan. 12. The F.C.C. attached conditions intended to protect competitors and telephone customers in the United States. [42.]
 
Copper Prices Plunge
 Copper prices fell nearly 5 percent on signs that near-term supply problems are easing. The London Metal Exchange reported a sharp increase in warehouse inventories of copper, particularly in the United States, prompting speculation that the bull market is over. [38.]
 
Dollar Advances on Rate Cuts
 The dollar moved higher against other leading currencies, benefiting from interest rate cuts in Europe, where more signs of an economic slowdown are emerging. Trading was relatively light, as many traders were waiting for a resolution of the budget dispute between the White House and Congress. [38.]

HEADLINE: Utilicorp Said to Be in Talks To Buy Kansas City Power

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Utilicorp United Inc., a utility based in Kansas City, Mo., with businesses in natural gas and independent power, is in merger talks with Kansas City Power and Light, an industry official familiar with the discussions said yesterday.
The official, speaking anonymously, said that a merger announcement could come in the next few days. Sally McElwreath, a spokeswoman for Utilicorp, said yesterday that the company would not comment on rumors about mergers and acquisitions. Officials of Kansas City Power could not be reached for comment. Turner White, Kansas City Power's senior vice president for retail services, said, "We never comment on these kinds of things." 
 Don Scotto, a utility industry analyst at Bear, Stearns, said that Kansas City Power, which serves electric customers in the Kansas City area, had long been a top takeover candidate among analysts because of its reputation as a producer of low-cost electricity. Mr. Scotto said Utilicorp had been considered a logical partner because the companies' businesses mesh without much overlap.
There has been a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry, which is preparing for more competition when states open up their utilities to competition from peers and independent power producers, beginning in the next several years. Many utility company managers believe that to survive, utilities must cut costs and increase in size to take advantage of economies of scale.
In recent mergers -- the union of Puget Sound Power and Light and Washington Energy is a good example -- the parties typically have cut costs mostly by consolidating headquarters and compatible divisions. In the Puget Sound-Washington Energy deal, management estimated that the combined company would save about $370 million over 10 years, mostly because of an 8 percent cut in the combined work force of 3,550.
Utilicorp reported revenues of $1.5 billion last year, while Kansas City Power had revenues of $868 million.
Utilicorp has been aggressive in coming up with new marketing strategies and in diversifying, including experience in the deregulated energy market in Britain.
The company is a major supplier of natural gas and owns a pipeline subsidiary. Utilicorp supplies natural gas to 780,000 customers in eight states and has interests in 16 independent power projects in the United States and Jamaica.
About a year ago the company adopted an unusual strategy of seeking to market its energy products and services nationwide under the brand name Energy One.
In Britain, Utilicorp has been selling natural gas, taking advantage of the fact that customers can now shop for power.
Utilicorp has also been shopping for one of Britain's profitable regional power transmission companies, some of which have already been bid for by other United States utilities.
Compared with Utilicorp, Kansas City Power is a more traditional utility, supplying electricity to 429,000 residential customers.
Kansas City Power is able to offer low-cost electricity because it produces three-fourths of it in coal-fired plants. This puts it in a good position to compete for customers in a deregulated market.

Behind the Budget Deadlock: '96 Election Strategy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The stakes in the last-ditch budget negotiations that began today could hardly be higher.
They involve such momentous questions as whether the place of the American Government in the lives of its citizens will be substantially diminished, whether social policies developed over the last three decades will be reversed and whether middle-income families and wealthy investors will have their taxes cut. 
 But important as those questions are, their resolution will probably turn more on partisan politics than on substance.
Each side has one overarching political imperative. It was their refusal to budge on these points that led the budget talks to break down again today.
For Republicans, the imperative is that policies be adopted that can be shown on paper to produce a balanced budget in the year 2002.
If a budget agreement is reached, Republicans must be able to argue that they forced the hands of profligate Democrats. If talks collapse, Republicans need to be able to blame the Democrats for refusing to control their appetite for overspending.
For Democrats, the essential element is that they be seen by voters to have protected Medicare and Medicaid from destruction by the Republicans.
If a deal is struck, Democrats must be able to say that it resulted from their demand that Republicans retreat on health care programs. If there is no agreement, Democrats want to be able to blame Republicans for trying to pay for tax reductions for the wealthy by spending less for Medicare and Medicaid.
So when President Clinton failed to present a plan for a balanced budget and when the Republicans insisted on big savings in Medicare and Medicaid, the negotiations today screeched to a halt.
Looked at from afar, the emphasis that both sides are placing on these issues hardly seems justified. But their strategy for winning next year's elections relies on the hard line they are taking.
On the matter of balancing the budget, most economists believe that for the long-term strength of the nation's economy, the Government must indeed close the gap between the amount of money it spends each year and the amount it receives in taxes and other revenue.
But Republicans would be hard-pressed to find a single economist who believes that balance must be achieved in precisely seven years -- not five or six or eight or ten.
The notion of reaching a balanced budget in seven years was developed by Republicans in 1993 to demonstrate that the goal could be accomplished by the turn of the century.
Then, Republicans made a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget in seven years the cornerstone of their Contract With America, the platform most Republican candidates for the House ran on last year.
After the proposed amendment failed to get the required two-thirds majority in the Senate this year, Republican leaders decided to try to achieve their goal in the budget process.
Asked last month why seven years was so important, Speaker Newt Gingrich responded, "Seven is the longest period in which you can maintain the discipline to insist on it happening."
And what is the basis for that view?
"Intuition," he replied.
If that seems to fall somewhat short of a principle to live or die on, so does the Democrats' stance on Medicare and Medicaid.
Even the most devoutly Democratic budget analysts understand that the taxpayers cannot continue to sustain the Medicare and Medicaid systems as they exist today. While private health costs have leveled off in the last couple of years, the cost of Medicare and Medicaid, virtually the last bastions of traditional fee-for-service medicine, has continued to grow by about 10 percent a year.
The latest data from the Congressional Budget Office made public this week forecast that unless the law is changed, the cost of the two health programs will rise to $664 billion in the year 2005, or 26.9 percent of the entire Federal budget that year, from $293 billion, or 18.2 percent of the budget this year.
By the second or third decade of the next century, when large numbers of baby boomers retire and many go into nursing homes, Medicare and Medicaid will be swallowing such a large share of the budget that little will be left for anything else.
That is why in his own latest budget, the President proposed changes in the law that would save $97 billion over seven years in Medicare, the program for the elderly, and $37 billion in Medicaid, the program for the poor -- proposals the Administration rarely mentions now.
The comparable figures in the latest Republican proposal, put forward today, are $200 billion in Medicare savings (down from an initial offer of $270 billion) and $119 billion in Medicaid savings (down from $164 billion).
One might think that the two sides could split the difference. It amounts to about $26 billion a year, hardly an asterisk in a budget that is expected to exceed $2 trillion by 2002.
But Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said after the talks ended this afternoon that the Administration would not compromise at all on this issue -- just as the Republicans drew the line on the question of a balanced budget in seven years.
Medicare was the Democrats' crowning achievement in the Great Society, an enormously popular program that is largely responsible for making this generation of retired people ever so much more independent than their parents were at the same age.
When the program was created 30 years ago, most Republicans opposed it. And ever since, whenever the Democrats have needed a political lift, they have accused their opponents of threatening the well-being of the elderly.
But both parties believe that the outcome of next year's elections will depend on making their charges stick -- the Republican charge that Democrats tried to block a balanced budget and the Democratic charge that Republicans tried to gut Medicare and Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Who Is Really Cooking the Books?

BYLINE: By Richard McGahey; Richard McGahey, former executive director of the Joint Economic Committed of Congress, is senior fellow at the Center for National Policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the battle over the budget goes into extra innings, issues of economic analysis and forecasting have become central to any deal. The Republicans have kept up a steady drumbeat against the Clinton Administration, calling for "honest scorekeeping" by the Congressional Budget Office and accusing the Administration of cooking the books with their own economic forecasts.
But the public should not be fooled. The Administration's economic forecasts are in the mainstream of all such projections, including those of private and corporate economists. 
 Although forecasting is an arcane art, the Administration's figures have been more accurate on such key variables as real and nominal economic growth rates, unemployment and long-term interest rates. For example, the Administration's estimates of economic growth have been about 20 percent more accurate than the C.B.O.'s for 1993-95.
Unlike the rosy economic outlooks from the Reagan White House -- projections that overestimated growth and tax revenue, contributing to the explosion of the deficit by overestimating economic growth and tax revenues -- the Administration has had an excellent track record on honest and conservative economic forecasting. Both Business Week and The Wall Street Journal have run editorials urging Congress to use its growth projections.
The point was underlined last week when the Congressional Budget Office belatedly released a revised forecast that moved much closer to the Administration's figures on inflation and other indicators. (The old C.B.O. forecast for inflation was 3.2 percent, but the new forecast dropped to 3 percent.)
But it is hard to know what to make of some C.B.O. findings, like its puzzling forecast that higher long-term interest rates will coincide with lower inflation and slower growth. There is also its claim that the Administration's plan is still $365 billion out of balance. And the office has not provided estimates for the costs of the proposed Republican tax cut beyond 2002, when many analysts think that revenue losses will soar.
Republicans promised to discuss these technical issues as part of the negotiations, but detailed discussions never took place. Indeed, the C.B.O. issued its forecast without real consultation, in violation of the Republicans' agreement.
In fact, the deficit has fallen for three years in a row, the first time since Truman was President that this has happened. As a percentage of G.N.P., the deficit is back to where it was before the national debt exploded in the 1980's. And the Government is being radically downsized; Federal employment, as a percentage of total employment, is at its lowest level since the mid-1930's.
These huge reductions have come under the Administration's 1993 deficit reduction plan, which passed without a single vote from Republicans. Nevertheless, the Administration has agreed to an arbitrary seven-year time frame to balance the budget (a period justified by Speaker Newt Gingrich based on "intuition"). Having given in, the Administration has every right to stick to its guns on the remaining issues, though it is again trying to negotiate, with yet another plan to balance the budget.
But its should stop this one-sided negotiation until the Republicans enter into serious consultation on the economic forecasts, as they agreed, and drop the misleading rhetoric about "honest scorekeeping" in favor of a truly honest discussion.

HEADLINE: An Era Is Fading in Greece

 BODY:
The curtain is drawing on an Aegean melodrama, featuring Greece's aging lion, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, and his second wife, Dimitra Liani, a former airline hostess. The 76-year-old Prime Minister is hooked to a respirator, deferring key decisions to his wife, whom he has named chief of staff. He has yet to propose a successor and has rebuffed calls for his resignation, while Mrs. Papandreou tries stoically to ignore a tabloid barrage of old photographs in which she appears topless.
It is a sad, undignified twilight for a leader who has dominated Greek politics for a generation. Despite high unemployment and a potentially worrying budget deficit, these have been good times for most Greeks. Sobered by Balkan turbulence, Athens this year wisely tempered its fervid nationalism. It recently lifted a self-injuring trade embargo against Macedonia, or Skopje, as Greeks call the former Yugoslav republic. Moreover, Greece threw no roadblocks against Turkey's bid for a customs union with the European Community. 
 This stable interlude could dissolve overnight with the passing of Mr. Papandreou. The scramble for power has already begun in his Socialist party, Pasok, and in the equally divided conservative opposition party, New Democracy. Greece's friends in Europe and America should make plain their support for the pragmatic course begun in Mr. Papandreou's final year, and press for new initiatives to settle old differences.
Highest on the list of old disputes are the quarrel with Turkey on Aegean air and water rights, and the deadlock over Cyprus, which began in 1974, when Turkey invaded and the island was partitioned. Cyprus is a quarrel ripe for resolution if Athens and Ankara can be nudged toward a settlement of wider issues in the Aegean.
Americans can only contemplate with sadness the anticlimactic finale of Andreas Papandreou's remarkable career. He helped restore democracy to Greece after the rule of the colonels and presided over the modernization of his country.

HEADLINE: Domestic Poverty Is a Human Rights Issue

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The New Attack on Human Rights" (editorial, Dec. 10): You correctly chastise Indonesia, China and Singapore for accepting only those rights that suit their cynical purposes, and find it "patronizing, indeed almost insulting to Asians and others, to suggest that citizens in developing countries should not have the same rights as those in more developed lands." 
 But you would do well to recognize that the United States continues to repudiate economic and social rights -- half of the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- and has stonewalled the majority of human rights treaties.
At this year's preparatory meetings for the United Nations Conference on Housing, the United States stands alone in refusing to accept the internationally recognized right to housing.
Where is your indignation for the daily violations of dignity and human rights in Harlem, where living standards match those of Bangladesh? Is there nothing "insulting" about the richest country in the world responding to its urban wastelands by rushing to deny its citizens their few remaining social entitlements? Is it coincidental that the only industrialized country to reject economic and social rights also boasts the highest disparity between rich and poor?
Economic and social rights are not alien to Western values. Education, Social Security and a minimum wage have long held the status of rights in this country. Franklin D. Roosevelt championed "freedom from want" as strongly as "freedom from fear," on the understanding that "true individual freedoms cannot exist without economic security and independence."
As citizens of the former Soviet Union have discovered, voting rights and free speech are of little value to those with neither the education nor economic clout to make them meaningful. Poverty, sickness and illiteracy undermine human dignity as effectively as military thugs.
Growing domestic and global economic inequalities represent the gravest threat to civil liberties, if not international security. The United Nations estimates that less than 10 percent of the world's population participates fully in the political, economic, social and cultural institutions that shape their lives.
If Western media and human rights groups continue to ape the United States Government's two-tiered approach to human rights, their voices will be increasingly irrelevant to the human rights problems of most of the world's people.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Franchises In Canada Are Likely To Get Aid

BYLINE: By CHARLIE NOBLES 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH, Fla., Dec. 15

 BODY:
The National Hockey League took a major step today toward establishing a form of revenue sharing for financially ailing teams in Canada.
The Board of Governors' eight-person committee on revenue and currency recommended the use of league-generated funds to help qualifying Canada-based teams deal with a disparity in the Canadian and United States dollars. 
 To qualify, a team would have to be in the lower half of the league in gross revenues, despite doing a good job of selling season tickets and suites, as well as merchandising.
"We want to make sure that this is a joint partnership," said Commissioner Gary Bettman, who expects league-wide approval of the plan before the N.H.L. All-Star Game next month. "If a team is going to get the support that it needs from the local community, the league is going to help the rich to try and keep the smaller revenue-generating clubs in Canada in their markets."
Among those franchises likely affected are Edmonton, Calgary and Ottawa. Calgary's part-owner Harley Hotchkiss was beaming after the committee's meeting.
With the Canadian dollar worth just 73 United States cents, Hotchkiss, a member of the revenue and currency committee, argued that Canadian teams were at a distinct disadvantage, particularly in player procurement.
"Before, when the dollar was, say, 85 cents, and our costs were lower, the problem was livable," he said. "Lately it's become a more serious problem for us, and not one we can do anything about.
"We're trying to be competitive and we're at a significant disadvantage."
Bettman said today's development in no way signaled the start of more extensive N.H.L. involvement in revenue sharing.
"Gate-sharing and local television sharing, when you have an economist do all the charts, doesn't work," he said. "Because there are some clubs in small markets that have very, very strong gates, and others with strong television contracts. The last thing you want to be doing is taking money from those clubs and giving it to teams in bigger markets that may have other revenue sources that they don't."
The committee, besides Hotchkiss, was made up of representatives from Anaheim, Chicago, Boston, Washington, Edmonton, Montreal and Vancouver.
"Does this solve all the world's problems?" Bettman said. "The answer is no. But it does address a very important issue that has imposed a hardship on many of the clubs."
Turning to another matter, Bettman said that if the N.H.L. expanded again, it would be in North America, not Europe.
"I think we can strengthen our footprint and strengthen this sport in North America before we worry about the rest of the world," he said. "While we like to take a long-term view, we don't want to look so far. You ever try walking while you're looking through binoculars? You're destined to trip."

HEADLINE: Parent Power

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

DATELINE: UNION

 BODY:
FOR years, from the time they were installed in 1983, the high, heavy thermal-pane windows in her kindergarten classroom drove Gail Signorelli nuts. Like nearly all the windows in Washington Elementary School here, they stuck, permanently. Some teachers strained their backs tugging at them. One custodian hurt his back so severely he was out for months.
As a result, Ms. Signorelli's classroom, like the others, was usually stifling. It faced south, overlooking the playground blacktop, from which heat rose. "The heat made children cranky," Ms. Signorelli said. "In the afternoon they'd fall asleep." 
Furthermore, a chemical in the glass reacted with the sun, darkening the windows so they looked filthy. "Those windows were miserable, ornery," said Robert Jeranek, the principal.
It took 12 years for Washington School officials to get the approval to spend $250,000 for new windows. Were it not for the local PTA, they'd still be waiting and, come spring, the children still sweating. No one would have dealt with the sporadic complaints that only occasionally reached the school board. Somebody had to take charge: rallying people, shuttling complaints to the board, making a show of power.
That was a job, clearly, for Washington Elementary's PTA, for its 600 mothers, fathers, grandparents and teachers -- 10 more PTA members than there are children in the school. Many Parent-Teacher Associations confine their efforts to annual cookie sales for new hockey jerseys. "You hear PTA, your image is cliquey cupcake bakers," said Pat Pastore, Washington PTA's president.
But a strong, organized PTA can do much more. At Washington School, if a teacher needs somebody to read aloud, if a child needs tutoring or is out sick for a while or the playground equipment is rusting, if the Legislature is contemplating cuts in special education, parents and teachers turn to the PTA. Usually, it dispatches tutors or get-well stuffed bears, news of the state government or addresses of local lawmakers.
In other words, it practices politics at its most local, concrete and satisfying -- and at its purest. Nobody stands to make money. Everybody is in it to make schools and children's lives better. Whatever parents' skills, they are welcome. One father, a police officer, gives safety talks. Others bring in people who can perform for assemblies: actors, magicians, wildlife experts exhibiting birds of prey. "Everybody does a little something," said Mrs. Pastore. "Put together, it adds up to a lot."
Furthermore, the Washington PTA is organized like a small business. It is overseen by a few mothers who treat the responsibility like a full-time job. An artistically inclined parent, for instance, asked to design a logo, drew five children holding hands, which another had printed on mugs, pins and sweatshirts for members. Small as this is, it creates the feeling of an inclusive club.
In Union, which residents describe as "typical blue-collar middle class," adults spend a lot of free time coaching or cheering the huge soccer, baseball and football teams or the marching band or rifle club. An evening out may well be bowling at the PTA's family fun night.
So typical a town is Union (population 50,723 in 1992) that for nearly 40 years every major Presidential candidate has campaigned there. The average household income is $50,000, and few families range much higher or lower. And while only one-fifth of the adults have graduated from college, the township's schools regularly win praise -- Governor Whitman singled them out last year as a statewide model of efficiency -- and the dropout rate is minuscule.
On weekends, after work, residents give time to the town. "People in Union for some reason get caught up in the tradition of volunteerism," said Mayor Greg Muller. "It's a phenomenon. Even one-parent families contribute."
The satisfaction of the PTA is in arousing oneself and one's neighbors to fix what's broken and enhance the rest. It is, when the occasion arises, figuring out a way to persuade the school board to come up with a few hundred thousand dollars to replace miserable, ornery windows.
For years Mr. Jeranek, the principal, and a succession of business managers had tried -- calling and writing the manufacturer, who made promises and sent a worker to spray lubrication. In 1988, after five years of this, the school sued the manufacturer, who subsequently went bankrupt.
Children complained to parents, who complained to teachers, who complained to the principal. The principal wrote memos and talked to the school board president, who would talk to the Washington School business manager, who would plead that the matter was in litigation.
Finally, two years ago, Mrs. Pastore, the new PTA president, took it on. Mothers stamped and addressed blank postcards to each board member, handing them out in bundles to parents, teachers and staff, urging everybody to write about the windows. "I take this seriously, like a business," said Mrs. Pastore.
Over the two years, they did this four times. Each time more than 1,000 cards were sent to board members.
"Those postcards were lethal," said Mr. Jeranek. "They slaughtered with those cards. It was not just a few people. It was the entire population of the school."
Last spring the board agreed to allocate money to replace the windows. But the replacement of a deteriorating 100-year-old elementary school pushed it aside.
Again the postcards went out. The board agreed to tack on $250,000 to the elementary school bond issue, which the voters approved. This fall the windows were measured. They'll be installed in spring.
THE volunteers of the Washington PTA, whose children are in preschool to fourth grade, used well-worn political strategies: uniting splinter groups, getting people to prod those in power, being relentless. But from the first, PTA's have been about politics.
The need for a strong voice to support children's issues was evident in 1897, when 2,000 people came to the first PTA meeting in the dead of winter. Even after the crowd was moved from the Arlington Hotel banquet hall in Washington to the nearby First Baptist Church, many had to stand outside on the steps. Among the early concerns of the National Congress of Mothers, as it was called, were child labor laws, sex education, Federal aid to public schools, the institution of a national public health bureau and of kindergartens and hot lunches in public schools. In the mid-1920's, the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers was formed to lobby in segregated states for schoolbooks and adequate sewers and drinking water. It merged with the National PTA in 1970.
"All we care about is children," said Nancy Paley, the departing president of the New Jersey State PTA. "Homelessness, hunger, teen-age pregnancy, abused children, children smoking. Anything that affects children."
Local PTA's raise money for books, take children to museums, arrange for theater groups to put on plays, hold drug and alcohol prevention programs, tutor students in reading, math, computer skills. The idea is simple: parents should know what's going on in their children's schools and should lend a hand.
Years ago, when Mrs. Paley was the Washington PTA's safety chairman, children were supposed to leave the building by the outdoor stairs rather than the parking lot. When it snowed, custodians cleared the lot but left the stairs covered with snow and ice. So Mrs. Paley, worried that children would fall down the icy stairs, countermanded the policy, halted cars and directed children through the plowed parking lot.
"When parents get involved, things get accomplished," she said.
She might have added that when parents get involved, children become accomplished. A growing body of research indicates that the more parents take part in schools, the higher their children's grades and the better they fare. This holds true at all economic levels, among native-born and immigrant families, in suburbs, the country, the inner city. In one study -- of a New York State program for preschoolers from poor families -- the more time parents spent in school activities, the higher their children's cognitive development.
An unsurprising corollary is that if parents are encouraged to participate in school affairs, they will -- especially if they are asked to do more than bake cookies or sell raffle tickets. No school administrator would discourage parents from helping out. But some administrators make a point of pulling in parents and even local businesses, providing projects, space and equipment and soliciting advice.
The results can be dramatic. In Los Angeles, researchers followed 500 low-income black and Hispanic sixth-graders for four years. They found that schools with the most vigorous, substantive support from parents had students with the highest reading scores and greatest improvement in reading.
"Parents hold the key to schools," said Kenneth Shore, a psychologist with the Hamilton school district in Mercer County. "Parents fight more vigorously for their kids. They push schools to do things they might not otherwise do."
Not all educators want parental attention. "Some schools place obstacles in the way or steer parents towards fund-raising," Dr. Shore said. "Some parents are intimidated -- they feel they don't have the skill or knowledge, that teaching kids is the schools' job." But he added, "Nationwide, there's a trend to enlist parents' support."
Parents first contribute to schools for the good of their own children, of course. But they wind up doing good for their children's schoolmates. Given a chance, these attitudes and these efforts could extend indefinitely, with people seeking to help children they'll never meet -- children in neighboring and distant schools, neighboring and distant counties, state, countries.
"Some people think their school is the only one that's important," said Mrs. Paley. "Washington School is not afraid to become involved with any other school. The parents are not petty. I have five kids, but I still have to care about your child, about children throughout the town and state."
WELL and good. But who has time? The trick, say PTA officials, is to limit one's participation, to volunteer without becoming overwhelmed. The National PTA even has a list entitled "How to Say No and Not Feel Guilty."
Mrs. Pastore says she tries to get parents to do what they want when they want to. One new mother knitted tree ornaments for this month's holiday boutique, where children bought inexpensive gifts for their families. A pharmacist went to the boutique to wrap presents on Friday, her day off, while other working mothers made calls and lists in the evenings.
"I don't ever put people on the spot," Mrs. Pastore said. "I let them think about it for a few days."
To make a PTA run takes a little time from most people and a lot from a handful. For Mrs. Pastore and the committee chairpeople, it's like a career.
At the year's start, they send letters asking parents what they'd like to do. Everyone who wants can join the executive board, which currently has 60 members and meets monthly.
Many, including retired people, tutor students. Sometimes there are too many tutors for the classroom to hold.
"You see parents sitting in the hall with a group of children with flash cards, teaching letters," said Ms. Signorelli. "Anytime you need help, you let them know. You say, 'This is what we're doing; this is what we need.' And they say, 'How many people do you need?' "
There are 23 annual Washington PTA events. In October, there's the book fair and Halloween party; in November, science night, where parents and teachers demonstrate flashy experiments. Family roller-skating night is in February, and in May, a fair where students in school T-shirts ride ponies. There's a track meet and an arts festival showing work by adults and children. Once a year, PTA members give teachers little gifts, apples and a catered lunch that last year consisted of lemon chicken, punch and homemade desserts.
Each event requires dozens of workers to schedule, staff, teach, buy, sell, collect money, clean up. And there are PTA lobbying efforts, and committees to achieve certain educational goals -- goals set by the state, the Federal Government, the National PTA -- by the year 2000.
Parents have run thousands of feet of cable wire -- donated by a parent -- to fit all classrooms with computers. Dozens of Union parents coach sports teams.
Washington's PTA parents tend not to meet formally. They meet on ballfields or the playground or the school parking lot while waiting to pick up a child. There, the word is spread: Can you make calls to raise money for a family in trouble? Can you talk to fourth graders about engineering on Career Night? Will you come to the board meeting to talk about the bond referendum?
"We've been allowed to establish a community in the school," said Mrs. Pastore.
Before she had children, Mrs. Pastore ran a gift shop in Montclair. She and her husband, Tony, a salesman who works out of his home, decided to forgo some income and move from a seven-bedroom, five-fireplace house into something more modest. They'd had money. Now, with two boys, they wanted time.
"I wouldn't give up time with my kids, and neither would my husband," she said. "A lot of mothers get jobs that don't interfere with their schedule with the kids. And lots of mothers in Union stay home."
Washington School is more than a place where children learn to read, write, multiply, think logically. With the efforts of the administration, teachers and parents, it has become a place for Union residents to meet one another, to contribute their knowledge, skills and good will, to feel and become a part of the town they've chosen to live in.

 BODY:
I take strong issue with Lewis on two specific points. He writes: "Most Americans do not enjoy taxable capital gains." In fact, many Americans do own common stock, via mutual or retirement funds or both. In addition, almost all Americans who have jobs in the private sector are affected, directly or indirectly, by the level of available venture capital in the economy. Many older Americans are now locked into stocks they bought years ago because of the tax they would have to pay on illusory gains that exist solely because of inflation. 
 Lewis says, "The Templeton Growth Fund . . . makes risky plays mainly in foreign countries." John Templeton, who founded the fund that bears his name, is widely known to be a firm believer in buying shares in undervalued companies and holding them for a long time. After Templeton's retirement, this investment philosophy remains in place. There are speculators, but Templeton isn't one of them.

Is Simpler Better? State Readies New Rules for Building

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
New Jersey is about to undergo a subtle but important change in the way houses, and neighborhoods, are built.
Until now, every city and town has had its own standards governing development sites: how wide each street should be, what the sewer pipes should be made of, whether sidewalks are required and so on. But under regulations that are to take effect next summer, all residential developments would be subject to the same guidelines. 
 State officials say the new standards represent a vast simplification that will end up saving money -- as much as $2,000 for every new house, some of which will be passed on to buyers -- and will set a nationwide precedent.
"I don't know of any other state that has a statewide set of site standards, so this is very important," said David Listokin, professor of urban planning at Rutgers University's Center for Urban Policy Research, whose research formed the basis of the standards.
But some local officials, particularly those who have long been involved in planning and zoning, call the new guidelines an inadequate one-size-fits-all approach that strips power from the municipalities.
"This is a direct assault on home rule from A to Z. This is obnoxious," said Mayor William J. Pascrell Jr. of Paterson. "At least $15 million worth of development in our city would have been curtailed by these standards. We don't have the space to put in all the parking they say should go in; we're not a suburban community."
The standards cover a host of seemingly technical items, from storm-water management to the width of new streets. But their overall purpose is far from technical: to establish a flexible range of building requirements applicable to all communities. The rules are intended to complement the state's Uniform Construction Code, which in 1975 standardized regulations for building houses.
"As people realized savings with the construction codes of the mid-1970's, they realized the same type of thing could be applied for streets and sewer pipes," said Joanne Harkins, director of land use and planning for the New Jersey Builders Association, a trade group. "The amount of money spent running here and there to get approvals is just incredible."
In 1993, Gov. Jim Florio signed a law authorizing uniform site standards and establishing an independent advisory panel, composed of planners, builders, local officials, and others, to hammer out the details. The final report is not expected until next month; public hearings are to follow.
"I think you add professionalism, predictability and consistency," said Charles A. Richman, assistant commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs, which will adopt and administer the standards. "It's all the more important because housing starts are dropping and the inventory of readily available, zoned and approved site plans is dropping."
Beyond the criticism from local officials, the new rules have come under attack from transportation advocates and environmentalists, who say more attention needs to be paid to pedestrians' and bicyclists' concerns. These advocates have made some headway, pressing for more sidewalks, bikeways, and "traffic calming" measures like improved signs, speed barriers and raised crosswalks, depending on housing density and other factors.
"The original draft was definitely put together by engineers whose mind-set is from the post-World War II period of urban sprawl," said Mary D'Arcy, transportation advocate for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Law and Policy Center, in Trenton. "The draft now before the board is better, but we still have work to do."
The loudest objections have come from the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the group New Jersey Planning Officials, which represents municipal planning and zoning boards. They say the standards, while technically acceptable, create an unnecessary state bureaucracy that limits the power and options of municipalities. If used at all, they argue, the standards should be used as a guide, not a mandate.
"The majority of builders work in one or two municipalities, and these builders know those municipalities very well; they know the rules, the procedures, the time the office is open," said Gregory C. Fehrenbach, municipal manager of Lakewood Township. "The new standards are a matter of concern to builders, planners, engineers and landscape architects who want to be able to have statewide business and the same cookbook rules for all towns, not taking into account special circumstances."
The future doesn't look any brighter, Mr. Fehrenbach said. There is now talk of site standards for commercial and industrial areas, and talk of legislation to overhaul municipal land-use laws. But panel members said the residential site standards were necessary and fair.
"I'm convinced that what we've come up with is best for the municipalities," said Harvey S. Moskowitz, president of Mosko witz, Heyer & Gruel, the state's largest planning consulting firm, based in Florham Park. "I think the standards are flexibile enough. It's an attempt to bring up the standards where they've been deficient, and it cuts back where they've been excessive."

The 2 Mrs. Whitmans, As Viewed by the G.O.P.

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It is December in Washington, and there are Christmas parties for every lawyer and lobbyist in the city. These events are not for fun, not for the hosts at least, who hope to gain a little attention for their many causes. The Republican National Committee offered up some mini-pizza and chicken-with-peanut kebab in a somber room over Union Station, and Haley Barbour, the chairman, left no doubt about his purpose when he broke away from a clutch of people and set out to perform the duties of host by apologizing, " 'Scuse me while I go do some work."
That was on Monday, the day Governor Whitman met Senator Bob Dole in Edison to endorse him for President. There was not a lot of surprise in her choice, because there was not a lot of choice left for her in the Republican field, now that Gov. Pete Wilson of California and Gen. Colin L. Powell of everyone's dreams have taken themselves out of the race. 
 Mr. Barbour said he was enthusiastic about Mrs. Whitman's decision to endorse Mr. Dole, but not for the reasons many other Republicans are. Republican moderates might expect someone to note that Mr. Dole has burned a lot of his centrist bridges in pursuit of a nomination controlled by the Republican right, and that he will need all of the carpentry skills of people like Mrs. Whitman to rebuild them once -- that is, if -- he becomes the nominee.
Others might expect some mention of the gender gap, which is the evidence that the Republicans have a problem with female voters, since men far more men than women seem willing to support the G.O.P. It is a gap that can only widen with the anti-abortion language of the Republican campaign so far, and because Mrs. Whitman is the country's only female governor, and very possibly the country's most prominent Republican feminist, some might expect the party chairman to embrace a public figure who enlarges the leading contender's appeal.
But no. The party chairman's spin on Christie Whitman is to focus on the fairly narrow issues that got her elected, which is lower taxes and a government-is-the-problem message that just happens to be what most of the G.O.P. Presidential field is saying, not to mention the Republican leadership in Congress. It is an approach that may be hard to sustain if the Governor's luck runs out next year.
"What Governor Whitman brings to this race is that she is a very popular and well-known Governor who ran for office and won on the Republican agenda -- lower taxes and economic growth," Mr. Barbour said. "That's why I chose her to give the response to the President's State of the Union. I mean, I'm not as dumb as I look."
To be fair to Mr. Barbour -- it was his Christmas party, after all -- the Presidential race is still a long way off, the Republican convention is not until June, he cannot appear to endorse one contender over another, and why should he admit to any problems in his party anyway?
Here's why. Next year is going to be a very tough one for Governor Whitman's fiscal ideals, and it may become very hard for her to campaign next summer as the Governor who brought lower taxes and economic growth to New Jersey. Robert Littell, the State Senate Budget Committee chairman, believes that spending will have to rise $1 billion to $1.3 billion in the next budget. It is only a coincidence that $1.3 billion is the amount of taxes the Governor is saving New Jersey voters with her 30 percent income-tax cut, and so will not be available to the state next year.
In the coming budget, Mr. Littell pointed out, the state must complete the takeover of the county court system. State interest payments will grow, and the Governor must provide the State Supreme Court a plan, by next September, to show how the state will meet the court's order to bring spending in poor school districts up to the level of rich ones.
Revenues, meanwhile, are borderline at best, running about 1 percent below the level forecast by the Treasurer last spring. And the unemployment rate ticked up last month, to 6.1 percent from 5.7 percent, and now stands, once again, above the national average.
Mrs. Whitman's anti-tax message began to fray, meanwhile, with the introduction of a bill last week to raise cigarette taxes by 60 percent, to pay for hospital charity care and extend health benefits for poor children. The Governor supports such a tax increase.
These are serious portents, and not to be celebrated, as some must secretly be doing. No one should wish to see the Governor fail, but it is hardly perverse to wonder how she will be able to campaign for Mr. Dole next year as a tax cutting economy-booster if the news columns are filled with articles about how she had to raise taxes and her economy is flagging.
In that situation, maybe Mr. Barbour and Mr. Dole would wish to look around for some other other way to compliment the Governor. Something about the old-fashioned way she has tried to bridge the differences between the Republican right and left, and has tried to enlarge her party's appeal instead of confining it to a movement that thinks taxes are un-American and that government is author of all our problems.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Tax Incentives Make a Buyer's Heart Grow Fonder

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
A BUSINESS that owns its premises is more likely to be rooted to its community than one that merely leases. When it expands, it is more likely to try to do so in place.
"It doesn't have to face a decision every five or 10 years about whether to leave or stay," said George G. Sirras, president of Major Development Company, a commercial brokerage in Flushing, Queens. "And the banks are more willing to provide the financing they need." 
 These verities are currently finding expression in the industrial real-estate market in Queens among manufacturing companies that are both buying and selling properties. The sellers typically have had stability of place for decades, while the buyers are looking for that stability.
A leading example on the buying side is the American Umbrella Company. It is a 50-year-old family-owned business that for 16 years has rented a floor in the Cooper-Siegel Building, at 18th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, where it operates with 75 employees and 130 sewing machines. With Tishman Speyer Properties, the owner, bringing in major retailers and seeking office users upstairs, the space has become too expensive for a manufacturer.
Facing a lease expiration, American Umbrella was "within five days of signing a rental deal in New Jersey," said Richard Ziskin, 41, president of the company. But then Henry Auffrath, Chemical Bank's vice president for business development in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, with offices in Rego Park, Queens, got wind of his intentions.
THE banker sold the company on the advantages of buying, said Mr. Ziskin, and will soon move into the former Lyon Leather Company building at 1831 Starr Street, in Ridgewood, Queens.
Apart from getting a more efficient loading and unloading operation in the 50,000-square-foot building, the appeal of buying rested largely on an expanded tax-incentive program introduced by the Giuliani administration two months ago. Industrial properties are now eligible for an exemption for 16 years of 100 percent of the taxes that result from the rise in assessment caused by the work that is done to improve the building for reoccupancy. The exemption then declines by 10 percent a year for 9 years.
To get that 25-year benefit, the improvement has to add at least 10 percent to current assessed value. But if the work adds 25 percent or more to assessed value, the building is also eligible for 12 years of abatement of existing taxes, based on 50 percent of the current assessment for four years, and after that declining by 10 percent every other year for the remaining 8 years. The benefits apply to new construction or renovation.
The effect of all this, brokers say, is to allow industrial companies to own real estate for about what it would cost to rent space.
ACCORDING to Mr. Sirras, for example, a user-buyer of the former Robbins Men's & Boys' Wear building in Sunnyside -- 108,000 square feet of ground-floor space plus a parking area at 39-34 43d Street -- would be able to cut property taxes by about $120,000 a year under the program, or more than $1 a square foot.
There is also the prospect of an electric rate from Con Ed as much as 25 percent below the normal rate, available as an economic development incentive. Together, the two incentives would cut effective occupancy costs for ownership to about the same cost as renting, Mr. Sirras said, or about $6 a square foot a year, including mortgage debt.
"Until this program was improved, a lot of my customers found that it was clearly more advantageous financially to move to New Jersey," said Mr. Auffrath, the Chemical banker, who conducts seminars for manufacturers on financing issues. "Now it's a level playing field." Under a state program, he said, banks are also able to offer companies 90 percent financing for acquisition and improvement loans, enabling user-buyers to make purchases with only a 10 percent down payment.
But more often than not the purchaser is not a user but a developer-contractor who divides and rebuilds the space to rent out to several tenants. There is greater demand for small space than large space.
"The deals we make are mostly for under 50,000 square feet, and mainly for under 30,000 square feet," said Michael Fierman, a senior broker at Greiner-Maltz Company, based in Long Island City. When companies need 100,000 square feet or more, he said, they have trouble finding it in Queens.
The improved incentive program may lead to more purchases by users, however. According to the latest Greiner-Maltz survey, there are now 18 one- or two-story factory or warehouse buildings of 100,000 to 150,000 square feet on the sales market in Queens.
One of these properties is the 12-acre Edo Corporation compound on Flushing Bay in College Point. Edo is a public company that makes aircraft landing gear, among other aircraft-related products, with $90 million in sales last year.
Edo was founded in College Point in 1925 by Earl Dodge Osborne, first as a manufacturer of small seaplanes and later as a maker of the floats or pontoons that allow planes to land on water. It has branched out to many other aircraft devices, including many for the military, to which sales have declined. Edo has operations across the country, but its headquarters are in College Point.
"We used to have as many as 700 or 800 people working at College Point," said Marvin Genzer, the general counsel. Now there are 150.
Last year Edo put its three College Point buildings on the market -- one of 148,600 square feet, another of 76,100 square feet and a third of 20,800 square fee. Mr. Genzer was unwilling to discuss negotiations going on with potential buyers, but they are said to include developers who might redevelop part of the space for other tenants, enabling Edo to consolidate in a portion of it.
Another long-term Queens company that has been affected by military cutbacks is Ozone Industries, a supplier of hydraulic components and landing gear to the aircraft industry and the military. For nearly 50 years it has operated on 101st Street in Ozone Park, where it was founded.
IN 1980 the company was sold to Joy Manufacturing, and seven years later Joy sold it to BBA Group, a British conglomerate. Last winter Ozone bought a 65,000-square-foot building out of foreclosure in East Lyme, Conn., and has been steadily shifting operations there since May.
"We looked all over the Northeast, with economic development agencies helping us," said Robert P. Terenzi, Ozone's president. "We ended up in Connecticut because of the bankruptcy of the company that owned the building. We got a very attractive price."
Now Ozone is trying to sell the three buildings with 200,000 square feet of disjointed space that it collected over 50 years. Military cutbacks had left the company with more space than it needed, Mr. Terenzi said, and it was inefficient space at that. "We needed one building under one roof for production efficiency," he said.
In Connecticut, Ozone has about 100 employees, said Alan Macht, the firm's chief financial officer. As recently as 1992 it had 250 employees. About a quarter of the employees from Queens have relocated to Connecticut.
One contractor who has purchased and redeveloped industrial property for smaller users in Queens recently is Joseph LoStrito. He acquired the 127,500-square-foot three-story building at 114-02 15th Avenue in College Point a year ago. Ten smaller tenants have taken space at rents of $5 to $6 a square foot, brokers said.
That, too, was a situation that began with the departure of a long-term owner-user. Traulsen Refrigeration Company, a privately held manufacturer of stainless steel refrigeration equipment, had been in the building for more than 40 years. The company moved its factory to a 320,000-square-foot building in Fort Worth, Tex.

FINDING a Santa Claus who looks like the real thing is not easy. No one knows this better than Leslie Catlin of Berlin, who is in the business of supplying Santas to malls, shopping centers and private parties.
So Ms. Catlin is forever on the lookout for Santa look-alikes or at least reasonable facsimiles. And for a long time one of her best prospects was Bill Welch, a Scout master to one of her sons. 
 "Bill had this wonderful white beard and I was after him for years to be a Santa," Ms. Catlin said in an interview. "But he always said, 'When I retire.' Well, he finally retired and now he's one of our best Santas at the Westfarms Mall." Mr. Welch is one of about 40 Santas, along with about 60 Santa's helpers, that Ms. Catlin has provided this Christmas season for two shopping centers in Connecticut. With fewer spots open for Santas these days, there is no shortage of applicants, but ones who come close to naturally look the part, like Mr. Welch, are rare.
Why the decline in the number of Santas? Mainly, it's because in years gone by Santas could be found in almost every town's department stores. But nowadays it's the mall, and only one to a mall no matter how many stores are involved.
"It's all changed, and economics are primarily responsible," said Lud Baldwin, a drama teacher at the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, who has been portraying Santa and training others to do so for 17 years. "The stores pool their resources and you wind up with only one Santa, which is much less costly than having a Santa in individual stores. Unfortunately it can mean long lines and less time for children to spend with Santa."
Nowadays the best place to find Santa is in the center of a shopping mall. He is likely to be surrounded by Santa's helpers who pass out free candy to children and take their pictures sitting on Ol' Kris's lap -- for a fee. Considering that this very seasonal job pays between $8 and $12 an hour (longer service and a natural beard usually means more pay) and requires, among other things, a jovial disposition and intense concentration, it is surprising that so many Santas return year after year to ask tots, and some grown-ups, whether they've been naughty or nice and, regardless of the answer, what they want for Christmas.
"It's pretty demanding work and there's quite a lot of pressure," said Mr. Welch, a retired tool maker and model maker who has been at Westfarms Mall for three years. The mall, which straddles the border between West Hartford and Farmington, has six Santas and 130 stores. "But I love it and I think I have more fun than the people in line," Mr. Welch said. "And the kids are wonderful. To see the smiles on their faces makes it all worthwhile."
To Jim Weed of West Hartford, playing Santa is so special that he takes vacation from his job at a preschool center each December so that he can do it full-time. "At the risk of sounding corny, being Santa is a privilege," said Mr. Weed. "There's a very special connection between children and Santa Claus and words can't describe the magic in the children's eyes when they talk with Santa. At times you look out and see the line around the corner and wonder if you'll have enough energy to handle it. But of course you do."
Mr. Weed was a Santa at the G. Fox & Company store in Hartford for 15 years, until the store closed in 1992. For the last two years, he has been one of 16 Santas in the "Winter Wonderland" that takes up six floors of the former G. Fox store in downtown Hartford.
Mr. Baldwin, who was head Santa at G. Fox for 13 years, said "On Saturdays and Sundays there can be as many as 13 Santas at work in different rooms at Winter Wonderland." But can't so many Santas prove confusing to young children? "Not really," he replied. "After all, Santa is magical and he can be in as many places as he wants to be. Look at him on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning."
The Santas at Winter Wonderland not only come in different shapes; they also come in different colors, and some of them speak two languages. "We have a few African-American Santa Clauses and several who are Spanish-speaking," said Mr. Baldwin. "And we have a Santa who is able to communicate in sign language."
But you won't find a woman Santa at Winter Wonderland. Or, so far as is known, anywhere else in Connecticut. "We tried female Santas about 20 years ago and the kids were furious," said Ms. Catlin, the owner of Leslie Photo Promotions in Berlin. "They know that Santa is a man. We tried females again once or twice but realized that it doesn't work because the kids get upset."
Mr. Baldwin said G. Fox, too, had tried using women as Santas. "But it didn't work out because it was impossible for them to disguise their voices," he said. "The store got some complaints and stopped using them."
That is not to say that women are not a part of the Christmas scene. "I remember how I was going into a shopping center a few years ago when I saw a man with a great white beard who I knew would make a great Santa," said Ms. Catlin. "I told him so and then I said to his wife, 'You'd make a great Mrs. Claus.' And they both agreed to do it." This year, the couple, Eugene and Trudy Pike, are Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus at a shopping mall in Natick, Mass., which is one of Ms. Catlin's clients.
What qualifies a person to be Santa, or Mrs. Claus? "No. 1, you have to like children and obviously you have to be very outgoing," said Ms. Catlin. Then there's the physical appearance, and, Ms. Catlin said, "We make very thorough security and criminal checks on people we're considering. We have to be very careful as to who our Santas are."
Santas come from many walks of life. "We have teachers, actors, students, retirees and even a few postal workers," Ms. Catlin said.
Postal workers? During the busiest time of the year for the Postal Service? "Yes," Ms. Catlin said, "and they work as Santa while they're working for the Post Office."
Most Santas require some training. "You just don't put on a red suit and start saying 'Ho, ho, ho,' " said Mr. Baldwin. "Even after a day or two of training, our Santas get coached on the side their first day or two on the job. One of the most important things we tell them is that Santa Claus doesn't make any promises. It's best to say, 'I'll see what I can do.'
"And it's important that they read the situation between the children and their parents. I practice what I preach, and even after all these years of being a Santa, it's very satisfying when, after you've been talking with a child, a parent says, 'That was wonderful.' "
While Barbie dolls and Barbie accessories -- she's making a big comeback -- and action figures like Power Rangers the most requested items for boys and girls this year some requests made to Santa are particularly touching.
"One child about 5 years old told me that she didn't need anything and that what she wanted most was peace on earth," said Bill Grace, a retired I.B.M. manager and one of the Santas at Winter Wonderland who donates his salary to Habitat for Humanity, an organization that builds and repairs houses for people in need.
Bill Welch, a Santa at the Westfarms Mall, recalled a girl, also about 5, who said, "I just would like to be able to help feed the homeless and make them happy."
Some requests are difficult to handle. "I had one little girl who told me that her one wish for Christmas was to get her mother out of jail," Mr. Grace said.
And John Torunski of East Lyme, a long-time Santa at the New London Mall, said more and more children were asking him to please bring their parents back together. "It's very touching," said Mr. Torunski.
Perhaps the hardest-working Santa in the state is Logan Jackson, who has held court as the lone Santa in the Center Court of the Stamford Town Center for the last three years. "Logan is absolutely wonderful with kids and, with his white beard, he is Santa," said Al Messer, the general manager of the 130-store mall.
"Logan comes up from Tennessee and works seven days a week from 10 in the morning until 10 at night, and he loves it. We couldn't have a better Santa." With 6 children and 23 grandchildren, Mr. Jackson, a retired house painter, knows something about the younger set.
"He has an amazing patience," Mr. Messer said. Not to mention tremendous energy and endurance.
How does Mr. Jackson do it?
"If I get tired, I just look into the eyes of the little kids coming up to me, take a deep breath and say to myself, 'You can do it'," said Mr. Jackson, who estimates he sees between 500 and 600 children a day, along with more than a few teen-agers and even grownups, particularly in the evening.
If the demand for Santas has waned since the demise of the old-fashioned department store, some of the slack is being picked up elsewhere.
"In recent years we've been getting more calls for Santas to show up at corporate parties," Ms. Catlin said. "And there've been a lot of requests for Santas at house parties and on Christmas Eve. People will hide presents outside and tell Santa in advance where they are. Then when he arrives, he brings in the presents and passes them out to members of the family."
Lud Baldwin, who also supplies Santas, said that he, too, gets such requests.
"Some of the Santas we send out on Christmas Eve follow a route, from house to house, distributing gifts," he said.
Just like the Jolly Old Elf himself, but without the reindeer.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut;
For Duracell, a $70 Million, Self-Sufficient Hq

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE opening late last month of Duracell International's new 310,000-square-foot, $70 million world headquarters in Bethel could ignite renewed interest in the once-popular corporate campus headquarters so self-sufficient that employees never left the premises from morning to night.
It is the only single-occupancy commercial building of its size to have been built in Connecticut in more than a decade. 
 There are similarities between the Duracell headquarters and such icons of corporate campus life in the 70's as American Can in Greenwich, Union Carbide in Danbury and Stauffer Chemical in Westport.
Like them, Duracell is in a fairly remote location, making on-site amenities necessary. It has its own cafeteria, sundries shop and two and half miles of outdoor jogging trails, and it looks out on a pristine country landscape. Conveniences of the 90's include automatic teller machines, a media center that telecasts local and CNN news and produces teleconferences within the building or internationally, and a fitness center with 27 stair-climbing machines, treadmills and rowing machines.
When the recession struck, none of the earlier single-occupancy buildings survived the shift in corporate fashion from sprawling campuses to tighter quarters in downtown business districts. Within a decade of opening, they and other buildings like them were sold and broken up into smaller rental components. In the case of Union Carbide, the building was sold and the company took a lease on 658,000 of the 1.2 million square feet for its own use.
Duracell believes it has been more circumspect. "We didn't suddenly expand, collecting hundreds of people from distant locations," said Gregg A. Dwyer, senior vice president, general counsel and secretary. Duracell's employees, formerly scattered through eight rented buildings in the Berkshire Office Park, were consolidated at the new headquarters on 48 acres of the same park.
By comparison, American Can's 625,000-square-foot headquarters was built on more than 300 acres, almost as large as as the whole 325-acre Berkshire park property. Its employees, uprooted from other areas, were devastated by the cost of housing along Connecticut's Gold Coast. The current average cost of a three-bedroom house in the northern Fairfield towns of Bethel, Danbury and Brookfield, near the new Duracell headquarters, is $150,000 to $200,000. Southern Fairfield prices begin at $250,000.
Mr. Dwyer touched on other differences. "Our business is notoriously noncyclical," he said. "We are not as vulnerable to economic events. I don't want to sound arrogant about how wonderful the battery business is, but we didn't even notice the recession and we did not downsize."
Company revenues from manufacturing in the United States, Britain, Belgium, Canada and Brazil exceeded $2 billion this year. Duracell distributes its batteries to 85 countries.
THE company has been in Bethel since 1974, when it employed 100 people. It now has 650 employees and town approval to build an addition of 150,000 square feet, hire up to 775 employees and enlarge its 750-car parking structure by 100 spaces.
Land costs and construction were financed by a consortium of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank Brussels Lambert, the First Fidelity Bank, the First Chicago Bank and the Bank of Boston, Duracell's landlords under a five-year lease.. Mr. Dwyer said the lease included an option to buy the property, but he declined to discuss its financial terms.
"From the start," said Herbert S. Newman, architect for the project, "Duracell told us that they wanted a building that could be rented if they ever moved out." The design lends itself to that purpose -- carried out in four so-called precincts dedicated to specific corporate divisions and linked by a broad, skylighted spine called Main Street, whose walls display a revolving collection of contemporary art from Galleri Seven in Danbury.
Built into the side of a hill, the long, angled building reveals itself gradually as it is approached along a winding drive. The exterior and some interior walls were built of 460,000 dark red bricks made with manganese that is a byproduct of Duracell's battery production. Half of the building materials contain recycled or reclaimed ingredients, including the landfill of rock excavated during site preparation and pulverized.
"We were impressed with Duracell's interest in an ecologically sensitive building," said Mr. Newman, who has won more than 50 awards for design excellence in 30 years. He heads the New Haven architectural firm of Herbert S. Newman and Partners and teaches at the Yale School of Architecture. "We used energy-efficient lighting and relied heavily on natural light from skylights and large windows," he said. "Nobody is far from a window, and the work stations along Main Street keep co-workers in sight and in touch, much like a sidewalk cafe."
Leda M. Pierce, senior designer at the Manhattan firm of Haines Lundberg Waehler, was responsible for the interior. "The challenge was meeting Duracell's requirement for using only nontoxic and recycled materials," she said. The results include ceramic tile in the cafeteria made of recycled glass, nontoxic carpeting and upholstery, as well as furniture made of woods that are not from endangered species.
A COMPANY policy of inclusiveness permeates every aspect of the building's design. There is no executive dining room, parking area or entrance. The cafeteria seats 250 people and its attractive decor rivals that of many fine restaurants.
During the planning period, 160 employees weighed ideas for the new headquarters. Individuality is evident in the casual attire of Duracell's employees; anyone in a suit, male or female, is likely to be a visitor.
As for the almost 200,000 square feet of space that Duracell left behind, it is available at $8 to $12 a foot, excluding real estate taxes, common charges and utilities. In addition to Duracell, the Berkshire Office Park is occupied by seven high-technology companies and a day-care center operated by Bright Horizons, a national chain. That leaves 125 acres available, priced from $75,000 to $200,000 an acre depending on location, topography and the amount of infrastructure provided by the park's owners, Richard, Greg and Roy Steiner, a father, son and nephew, respectively.
"We will build to suit," said George Walker, vice president of marketing and development for the park, "anything from 15,000 square feet to as large as Duracell."
Bethel, a typical small town with a population of 17,541 in 17 square miles, has a moderate property-tax rate of $18.56 per $1,000 of assessment at 70 percent of market value. This year, Duracell paid $180,008 in taxes on the steel framework erected a year ago.
While Bethel's assessor, Christina Maddocks, declined to speculate on the taxes that the company would pay now that the property was fully developed, she said that "they will absolutely be our biggest taxpayer, and there is no question that they will affect the mill rate downward."

HEADLINE: Why Not a Detroit 'Acropolis'?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Tribute to Ruin Irks Detroit" (news article, Dec. 10): 
 The good burghers of Detroit may indeed be irked by Camilo Jose Vergara's suggestion that the pre-Depression-era skyscrapers of downtown can be turned into an American Acropolis, but there is nothing unusual about decay producing the ruins and monuments of tomorrow.
With its relatively short history of building edifices, the United States has lacked the sort of imposing, time-worn monument found in other cultures. The controversy over the fate of downtown Detroit raises the question whether relics from the immediate industrial past such as abandoned and derelict factories, warehouses, office buildings, railway stations and the like can become authentic rivals to the royal tombs, medieval castles and Gothic cathedrals of other civilizations.
All too often the response is demolition, rendering the city a patchwork of weed-filled lots.
But the process of finding new meanings and values for old structures so objected to in Detroit is under way elsewhere. The conversion of old industrial sites into landscapes of consumption is apparent at Lowell National Historical Park in Massachusetts, Baltimore's Inner Harbor, New York's South Street Seaport and Penn's Landing in Philadelphia.
The Andy Warhol Museum is happily ensconced in an old mattress factory in Pittsburgh. Important recycled industrial-era sites soon coming on line include the Roebling wire rope factory complex in Trenton and the derelict Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.
In Philadelphia, where the scale of industrial dereliction is hard to grasp (65 percent of land zoned for industrial use lies abandoned), it is difficult to see how conversion of old industrial sites into condominiums, arts centers and sports bars make up for the lost industrial economy.
But it is also hard to see how official redevelopment plans based on tax-abatement enterprise zones and the like produce much more than the occasional lumberyard, foam rubber warehouse or sawdust-bagging plant to interrupt vistas of industrial decline.
Subsequent generations may well plan holidays around an educational trek through the North Philadelphia National Park of Deindustrialization or a visit to a Disney EntropicWorld in Detroit.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Cyberstocks: Did You Miss Out?

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
THE little guy has missed out again, right?
Now that Internet stocks like Netscape have taken off into the cybersphere, it might seem that the big shots who got in early have made the instant fortunes, leaving everyone else in the dust. 
 History suggests, though, that nothing is further from the truth. Odds are, it is not too late to invest in the Internet, and it might even be far too early. If you jump in now, you could get soaked.
Look at it this way: when the auto business was born a century ago, investors faced hundreds of choices, including Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. If you had, by good fortune, bought stock in one of those three, you would be riding high now.
But as David L. Lewis, a professor of business history at the University of Michigan, points out, for every auto company that became a giant, "there were a couple of hundred that did not make it, and people lost a substantial amount of money." While you might have bought stock in General Motors, you could have just as easily picked, say, the U.S. Motor Corporation, which failed in 1911.
Now, too, with the Internet in its infancy, you would have to be clairvoyant to hitch on to the right Internet star.
Many are tempted to try, though. The world is abuzz over the Internet, the rapidly growing network that links personal computers all over the world. Bill Gates makes speeches about it, Business Week writes splashy cover stories about it and investors fall all over themselves to participate in what they view as technology's Second Coming.
Just ask Suzanne Bell, a small investor in Houston who bought stock in one start-up and uses the Internet to discuss her picks with others.
"Use your imagination," she admonishes the skeptics. "This stuff is big. The implications are phenomenal."
Phenomenal is certainly the word for stocks like Netscape Communications. "I wish I could have gotten Netscape when it was lower," sighed Ms. Bell, who, like most people, could not get the shares at their initial price of $28 in August. Leery of buying them at two or three times that price in the next few days, she passed up the stock only to watch it rise to $130.50 recently. That is down from its high of $174 -- many Internet stocks tumbled late last week -- but it's still hot.
Forrester Research estimates that the overall Internet market will explode from about $300 million today to $10 billion by 2000. While investors can no longer benefit from the gravity-defying run-ups of the first crop of new Internet issues, there will be plenty of chances.
"The central fear people have is they've missed out," said Roger B. McNamee of Integral Capital Partners, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif. Mr. McNamee dismisses such anxiety as foolish.
As the Internet develops, investors will be in a much better position to choose the investments that have the highest odds of paying off. As with any burgeoning industry, whether cars or biotechnology, the enthusiasm, and hype, are highest at the start. Investors might want to ignore the current mania and wait for the almost inevitable shakeout.
They will most likely get another chance to buy many of today's hot stocks at far lower prices, and they will also have plenty of opportunities later to buy equally attractive start-ups and established companies. Options for some of these stocks, like Netscape, do not even exist yet, making concentrated bets difficult. "It's just coming off the runway here," said Byron R. Wien, an investment strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company
Of course, it is hard not to envy all the people, usually company insiders and venture capitalists, who have already made enormous sums on offerings like Netscape, Uunet Technologies and Spyglass. But the scarcity of Internet stocks has led to the out-of-sight price rises typically seen in everything from tulips to biotech.
Take Netscape, which develops software that helps people use personal computers and modems to make their way around the Internet. Although Netscape is considered a fine little company, it isn't making any money yet on its products. But frenzied investors have already awarded the company a market value of $5 billion, about 120 times its sales over the last four quarters.
It is not alone. Netcom On-Line Communications, which helps people get onto the Internet, has a market value 38 times its sales. Spyglass Inc., which also develops software for navigating the Internet, goes for 136 times its tiny revenues. By contrast, Microsoft, which really does dominate its industry, has a market value of less than 8 times its $7 billion in revenue.
"The equity market has failed to differentiate between the extremely large overall market opportunity and the various business opportunities available to individual companies," warned Jonathan H. Cohen, an analyst with Smith Barney who recently started following some Internet stocks and recommends that investors steer clear.
At some point, the market will likely take a less rosy view of today's hot companies, probably when one of them stumbles or if profits take much longer to materialize than Wall Street expected. Investors would then be able to snatch up shares of a Netscape or a Spyglass at much lower prices.
That is what happened in biotechnology in the mid-80's -- and again in the early 90's. Investors realized that the spate of promising young companies would not be coming up with an instant cure for cancer or the common cold, and even those that eventually proved to be success stories were available a bargain-basement prices. Amgen, for one, lost roughly three quarters of its value by late 1984, the year after it went public. "If you had bought at the offering, you'd have a great investment," said Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley, Calif. "But if you waited a year or so, you'd have a better investment."
And Wall Street has not forgotten the bruising it took on biotech. Even now that many companies have started earning more money, the stocks have been slow to recover. The American Stock Exchange biotechnology index, for example, which began in October 1991, still has not matched its earlier highs.
IF you think Internet stocks are overpriced, it may be tempting to bet on a price drop by selling them short -- selling borrowed shares in the hope of replacing them later with shares bought for less. But in addition to the practical difficulties of finding stock to borrow, investors could lose vast sums if the stocks continue to defy gravity.
"You can get nailed," warned Michael Murphy, who writes the Overpriced Stock Service, a newsletter in Half Moon Bay, Calif., though he still recommends that sophisticated investors sell Internet stocks short. But because so many portfolio managers will keep buying simply because a stock is rising, he said, "you cannot afford to stay short."
The smartest strategy is probably to sit out the current buying frenzy. No matter how big a market the Internet may become, it is not going to develop fully overnight. In fact, Bob Metcalfe, who invented the Ethernet, one of the first "local area networks" for office computers, said the Internet faced some serious obstacles.
For one thing, it is difficult to measure how many people actually use the network and to protect companies' private computer networks from outsiders. Also, no one can predict how well the network, and the telephone lines, can handle the growing volume of users, or when a safe way will be found to sell things on the Internet and make it a commercial success. While companies that solve these problems may eventually make good investments, overall progress could be slow.
Also, as in any field, investors may discover that the businesses that seem the most promising at first lack long-term potential because competition drives away potential profits. Many new companies, for example, simply help people connect to the Internet. But as giants like AT&T, MCI and I.B.M. muscle their way into that business, start-ups like Netcom, Uunet Technologies and Psinet could get shoved out of the way unless they are nimble.
If investors have their heart set on buying new issues, there will be plenty to choose from in coming years. Venture capitalists are "going to plant Internet companies like Johnny Appleseed," predicted Howard Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a Boston technology research firm.
Promising possibilities include Raptor Systems in Waltham, Mass., and Checkpoint Software Technologies Ltd. in Israel, which focus on keeping interlopers out of corporate networks. Other candidates include RSA Data Security Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., which scrambles data so prowlers cannot decipher it, and companies involved in new electronic Internet-friendly forms of money, like First Virtual Holdings in San Diego or Cybercash in Reston, Va.
But only a few will make it. "The shakeout is coming," warned Mr. Anderson, who said the industry would begin a painful consolidation as soon as next year. It's a stage every new industry, no matter how revolutionary, goes through.
The auto industry was just one example. Investors learned the same lesson when the personal-computer industry got off the ground in the early 1980's. While investing early in Compaq Computer would have made someone a fortune, there were plenty of disappointments: Vector Graphics, for example, or Eagle Computer, both of which went bankrupt within a few years. "In the early stages, you have to avoid kidding yourself and thinking you know how it's going to turn out," said Mr. Murphy, the newsletter writer.
In fact, among the biggest mistakes investors can make is thinking they can spot the right company. "My ability to name a winner is zilch," said Eric T. Miller, chief investment strategist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "For the average person to try to pick individual stocks, good luck."
Buying several stocks may be the only way to get better odds. Robert Natale, director of equity research at Standard & Poor's, notes that the odds of hitting oil are much greater if you drill 10 wells instead of 3. "What you're counting on is the one or two gushers to counter the risk and make up for all the losers," he said. He says that if investors are unwilling to pick at least 10 stocks, and bet that one of them will rise far more than tenfold, they would be better off choosing a diversified technology mutual fund.
THE safest way to play the Internet could be to bet on companies that have established themselves in other areas of technology. They have already demonstrated an ability to understand technology markets and, more important, make a profit from them. Many are already setting their sights on the Internet. "Your success ratio, in our opinion, will be much higher," said John Force, the manager of the PBHG Technology and Communications Fund.
Like Mr. Force, Ronald E. Elijah, manager of the Robertson Stephens Value and Growth Fund, is staying away from pure Internet stocks to search for companies that provide the nuts and bolts and related software for the development of the network. He likens the Internet to the gold rush, when it wasn't most miners who made money, but the people selling to the miners.
Among the hardware and software companies trying to profit from the Internet are Cisco Systems, Ascend Communications, Sun Microsystems, Bay Networks, U.S. Robotics, Intuit, Adobe Systems and, yes, Microsoft. Some, like Sun, have already seen their stocks soar, but others have yet to take off. While investors would be wrong to consider buying the stocks of these companies only in terms of their potential to capitalize on the Internet, many will benefit as much from the new technology as any start-up, and possibly even more. What's more, if the Internet explosion does not pan out as expected, these companies still have their other business to fall back on.
The best advice may be to relax and resist giving into the panic that you're missing out on it all. "Those people who want instant gratification are going to get clobbered," said Mr. Anderson of the Yankee Group.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Clinton's Tax Crackdown Would Hit Investors, Too

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
WHEN the Treasury Department proposed strict new tax rules on Dec. 7 -- Pearl Harbor Day -- big companies and Wall Street firms quickly cried sneak attack. But while the Administration's move is aimed mostly at those groups, someone else who will be caught up in the combat made nary a peep: individual investors.
Many of the proposals center on that puzzling investment known as preferred stock. These securities give investors first dibs on dividends, ahead of holders of common stock. If a company gets into trouble, preferreds give investors a claim on assets that also outranks that of common shareholders, although not that of bond owners. And because preferreds do not return any principal, they generally yield higher dividends than do bonds. 
 This year, roughly $15 billion of these part-stock, part-bond investments have been issued, making for $80 billion that is now outstanding. That makes the market about equal to the gross domestic product of the Czech Republic, and Wall Streeters say it is a legitimate as well as big source of capital.
This market reacted swiftly to the tax proposals, which the White House says will raise $4 billion by 2005. J. P. Morgan, Monsanto and Pacific Telesis withdrew sales totaling $700 million in issues whose tax advantages were suddenly in doubt. These include some of the popular new preferreds, ones carrying exotic names like TOPrS (pronounced "toppers").
And preferred stocks that are already out there have fallen since the announcement. On Nov. 30, Chemical Bank's 8 3/8 percent preferred, which is callable in June 1997, traded at 26 1/4. At Friday's close, it was trading at 25 1/2. Issues callable in a decade or more are bearing even more damage. Florida Power and Light's 6.98 percent preferred sold for 1082/10 on Nov. 30, for instance. On Friday, after thin but volatile trading, it closed at 104 5/8.
In fact, the preferred-stock market is as frozen as a Midwestern winter or the current state of the Washington budget talks. "It's been very slow," said Jeanne L. Mockard, a manager of two mutual funds at Putnam Investments that specialize in preferred stock. "Nobody wants to sell at the new depressed prices for preferred, and nobody wants to buy because the tax advantages may now be diminished."
The Treasury's plan is a two-front offensive. It attacks companies' tax benefits both as investors and as issuers of investments.
Companies can now deduct from taxable income 70 percent of the dividends they receive on the stocks they own in another company, as long as they don't own more than 20 percent of it. Because the investor-company will be taxed on the dividends it pays its own shareholders, who will in turn pay taxes on those distributions, the rule prevents punitively high taxation of corporate investments, its proponents say.
But the Treasury, saying this deal is too generous, wants to cut the dividend deduction to 50 percent. That will make these investments less alluring to companies.
What about individual investors? Unlike companies, they pay full taxes on preferred dividends -- that is why companies are by far the biggest investors in the plain-vanilla preferreds that make up most of the market. But some individuals do buy them, and they may see their choices shrink if the proposals take root. Wall Streeterssay that companies will simply issue less preferred stock if their biggest customers get a smaller tax break.
The second part of the Treasury proposal starts with the fact that Wall Street has always regarded stocks and bonds as just two different ways of raising money. But dividends paid out on stocks -- common and preferred -- are not tax-deductible for the issuing corporation, while payments made to bondholders are.
The mad scientists of Wall Street finance, however, have managed to come up with a new instrument -- a special kind of preferred stock -- that gives the issuer a big tax deduction as does a bond and pays investors high yields.
IN these exotic flavors, like Merrill Lynch's TOPrS (trust-originated preferred securities), and Goldman Sachs's MIPS (monthly income preferred securities), companies create a trust or other structure. This intermediary issues the preferred stock called TOPrS, say, and then lends the proceeds to the company. The company makes interest payments to the intermediary for the loan, and the intermediary uses that cash to pay the dividends on the TOPrS. Because the company enjoys a tax break, it can afford to be more generous in the payout.
But the Clinton Treasury contends that these exotic instruments are tax loopholes -- ownership interests disguised as debt. To close them, the Administration proposes banning tax benefits for instruments that do not mature within 40 years. TOPrS and MIPS run afoul of this "Methuselah" rule. The bond-like portion of TOPrS, for instance, matures in 49 years.
As with the plan to trim the dividend deduction, this tighter tax rule will mean that fewer companies will issue these arcane securities. But for individuals, the proposal's impact will be far greater.
The reason is that, with dividends as much as 1 percentage point higher than a company's bonds, MIPS and TOPrS have become best sellers among investors, especially older people. For example, although Pacific Telesis's canceled sale of $500 million in TOPrS never reached the pricing stage, the securities would have likely carried an interest rate of 7.75 percent, the company says, instead of the 6.9 percent for Pacific Telesis bonds.
That's a big difference. At 7.75 percent, money is doubled in a bit more than nine years, instead of 10.5 years, as with 6.9 percent.
Also popular with individuals is the price tag. Even though the average purchase is $15,000, the investments are often priced low, like $25 a share, rather than at the somewhat forbidding $1,000 and up denominations of bonds.
Are the Treasury proposals here to stay? Republican leaders strongly oppose the measure, although everything in Washington is on the table for the budget negotiations. But Robert Flaherty, president of Flaherty & Crumrine, a fund manager in Pasadena, Calif., that specializes in preferred stock, says that even if the tax rules are changed, investors and companies will change their behavior and the $4 billion in anticipated tax revenue will never appear.
"Somebody over there in Washington has a bee in his bonnet," Mr. Flaherty said. "There will be a lot of fuss and they'll wind up not collecting a nickel in new taxes."

State Pulls Plug On Trade Center

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
To hear the state tell it, Harlem had ample opportunity to make a go of its proposed international trade center. After seven years of false starts, the state says, Gov. George E. Pataki had no choice but to pull the plug.
But according to those leading the project, the trade center was well under way; Governor Pataki simply took the $64 million in Regional Bank funds back for his budget. "He's got a budget to close," said Representative Charles B. Rangel. "If this was happening in some other community that was strongly Republican, this would not be happening." 
 The center, which was to occupy state-owned land on 125th Street at Lenox Avenue, was initially proposed in 1978 as an office, hotel and convention center and a centerpiece of Harlem's economic renewal. But the state says there was a lack of private interest in the project.
"After seven years, five extensions and $48 million that has been sitting there, they have not demonstrated that this is a viable project," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "We have decided that the money can be better spent right now."
He said the money would finance economic development projects in the metropolitan area, including a Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund that will try to leverage $250 million for distressed communities.
But Percy Sutton, chairman of the trade center's corporation, says he had commitments for more than 70,000 square feet of space at the center -- from Motown Records, Equitable Insurance and Essence Magazine, among others -- that would have paid for the remaining $18 million needed to get the complex constructed. He says the project was held up by factors outside its control, such as a troubled real estate market, a falling out with the center's original developer and the state's failure to transfer the land to the center.
The state's decision was announced three days before a racially motivated arson attack on 125th Street killed eight people, heightening tensions over economic issues in Harlem. It also comes at a time when local Democrats have been exploring nonpartisan avenues to economic development.
Mr. Gargano insists that the Governor's decision to take the money out of the trade center is no reflection of his larger commitment to economic development in Harlem. He pointed out that the state has committed $100 million to the Federal Empowerment Zone over the next 10 years. But Mr. Rangel is quick to point out that the Governor has yet to actually sign such a commitment.
As for the future of the trade center site, Mr. Gargano says the state hopes to develop it as retail space. But Mr. Sutton says he is not yet willing to concede defeat. "This is economic racism," he said. "Whether under this Governor or another Governor, we're going to build this trade center."

How Do You Solve a Problem Like Cityspire?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Cityspire, at 150 West 56th Street, is the skyscraper that whistled in the wind -- until some decorative slats were removed from its cooling tower. But the building's other problems have proved harder to solve.
When Cityspire's tower topped out 11 feet over its permitted height in 1987, city officials penalized the developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, by ordering three floors of studios for dance companies added atop what was supposed to have been a covered pedestrian arcade midblock between 55th and 56th Streets. 
 Today, the glass and granite Cityspire is still 11 feet too tall and is occupied by luxury offices and condominiums with stellar views. But the arcade remains unfinished -- and the studios were never started. Both languished when the recession forced the project into bankruptcy.
The building's current owners and the foundation that runs the adjacent City Center are now proposing a new solution. They would complete the arcade but, instead of adding studios over it, would renovate outmoded studios in the center. If the Planning Commission approved, both could be done next year.
When Cityspire was planned a decade ago, critics warned that the 73-floor behemoth would dwarf two neighboring cultural landmarks, Carnegie Hall and City Center. The critics were not mollified by the city's requirement for the arcade; they were outraged anew over the tower's height violation and then turned apoplectic over the city's solution.
"It's bizarre, to say the least, that the remedy for a case of overbuilding would be a proposal for additional building," said Joseph Rose, then chairman of Community Board 5. He also said the space was ill-suited for studios.
Today, Mr. Rose is in a better position to do something about Cityspire. He is chairman of the Planning Commission and is awaiting a formal application detailing the new plan. "The old deal made no sense," Mr. Rose said recently. "Now the obvious is being acknowledged at last."
Supporters of the new plan include the city's Cultural Affairs Department, which oversees the studio project because City Center is city-owned. Cityspire originally acquired the center's air rights in exchange for $6 million given to opera and ballet institutions, an addition of 10,000 square feet to the center and a promise to make $6 million in renovations, though not all the work was done.
Howard Goldman, Cityspire's lawyer, said the new plan would create 12,160 square feet of "far superior rehearsal space," nearly double the old plan, with better layouts, much higher ceilings, dressing rooms and a new City Center entrance on the arcade.
The unfinished arcade is a blot on 55th Street, next to the center's Moorish facade and opposite a canopied entrance to the Rihga Royal Hotel. Piles of pigeon droppings and trash lie inside the chain-link fence with its locked gate, barbed razor wire and plywood panels. About the only thing missing is a snarling junkyard dog. "It's been a long struggle," said Lois Framheim, director of the City Center 55th Street Foundation. "We have been living with a real eyesore." BRUCE LAMBERT

Five Candidates Scramble for Millard's City Council Seat

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
On paper, the City Council's Fifth District is heavily Democratic, but Charles Millard, a Republican, snatched the seat in 1991. He quit this month when Mayor Giuliani named him president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Now there is a scramble to fill the vacancy. 
 Last week, five candidates filed nominating petitions in an effort to qualify for the ballot in the special election on Jan. 16. Two of them failed to file the required number of signatures but are challenging the requirement in court.
The law bars traditional party names on the ballot, so candidates make up their own designations. But both the Republican and Democratic parties are very much involved.
The Republicans, with only 6 other seats in the 51-member Council, are eager to keep this toehold. They have teamed up with the Liberal Party to support Judith G. Marcus, a top aide to Mr. Millard and his Democratic predecessor, Robert Dryfoos. She is counting on the contacts she has built over 14 years as a problem-solver on the Upper East Side, working on everything from closing brothels to adding bus service.
She is the only Republican, and the only woman, in the race in a district where female voters outnumber men 3 to 2.
Democratic leaders back A. Gifford Miller, a top aide to United States Representative Carolyn B. Maloney. Mr. Miller is asking voters to send a message against the conservative Republican policies of Speaker Newt Gingrich and Gov. George E. Pataki, which he says hurt the city.
A dark horse is Andrew N. Schiff, a primary care doctor at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, who is concerned about health care issues. Two other candidates, George N. Spitz and Samuel D. Morell, have often run for local office but never won. Neither filed the 2,356 signatures required, but they have filed a joint lawsuit in Federal court opposing the requirement.
All five seek public financing. Ms. Marcus and Mr. Miller say they expect to reach the maximum of $124,000 in private and public funds.
The Upper East Side's many wealthy residents have earned it the nickname the Silk Stocking District, but people in the eastern portion are often of more modest means. Politicians call it the Nylon Stocking District.
Although Democrats account for 56 percent of the district's 77,000 voters, it has produced a string of liberal Republican winners. Independent voters account for 23 percent and Republicans 20 percent.
With no other contests, a low turnout is expected. "The victor," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat, "will be the candidate with the best organizing skills."
For years, the Manhattan Republican organization has been led by Roy M. Goodman, and for years Mr. Goodman has been re-elected to the State Senate. The organization has also helped elect John A. Ravitz to the Assembly and Mr. Millard and Andrew Eristoff to the Council.
Whatever the outcome, more battles over the Council seat are scheduled in the next 22 months. The victor on Jan. 16 will serve until the general election next November; the e winner of that election will serve the rest of the term but will come up for re-election in November 1997. Both November races may have primaries. BRUCE LAMBERT

2 Officials Suspended, Accused of Using Jobs for Personal Gain

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The state has suspended two top officials of the agency that runs Roosevelt Island, pending an investigation of complaints by present and former workers that the officials had used their positions for personal gain. Both officials denied doing anything improper.
Several leaders on the island, including an agency board member and a tenant representative, have defended the officials and have attributed the charges to workers disgruntled over labor and contract issues. 
 The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal suspended Barry Chafetz as vice president for operations of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation and Tom Sloan as director of facilities on Dec. 4. The suspensions are with pay. A spokesman for the state, Harry Ryttenberg, said he expected an inspector general to complete an inquiry "in a week or so."
Workers employed by the corporation have accused Mr. Chafetz of using other employees to work on his home in Queens. They accused Mr. Sloan of taking agency equipment and supplies in his private car.
Last week, Mr. Chafetz said that he had hired agency workers to repair and renovate his home but that they worked on weekends and he has check stubs to prove he paid them. "I welcome this investigation," he said. "I hope the investigation moves quickly so that my name can be cleared as soon as possible."
Mr. Sloan, whose telephone is unlisted, could not be reached for comment. But associates said he has denied taking anything and one said Mr. Sloan used his own car to deliver goods to work sites because no agency truck was available.
"I can't in my wildest dreams imagine Barry Chafetz stealing," said Ronald Vass, a member of the corporation's board. "He's too fine a person, totally competent and totally devoted. The loss of that man to the island would be devastating. It's got to be part of a revenge thing." Tim Johns, a leader in the Westview/ Island House Task Force, a tenants group, called the accusations against Mr. Chafetz "all horsefeathers."
"He may be brusque, but he's a straight arrow," Mr. Vass said. "He's been set up. I think the union's behind it." Local 32B-32J of the Building Service Employees Union, which represents workers on the island, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
Mr. Chafetz, who has been with the corporation for a decade, handles contract negotiations, which have been difficult lately because of reductions in state aid. Mr. Sloan, a relative newcomer to the corporation, and a former military man, has criticized workers for excessive slack time and has pushed for more productivity. BRUCE LAMBERT

Visions From the Great Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
ABOUT 6:30 A.M. every working day, a van arrives at a Sanitation Department garage to test 15 workers for drug use, fulfilling a controversial Federal law. Joseph Miller, the program's supervisor, is generally surprised by the reaction. "Many sanitation workers like the random drug testing," he says. "Think about it: they work in pairs, on a truck. How would you like to have a partner who's drunk or high on something? We get comments like, 'It's about time; it's a wonderful program.' "
Those on the front lines of the city's bureaucracy bear witness that municipal work has its quirks and insights. Last week, seven city workers were lifted, however briefly, from rounds of responsibility to tell a few of their stories -- and to receive $7,500 Sloan Public Service Awards from the Fund for the City of New York. 
 JoAnn Jacobs, a fire marshal, is part of a new unit that counsels young arsonists. She has plenty of stories about the career difficulties she has faced on the way -- some more surprising than others. In 1982, after a legal fight and a special test, she became the first black woman to be hired as a New York City firefighter. "At my retirement," she says, with a gentle, almost fond, rancor, "I'm sure some guy's going to raise his glass and say, 'You still didn't pass the test.'
"And I," she says with a laugh, "will have to punch him out."
But she didn't anticipate the amicable rivalries between truck companies, which break down the doors and pull out the people, and engine companies, which "merely" man the hoses.
And she didn't know, when she moved up to fire marshal and had to give up her uniform, that she would miss it so much. "The firefighter has always been perceived positively. They run into poor people's burning buildings as quickly as rich people's burning buildings. By taking off the uniform, I lost that." But she never lost her humor. "I really loved wearing the uniform," she continues, "but not on the train: they think you're a conductor. And for heaven's sake, don't go to the Brooklyn Museum in it: you look like a security guard."
And for Frank Vardy, a demographer for the City Planning Department, work is collecting the facts and figures that turn the metropolis into a series of small towns, and history into stories -- a talent that started early. His father was born in Ireland in 1896 and came to New York. He drove a truck for the American Can Company. And he played semipro baseball.
"He'd been all over the city in the course of playing baseball, mostly in places that have been built on now," says Mr. Vardy, who remembers tootling around in his dad's '36 Packard, listening to accounts of Lindbergh's great ticker tape parade, and Buffalo Bill Cody riding through town on his white horse.
But Mr. Vardy's vision of the past doesn't eclipse his delight in the present. "Sure, I can reminisce about other eras," he says. "But the current era is as good as any. This town was made by people, by immigrants, and it's great to watch these new immigrants change them, and be changed by the city. They become New Yorkers!"
 
MARILYN RICHTER, 46
TITLE: Deputy Chief of General Litigation for the Law Department
SALARY: about $80,000
RESPONSIBILITIES: Defends city policy and city managers in court.
HOW SHE SEES IT: "City officials work under extremely difficult circumstances. You're helping them exercise the discretaion they need to do their jobs. Litigation is often not the best way to resolve disputes; it often exacerbates some of the underlying emotional issues. You see this in employment discrimination cases; there's a lot of emotional anger. Litigation doesn't seem to heal that,it seems to make that worse. I think we've become too litigious a society. I think some of the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that people have been experimenting with are a good idea."
 
JOANN JACOBS, 44
TITLE: Fire Marshal
SALARY: about $54,000
RESPONSIBILITIES: As part of Junior Firesetters Program, counsels child arsonists. Was first black woman to be hired as New York City firefighter.
HOW SHE SEES IT: "You go to a party, say, and people say, 'What do you do?' And you either get skepticism or the guys want to arm-wrestle you. I learned to just say I work for the city. They say that with these firesetters, there's no economic pinpoint. It happens across all classes - but a lot of the families we see are black or Hispanic. I get a real kick out of being in this unit; I can establish a rapport with the mothers. And I think it helps, having someone that looks like them ringing the doorbell."
 
ANTONIO RODRIGUEZ, 41
TITLE: Director of Special Events for the Department of Homeless Services
SALARY: about $42,000
RESPONSIBILITIES: Channeling donated goods, performances, and services.
HOW HE SEES IT: "If homeless people think they're different, and at the same time they're seeing all this cultural richness, then maybe they're thinking, that's not for people like me. It's not even a question of money; it's a social thing. When you provide all these things, you're motivating homeless people to think of themselves differently, to change their own lives. You're socializing them into the life of the city. New York is very progressive. We want to do right. We do have this vision of a city for everybody. And when it doesn't happen, there's a controversy."
 
PETER ABATANGELO, 52
TITLE: Director fo Facilities Operations for the Public Health Laboratory, Department of Health
SALARY: about $59,000
RESPONSIBILITIES: All building operations at 455 First Avenue, including lab safety and installation of new medical testing equipment.
HOW HE SEES IT: "It's very fascinating. Goal No. 1 is to have the proper safety environment within the labs. No. 2 is to have a safe approach for people withing the labs. No. 3: whatever you release into the streets has to be safe, not to create the possibility of airborne bacteria."
 
JOSEPH MILLER, 45
TITLE: Director ofr Medical Division for the Department of Sanitation
SALARY: about $80,000
RESPONSIBILITITES: Supervises units that monitor sick leave and administer federally mandated random drug testing.
HOW HE SEES IT: "Sometimes somebody will call in sick from Florida or Puerto Rico. That's fine, but when they come back, they better have documentation. Or we'll say, c'mon! You were on vacation, and you took a few extra days!"
 
JOSEPH SALVO, 41
TITLE: Director of Population Division for City Planning
SALARY: about $60,000
RESPONSIBILITITES: Supervising the collection and analysis fo demographic information.
HOW HE SEES IT: "The thing that makes this job so interesting is that we provide data to everyone. Our job is to put the data out there and explain it. So that all sides can debate what is actually true, or, given the limitations of statistics, what is probably true. We get calls from all different sides of the immigration issue, and I'm very proud of that."
 
FRAND VARDY, 59
TITLE: Demographer for the Population Division, City Planning
SALARY: about $49,000
RESPONSIBILITIES: Collecting and analyzing demographic information.
HOW HE SEES IT: "This is just a big town. People look at it like it's a grandiose city that's beyond them, and it's not. This town was made by people, by immigrants. It's great to watch these new immigrants change the neighborhoods, an be changed by them. We believe we've got the best job in the city. We're here because we love it. We get to work for the greatest city in the world, and for the greatest people in the world."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Haiti Takes the Next Big Step

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
HE is not the man whom officials in Washington had hoped to see succeed Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But everything seems to indicate Haitians will elect Rene Preval as their new President in voting today -- which automatically means the United States now has a considerable investment in his future success.
 
The Honeymoon's Over
 The balloting comes after two months of friction in relations between the Clinton Administration and Mr. Aristide. After the year-long honeymoon that followed Mr. Aristide's restoration to power in October 1994, the two countries have recently had very public disagreements about issues like privatizing state companies and returning more than 160,000 pages of documents seized by American troops from the headquarters of the military and paramilitary groups here. 
 A calm and fair election with a respectable turnout would help arrest that decline. The primary goal of American policy here has always been to carry out a peaceful transfer of power from Mr. Aristide to a democratically elected successor in the presidency -- something that would be new in Haiti's turbulent 190-year history. A credible vote today is obviously essential to that process.
Mr. Preval's ascension comes as little surprise to Haitians: He has been Mr. Aristide's Prime Minister and is popularly regarded as the President's alter ego. Washington's favorite Haitian politician, Evans Paul, the former mayor of Port-au-Prince, was eliminated from the succession picture in the chaotic and widely-criticized parliamentary elections held here in June.
But neither Mr. Preval nor American policy makers will have long to savor his expected triumph.
Even before Mr. Aristide departs office on Feb. 7, the new President will have to begin negotiations with Haiti's foreign creditors and allies about economic reforms and perhaps also an extension, at a much reduced level and for a brief period, of the United Nations military presence here.
"This remains a very poor and troubled country with an extremely weak government structure," said one diplomat here. "The new President is going to have to confront all of the same problems that faced Aristide, but without the very important advantage of being Aristide and having the authority and prestige he enjoys."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Why Beijing Is So Afraid Of Mr. Wei

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
ASK average Chinese to name their most important goal and the answer will be: a good job; wealth; a visa to America or Europe; more wealth, or a good education.
Way down the list, perhaps just below dental work, would be: a democracy movement to change China. 
 In a nation that has put virtually all thoughts of politics aside, why then is the Communist leadership so afraid of Wei Jingsheng?
The pro-democracy campaigner, who got a 14-year prison sentence last week at a trial in which the verdict was decided not by a judge but by the Communist Party leadership, has never organized a march, never declared an opposition party and does not believe, as Mao did, that power comes out of the barrel of a gun.
 
Takes One to Know One
 But the crux of Mr. Wei's threat may be deceptively simple: it takes a group of aging revolutionaries to spot another one.
Sixty-five years ago, after hundreds of Communists had been rounded up and shot in Shanghai and Mao Zedong's tiny band of guerrillas was an encampment of gloom deep in the hills of southern China, Mao sent round a letter exhorting his commanders to action. He looked out across the wreckage of the Communist movement and saw a vision of victory:
"All China is littered with dry faggots which will soon be aflame," he wrote, "The saying, 'A single spark can start a prairie fire,' is an apt description of how the current situation will develop.
"We need only look at the strikes of workers, the uprisings by the peasants, the mutinies of soldiers and the strikes of students which are developing in many places to see that it cannot be long before a 'spark' kindles 'a prairie fire.' "
Today China may be another tinderbox and Wei Jingsheng the dreaded spark of a new political revolution.
A wrenching and chaotic transition has already begun here. Though parts of China's economy are booming, a huge mass of state industries with 110 million workers is stagnating or collapsing. Each month reports of strikes, labor actions and peasant unrest drift into Beijing from the provinces. Drug trafficking and lawlessness reign in broad sections of the country.
Party leaders this fall announced that they would rescue only 1,000 of the most important state industries, like aviation, petrochemicals and steel, and let the others -- there are 14,000 large and medium-sized state enterprises -- die, merge or "go to the sea," the new Chinese euphemism for privatization.
 
The Anger Out There
 The new year may bring a high tide of bankruptcies in the public sector and a flood of newly unemployed Chinese, resentful that their cradle-to-grave rice bowl is crumbling even as Communist Party cadres -- identifiable by their wealth -- skim state bank accounts to subsidize a privileged life style.
China's leaders, because they have access to the truth, know that millions of workers are now idle; millions more have been laid off. Hidden unemployment, Nanjing University recently estimated, could be as high as 14 percent among the urban workers and number of jobless rural laborers is approaching 150 million.
An international bank official, who has been traveling to China for more than a decade, returned from the countryside recently, telling a reporter "how much anger is out there."
Today's Communist Party chiefs are students of the Communist disintegration around the world. They have witnessed how one man, Lech Walesa, unhinged the Polish Communists when the shipyard workers of Gdansk rallied behind him. They saw how Russia's miners destabilized Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his final days.
The hard-line leaders here, who dispatched tanks and machine gunners to snuff out China's democracy uprising in 1989, are also watching as the rulers of South Africa and South Korea support criminal prosecutions against former rulers, especially those who have blood on their hands.
 
Message and Messenger
 Wei Jingsheng's message that the Chinese have an inalienable right to democracy may not seem profound or revolutionary to a Western ear. But in the Chinese context, Mr. Wei, 45, projects a charismatic fearlessness and speaks a compelling evangelism of freedom from corruption and repression. The Politburo is loath to expose 1.2 billion Chinese to such a message.
Many Chinese last week said they believe it is unlikely that Mr. Wei will serve out his full sentence, coming as it does at the end of the era of Deng Xiaoping, China's 91-year-old paramount leader. It was Mr. Deng who first recognized the dangerous nature of Mr. Wei and developed a personal animus toward him. From 1978 to 1979, Mr. Wei took advantage of a period of public debate about democracy to attack Mao, the Communist Party and the whole Leninist system, something that remains dear to Mr. Deng's heart.
For his sins, Mr. Wei has already spent 15 years in jail.
The future of China after Mr. Deng remains nebulous, but many Chinese believe that a new debate will then begin. Mr. Wei may finally get his chance to speak to an audience larger than his jailers.

HEADLINE: YANKEE COME BACK;
American Money Makes the Whole World Sing

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
ONCE again, American guns, carried by American soldiers, are heading into a distant fray, their reception in Bosnia at best uncertain. Memories of Somalia and, still, Vietnam, haunt every military venture overseas.
American butter, spread by American corporations investing abroad at a record pace, has meanwhile never been so widely welcomed. Although United States battleships and B-52's have in many places overstayed their welcome, Boeings filled with business executives and Commerce Department aides can land almost anywhere, even at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi. 
 The new spirit has spread so thoroughly and rapidly, but with so little comment, that it's easy to forget how recently the United States was seen as an economic Godzilla. Nobody talks about Coca-Colonization anymore -- "Coke welcomes you to Hanoi," say a pair of signs in the shape of giant bottles bracketing the airport highway -- and seldom are Yankees bearing briefcases told to go home.
 
More Jobs at Home
 As most economists agree, direct foreign investment, as distinct from portfolio investment in stocks and bonds, generally raises demand for American goods and services and creates jobs and wealth back home. Although some foreign spending has shifted jobs abroad, most goes to penetrate overseas markets.
In the first nine months of this year, American direct investment abroad was running at a record $74 billion annual rate, more than double the 1992 pace. By now, the world's thirst for American investment is taken for granted, so much so that exceptions seem downright quaint.
When noisy Indian nationalists recently halted construction of a $3 billion American power plant and health inspectors shut New Delhi's first Kentucky Fried Chicken, nobody in other countries applauded. Even many Indians snickered. "The Tale of Two Flies," they called the Kentucky Fried Chicken case, noting that by local standards, a restaurant with so few deserved to be celebrated, not punished.
The rest of the world is competing for American capital, to finance factories, public works, telecommunications, technology transfers and jobs. This nation's capitalists are eager to oblige, and not just in countries recuperating from Communism or rambunctious self-reliance.
American products and culture are the rage everywhere. In Japan, consumers allied themselves with the United States Government in pressing officials to open markets. More and more Japanese are learning to eat at McDonald's, shop at Toys 'R' Us and strike sullen, slouching poses in clothing from the first two Gaps, which opened in September.
Western Europe -- which American executives, policymakers and journalists were calling Fortress Europe just a few years ago -- has absorbed by far the most American capital and the greatest absolute increases. Even the largest funeral home chains in France and England have been bought by a Houston-based company determined to sell Europeans the flashy, overengineered coffins that Americans crave. Mon Dieu!
And to think of all the trouble the world's revolutionaries and intellectuals took to paint foreign investment in general, American in particular, as colonialism in another ravenous form. Back when banana republics weren't just outfitters for expeditions to shopping mall food courts, they often handed over their natural resources on foreigners' terms. Lenin's description of foreign investment as economic imperialism captured and colored the outlooks of many emerging nations.
Europeans, guided by the likes of Charles de Gaulle, resisted American investment on cultural and political as well as economic grounds. "The Common Market has become a new Far West for American businessmen," the French journalist Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber wrote in "The American Challenge," published in 1968. "Their investments do not so much involve a transfer of capital as an actual seizure of power."
French and British universities provided a link to leaders and intellectuals in the developing world, steeping them in socialism and anti-Americanism while American universities provided technical skills.
In the 1980's, however, foreign investment was flowing so strongly into the United States that many Americans themselves went nationalist. First they feared the flood of Arab petrodollars. Then they were vexed by Japan's superyen, which bought up the Pebble Beach golf course, Hollywood studios and even Rockefeller Center. Americans demanded barriers, even though the prices were so crazed that the slogan among many deal makers became, "I have met the greater fool, and he speaks Japanese."
 
Japan's Retreat
 The Japanese are still taking their losses, the Europeans just starting to make many of their American acquisitions profitable. And the United States has supplanted a retreating Japan as the major font of foreign investment. No other country has capitalized so well on the political and philosophical turns of the late 1980's.
In China, Bill Gates can do what Warren Christopher often can't, which is to receive a warm smile and hearty clasp from President Jiang Zemin (followed by a decree making Windows the nation's software standard). In Vietnam, where the United States lifted an embargo on trade and investment last year, Coca-Cola is already opening its first bottling plant, Mobil is exploring for oil, Caterpillar is leasing equipment and Otis Elevator is busy with installations in new buildings.
But the failure of socialism and the ebbing of fears dating to the colonial era only go part way toward explaining America's new popularity. Many countries are adopting American corporations (calling them multinational has become redundant) as their industrial models. Asian executives go for business training at Stanford, Latin Americans favor the Ivy League and M.I.T., and British and French universities teach American management skills.
Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, recently wrote in Die Welt, Germany's leading newspaper, that English should become Europe's second language. Some diplomats protested, he said, but scientists and business people have already made English their universal tongue. These include even the French, he added, "which was impossible to imagine 10 or 15 years ago." Mr. Walter is also on the board of The English Theater in Frankfurt, which recently presented the shamelessly American "Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding."
Not that the surge in investment always benefits both sides of the deal. American companies sell drugs abroad that fail safety tests here, foul the environment and deal with apparel contractors who use child labor.
Among American workers, tens, probably hundreds of thousands have watched their automobile, apparel and electronics jobs moved to Latin America and Asia. Companies are even farming out software writing to India.
 
Still Targets
 Instead of raising the alarm about foreigners investing in the United States, politicians now search for scapegoats among countries where America itself is spending -- a hunt certain to gather urgency once the next recession hits.
In some places, Americans still make inviting targets. Not even the latest innovations in combining shampoo and creme rinse have shaken Muslim fundamentalists from defining the righteous state as one clean of American influence. But even Cuba's Fidel Castro, on his recent trip to New York, shucked his combat fatigues for the let's-make-a-deal look. To meet with people named Rockefeller and Tisch, he wore a business suit.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The G.I.'s Don't Carry a Marshall Plan

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AMERICAN troops were already deploying in the winter snows of Bosnia last week when President Clinton joined the signing of the Balkan peace treaty in Paris; the mission could cost American taxpayers as much as $2 billion by the time it ends next year.
But even that falls short of the extent of American involvement, which will also include a disputed share of Bosnia's reconstruction and the repatriation of several million refugees and displaced persons. The Clinton Administration has played down this expense while it cajoles a skeptical Congress to support the sending of troops. But this week the Americans and their allies will sit down in Brussels to work out what needs to be fixed first and where the money will come from. 
 The Clinton Administration is aware of the stakes. The President himself has admitted the military mission cannot succeed unless the civilian population is helped back onto its feet. At the same time, his officials are warning Europe not to expect a cash-strapped Administration in Washington to footmuch of the bill.
This raises a persistent question: Alongside its military contribution to the NATO-led peacekeeping force, how much money should the United States kick in to undo the damage done by four years of war in Bosnia? Or is this the kind of burden that Europe should bear essentially by itself, since Bosnia is a European problem? Agreeing on the answer has already created tensions between Washington and its allies.
No one questions the need for reconstruction.
According to the World Bank, domestic food production last year met just 35 percent of Bosnia's needs, leaving 90 percent of Bosnians dependent wholly or in part on foreign food aid. Bosnia's industrial output has plummeted to 5 percent of 1990 production, with 70 percent of the electrical generating capacity damaged or out of operation. Coal production has dropped to 10 percent of its prewar level. Not surprisingly, Bosnia's gross national product has declined 80 percent since before the war, to about $500 per person this year. Neither the banks nor the sewers work.
A Bosnian Government survey in July found 18 percent of housing units destroyed and 63 percent damaged. More than half of Bosnia's schools are destroyed, damaged or occupied by soldiers and refugees. Teachers have not been paid since November 1994. At least 1,500 miles of road require urgent repairs.
And none of this covers the war's grimmest toll: 250,000 people killed, more than 200,000 wounded and 13,000 permanently disabled.
Nobody is certain of the price tag for Bosnia's recovery, only that it will be high. World Bank officials visiting in October identified $3.7 billion of urgent reconstruction needs in land controlled by the Bosnian Government and its Croatian allies. If areas under Bosnian Serb control were included, the team reported, reconstruction could cost $4 billion to $5 billion for just the next few years. And Christine Wallich, the economist heading the mission, said that only includes "what we think the priorities are."
 
Not Much for Housing
 Kemal Dervis, the World Bank's director for the lands of the former Yugoslavia, cited this example: "If one were to rebuild all the private houses destroyed, it would cost $4 billion or $5 billion." He expected planners to budget only $600 million for the entire housing sector.
A senior White House official thought the total reconstruction bill could run five times what is now being discussed, buttressing doubts about how much the United States can afford.
After all, the United States declined to pump massive financial assistance into the lands of the former Soviet Union. When the Persian Gulf war ended, it counted on Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich states to finance much of the reconstruction of Kuwait. And in Haiti and Somalia, American military intervention failed to satisfy local expectations of largess.
The question pops up again in Brussels on Wednesday, when the World Bank and European Union convene a meeting of more than 40 potential donor countries to identify Bosnia's most dire needs and find about $500 million for the first few months. With the extent of Washington's participation unresolved, European foreign ministers have postponed discussions at their level until next spring.
President Clinton asserted recently that for peace to survive, Bosnians "must have the food, the medicine, the shelter, the clothing so many have been denied for so long" and that "roads must be repaired, the schools and hospitals rebuilt, the factories and shops refurbished and reopened." Nevertheless, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the House International Relations Committee that the United States would contribute a mere $200 million a year for three years.
 
Dueling Formulas
 By contrast, President Jacques Chirac of France has said the European Union expects the United States to assume one-third of the reconstruction costs -- 10 times what Washington offered -- and the 15-nation European Union another third, with other wealthy countries like Japan and Saudi Arabia being asked to pay the remaining third. President Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, has dismissed this formula as "exorbitant for us." The Administration's preferred plan: international institutions like the World Bank finance half of the reconstruction, with the European Union and other countries paying the rest.
In some countries, American troops have improved the lives of residents by fixing their roads or bridges. Not in Bosnia, according to Secretary of Defense William Perry, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee that "these tasks of rebuilding the infrastructure, rebuilding the economy, creating elections, resettling the refugees, providing humanitarian assistance" would be done by other organizations, "most of them under the sponsorship and the direction of the European Union."
That leaves the United States and its brothers-in-arms starting out their military mission divided over how to split the tab for Bosnia's self-mutilation.

HEADLINE: Ousted Labor Chief Has No Regrets

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Four months have passed since Lane Kirkland was chased from his position atop the nation's labor movement, but his wounds remain raw and his sentiments bitter and defiant.
Mr. Kirkland, who was president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for 16 years, does not have a kind word for John Sweeney, the man who now holds that job. And he admits that he still harbors some ill feelings toward the labor leaders who, he says, plotted behind his back and anonymously skewered him in the news media to help push him from power. 
 While almost all commentators agree that the labor movement has been hobbled and humbled, Mr. Kirkland says it is doing fine and remains the "most successful and effective democratic free trade union movement in the world." Mr. Kirkland is the only president in the American Federation of Labor's 109-year history to be forced to step down -- his opponents said he lacked the vision and energy to reverse labor's slide. But he said he could not think of one thing he would have done differently.
"I have no regrets," Mr. Kirkland said while sipping cappuccino in the opulent delegates' lounge at the United Nations. "Je ne regrette rien."
At President Clinton's invitation, Mr. Kirkland -- who was often criticized in labor circles for seeming more interested in overseas problems than domestic ones -- is spending three months as a United States delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.
After his stint at the United Nations, he plans to write a book, not of memoirs, but of reflections. "I don't believe in memoirs," he said in a low, lugubrious voice. "Memoirs are either lies or treason or both."
Asked what was his biggest mistake at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Kirkland thought for half a minute and responded, "I regard as a mistake something that I could have done and I didn't do. I have a hard time finding -- my mind doesn't fly directly to anything in that category."
The chief criticism of the labor leaders who forced Mr. Kirkland out was that this remote, often cantankerous intellectual was not a visible and vigorous spokesman for labor and did far too little to energize and organize workers.
When he took the federation's helm in 1979, 24 percent of American workers belonged to unions, but by the time he stepped down in August, that figure had dropped to 15.5 percent.
Among the pivotal events leading to Mr. Kirkland's resignation were two visits by Mr. Sweeney to suggest that he not seek a ninth two-year term as head of the house of labor. Mr. Sweeney knew that President Clinton had offered Mr. Kirkland the ambassadorship to Poland, and he hinted that Mr. Kirkland, now 73, accept that job to make way for new leadership in organized labor.
Mr. Sweeney said Mr. Kirkland responded, "I don't want to talk about it."
To many labor leaders, sending Mr. Kirkland to Warsaw would have been an ideal way to cap off his career and make way for younger blood. During the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Kirkland fought tirelessly to help the Solidarity movement topple the Communist government, surreptitiously channeling federation money and fax machines to Lech Walesa.
Sitting at the United Nations, his chin buried in his right hand, Mr. Kirkland now said: "I had no interest in being an ambassador. I was president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. My aspirations were entirely fulfilled."
All along he was not planning to run for re-election, he insists now, an assertion that some mutineers do not believe. But he makes clear that he was not going to let Mr. Sweeney or other union leaders run him out of office.
"I did not intend to run anyway," he said. "But I did not want to be hustled into a hasty announcement. I wanted to organize a succession that preserved solidarity."
He dug in his heels for a few months, until he realized that the Sweeney forces had enough votes to oust him at the federation's October convention. The auto workers, steelworkers, mine workers, service employees and state, county and municipal employees were all lined up against him. He dug in his heels so long, however, that he gave the rump caucus enough time to rally around Mr. Sweeney, thus ruining the chances of the man he had groomed to succeed him, Thomas R. Donahue.
Mr. Kirkland bites his lip when asked about Mr. Sweeney's two-month-old stewardship of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "He's entitled to his shot," he said. "It's my watch below."
Nautical terms slip off Mr. Kirkland's tongue for a simple reason. He studied at the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point before joining the Merchant Marine during World War II, along with the Masters, Mates and Pilots Union. Mr. Kirkland, moved to Washington and joined the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s staff in 1948. A talented wordsmith, he was drafted to write speeches for Adlai Stevenson's 1952 Presidential campaign.
George Meany, the federation's cigar-chomping president, adopted him as his protege, making him his executive assistant in 1960. Mr. Meany elevated him to the federation's No. 2 post in 1969, and, a decade later, Mr. Kirkland took over when his mentor retired.
Mr. Kirkland much prefers talking about the positive side of his ledger than Mr. Sweeney's. He talks of how he put the first women on the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive board and increased black and Hispanic representation. He also claims credit for setting up an institute to train union organizers, even though he was pushed hard from below to do that.
His biggest achievement, he said, was to bring the federation "to the highest level of structural solidarity in its history" by persuading the auto workers, teamsters, mine workers and a longshoremen's union to rejoin the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
He is not shy about claiming credit for these achievements, but when he was asked what caused the percentage of unionized workers to drop so precipitously, he points to everything and everyone but himself and the federation. He talks of rapid automation, of massive layoffs caused by imports and of the explosion in hard-to-unionize jobs in the service sector. He omits the charge cited by many critics: that his federation dropped the ball by doing little to organize workers.
At a time when the labor movement is embattled, when unions lost a devastating 18-month strike against Caterpillar and when wage increases are the lowest in 30 years, Mr. Kirkland says he is satisfied about the state of labor.
"My view is it's going through a period of adjustment to radical changes, not only in the domestic economy but the world economy, and it's weathering those changes in remarkably good shape considering their dimensions," he said.
For him, low-wage competition from abroad is by far labor's biggest challenge. The best way to deal with that problem, he says, is to have a world trade agreement that makes it an unfair practice for a country to prohibit unions, strikes and collective bargaining.
From his point of view, there will always be a need for a labor movement.
"The role of the trade unions is to try to keep big people from kicking around little people without a reaction," he said. "Your capacity to defend yourself is far greater if you're organized, if you do it as a union rather than as an individual."

HEADLINE: Scholars of Political Speech Are Giving Gingrich Some Very Mixed Grades

BYLINE: By ERNEST TOLLERSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
This is how Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a recent talk to the American Medical Association, described the price to be paid if the Republicans failed to persuade President Clinton to accept their formula for achieving a balanced Federal budget in seven years:
"First, it'll be clear to this country that the best chance we've had in a generation to balance the budget will have failed -- not been postponed, failed. And second, you will see interest rates skyrocket and the stock market crash, because the fact is, they are counting on us keeping our word because they actually believe we are different." 
 Skyrocketing interest rates?
A stock market crash?
Most national leaders are careful to avoid saying anything that might rattle the markets. But not Mr. Gingrich, whose numerous vehement public remarks since he became Speaker a year ago have led many academic experts on political rhetoric to mark him as a brilliant but particularly imprecise orator whose fiery words have frequently added to polarization in American public life.
Mr. Gingrich's oratory, said David Zarefsky, dean of the School of Speech at Northwestern University, "is designed to force issues, not resolve or manage issues."
Although he reminds his audiences that he has an academic background as a history professor in Georgia, Mr. Gingrich is viewed by these experts as a speechmaker who is first and foremost a storyteller, not a scholar with a rigorous command of facts and logic.
"He has a great respect for information, but he has no love for it," said Roderick P. Hart, a professor of communication and government at the University of Texas.
Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, Tony Blankley, contends that the Speaker's oratory is in the tradition of labor leaders and leftist reformers who campaigned earlier in the century for safer factories, worker compensation and decent housing. Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Blankley said, "is a real reformer."
The Speaker's rhetoric, he said, "goes beyond style -- it goes to a reforming urge and how do you get people to do things." As a persuasive public speaker, Mr. Gingrich realizes that there is "a trade-off between absolute scientific precision" and making a point effectively.
Professor Hart described Mr. Gingrich is one part "lapsed historian," because "he has the language and some of the tissue of fact," and one part "a lapsed preacher, because he's moved out of the pulpit and into the civic square."
"The historian," the professor added, "isn't embarrassed by the preacher in him, or vice versa."
Professor Hart, who describes himself as a vigorous democrat "in the small 'd' sense of the word," believes that Mr. Gingrich is playing an important role. "He's engaged us in a debate that's long overdue," the professor said.
Twice this fall, in late September and again in late November, Mr. Gingrich attributed particularly grim instances of murder to the effects of liberalism and the welfare system.
On Sept. 22, he referred to a USA Today account in giving a synopsis of the arrest of a suspect in the murder of Stephanie Kuhen, a 3-year-old girl who was killed when her family's car strayed into gang territory in Los Angeles.
"Now," he went on to say, "we have had, since Lyndon Johnson created the Great Society, a 30-year experiment in destroying America. For 30 years, we have liberated prisoners, tolerated drug dealers, put up with violence, accepted brutality and done it all in the name of some kind of bleeding-heart liberalism which always had one more excuse, one more explanation, one more rationale."
On Nov. 21, addressing the Republican Governors Association in Nashua, N.H., he cited another newspaper account, of murders in Addison, Ill., in which a pregnant woman and two of her children were killed and a baby was removed from her womb. "Let's talk about what the welfare state has created," he said. "Let's talk about the moral decay of the world the left is defending."
Professor Zarefsky, of Northwestern University, believes that if the issue of race is excluded, Mr. Gingrich's use of images is reminiscent of the Southern-based populism once practiced by Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama. Mr. Wallace, Professor Zarefsky said, "did the same sort of thing in relation to the Great Society," linking the decay of cities to school busing.
Jeffrey Tulis, associate professor of government at the University of Texas, said that in tying gruesome crime to a social philosophy, Mr. Gingrich was making a kind of argument that, upon reflection, was bound to fall flat. How would the Speaker have explained the murders, Professor Tulis said, if they had occurred after the nation had lived for a time under the policies of the Contract With America?
Mr. Gingrich, he said, has a propensity for saying "things that are defensible in less-than-defensible ways."
In early March, Mr. Gingrich said liberal Democrats were responsible for creating public housing and public schools. Later questioned by the press, he conceded that Senator Robert Taft of Ohio, a conservative Republican half a century back, had supported the creation of public housing with the Housing Act of 1949. Indeed, Mr. Taft was one of three Senate sponsors of the legislation.
As for schools, Mr. Gingrich later said he had meant the "modern, unionized big-city school system, with work rules that make no sense, with very big bureaucracies, with a tremendous amount of money wasted and with buildings that don't function."
Some analysts believe there is a great deal more to Mr. Gingrich's missteps than fatigue from his workload or the perils of extemporaneous talk. "Facts for him are illustrations, not tests of propositions," Professor Tulis said.
Other academics see shades of Ronald Reagan as well in Mr. Gingrich. "Dramatizing anecdotes recalls Ronald Reagan, and even the use of things that are untrue -- or untrue as stated -- is also reminiscent of Ronald Reagan," said Karlyn Kohrs Campbell, chairwoman of the department of speech and communication at the University of Minnesota.
Whatever similarities there may be, though, there is also a major difference. "We forgave Reagan for his lapses of fact," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Americans, Professor Jamieson said, did not expect the onetime movie star to have a firm grasp of history and fact. Mr. Gingrich, in contrast, has positioned himself as a scholar and thinker who uses the rhetoric of fact, she said.
William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and a former speechwriter who was a top aide to Vice President Dan Quayle, does not see any Republican communicating the vision of the party better than Mr. Gingrich. "He's the heir to Reagan in that respect," Mr. Kristol said. "What makes him interesting is he does have a world view and a thesis, and he's not rattling off statistics in a prosaic way."
Mr. Kristol attributes Mr. Gingrich's lapses to speaking off the top of his head and doing too many jobs -- party leader, Speaker, Republican messenger -- at once. "Newt is both the guy in the kitchen doing the nasty things you do to prepare the food and the waiter delivering the lovely result," he said.
"I think he could be more disciplined and more careful," Mr. Kristol added. "At the end of the day, he is what he is. I can't imagine him reading speeches written for him by some boring 25-year-old staffer."

HEADLINE: Atrium Renewal, Adding Art, Chases Away Most of the Zen

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
Do bamboo trees look better with a Nevelson (or a Calder or a Dubuffet or an Oldenburg) in front of them? That is the question. And the answer is no.
The public atrium in the former I.B.M. Building at 590 Madison Avenue, at 57th Street, one of the most celebrated public spaces to have been built in Manhattan in the last generation, reopened last week after a discreet renovation. New management -- the I.B.M. Corporation sold the building in 1994 to the developer Edward J. Minskoff -- has added eight works of sculpture to the space, cleaned it up and rechristened it "The Sculpture Garden at 590 Madison." 
 On the surface of it, what could be better? The 10,000-square-foot glass-enclosed atrium, known for its spectacular stands of bamboo trees, had grown dingy in the last few years, its poor maintenance reflecting I.B.M.'s preoccupation with survival rather than corporate philanthropy. Adding a rotating exhibition of sculpture would seem to be just the sort of cure this sick urban space needed. It would liven things up and give New Yorkers a new enclosed place in which to see some first-class works of art.
At least that is what Mr. Minskoff and his architect, Robert A. M. Stern, and his curators, the Pace Wildenstein Gallery, argued when the plan to turn the space into a public sculpture garden came up before the City Planning Commission this year. (Since the original atrium was built under a special zoning permit, the commission had the right to review any modifications.)
After long debate, the Planning Commission said yes. It was probably the only thing the commission could have done -- no major changes were being made to the architecture or to the degree of public access, which would have been the only plausible grounds for the commission to withhold its approval. But now that the renovated atrium is complete, it is clear that this change, acceptable though it may have been under the zoning laws, is a loss, not a gain.
The atrium was better before. To understand why, it helps to know something about the scarcity of first-class public space in New York, and about the special role the I.B.M. atrium has played in the city since its completion in 1982.
Designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, this was a space of unusual serenity in midtown Manhattan, and one of the only public places in which nature, rather than architecture or sculptural objects, provided the central theme.
Multiple stands of lilting, slender bamboo trees shot up from the gray granite floor of the space, and they provided a perfect counterpoint to the I.B.M. Building's stolid architecture. The bamboos are softly vertical in a part of the city that is harshly vertical -- they have a thinness, a precision, an architectonic quality that made them absolutely right as an element to play off against this boxy stone skyscraper.
Bamboo trees are not lush -- they are supple and lithe, with as much of a sense of precision and structure to them as I.B.M. has to its computers. Usually when plantings are placed in the lobbies or atriums of skyscrapers, they are voluptuous, lavish manicured flora intended to distract the eye from the hardness of stone and steel. Here, the relationship was much more subtle: these trees met the architecture and joined hands with it.
The word that came up continually in describing the I.B.M. atrium was serene, not a common adjective when discussing places in midtown. When the I.B.M. atrium was at its best, it provided something unique in Manhattan, a sense of quiet, rhythmic calm that managed still to be exactly in tune with a sleek skyscraper. This place was not created for total escape, not designed to make us think we were somewhere else -- it was midtown, made magically, momentarily, Zen.
That remarkable quality is now compromised, and it is no disrespect to the quality of the art that has been put inside the new sculpture garden to say that the atrium is now a lot like other places. The bamboo trees don't dominate the room as they once did; they struggle for pride of place with Roy Lichtenstein and Mark di Suvero, and more often than not, it is the sculptures that win.
This renovated atrium is a lot better than what Mr. Minskoff first proposed, by the way; when he first came to the Planning Commission, his intention was to remove half the bamboo trees and replace the atrium's movable seats with fixed benches. That would have turned the place into nothing but a glass house for sculpture. Negotiations with the Planning Commission brought the final design much closer to the original, with only minor loss of bamboos, and the retention of the movable furniture that is so essential for relaxed public space.
Yet it is still a very different kind of place from what it once was. Even though the works on view (which will change four times annually) are not for sale, the co-president of Pace Wildenstein, Marc Glimcher, all but admitted that he sees the sculpture garden as a showcase for commercial galleries when he called the new space "a great opportunity for dealers to work together" and said, "Educating the public is the very foundation of the art market."
So how, bamboos aside, does the space work for displaying art? It isn't bad, though it is rather pointless to speak of this space without speaking of the bamboo trees, since if the art sometimes gets in the way of the bamboos, the bamboos at least as often get in the way of the art. The two really cannot be seen apart. Indeed, in the initial show the only sculptures that are truly successful in this space, that look better here than they might elsewhere, are figures by Alexander Calder and Roy Lichtenstein -- the only two pieces that are vertical. They are slender and tall, their forms not fighting the bamboos but joining with them, like the trees reaching high toward the sky.
The very best relationship between art and architecture, however, is not to be found in the atrium, but around the corner, at the front entrance to the building at the corner of 57th Street and Madison Avenue. It is Calder's "Saurien," a bright orange stabile from 1975, and it is spectacularly placed underneath the cantilevered corner of the skyscraper. The open corner of this building has long been an awkward void, and this piece fills it magnificently, bringing energy to the building's architecture and life to the streetscape. Here at the front door, unlike the atrium, art and its surroundings are in perfect accord.

HEADLINE: Act II of Federal Shutdown: Some See Politics of Absurd

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Cpl. Yamashita Johnson locked the door of the National Gallery of Art at noon sharp today, leaving Karen Rose fuming on the street in esthetic deprivation, while Joan Phillips delighted inside at the windfall of being among the final gallery visitors to the Vermeer supershow.
"It's grandstanding," said Ms. Phillips, speaking of the politicians, not the paintings, as she sympathized with Ms. Rose and other citizens locked outside the museum, normally open until 5 P.M. "You can't really shut down the Government," she said as the gallery crowd thinned down to a precious few savoring the unhurried serenity of Vermeer. "These politicians are grandstanding." 
 On the street, Ms. Rose, who had timed her drive perfectly from Orlando, Fla., to Rhode Island for her afternoon tickets to the Winslow Homer show here, was furious. "It's just this great big drama the pols are trying to create," she insisted, gesturing angrily down Constitution Avenue toward the Capitol. "O.K., so I miss this show, but the real problem will be Monday when people can't talk to the Social Security Administration and other things like that."
Measuring the first hours of the renewed shutdown was almost a metaphysical task on a quiet weekend day. But the Americans inconvenienced by the Congress and White House -- even though their numbers were few -- were noteworthy for the similarity of their complaints. They said the underlying issue seemed to be a matter of politicians preferring to cry wolf, rather than uncle, in their chronic budget crises.
"It's just political theater, and I had enough of it in their first performance," said Robert Untreberger, who journeyed from Philadelphia for a weekend visit to the Washington Mall museums and found himself with enough idle time to wonder at the state of national politics.
Politics was hyperactive with blame-saying this day, as rival politicians indulged another Capitol art form and did weekend sound bites on Washington's busy ghetto of commentary news shows.
The White House, denouncing Congressional Republicans for the shutdown, lent a Dickensian tinge to the standoff, announcing that President Clinton had decided to keep the White House Christmas tree's 6,000 bulbs lit by paying out of his own pocket for the electricity. Republicans rejoined that the White House was deep into budgetary humbug.
Across the nation, vital Government services like the air traffic control system were maintained, but many national parks were closed.
"The big losers will be the concession operators," said Manny Strumpf, spokesman for the National Park Service in New York as the Statue of Liberty was shut to visitors, who normally crowd Liberty and Ellis Islands during the holiday period.
The effects of the shutdown varied widely, from causing a serious economic problem in this tourist-dependent city, to having little, if any, impact on places like Chicago, where the only local Saturday morning news broadcast failed to even mention the closing of some Federal agencies. Basic Federal operations, including postal, safety and health protection services, will continue nationwide.
This shutdown was not expected to affect city services in the District of Columbia because the Republicans have agreed to pass a spending bill for the district, and the President is expected to sign it.
The odd nature of the shutdown, in which some 260,000 Federal workers, about 15 percent of the Government workforce, are being furloughed yet ultimately not deprived of pay, made ordinary taxpayers consider the proclaimed crisis a peculiarly Washington concoction.
"In Cleveland when we have a shutdown, nobody gets paid," said Neil Ruddock, a visitor from Gates Mills, Ohio. "This thing is confusing and, as far as I'm concerned, it's not important."
On Monday, the effects will be clearer as workers deemed nonessential at the Departments of Education, Veterans Affairs, Justice and five other Cabinet agencies plus scores of other offices will gather long enough to be told to return home and await another attempt by Congress and the President to agree on a stopgap budget measure.
In the meantime, Social Security checks and Medicare payments will continue to be issued, and limited application services will be available at Social Security offices.
"What about my sister?" asked Maria Uricoechea, a visitor from Colombia whose sister, Lina, tried to join her last month on vacation but was denied a visa because of the first Government shutdown's effects on consulate services. She was planning to try again next week.
The effects of the shutdown are subtle. Ten minutes after the Mall museums' doors were locked, Nigina Ford, a 16-year-old student from Central High School in Capitol Heights, Md., showed up at the National Gallery of Art with a highlighted must-see assignment sheet in hand. "It may mean an 'E,' " she said, fearing failure in her art appreciation course.
Across the street, two homeless men stared from on top of a heat grate at the noontime consternation outside the museum.
"I panhandle my regulars right here, and when they don't come to work, I'm hurting," said Rodney Whipple, a 35-year-old who worried that the nonessential personnel being furloughed could turn out to be essential for him.
His partner, Monty Wandix, 36, was more concerned that the crisis not escalate to shutting down buildings and heating systems -- and their vents of hot air that shelter legions of the city's homeless.
"They cut this off, I'm facing pneumonia," he said as the warm air blasted and Mr. Whipple reassured him that the whole crisis was only politics.
Such analysis was small comfort to Christine Hickey, who makes her living off the Government museums and monuments as a private tour guide. "Now it's open, now it's closed," she fretted after finding the Western High School choir from Palma, Mich., turned away from a scheduled midday concert at Arlington National Cemetery. "Truckloads of wreaths are being turned back, and one of the florists was telling me their business will be clobbered through the holidays by this shutdown."
Overall, people interviewed at random understood the large stakes of the budget fight, but their sense of petty politics was also clear. "Fire those guys," Paul Yakubek of Los Gatos, Calif., said of the politicians. "Don't pay them this time. They're close together, talking about peanuts in their differences. But they just got to score points with the public, right?"
 
SORTING IT OUT: Open or Closed?
 Here is how some functions have been affected by the Government shutdown or will be affected if it continues into Monday:
 
AGRICULTURE -- The Agriculture Department's offices will not be affected.
 
LAW ENFORCEMENT -- Federal courts will be open, and prison guards will remain on duty. Law officers and border agents will stay on the job.
 
MAIL -- Mail delivery will not be disrupted.
 
THE MILITARY -- The military and its civilian employees will not be affected.
 
PARKS -- Most national parks, including the national Zoo in Washington, the Smithsonian museums in Washington and New York and the Statue of Liberty, have been closed since early yesterday. Some large parks remain accessible without visitor services, and the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona remains open under an agreement with the Interior Department and the state government. White House tours have been canceled.
 
PASSPORTS -- Passport offices will be closed on Monday if the shutdown continues. Passports and visas will be issued only for emergencies. Foreign offices will offer only emergency aid to Americans traveling abroad.
 
SOCIAL SECURITY -- Some workers have been furloughed, but the Social Security Administration's field offices will be open on Monday to help people apply for retirement and other benefits, even if the shutdown persists. The information phone line will be staffed, and benefit checks will be mailed as usual.
 
TRANSPORTATION -- Air traffic controllers and railroad workers will remain on duty.
 
VETERANS -- The Veterans Affairs Department will keep offices staffed, but benefit checks could be delayed if the shutdown lasts late into the week.
 
WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE -- Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said President Clinton would pay the electric bill for the tree's 6,000 lights out of his own pocket.

HEADLINE: Dilemma for Clinton on Nafta Truck Rule

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Facing a Monday morning deadline, Clinton Administration and Mexican officials talked intensively today about how they might back away from an important provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement that would let trucks from Mexico travel freely in American border states starting next week.
The Administration, which negotiated the agreement two years ago, is now fearful that the trucks could pose safety hazards and spur trade in illegal drugs. Meanwhile, Mexican officials are under political pressure at home to delay the implementation of the provision because of fears by the Mexican trucking industry that their business, already suffering because of Mexico's financial crisis, would be further hurt by American competition. 
 For weeks the Administration has been under pressure from unions, many Democratic leaders and officials in Texas and California to maintain existing trucking rules. Mexican and American trucks are now allowed to travel only 26 miles beyond their national borders. Under Nafta, Mexican trucks would be able to travel throughout Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California starting on Monday. American trucks would have similar rights in Mexican border states.
If the United States and Mexico agree to maintain the current limit for an as-yet-undetermined time, it would mark the first time that either side has backed away from a chief provision of Nafta.
Today, American officials were continuing discussions here among themselves and with their counterparts in Mexico City. A senior Administration official said it was "too close to tell how this will come out," but this evening it appeared that both countries were looking for a way to stall Monday's relaxation of border restrictions.
For President Clinton and his advisers, the question of whether to allow the trucks to range farther from the border has taken on larger political dimensions than the implementation of an obscure provision of the trade agreement would seem to provoke at first glance.
Officials in Texas and California -- two of the states with the largest number of electoral votes -- have warned the White House that the Mexican trucks often fail to meet safety standards and that their drivers often work far beyond the hourly limits set for American drivers. Many carry hazardous materials, including corrosive chemicals, toxic waste, jet fuels and pesticides, and experts question whether those materials are safely contained. Texas officials say their surveys show that 1 in 4 Mexican trucks in the state do not meet Federal safety standards.
Moreover, Mexico has become a growing source of illegal drug shipments, and there is concern that increased truck traffic could overwhelm the ability of customs officials to inspect the cargo.
"All we need is one big environmental disaster, or one of these trucks plowing into a school bus, and all of a sudden Nafta is going to look like a pretty disastrous idea," one of Mr. Clinton's political advisers said recently.
When it was signed in 1993, Nafta did not specify what kind of safety provisions Mexican trucks would have to meet, nor did it provide for increased inspections at the border. So United States officials believe that they have considerable latitude to work out new rules. But Mexico, unlike the United States, passed Nafta as a formal treaty, not just a trade accord. Mexican officials have said they are reluctant to bring a revised treaty to a legislative vote for fear that it would reopen other parts of the accord that have come to be unpopular among Mexicans.
While concerned about the safety issues, Mr. Clinton is hesitant to appear to be pulling back from one of the signature achievements of his Administration, the hard-fought passage of Nafta, which drastically reduced tariffs and trade regulations between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Mr. Clinton has argued that the agreement will create jobs in the United States largely because it require Mexico to reduce far more trade barriers than the other signatories to the accord.
In the two years since Nafta went into effect, however, the Administration has had a hard time proving its case. The peso crisis that began a year ago has plunged Mexico into a deep recession. The American trade surplus with Mexico has turned into a substantial deficit. And while the peso crisis and Nafta were unrelated events -- many economists argue that the crisis would have been deeper in the absence of the trade accord -- the Administration has been criticized by both the left and the right because few economic benefits have come to pass.
Mr. Clinton is also under attack from some of his core constituencies, especially labor unions. They opposed the accord and are still bitter that their position was overruled by the White House. This week, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters went to court in Washington to seek a stay of the implementation of the truck accord, although no hearing is scheduled until next week. Protests are planned this weekend in Laredo, one of the largest truck crossings in Texas. And many members of Congress, including many prominent Democrats, have joined appeals to have the trucking provision delayed.
In Texas, opposition is strong. The state attorney general, Dan Morales, has complained that the Federal Government has not done enough to insure the safety of the trucks coming into the state. "We do not want the cries and screams of disaster to be the wake-up call for the Federal Government," he told the Dallas Morning News. "These unsafe and uninsured cargo trucks are a traveling calamity waiting to happen."

HEADLINE: President-to-Be Of Haiti Faces Tough Agenda

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Even with 14 candidates on the ballot, the result is considered a foregone conclusion. It is what comes after the presidential vote on Sunday that promises to be the next big test for stability in Haiti and for the Clinton Administration's policy toward this country.
Everything the United States and the United Nations have done here since restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power 14 months ago has been aimed at guaranteeing a peaceful transition to a popularly elected successor. 
 To the surprise of few here, that man has turned out to be Rene Preval, President Aristide's closest friend and the handpicked candidate of his Lavalas movement.
A poll published this morning by the newspaper Le Nouvelliste, the first to be made public since campaigning began last month, showed Mr. Preval with the support of 64 percent of the electorate here in the capital, the nation's political center of gravity. The survey was taken before Mr. Aristide delivered a speech Friday urging voters to support his longtime ally, saying, "I will cast my ballot for Rene Preval."
Mr. Preval, Haitian Government officials and foreign diplomats say, would not have been the heir apparent had the United States had its way. The clear American favorite, they contend, was Evans Paul, who was the Mayor of the capital until going down to defeat in a bid for re-election in June. American officials saw Mr. Paul as more flexible, less ideological and easier to work with than Mr. Preval.
But now, Washington must work closely with Mr. Preval to prevent one of the Clinton Administration's principal foreign policy successes from going off track.
The close relationship that prevailed after Mr. Aristide's return has eroded in the last two months. This was the result of disagreements about economic and security issues as well as American suspicions that President Aristide might try to remain in office after his term expires on Feb. 7, 1996.
Neither Mr. Preval nor the United States can afford any delay in addressing those and other problems, Haitian and foreign officials agree.
"The decisions Preval makes in the next few months will determine the course of this country for the next five years," a diplomat said.
Even before he takes office, Mr. Preval will have to begin negotiations with the United States and other aid donors about economic reforms. More than $125 million in foreign assistance is being held up as the result of a dispute over the privatization of state enterprises, and without that aid the Haitian Government is certain to run out of money and its currency is likely to collapse.
Equally pressing is the issue of security and disarmament. Haiti's newly trained National Police is still an inexperienced and somewhat amateurish force. With the United Nations scheduled to withdraw its 5,800-member military contingent by Feb. 29, Mr. Preval has no time to lose if he wants a reduced version of the international force to stay on for a few months.
How Mr. Preval plans to deal with these and other issues remains something of a mystery. During a brief, cautiously managed election campaign, he ducked all invitations to debate the other candidates, limited his contacts with reporters and, when pressed, pledged to do as Mr. Aristide would do.
"He frequently gives me advice, and I consult him often," Mr. Preval said this week of his relationship with the President. "He is a personal friend and a political friend. There have never been any clouds in our friendship."
No matter what course he takes, Mr. Preval will be governing in the long shadow cast by Mr. Aristide, something that could be another problem. The President said at a news conference on Thursday that he planned to spend his time at home, reading and writing, but many here are openly skeptical of that vow.
"The big question is whether Preval is going to have room to move, or whether Aristide will constantly be breathing down his neck," a leading Haitian business figure said. "The best thing that could happen to Preval would be for Aristide to do as Jimmy Carter has done and go off and mediate an international crisis, say like Rwanda."
Mr. Preval, 52, is an agronomist who was educated in Belgium and the United States, where he lived for several years during the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier. After returning to Haiti in the early 1980's, he opened a bakery and became active in civic and political movements, through which he met Mr. Aristide, then an obscure parish priest.
"Though he spent many years abroad, Preval is less worldly than Aristide," said one foreigner who has worked closely with both men. "He prefers to do things in a very Haitian way, which is to say indirectly."
When Mr. Aristide was elected President in 1990, he appointed Mr. Preval his Prime Minister. During his brief tenure, interrupted by the September 1991 coup that brought the military to power, Mr. Preval was praised for his personal honesty but often criticized as a mediocre administrator and negotiator.
He joined Mr. Aristide in exile after the coup and returned with him in October 1994, but largely because of lingering American distrust, Haitian officials said, was not given a Cabinet post. Instead, he became an informal adviser and was appointed director of the Foundation for Economic and Social Assistance, which finances and supervises development projects.
"In other words, he is in charge of what little patronage this Government has available to dispense," one Latin American diplomat here said. "That has allowed him to accumulate favors and build up a strong network of contacts."
But those advantages are no substitute for having the personal blessing of Mr. Aristide, who clearly remains the first choice of most voters here but cannot legally succeed himself. As Mr. Aristide himself put it in an interview with foreign reporters three weeks ago, he and Mr. Preval have a personal relationship so close that "they used to call us twins."
For better or worse, that means most of Mr. Preval's popular appeal derives not from his own personality or efforts, but from his perceived closeness to Mr. Aristide.
"There hasn't been enough time for Aristide to take advantage of his term, but as long as we know Preval is Aristide's friend, he's our candidate," said Alain Nouriska, 29, an unemployed man in the coastal town of St. Marc.
But there are important differences in style and approach between the two men. In public appearances, Mr. Preval often appears ill at ease and tends to deliver speeches that sound stiff and formal, in contrast to Mr. Aristide's effortless charisma and gift for oratory.
Mr. Preval devoted much of his five-week campaign seeking to act more like a man of the people. Advertisements, posters and banners baptized him "Ti Rene," an affectionate nickname that means "Little Rene," and at a campaign stop on Wednesday in the dusty village of Desdunes, he mounted a horse and took a bite from a stalk of sugar cane offered to him, gestures that seemed to endear him to peasant voters.
Still, there are those within the Lavalas movement who resent the rapport between the President and his designated successor and have been trying to undermine Mr. Preval, spreading rumors of a rift between the two men.
"They worry about what future they have after Feb. 7 and want to remind Preval that he cannot ignore them," said a Haitian with close ties to the Government.
At a campaign rally on Thursday in Carrefour, a suburb of the capital, leaflets accusing Mr. Preval of being a "traitor to Aristide" were distributed, and some Lavalas partisans paraded with banners calling for Mr. Aristide to stay in office for three more years. A few people even threw rocks at Mr. Preval's caravan as it departed.
"Nothing is ever easy in Haiti," one foreign official here said, "and it would be foolish for anyone to think this succession is going to be an exception. The job has been difficult enough for Aristide, much less someone trying to fill his shoes."

HEADLINE: Harlem Church Is Outpost of Empire;
House of Prayer Built Wide Holdings on Devotion to Sweet Daddy Grace

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
Barnstorming the country in the 1920's and 30's, baptizing thousands at once in rivers and beneath the spray of fire hydrants, an immigrant preacher who called himself Sweet Daddy Grace promised salvation and upward mobility to America's black and poor. At revival meetings from Harlem and Washington to Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles, he flaunted his gold jewelry, flowing hair and five-inch fingernails while "love offerings" of cash rolled in from the faithful.
From those flamboyant beginnings, guided by that message of economic self-reliance, Daddy Grace's church, the United House of Prayer for All People, has grown into an unusually prosperous religious organization. A church that started out selling toothpaste and shoe polish now has extensive, and growing, real estate holdings in cities across the country. 
 One piece of that empire was the two-story building at 272 West 125th Street in Harlem, and as the building's owner, the church became a crucial player in a rancorous and racially charged dispute involving its tenant, a Jewish-owned clothing store, and a subtenant, a black-owned record shop. And in the days since Dec. 8, when a gunman walked into the clothing store and set it afire, killing himself and seven others, the charismatic sect has become the object of unwanted questions and attention.
An examination of court and property records shows that the House of Prayer is a major real estate power in many cities, with tens of millions of dollars worth of church buildings and residential and commercial space. It plans to spend more than $200 million on new development around the country.
It is also a church apart: Expanding its empire, wracked by internal strife, the House of Prayer has steadily turned away from the public glare, and often from the civic and political activism practiced by so many of America's black churches.
"They have been very entrepreneurial," said Robert M. Franklin, an expert on black churches at the Ford Foundation. "One has the sense of a theology of prosperity and empowerment in the here and now."
More than a week after the fire, the precise role of the House of Prayer in the dispute remains uncertain. But what is apparent is that the church was operating in its characteristically quiet and independent way, trying to stay out of the spotlight; indeed, many people in the neighborhood did not even realize that the church was the real landlord.
As the dispute was escalating in increasingly angry protests against the clothing store called Freddy's, church officials sought a settlement. They offered to subsidize a new site for the record shop, which was being forced out of its space next to Freddy's, and urged the police not to arrest demonstrators.
The church has used a similar strategy when other real estate projects have run into conflicts. Last summer, when the House of Prayer was criticized for plans to evict elderly residents in Cleveland to make way for a new church building and parking lot, officials quickly negotiated a secret settlement. And after Philadelphia residents challenged the replacement of a black contractor with a white one on a housing project, the church walked away from the $15 million deal.
Most of the church's affairs, though, have occurred behind the closed doors of its 135 congregations in 25 states. Apostle Sterling Green, an official at the church's headquarters in Washington, declined to discuss the House of Prayer's holdings or recent struggles over its leadership. He said the current leader, Bishop Samuel C. Madison, was unavailable for an interview. Apostle Green also would not speak about the size of the church's membership. In the past, the church has claimed as many as four million members, but religious experts believe that the actual figure is a small fraction of that amount.
Several religious experts concurred that the church's taciturn face could be traced directly back to the extravagance of its early days. While the people who flocked to Daddy Grace accepted his self-proclaimed divinity, many other blacks rejected his unorthodox theology and criticized him as a charlatan.
"They tend to downplay what they are doing in communities rather than opening themselves up to public scrutiny," said Dr. Wardell J. Payne, an expert on black churches at Howard University's divinity school. "And part of the reason relates to the church's particular history."
 
Makeshift Chapel, Dramatic Services
 That particular history began in 1919, when an immigrant from the Cape Verde Islands off the west coast of Africa -- a railroad cook and cranberry picker -- built the first United House of Prayer chapel from discarded rocks and wood in West Wareham, Mass. Then he was simply known as Marcelino Manoel da Graca. But as his charismatic preaching and claims of miraculous healing powers attracted a following, he formed branches in Washington and Charlotte, accorded himself godly status and adopted the name Sweet Daddy Grace.
He often told parishioners: "Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't worry about Him. If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you."
Mr. Grace's followers showered him with riches, stuffing "love offerings" of cash into his hands as he paraded into the churches surrounded by a bevy of female attendants who waved large fans as he took his place on a red throne. In 1934, the Internal Revenue Service accused him of paying only $41 in tax on $190,000 income. The case was dismissed by a court that ruled the voluntary offerings were tax free.
Today, the church's chief source of income remains donations from its members, many of whom give 10 percent of their income. In addition, the church collects numerous special offerings -- for the pastor's anniversary, the building fund and even a legal defense fund. One North Carolina family said in a lawsuit that they donated more than $500,000 to the church over three decades.
Services are held seven days a week, often lasting all day on Sundays. At the start of services, members stand before the congregation and give testimonials, often "speaking in tongues," the unintelligible utterances that they believe signify possession by the Holy Spirit.
During a recent service in Harlem, Mammie Dorsey, a spry elderly woman, testified about how Daddy Grace healed her from an illness. "Daddy Grace prayed for me in 1935," said Mrs. Dorsey, who joined the church in 1929 in Georgia. "The doctor said there was no way for me to live back in 1935, and I'm still breathing today." She raised her hands and went back to her seat, strutting to the beat belted out by the church's full brass band.
From the start, Mr. Grace combined his Pentacostal fervor with a distinctly secular spirit. His followers sold products that included toothpaste, cold cream, coffee, soap and shoe polish. He acquired a coffee plantation in Brazil, an egg hatchery in Cuba, an 85-room mansion in Los Angeles and a 25-room mansion in Montclair, N.J. In the 1940's and '50's, he bought several high-rise apartment buildings in Manhattan that did not rent to blacks.
All of the property was in Sweet Daddy's name and when he died in 1960, he left an estate of $25 million and a major fight over succession. To become Mr. Grace's successor, a former taxi driver named Walter McCollough had to win a court fight and two elections.
Assuming the mantle and the name of Sweet Daddy, Mr. McCollough concentrated on projects that served the congregations, rather than the acquisition of trophy properties. He prided himself on paying cash, accepting neither bank loans nor Government assistance.
Within blocks of the gold-domed mother church in Washington, which is called God's White House, he built 288 units of housing for low-income and moderate-income families.
"We started the housing component so that we can maintain a community base and not become detached," said Mr. Green, the church official in Washington.
Adjoining the Washington church is an inexpensive, popular cafeteria, Saints Paradise. House of Prayer churches are known in their communities for serving low-cost meals.
 
Leadership Strife, Church Expansion
 Mr. McCollough's death in 1991 kindled another succession fight, pitting his son, Charles L. McCollough, against Samuel C. Madison, a senior pastor. Mr. McCollough argued that members should have a stronger voice. But Mr. Madison, a man in his 70's who was a direct disciple of Mr. Grace, won election by the hierarchy. The results ignited strife that spilled over into lawsuits, with members claiming the vote was rigged and some refusing to submit to Mr. Madison's authority.
But Mr. Madison remained in power, locking dissidents out of their churches and using security personnel to quell disturbances, according to court papers in Philadelphia, Washington and Charlotte.
When one small congregation outside Charlotte objected to Mr. Madison's stewardship, the bishop took several busloads of loyalists to the church to remove the pastor in April 1992. Court papers in one suit describe a brawl in the sanctuary between parishioners and guards affiliated with Mr. Madison, which was broken up by the local police.
Mr. Madison and the church have prevailed in the lawsuits, with the judges generally ruling that the courts should not get involved in church affairs.
In the meantime, Mr. Madison has embarked on a $178 million project to renovate and expand the church's holdings. Part of that agenda was the $4.5 million renovation of the building on that housed the clothing and record stores and has been the church's primary New York City home since 1936. Although the congregation numbers only 300, the plans called for a second-story sanctuary that will hold 1,200.
The church also is planning to build 150 units of low and moderate-income housing and 14,000 square feet of commercial space, with a supermarket and drug store, in Harlem. The church is providing $30 million in financing and is seeking a tract of land from the city.
"We're doing a lot of positive things in New York City," said Malcolm Barksdale, a church official and its primary real estate agent in New York. "I'm talking major economic development."
Despite its long presence in Harlem, the House of Prayer has remained outside the religious mainstream, eschewing political advocacy and membership in such organizations as the Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement.
"They have a history of running their own programs and paying for their own programs," said the Rev. Canon Frederick B. Williams, chairman of the congregations group.
 
Tense Dispute, Quiet Church
 Throughout the dispute over the record shop, the church tried to stay in the background.
Fred Harari, who leased space for Freddy's clothing store from the church, wanted to expand into the space where Sikhulu Shange had operated the Record Shack for nearly two decades. When Mr. Harari insisted that the record store had to move out when its sublease expired at the end of this year, Mr. Shange turned for help to the Rev. Al Sharpton and one of his associates, Morris Powell, head of the 125th Street Vendors Association.
In September, demonstrators began to appear outside Freddy's, demanding a boycott. As the protests escalated, so did the anger. In court filings the day before the fire, Mr. Harari and two employees said demonstrators threatened employees and warned the store would burn.
Tom Kelly, deputy police commissioner for public information, said Mr. Harari did not want the police to arrest any demonstrators. Mr. Harari told the police he was acting on the recommendation of church officials, who wanted to avoid any escalation of the dispute.
At one point, the church tried to persuade Mr. Shange to move to another site, but he rejected it as too expensive.
Amid the anger and anxiety since the fire, some people have asked if the church could have made a greater effort to defuse the tensions. The church has declined to comment, but people close to the investigation say Mr. Barksdale tried to arrange several meetings with organizers of the protests. But apparently none ever took place.

HEADLINE: Many Serbs Of Croatia Find Misery In Belgrade

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia

 BODY:
Milan Peksir is a forlorn and broken figure as he wanders the streets of Belgrade, timidly entering cheap diners to try to keep warm over a cup of coffee and buying one or two cigarettes at a time from street vendors.
The last few months have been a humbling time for Mr. Peksir, a 52-year-old laborer, and for many of the 170,000 Croatian Serbs who are now stranded in Serbia. 
 Not long ago, they reveled in the self-proclaimed Krajina Republic carved out in southern Croatia, trumpeted the glorious destiny of the Serbian people -- while Croatian neighbors were hounded from their homes -- and worshiped President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia as a savior. "We made many mistakes," Mr. Peksir said.
Now, he and the other Serbs from the Krajina are paying penance. All but a handful fled for Belgrade in August when President Franjo Tudjman sent the Croatian Army to recapture the territory. They are now shunted aside by the Serbs here and unable to reclaim their property, possessions or money.
More than a million people have been driven from their homes in the Balkan war, and while the peace accord calls for refugees to be allowed to go home, it is far from clear how many actually will.
Croatian Government offices have ignored petitions and legal proceedings brought by Serbs who want to return. Croatian officials, in a move that angered American diplomats, invalidated 4,000 applications by Croatian Serbs who wanted to go back, although they were hand-delivered to Zagreb, Croatia's capital, by the United States Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith.
[A Serbian member of the Croatian Parliament, Veselin Pejnovic, said in Zagreb: "All of the parties who signed the Dayton agreement know, quite cynically, that most of the refugees will never return to their homes. And the Serbs from the Krajina will now be the first to formally lose everything. President Tudjman has succeeded where the fascist Government in Croatia during World War II failed. He has driven nearly all of the Serbs from the Croatian state."]
In a series of bureaucratic roadblocks, the Serbs who try to return to Croatia have been handed one impossible task after another. For example, those who need new Croatian identity cards, which must be presented with any application to return, must travel to the Croatian Embassy in Budapest, something most cannot afford. But those who make it to Hungary are told they cannot pick up the cards until January, after a new law on nationality goes into effect.
Croatian officials in Belgrade, who wade through crowds of Serbs who gather each day along the iron gate, insist that most of the people outside do not want to go home.
"We have a list here of 10,000 people who say they want to go back, but we have determined that at least two-thirds of them really just want their property and do not want to return," said Davor Vidis, a Croatian official in the Government's office in Belgrade. "The Krajina Serbs, you have to understand, are not ready to accept Croatia as their state."
At the same time, soldiers in the Croatian Army have looted, gutted and burned dozens of Serbian villages and shot dead more than 100 elderly Serbs who were unable to flee last August, the United Nations says. Serbian homes in the Krajina are being handed over to Croats who fled Serbian-held parts of Bosnia.
The decision to dismiss the fate of tens of thousands of destitute people is, many warn, creating a breeding ground for the kind of terrorism and violence that beset the Middle East when the Palestinians were pushed out of Israel in 1948.
The Krajina Serbs, like the Palestinians who went to Lebanon, Egypt and Syria after the creation of the state of Israel, are refused work permits, identity cards and even refugee status by Belgrade. Young male refugees are being picked up in police sweeps off the streets of Belgrade and forced into the Bosnian Serb army. And the refugees, most of whom are poor and unemployed, are treated with the disdain usually reserved in the capital for Gypsies.
"We are consumed now by anger, blinded by it," said Miric Ninko, an official at the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Belgrade and a refugee. "As we feel more victimized we deny what we did to the Croats. We romanticize and glorify our own community and we demonize everyone else. Any type of revenge will be soon be justified."
But those who are older long not for revenge but for the chance to end their lives in dignity.
Adam Vasiljevic, 68, a refugee from Knin, worked for 42 years for the Croatian railroad. He has lost his pension, his home and his meager savings in his Croatian bank account. He and his wife live in an unheated room with no running water.
"Everything we had, everything we dreamed of and saved for, is gone," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Seeking Further Ways to Punish Nigeria for Executions

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
More than a month after the hanging of the Nigerian minority rights campaigner Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Clinton Administration is considering how best to strengthen its campaign to isolate Nigeria's military dictatorship in protest against the execution.
The United States has withdrawn its Ambassador, suspended Nigeria's application for financial credits, tightened the granting of visas to Nigerians with ties to the military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha and refused to sell it weapons. State Department officials will meet next week to consider what else they can do. 
 So far the Administration has shied away from using what is potentially the most effective weapon, an embargo on Nigerian oil, which generates 95 percent of the Government's foreign income. The United States buys nearly half of Nigeria's oil and its European allies buy 40 percent.
This week, an influential group of 54 black Americans wrote President Clinton urging an oil embargo against the Nigerian regime. But economists say the cutoff could also drive up gasoline prices here, which could hurt Mr. Clinton in his bid for re-election next November.
The Administration scored the first success of its campaign on Thursday at the United Nations, where the General Assembly committee on social, humanitarian and cultural issues condemned Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution and called on Nigeria's rulers to return the country to democratic civilian rule. The resolution, whose sponsors included the United States, its European allies and South Africa, was supported by 98 countries, while 12 countries voted against it. But 42 countries abstained and 33 others stayed away, underscoring Washington's problems in trying to forge a consensus.
Having threatened to punish Nigeria, the Clinton Administration is stumped about how to proceed next, American officials said. The State Department has yet to devise a coherent new strategy that does not encompass sanctions.
"It's very difficult to unilaterally levy an oil embargo against a nation when other countries are reluctant to do so," a State Department official said.
The letter from the group of black Americans to President Clinton asked him to impose economic sanctions against Nigeria, including an oil embargo, a freeze on assets held abroad by the military rulers and a prohibition on new investment in the country. The letter was organized by Randall Robinson, president of the private institute Trans-Africa.
"The military dictatorship of Nigeria has plunged a once proud nation into a frightening state of national crisis," the letter said.
Nigeria's rulers, it said, had emptied the treasury, diverted billions of dollars in public funds to personal accounts overseas, crushed dissent and jailed or killed thousands of Nigerians, including Mr. Saro-Wiwa and eight compatriots who were hanged on Nov. 10 after being found guilty of involvement in four murders. Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his supporters maintained that he was innocent and had been framed because of his criticism of Shell Oil's operations in the country.
The signers included 26 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, the mayors of Atlanta, Denver and Seattle, civil rights leaders like Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King and Joseph Lowery, the writer Maya Angelou and the actors Bill Cosby, Danny Glover and Robert Guillaume.
So far, the toughest action taken against Nigeria to protest Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution was its suspension from the British Commonwealth, a punishment pressed by President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.

HEADLINE: The Debate Over High-Speed Police Chases

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Last year, more than 11,000 cars were stolen here, giving this city of 290,000 residents one of the highest auto theft rates in the country. This year, the police say, the number of thefts has been cut in half now that officers in patrol cars are allowed to chase the car thieves.
But in going after suspects, Tampa's police have been involved in a number of accidents, including one in which officers crashed into a utility pole and another in which they knocked a house off its foundation. And during a chase last week, a car driven by a suspect struck another car, killing two German tourists. 
 The deaths underscored an ongoing debate over the wisdom of most high-speed police pursuits. It also focused attention on Tampa, which relaxed its policy on chases at a time when many law-enforcement agencies have moved to restrict them for safety reasons or because of liability concerns.
At a news conference this week, Mayor Dick Greco of Tampa and Chief Bennie Holder of the Tampa Police stood by their policy, saying it would not change despite the first fatalities since it went into effect last May. The Mayor, who took office this year and had made the policy part of his campaign platform, said it was necessary to help stop crime, and he blamed the suspect who tried to elude police officers for the accident.
"The policy doesn't say go out and have an accident," Deputy Chief Kenneth H. Taylor said in an interview. "We didn't kill anybody. Some felons who decided to buck the law endangered everybody. I totally reject the idea that the police caused any of this."
But in trying to balance law-enforcement with public safety, many police departments nationwide have restricted chases in recent years, often excluding traffic or property offenses and only allowing officers to pursue suspects involved in violent felonies, said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina who is completing a study for the Justice Department on pursuits and the use of police force.
He said studies had shown that 35 percent to 40 percent of all chases end in accidents, about 20 percent in injury and 1 percent in death.
"What these policies are saying is that life is more important than property," Mr. Alpert said. "Are the few arrests for stolen vehicles and the potential deterrence, which we don't know exists, worth the risk?"
Liability is also a strong factor. Gerald Arenberg, the executive director of the National Association of Chiefs of Police until this year, said police chases have led to "case after case" of lawsuits against police departments, with most juries in civil trials finding against the police regardless of how careful the pursuing officers had been in avoiding injury or property damage.
In Pinellas County, adjacent to Tampa, the case of two sisters killed in a collision with a suspect whom police were chasing after he ran a red light led the State Supreme Court in 1992 to rule that police agencies can be held accountable for chases.
"Juries have come back and said you've got to have your priorities in the right place," Mr. Arenberg said.
For three years, Tampa also restricted high-speed chases to felonies involving violence or the threat of violence, such as murder, kidnapping and robbery. But as auto thefts and overall crime rose, Chief Taylor said, the city decided something needed to be done.
The department first tried an auto theft squad, which was allowed to pursue auto thieves. The program was successful in reducing thefts by 25 percent in five months but proved too expensive to support, Chief Taylor said.
Upon the recommendation of a citizens' advisory committee, he said, the department decided to expand permission for chases to all officers, allowing them to also go after suspects of burglary, any firearm offense and drunken driving "due to the danger such a driver poses to the public if allowed to continue."
But car thieves were the primary target. Chief Taylor said that about 70 percent of all violent crime in the city is committed by people who steal cars to commit the crime or to escape. He said car thieves became so brazen that some went as far as making insulting gestures to officers as they sped off. One suspect even held up a sign once reading: "This is a stolen car. I dare you to stop us."
"We don't want to cause accidents and when it's an innocent party it hurts," he said. But, he added, "car theft is considered a serious offense because it fuels so many other crimes."
The crackdown has shown results. Between June and November, police statistics show, auto thefts dropped 51 percent, to 2,788 from 5,699. Over all, crime is down 25 percent, and the police credit their policy on chases for a large part of the drop.
But since its implementation last May 28, the expanded pursuit policy increased high-speed chases through Tampa's business and residential streets to 85 between June and November, from 10 in the previous five months. And despite refresher driving courses and safety guidelines such as not letting more than two police units join a chase unless approved by a supervisor, 29 of the 85 pursuits resulted in accidents, most minor, and 11 in injury.
Files kept by the police department's internal affairs bureau show that many of the chases ended when suspects crashed into cars, trees and chain-link fences. At least one chase was abandoned after seven minutes when the suspect ran a red light at 80 miles an hour, police records show.
In one case last June, a police car vaulted off Interstate 275 shortly before midnight, went through a fence and hit a house. The tenants have had to move while the house undergoes repairs.
"All we heard was this huge thud and the hissing from a broken gas line," said John Carpenter, 34, a neighbor. "We ran outside and there was a cop car where their back porch used to be. The air bag saved them. It was very scary."
Then last Sunday, the police say, five teen-agers in a stolen Honda ran a red light and smashed into a car, killing Markus Rossknecht, 37, and Henz Bary, 40, and injuring a friend they were visiting from Germany. The suspects had been followed by both patrol units and a police helicopter. The driver of the car faces numerous charges, including two counts of manslaughter. The other teen-agers face theft charges and perhaps other charges.
The accident happened less than three weeks after two people were killed on Thanksgiving Day when a suspected car thief hit a car after being followed by Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies through Tampa. Like other law-enforcement agencies around the country that have yet to tighten lenient chase policies, the sheriff's office also pursues car thieves.
But despite the deaths, many Tampa residents who are faced with economic loss, aggravation and higher insurance rates after cars are stolen, still support the police department. They say juvenile car thieves are a particular problem. The police agree, saying that car thefts typically jump 30 percent to 40 percent in the summer after youths are out of school. They say that this summer, thefts went down for the first time in years.
"People are kind of sick of it and ready to do just about anything," said John Grayson, producer of a popular morning talk show on WFLA-AM news radio, where he said calls had run 9-to-1 in favor of the policy.
But critics of Tampa's policy say the city is an example of the need for national legislation to restrict police chases so that such policies are not left up to individual law-enforcement agencies. A Wyoming-based group called Stopp, which represents families of people killed in police chases, advocates limiting chases to known violent felons. The group said that Federal statistics showed at least 388 deaths from police chases last year, with California, Texas, Illinois and Florida accounting for nearly half.
In Tampa, the families of some of the dead say they are aghast at the stance of both the city and the county sheriff's office. Veronica Elmore, whose 27-year-old cousin, Derek Johnson, was one of the two people killed on Thanksgiving Day, blames the sheriff's deputies for his death and said it is only a matter of time before more innocent people die.
"Anytime you contribute to something you're the cause of it," she said. "They initiated the chase."
She said her cousin, a former Army sergeant who was about to start a new job with the post office, died after hitching a ride with two friends because his car had been stolen the week before.
