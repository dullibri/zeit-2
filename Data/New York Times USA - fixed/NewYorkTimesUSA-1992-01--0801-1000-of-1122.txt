3M Earnings Off 12.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD, Minn., Jan. 22

 BODY:
The 3M Company said today that fourth-quarter earnings declined 12.2 percent, mainly because of the weak economy and the strong dollar, which reduced the value of foreign profits. The manufacturer reported fourth-quarter earnings of $259 million, or $1.18 a share, compared with $295 million, or $1.34 a share, in the comparable period of 1990. Sales totaled $3.224 billion, down 1.7 percent. For all of 1991, net income fell 11.7 percent, to $1.154 billion, or $5.26 a share, compared with $1.308 billion, or $5.91 a share, in 1990. Sales totaled $13.34 billion, up from $13.02 billion.

HEADLINE: Has Clinton Said Enough?;
A Yes or No Will Do

BYLINE: By Elaine K. Swift and Kenneth Finegold; Elaine K. Swift and Kenneth Finegold are assistant professors of political science at the University of North Carolina and Rutgers, respectively.

DATELINE: CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

 BODY:
"Have you ever had an extramarital affair, Governor?" a New Hampshire television reporter asked Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic presidential nominee. As he has before, Mr. Clinton sidestepped the question. "Well," he said, "if I had, I wouldn't tell you."
We think Mr. Clinton should give New Hampshire Democrats -- and the American electorate -- a simple yes or no. The answer would reveal much about his character and electability. 
 For good reason, American voters look at character in making their choice for President. If Governor Clinton has not been able to keep his marital vows, voters might rightly wonder whether he could be trusted to keep campaign promises or uphold his oath of office.
More important, a male politician's record of philandering says far more about his basic attitudes toward women than any number of policy papers or speeches on women's issues. Can women trust him to see sexual harassment and discrimination as serious problems?
Questions about his character could undermine Mr. Clinton's chances. He portrays himself as the most viable Democrat. He argues he can help the party in the South, where it has done poorly recently. And he is less likely to be tarred as a liberal.
But Governor Clinton is not electable so long as questions remain about his personal past. Extramarital sex may not be an issue in Washington and for Hollywood activists, but it is for the rest of the country. A recent New York Times poll found 23 percent of the public would not vote for a Presidential candidate who had been unfaithful to his wife. In a Time magazine-CNN poll last month, 42 percent of those surveyed said they would be less likely to support a candidate who has had extramarital affairs. These attitudes are likely to be strongest in the the South and, of course, among women, who make up a majority of the electorate.
Asked in Sunday's debate whether the Republicans would be able to find a woman to substantiate charges of infidelity, Governor Clinton responded that it was "highly unlikely." But you can be sure that if he wins the nomination, the Republicans will do whatever they can to increase these odds. The G.O.P. would like nothing better than to shift attention from the economy to the personal life of the Democratic candidate.
Mr. Clinton's supporters may well point out that some revered Presidents were unfaithful to their wives. But that was when everyone abided by the "gentlemen's agreement" that personal matters would not be mentioned even in the heat of the campaign. Those days are over.
It's easy to see how Republicans might make adultery the central issue of a Clinton-Bush contest. After all, character attacks succeeded in 1988 when unfounded rumors that Michael Dukakis had sought psychiatric treatment caused the Massachusetts Governor to drop eight points in the polls that summer.
A Republican campaign based on "family values" would allow President Bush to emphasize his relationship with the First Lady, who is more popular than he is, and appeal to conservatives who have complained that he has not pursued their social agenda. In New Hampshire last week, the President showed every sign of following this strategy.
Hillary Clinton, the Governor's wife, has asked that her family "have some realm of protection from public life." Mr. Clinton and his family do have a right to privacy, but not at the expense of Americans' right to assess the fitness of candidates to the highest office. Mr. Clinton would do well to reflect on the words of Thomas Jefferson: "When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property."

HEADLINE: EX-SOVIET LANDS TO GET SWIFT AID

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The 47-nation conference on aid to the former Soviet Union ended today with some general proposals on how to expand and accelerate humanitarian assistance but with lingering uncertainty over how to pay for the programs and carry them out.
In an effort to spur the aid process, the Bush Administration announced today that it would fly 54 shipments of emergency food and medical supplies to Russia and the other republics, beginning Feb. 10, to help the new Commonwealth of Independent States through the winter. On board the C-5 and C-141 aircraft will be some 16 million prepackaged meals left over from the Persian Gulf war. 
 In addition, at the end of the two-day meeting Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced new plans to send some 2,000 American farm volunteers over the next three years, for periods of up to 90 days, to work directly with private farmers in the commonwealth, and a new plan to establish a $25 million fund called the Eurasian Foundation for Democracy to help strengthen free market institutions in the former Communist nation.
Money for the American food and medical airlift, as well as the technical assistance programs like the Eurasian Foundation, will come primarily from funds urged on the Bush Administration by Congressional Democrats last year. While the Administration did not encourage Congress to appropriate the money at the time, it is now eagerly taking full advantage of it.
Following their talks, the 47 ministers present at the State Department announced a series of five sketchy "action plans" they would use in the coming months to improve and enlarge the transfer of medicine, food, shelter, energy and technical assistance to the commonwealth. The plans, each of which is being supervised by a working group headed by two countries that attended the conference, contain both new suggestions and proposals for insuring that aid already promised does not get duplicated or diverted to the black market.
Some of the plans, though, are so general and vague that it is still hard to see what they will involve. For instance, the food plan says the working group will try "encouraging competition and improving productivity throughout the food sector," and "establish contacts with the new states," and "build up links with the international institutions involved in assisting the new states."
If all of these plans are fleshed out, financed and carried out, the situation in the former Soviet Union will probably improve. But it is still unclear how many of these new initiatives will become reality.
 
Mood at Conference
 The mood at the close of the conference was best summarized by Portugal's Foreign Minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, spokesman for the European Community, who declared at the closing news conference:
"This is the first step of a process. Ahead lies the task of translating our commitments into effective and rapid results. We now need to insure that the people in the new state and their authorities at every level join us as partners in this task. Our aim is to contribute to their efforts and help them to reach the objectives they have chosen. If we succeed in this enterprise, as we must, we shall not only have helped to provide relief to millions of people. We shall need to build a strong momentum on the basis of our commitments at this Washington Conference."
The ministers agreed to reconvene again, at the beginning of May in Lisbon, to review progress. Each of the five working groups -- medical, food, energy, housing and technical assistance -- will have to report at that time on how well its plan has been carried out. American officials are counting on this pressure to help insure that the countries -- including the United States -- follow through on their promises.
 
Proposal by Baker
 When this aid conference was proposed by Secretary Baker in a Princeton speech last month, it was not greeted with much enthusiasm by either the White House or the Europeans. The Europeans in particular saw it as a gimmick, basically designed to allow the United States to take credit for leading the global aid effort for the commonwealth without having to spend any more of its own money.
Although Secretary Baker said this week's conference was intended not to secure more pledges of aid, but merely one to coordinate offers that had already been made, the European complaints embarrassed the Bush Administration into increasing its own contributions.
The President said yesterday he would ask Congress for $645 million more in humanitarian and technical aid during fiscal 1992 and 1993 -- which he apparently plans to take from the military budget -- and followed that up today with the announced airlift. Washington has now committed about $5 billion to the aid effort, but most of that is in farm credits for the Russians to buy grain from American farmers with loans that must be repaid.
Some other countries that were invited, though, also felt impelled to pledge real or token increases in their assistance, although many experts believe these still fall far short of what is needed if the commonwealth states are to avoid social unrest from shortages of food and shelter.
 
Dispute With Japan
 Japan, for instance, announced before coming to the conference that it would give $50 million more to the Red Cross for humanitarian aid to the commonwealth, but Tokyo made clear it would not make any larger contributions until Russia returns to Japan disputed islands the Soviet Union occupied at the end of World War II. The Japanese earlier had pledged $2.6 billion in aid, mostly in the form of credits.
Among the new pledges, Oman announced that it would commit $200 million to support energy exploration in the commonwealth. Thailand offered $450 million in loans for republics to buy rice and other commodities, while Korea offered $800 million for the same. Argentina proposed to absorb 100,000 Russian immigrants. Saudi Arabia and other gulf states agreed to unfreeze more than $1 billion in aid they had promised the former Soviet Union and frozen during the August coup. Finland offered to transport humanitarian aid to the commonwealth at a large discount.
"The conference created pressure on us and the people we invited to give more," said a senior Administration official. "In three months, people will have to say what they've done."
Mr. Baker said a delegation from this week's conference would sit down next week with leaders of the new Commonwealth of Independent States in Minsk to review the decisions and proposals put forward in Washington. He also announced the appointment of Richard L. Armitage, as the coordinator for American aid to the former Soviet Union, with responsibility for making sure that aid gets to its proper destination.
The Americans refused to allow discussion at the conference of a Russian request for a multibillion dollar currency stabilization fund, along the lines of that provided for Poland, to support any transition to free markets. Administration officials insist that such a program will have to be handled by the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Bush Weighs Health Benefits Tax And Cap on Medicaid Payments

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
As part of President Bush's effort to curb spending on health care, Administration officials want to limit how much Federal Medicaid payments can grow each year, and they want to impose a new tax on high-income people with health insurance purchased by employers.
Administration officials outlined their ideas at a meeting today with Republican senators and at a meeting on Tuesday with lobbyists for hospitals and health insurance companies. Both proposals are subject to approval by Congress. 
 Republican strategists have warned the Administration that the proposal to tax part of the health insurance benefits of affluent people is full of political peril for Mr. Bush and other Republican candidates in this Presidential election year. But the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, has brushed aside such doubts and defended the tax as sound health policy, Administration officials said.
Mr. Darman contends that the tax would discourage the purchase of excessive amounts of insurance and the resulting overuse of health care. And in speeches over the last 15 months, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, often said the existing tax subsidies for health insurance were costly and inequitable.
Under the Medicaid proposal, the Federal Government would pay states a flat amount, fixed in advance, for each person enrolled in Medicaid, the health-care program for the poor. The increase in payments for each person would be limited to about 6 percent in 1994 and 5 percent in 1995, the senators and lobbyists were told.
 
Jump in Federal Spending
 That represents a major change. Currently, only 2.6 million of the 29.8 million Medicaid recipients are covered by such prepaid health plans. For other recipients there is no limit on Medicaid payments; the Government pays more if they use more services.
Federal Medicaid spending shot up 28 percent last year, to $52.5 billion, partly because of surging enrollment as a result of the recession. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that under current law the Federal share of Medicaid will rise to $68 billion this year and $80 billion in 1993, almost twice the 1990 total. The average payment for a beneficiary has been increasing more than 15 percent a year.
Congress is unlikely to impose a rigid cap on Medicaid, but might well go along with a proposal, currently being discussed by Administration officials, to force large numbers of Medicaid recipients into health maintenance organizations and other "managed care" plans. More than 30 states are already experimenting with such plans. New York State aims to enroll half its Medicaid recipients in such plans within five years.
A Federal health official said the Medicaid proposals were part of "a massive cost-containment strategy." But the official did not disclose the amount of the expected savings.
Larry S. Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals, who attended the White House meeting, said today, "Under the guise of national health-care reform, the Administration is trying to resurrect arbitrary caps on Federal Medicaid spending." Congress rejected such a ceiling when President Ronald Reagan proposed it in 1981 as a way to control costs.
States share the cost of Medicaid, and the program has become one of the fastest-growing items in state budgets. James L. Martin, director of state-Federal relations for the National Governors' Association, said, "Governors do not like Medicaid caps because if your Medicaid costs are going up more than the per capita increase in Federal payments, you would have to cut the program or find state revenues to pay for it." But he added, "Governors want more flexibility for statewide health-care reform, including greater use of managed care for Medicaid recipients."
At the White House meeting, Mr. Bush's proposals were outlined by Thomas A. Scully, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget; Dr. Sullivan, and Samuel K. Skinner, the President's chief of staff.
 
Tax on Benefits of Affluent
 Here, according to their description, is how the tax on health insurance benefits for affluent people would work: families with annual incomes of more than $125,000 would be subject to the tax if they received employer-paid health insurance worth more than $160 a month. Employer contributions exceeding that amount would be taxed as regular income for the employee. Under current law, such contributions are not counted as taxable income.
More than 138 million Americans get health insurance through their employers. The Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group, says the average monthly premium for a family was $318 in 1990. Insurers fear that once the principle of taxing health benefits is established, the income threshold would be lowered, so more people would have to pay the tax.
While Mr. Darman has defended the proposed tax as good health policy, William D. McInturff, a partner in Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican survey research firm, said the idea for a new tax on health insurance benefits was, "from a Republican perspective, the single worst idea" since President Reagan proposed cutting Social Security benefits in 1981.
Mr. McInturff said Democrats could easily run television commercials attacking the proposed health insurance tax, as Senator Harris Wofford did last year in Pennsylvania when his Republican opponent, Dick Thornburgh, expressed interest in such taxes.
The proposed limit on Medicaid spending would allow an increase in Federal payments if more people qualify for Medicaid as a result of unemployment or economic hardship. But it would curb the growth in costs resulting from greater use of costly medical services by Medicaid recipients.
The average Federal Medicaid payment varies with the type of beneficiary. In 1990, it was about $800 for a child and $1,400 for an adult with dependent children, according to preliminary data from the Department of Health and Human Services. The Administration's proposal focuses initially on services provided by doctors and hospitals, not nursing homes.
Several important questions about the Medicaid plan remain unanswered. For example, it is not clear how the Administration would adjust Federal Medicaid payments to reflect differences in medical costs among states. Nor is it clear whether states would be legally obliged to make up for all the money they lose as a result of the limits on Federal Medicaid payments.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Reaching to Japan in an effort to keep the American national pastime alive in Seattle, this city's leaders announced today that a group led by Japanese investors had made an offer to buy the Seattle Mariners baseball team for $100 million.
The offer, by the family that founded Nintendo, the world's biggest video game company, is the first time that a potential buyer outside of North America has tried to buy a controlling interest in a major league baseball team. The offer was presented here as the best chance to keep Jeff Smulyan, the team's current owner, from moving the club out of town. As proposed, the Mariners would stay in Seattle and be under the control of a local board of directors; they could play some exhibition games in Japan, as well as develop a television following overseas. 
 But the package, which was unveiled here with a flourish of optimism and backed by the Northwest's most powerful political and business leaders, drew a terse and negative response from Fay Vincent, the commissioner of baseball. Mr. Vincent, as well as a majority of baseball's team owners, must approve the deal for it to go through.
In a statement issued late today, Mr. Vincent said: "Baseball has addressed the issue of ownership of its franchises and has developed a strong policy against approving investors from outside the United States and Canada. It is unlikely foreign investors would receive the requisite baseball approvals."
The issue of Japanese ownership of a United States baseball team comes at a tense time in trade and business relations between the two countries. On Wednesday, Los Angeles County officials canceled a contract with a Japanese company that had been selected to supply rail transit cars to the city, choosing an American company instead. Earlier this week, Yoshio Sakurauchi, the speaker of Japan's lower house of parliament, set off a furor when he said American workers were lazy.
In recent years, Japanese buyers have purchased everything from Hollywood film studios, to landmark buildings, to golf courses of national stature. The proposal to purchase the Mariners was made after an overture to the Japanese group by United States Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington. Seattle officials said the plan would keep jobs and a healthy segment of the local economy in the Pacific Northwest.
 
Political Clash Possible
 Mr. Vincent's seeming opposition sets the stage for a political clash in Congress, where this state's delegation, which includes House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, has raised the possibility of introducing a measure aimed at revoking Major League Baseball's exemption from antitrust laws if they were to allow the Mariners to pull out of Seattle.
Mr. Gorton, who initiated the deal when he approached the owners of Nintendo in December, said it was hypocritical for baseball to allow Canadian owners but not Japanese owners. The partnership would be made up of 60 percent Japanese money and 40 percent from Seattle. Minoru Arakawa, president of Nintendo's American subsidiary, which is based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, act as chairman of the investor group.
Mr. Arakawa, the son-in-law of Nintendo's president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, has lived in Seattle for 15 years. The current owner of the team, Mr. Smulyan, lives in Indianapolis.
 
'Partnership Made in Heaven'
 The Nintendo group decided to get involved only after being approached by Senator Gorton, said Howard Lincoln, a spokesman for the new investor group, called the Baseball Club of Seattle. "Mr. Yamauchi and Mr. Arakawa decided to get involved, and their only motivation is to help this community," said Mr. Lincoln.
The team, which posted its first winning season last year and broke all their team attendance records, was put up for sale on Dec. 9. Mr. Smulyan had given the city until March 27 to come up with a local buyer.
Asked about the commissioner's concerns of foreign ownership, Senator Gorton said: "Major League Baseball crossed that bridge 20 years ago when it admitted two Canadian teams. The Pacific Northwest looks outward. This is partnership made in heaven for the Pacific Northwest."
Mr. Gorton said the Seattle deal was different from the recently canceled Los Angeles rail car contract because no local buyer had emerged here to compete with the Japanese offer.
 
Offer Surprises Owner
 The Pacific Northwest, unlike other parts of the country, has long had a trade surplus with Japan. Its economy is heavily dependent on Japanese trade, and it has strong cultural ties as well.
Mr. Smulyan, traveling from New York to Indianapolis, could not be reached for comment. The offer came as a surprise to him, said his spokesman, David Aust.
While Mr. Smulyan relied on two large bank loans to purchase the team for $76 million in 1989, the new ownership group proposes to pay cash from their own personal fortunes. The investor group that would co-own the team includes business leaders from this city's leading companies, such as Boeing, Microsoft, McCaw Cellular Communications and others.
In their 15-year history, the Mariners have never been run by a local owner. Two California businessmen owned the team, and then it was sold to Mr. Smulyan, who owns Emmis Broadcasting.
Last year, the city fell in love with the team, and stars like Ken Griffey Jr. and Randy Johnson became household names. The club drew more than two million fans, nearly as many as the pennant-winning Atlanta Braves, and posted its first winning season. But Mr. Smulyan, facing a February deadline to pay off or refinance a $39 million bank loan, said he needed more than fan support to keep the team afloat. He appealed to the business community for help.
In the last five months, business leaders raised more than $10 million a year in pledges to help the team. But in December, just as the business group was hitting stride, Mr. Smulyan put the Mariners up for sale. A group in Florida has been trying to get Mr. Smulyan to move the team to the Tampa-St. Petersburg area.
Before Mr. Vincent issued his statement today, Seattle civic leaders sounded as if they had solved their baseball problems.
"It's all good news," said John Ellis, one of the Seattle corporate leaders trying to keep baseball here. "This is new ownership for the Mariners that will finally bring financial solvency, permanency and local control of our team."
 
Playing Down Foreign Angle
 George Duff, the head of the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, held aloft a baseball and said, "This deal will now permit us once and for all to take this little critter off the endangered species list."
In presenting the prospective buyers, Seattle leaders went out of their way to play down the nationality of the potential buyers. "In effect, all of the shareholders of the new company will be local Seattle area residents and all company decisions involving the club will be made in this area," said Mr. Lincoln. If the Japanese decided to sell any portion of the team, they would first have to offer it to a Seattle buyer, Mr. Lincoln said.
Nintendo has 1,400 employees in the Seattle area. The company has captured 80 percent of the American market for video games, and had sales of $3.5 billion last year.
Mr. Yamauchi's son-in-law, Mr. Arakawa, was introduced at the press conference today, but he declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Tisch Is Offering to Buy Macy's In Rescue From Huge Debt Load

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
In an apparent solution to R. H. Macy & Company's overwhelming financial troubles, Laurence A. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of Loews and CBS, has offered to buy the tottering retail company.
Already a major investor in Macy, Mr. Tisch would spend roughly $1 billion more to increase his stake substantially, people involved in talks to solve Macy's immense debt problems said last night. They added that negotiations were continuing and that details of the proposal could change. 
 Mr. Tisch is expected to wind up owning perhaps as much as 90 percent of the company's stock and to invest large sums to buy junk bonds and stock from creditors and investors at well below face value. It is not clear whether the management investors, including Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman and chief executive, would lose their stake.
Macy's board is expected to approve the proposal in the next few days, people familiar with the talks said.
If that happens, Mr. Tisch's move would be expected to calm the maelstrom of speculation about the company's solvency that has engulfed Macy in recent years. Mr. Finkelstein and his top executives bought Macy from its shareholders for $3.7 billion in 1986.
By eliminating a substantial portion of Macy's debt, the 11th-hour rescue would relieve the worries of the company about its bills and interest payments and concentrate on operating its department stores. That firmer financial footing would also give Macy's normal sales operations more of a chance to carry the New York-based company through the recession that has claimed many of its once-formidable rivals.
 
Calls for Bankruptcy Filing
 Whether Mr. Finkelstein would remain in charge of the company that operates the Macy's, I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains and several small specialty stores across the country is unclear. But Mr. Tisch and Mr. Finkelstein are close friends. It is also unclear whether Mr. Tisch, through his L.T. Holding Corporation, intends to try to sell any of Macy's assets, such as one of the department store chains.
A Macy spokesman declined to comment last night about the company's financial plans. Calls to Mr. Tisch's office and to other Macy board members were not returned.
The Tisch plan would call for the company to file for bankruptcy on its own terms and eliminate debt, rather than default on payments and be forced to seek protection from its creditors.
Holders of Macy junk bonds would be offered prices well below face value, but above the low market prices to which they have fallen as concern has grown about Macy's prospects.
Other Macy shareholders are expected to agree to sell their stock to Mr. Tisch for a fraction of what they paid, fearing that the only other alternative would be a bankruptcy filing that could result in even greater losses.
Those investors include the top echelon of Macy management, the GE Capital Corporation and A. Alfred Taubman, the real estate developer, through Ticsec Inc. Two other major investors are Winmex Investments, whose principal investor is Sir Run Run Shaw, a Hong Kong financier, and the Mutual Series Fund, an investment fund run by Michael F. Price.
In late 1990, when Macy had to scale another financial wall, Mr. Tisch and GE Capital were among a group of investors that chipped in $202 million to help the company over.
Macy's leveraged buyout at first seemed successful. But in 1988, the company bought the I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains from Federated Department Stores Inc. for $1.1 billion, a price many analysts considered far too dear.
Shouldering the additional debt, Macy staggered into the recession about the same time its customers started curtailing their spending. Sales fell and losses soared. Although the company again began reporting sales increases last fall, the gains were not enough to cover the interest payments on its heavy debt.
 
Steps Already Taken
 Since adding I. Magnin and Bullock's, Macy has taken several steps to stave off insolvency, including renegotiating the terms of its bank debt 23 times, raising cash by selling assets and coaxing investors to increase their stakes.
But two weeks ago it became apparent the retailer was having a lot of trouble juggling its many payments, despite extracting much more lenient terms from its banks a month earlier. On Jan. 15, Macy told its suppliers it would delay their payments for two weeks to avoid defaulting on its newly renegotiated bank agreements. Those agreements were reached in early December, and the inability of Macy to meet a payment deadline so soon afterward was seen as evidence the Christmas season had been far worse than Macy had expected.
Even with a rescue seemingly near, it is not clear whether those payments will be sent out Saturday as promised. Mr. Tisch's plan reportedly includes paying off the suppliers -- but only after enough bondholders have approved his plan to make it virtually a done deal. Getting that approval might take several weeks, leading to another two- or three-week delay in payments, one person involved in the talks said. Such a delay could put Macy's stores behind in receiving spring merchandise, creating a competitive disadvantage.
Mr. Tisch apparently plans to carry out his plans with the help of a "prepackaged" bankruptcy, a tool that has gained favor in recent years as an expedient way to revive debt-laden companies.
 
Bankruptcy Is Different
 Such a bankruptcy differs from a normal Chapter 11 filing in that it is largely a formality. By the time a prepackaged bankruptcy is filed in court, a debtor and its creditors have already decided what each will settle for. But they still need to go through an expedited bankruptcy process to break the contract terms of their previous debt agreements.
This also allows the company to force recalcitrant bondholders to accept the terms of the deal, so long as most bondholders agree to take a little money and, in effect, go away.
A Jan. 10 report on the company by Jack Hersch, David Teolis and Raz Kafri of Lehman Brothers called a prepackaged bankruptcy the best option because it would allow the management, which is highly regarded in the retail industry, to maintain control of the changes.
If Mr. Tisch can gain the approval of his plan from bondholders representing two-thirds of the value of the bonds, Macy can file for Chapter 11 and present its plan for restructuring its finances as a fait accompli. That will avoid the drawn-out legal wrangling that so often accompanies a normal bankruptcy filing.
Federated Department Stores, which operates Bloomingdale's and other large department stores, recently emerged from such a bankruptcy after two years of intricate legal bargaining.
Mr. Tisch apparently is seeking approval to buy at a premium to the market price a significant portion of Macy's $1.3 billion worth of junk bonds, whose double-digit interest rates have crippled a company also reeling from the impact of the recession on consumer spending.
He is willing to pay bondholders more than the market price of their holdings to entice them to go along with his plan quickly. He would also buy the other investors' stock in the company for what one person involved in the talks described as just cents on the dollar.
And upon receiving the approval of the bondholders for his plan, he would pay suppliers, many of whom are currently holding shipments to Macy until its future is resolved.
Although Macy's more than 140 department stores represent significant real estate value, most of them are heavily mortgaged and thus are not likely to be one of Mr. Tisch's primary reasons for investing in the company.
Mr. Tisch over the years has gained a reputation as a shrewd investor willing to make big bets on companies and assets that others have given up on. Sometimes, as with the purchase of control of the CNA Financial Corporation in 1974, the gamble has paid off handsomely. Many eyes were raised in early 1990 when Mr. Tisch and his family went heavily into New England bank stocks, which were then suffering from a severe real estate recession. Some of those investments did not pay off, but on balance it seems to have been a profitable strategy.
Mr. Tisch, 69 years old, and his brother, Preston, built their fortune through hotels and then Loews Theaters, which they have since sold. The Loews Corporation, which they control, has a 23 percent stake in CBS Inc., but that is far from its only holding. Loews controls CNA and owns Lorillard, the tobacco company whose brands include Kent and Newport. It also operates hotels and owns Bulova, the watch company.
CBS has been a successful investment for Loews, which last year took $537 million out of the company through a stock repurchase plan. But Mr. Tisch's tenure has featured cuts in expenses that angered some employees, as similar cuts had at CNA.

HEADLINE: BUSH TO ASK MORE FOR BASE CLEANUPS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has sharply increased its estimate of the cost of cleaning up pollution on military bases, and plans to ask Congress for an immediate increase of $1 billion for this purpose beyond the $2.7 billion already included in this year's military budget.
The Administration's request for funds to clean up the environment at military bases in the fiscal year 1993, which begins Oct. 1, has also been raised about $1 billion, to $3.7 billion, according to budget documents made public today. 
 The spending plans were disclosed at a White House briefing where President Bush and his top environmental aides sought to highlight the growth in spending on the environment in this Administration. It is part of a strategy to squeeze maximum political benefit from the Administration's budget requests, which will be officially made public after the State of the Union Message next week. Just the other day, Mr. Bush announced in Baltimore a sharp increase in funds for Head Start preschool program for the poor.
 
A Way to Gain Attention
 The White House was apparently concerned that if the environmental program was not announced in advance, it would get scant attention amid other features of the President's program, like economic stimulation and Pentagon spending cuts.
"I think this preview of coming attractions in the budget will be good news for all of us who share our concern about America's environment," Mr. Bush said.
Whatever the motivation for the budget request, the plan was welcomed by private environmental groups and Congress members who had been seeking more money for cleaning up the bases, many of which are being closed and converted to civilian purposes.
"I think the Department of Defense supplemental budget request is very welcome and needed," said Ralph De Gennaro, a budget analyst at Friends of the Earth. "It is a second level peace dividend."
Representative Richard Ray, a Georgia Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said: "Each year you delay, the costs get greater. We had been discouraged, thinking that the Defense Department may be, in these tough budgetary times, backing away from an important responsibility."
 
Likely Military Cutbacks
 The rise in environmental costs facing the Pentagon comes at a time when its budgets for weapons, research and personnel are likely to be sharply cut because of the decline in the military threat posed by the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Ray said that estimates of what it would cost to clean up 1,800 known polluted sites on military bases easily exceeded $20 billion, and that the Pentagon budgets enacted last year by Congress fell at least $1 billion short of what was needed this fiscal year.
Along with a separate request to spend $5.5 billion next year cleaning up pollution from the Energy Department's nuclear weapon programs, the budget figures announced today show that cleaning up after the cold war is going to cost more than $9 billion in the fiscal year 1993. That is considerably more than the total spending of the Environmental Protection Agency, which is $7 billion under the budget request for 1993 that is to be sent to Congress next week.
William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said today at the White House briefing that since the start of the Bush Administration in January 1989, the agency's annual budget had risen 44 percent.
The budget documents did not disclose any drastic new programs, but they did include several large grants for specific regions, like the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mexican-American border area, the Chesapeake Bay area and Boston Harbor.
The environmental agency's operating budget, considered by experts to be an important measure of its activities, would be $2.7 billion in 1993, an increase of $120 million above the current level, and up 54 percent since 1989, when the Administration took office.
But Mr. De Gennaro of the environmental group said that after accounting for inflation, the operating budget was up only 16 percent, while the agency's workload was increasing sharply because of several new environmental laws.
"Over all, there are some welcome incremental increases, and there are some cuts in the fine print that we will learn about next week," he said. "It does not add up to a big new domestic policy on the environment, if that was the goal."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House
Leader and Salesman;
Bush Turns to Power of Incumbency And Tries to Defuse Revolt in Party

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
After apologizing for the state of the economy and assuring Americans that he cares, President Bush this week has moved to a new phase of his re-election campaign in which he is trying to use the power of his incumbency to demonstrate that he is doing something about the nation's problems.
But underscoring the difficulties he faces in selling his policies to the entire country, the President is still struggling to gather members of his own party behind the economic growth package that he will present in the State of the Union Message next Tuesday. 
 Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, met with about 50 House Republicans today in an effort to keep their disappointment with some proposals to be included in the package from turning into open rebellion.
Republican Congressional officials said many of the lawmakers, under pressure from constituents, had told Mr. Skinner that they wanted a deeper cut in the tax rate on capital gains than Mr. Bush is expected to urge. Administration officials have said Mr. Bush's proposal will mirror one he made last year: to cap the rate at about 20 percent, down from 28 percent.
 
'Some Level of Concern'
 "There was some level of concern and anxiety that the President would not make the kind of speech and growth package that some of the members feel is essential," one Republican Congressional official said today.
During the week, Mr. Bush has made a series of announcements on preschool education, the environment and other issues intended to show that he is coming to grips with domestic needs.
And while Mr. Skinner moves toward a reorganization of the White House staff intended to put it on a campaign footing, the re-election team has made final its plans to promote the goals of the State of the Union after the speech.
But the clear sense of urgency in the White House and the Bush campaign to regain ground in the Presidential race has been tempered by the underlying realities of this Presidency: The politics of 1992 demand action, but Mr. Bush and his economic advisers believe there are no quick solutions to the recession and are committed to observing the spending limits in the 1990 budget agreement with Congress.
 
Appealing to Common Sense
 This morning, Mr. Bush himself seemed to acknowledge the tensions between the needs of his campaign and the demands of the Presidency. "You're going to hear all kinds of proposals out there promoting a lot of gimmicks," he told the National Association of Wholesalers-Distributors. "Given the fact this country is hurting, people are hurting, you're going to see a lot of quick fixes that will supposedly turn the economy around. I don't believe we need them. I think we've got to set common-sense goals, stick with them."
Still, Mr. Bush's hectic schedule this week seemed to address his political problems as much as the imperatives of governing, and it was infused with the air of a President's rapidly turning into a full-time candidate.
Mr. Bush has clearly been using his Presidency as a campaign weapon, arguing that he is trying to govern while the Democrats are electioneering. He has said that his State of the Union Message and his budget proposal, both clearly political documents, are "Presidential" and "transcend politics," and that Congress should rise above partisanship to consider them.
These statements are part of a central strategy of the Bush campaign: If Mr. Bush's economic growth proposals do not pass in Congress, the Republicans want to be able to make the case that it is the fault of the Democrats, who control Capitol Hill.
 
A Strategy Emerges
 The Bush campaign's strategy for the early part of the race has emerged in recent weeks, now that the President has abandoned his attempts to assure the country that the recession is ending, and that the economy would soon right itself.
The White House conceded in December that the recession was continuing, and Mr. Bush began his campaign in New Hampshire last week by apologizing for the state of the economy and promising voters there that he is concerned about them. "Message: I care," Mr. Bush said.
But campaign strategists have said that it is not enough for Mr. Bush to say he cares, that he must now demonstrate that he is taking action to right the economy and to erase any impression that he is not spending enough time on domestic issues.
To that end, the White House announced plans today to increase spending on the environment, and Administration officials sought a compromise with lawmakers that would avert another fight over extending unemployment benefits.
Administration officials are also drafting plans for new arms reductions which they hope would demonstrate Mr. Bush's mastery of foreign policy and satisfy demands for further cuts in military spending. In another cost-cutting move, the Pentagon is planning to limit investments in new weapons systems to research and design. And on Tuesday, Mr. Bush proposed the biggest increase ever in spending for Head Start, the preschool program.
Some Administration officials and Republican strategists remain concerned that Mr. Bush is staking too much on his address to Congress next Tuesday. But they say that he has committed himself to a strategy of using the speech and his 1993 budget, due out the next day, as the launching pad for his campaign, and that all the short-term activities of the Administration and the campaign are now geared toward those events.
Mr. Bush and his top advisers held a series of meetings this week about the economy and the campaign, including a lunchtime session today attended by the President, his campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, and his campaign manager, Frederick Malek, officials said.
After the State of the Union, officials said, Mr. Bush will give two or three speeches, most likely including a trip to California and one to Cincinnati, to promote his economic proposals.
He is also expected to campaign in New Hampshire on the weekend before the Feb. 18 primary. His re-election team is to televise its first commercials in New Hampshire this weekend.
Campaign aides said they would underscore the theme that Mr. Bush is listening to the voters in that state. "The message is: 'I know what's going on here. I know there are problems. We will have a sensible, real plan, with real results," said Victoria Clarke, Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary.

HEADLINE: Sales of American Vehicles Dropped 1.9% in Mid-January

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America declined 1.9 percent in mid-January, auto makers reported today.
Industry analysts said the figures suggest that the market is neither improving nor worsening.
"It's a continuation of the malaise," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in Manhattan. "We're probably going to bump along the bottom of this trough another six to eight weeks."
 
Consumers 'Overly Cautious'
 
 Tom Webb, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association, said that although some segments of the industry posted gains, "there is no denying that the retail customer remains overly cautious."
Auto makers with American plants sold 116,395 cars between Jan. 11 and Jan. 20, a decline of 7.1 percent from the corresponding 1991 period. Sales of American-made light trucks rose 7.9 percent, to 70,856, but those gains came over a particularly weak sales period in mid-January 1991, when consumers shunned less fuel-efficient vehicles at the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 million, compared with 6.6 million in the period last year. There were eight selling days in the mid-January sales period both this year and last year.
Although the figures suggested strong consumer interest in Japanese-brand cars, several dealers said many foreign-car owners had expressed greater interest in American-brand vehicles since President Bush's recent trip to Japan, which underscored America's trade deficit with that country.
Edward Kalaydjian, who owns a Pontiac dealership in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said about a quarter of his customers were foreign-car owners who said they had decided to buy an American-brand car. One Midwest dealer with both domestic and foreign franchises said sales of his American-brand cars were up 20 percent over last January, while foreign-brand sales were flat. "It's not just one store; all three G.M. stores are ahead," said Ray Green, who owns five dealerships across central Illinois.
Martin Biener, owner of a Pontiac and Nissan dealership in Great Neck, L.I., said that Pontiac dealers in metropolitan New York would begin a television ad campaign this week designed to fan the "buy American" sentiment among consumers. The commercials will refer to the comments a leading Japanese politician made last weekend on the shortcomings of American workers.
Some dealers, however, said they had not seen renewed interest in American cars. At Bob Thomas Chevrolet-Cadillac-Honda in Bend, Ore., the sales ratio of foreign to domestic nameplates remained unchanged. Nick Taylor, sales manager, said sales of Hondas were flat in 1991 compared with 1990, while his Chevrolet franchise suffered a roughly 30 percent drop in sales.
In the mid-January period, the General Motors Corporation sold 53,959 American-made cars, a decline of 9.9 percent. G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 3.6 percent, to 26,211 units.
The Ford Motor Company's domestic car sales were off 8.8. percent, to 30,746 vehicles. The auto maker's light-truck sales were up 13.6 percent, to 25,283.
The sales results included an estimate for the Chrysler Corporation, which does not report 10-day sales. The estimates, provided by Ward's Automotive Reports, indicated Chrysler's sales of domestically produced cars fell 24.6 percent, to 11,800. Sales of Chrysler's mini-vans, Jeeps and pickup trucks rose 22.2 percent, to an estimated 15,800 vehicles in mid-January.
Both the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Honda Motor Company reported sharp jumps in sales, partly because of leasing promotions.

HEADLINE: As Cabbies Protest, Taxi Panel Decides Against Fare Increase

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Unlike subway and bus passengers, cab users won't be paying more for their rides -- at least not right away.
The chairman of New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission said yesterday that he would not propose a taxi fare increase. As he made the statement, more than 300 cabs drove through downtown and midtown Manhattan to protest even the possibility of an increase. 
 The chairman, Fidel F. Del Valle, said at a Commission meeting yesterday morning that he would not recommend a fare increase because it did not "make sense" now. Mr. Del Valle said an increase might be counterproductive to the taxi industry because it would drive away riders.
"It would certainly not be welcome by a public whose own incomes have suffered in the recession," he added.
Luckmann Lalanne, one of the drivers in the convoy, agreed. "We are here because we refuse the fare increase," he said. "The economy is bad and this will drive our business away. This will send our business to the gypsy cabs."
 
Convoy Effect Slight
 The convoy, off-duty lights on and horns blaring continuously, started in the morning and, at midday, wound its way through the heart of the city's major business and retail districts. But the impact on traffic appeared relatively light because the cabs were moving quickly and because the police split the convoy into smaller groups.
The Taxi and Limousine Commission had been reviewing the financial health of the taxi industry and the possibility of a fare increase since early last year, when the Persian Gulf war briefly caused gasoline prices to escalate. Under the City Charter, formal consideration of an increase does not begin until the chairman proposes one.
The current taxi rates are $1.50 at the start and 25 cents for each one-fifth of a mile. The charge for waiting time is 20 cents per minute, and there is a 50-cents-per trip surcharge in effect from 8 P.M. to 6 A.M.
Mr. Del Valle, in explaining why he did not recommend an increase, noted that at a public hearing last month, taxi industry leaders were divided about whether they wanted the fare to go up.
Some drivers and owners said that an increase would hurt their business, Mr. Del Valle said. Some taxi associations took no position on the fare and some industry representatives favored an increase, he said.
Mr. Del Valle said that proponents of an increase had not made a compelling case. As for those who were opposed, he said, "It would be almost perverse to propose a higher fare that lacks drivers' support."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Mayors Appear Unmoved by the Major Candidates

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
After hearing pitches from the Democratic Presidential contenders on how they would revive America's cities, dozens of mayors meeting here today seemed to agree on one thing: the single candidate who truly understands urban needs is Larry Agran.
Given that Mr. Agran was once a mayor himself, of Irvine, Calif., it is not surprising that participants in a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors would rally behind behind his long-shot Presidential candidacy. 
 Though most of the mayors did not view Mr. Agran as a likely Democratic nominee, they did find his ideas appealing, which says less about Mr. Agran than about the unfamiliarity of the major Democratic candidates with the issues confronting urban America.
At a forum of the mayors here Wednesday night, the candidates offered their plans for helping cities after what they all said were years of neglect under Republican Administrations. But several mayors, from large cities and small towns, said in interviews today that while they were encouraged that the candidates were addressing the problems of cities, they were disappointed because many of the proposals were sketchy and sometimes naive.
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston, president of the Conference of Mayors, said he had hoped to rally the Democrats in the organization around one Presidential candidate for the first time. But he said today that this was not possible, at least for now, because none of the major contenders performed strongly enough to merit wide support.
"I want a little fire in the belly here for America's cities," Mr. Flynn said. "There's still this hesitancy among the candidates. We want people to be fiscally responsible. But we want somebody who's really going to have a feeling of commitment to problems like homelessness and AIDS."
Mr. Agran, who as a mayor ran a city with a population of 111,418 in the 1980's, is usually excluded from forums at which the major Democratic contenders appear. But he won approval from the mayors by proposing the most direct assistance to cities: $25 billion in "no-strings-attached" aid, with the money coming from a $150 billion cut in military spending.
"I thought the Mayor was the best candidate," said Mayor John Robinson of Wausau, Wis., echoing many of his colleagues. "He had a specific program and had given it some thought."
The other candidates sought to distinguish themselves at the forum but sometimes drew criticism. Several mayors said they objected to the suggestion by Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska that he would use the military to fight drugs in the cities.
Calling the drug problem a "national security issue," Mr. Kerrey said: "I would not hesitate to use our military forces, and to make them available in the cities to wage that war. I would not hesitate as well to use all available force to make certain that our children are protected from criminals and others who are preying on them in the streets."
Other mayors said they were disturbed that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said he was not ready to back a proposal by Senators Paul Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee, widely supported by mayors, that would pump $35 billion into the economy for public works projects, education and grants to state and local governments.
 
Clinton's Housing Plan
 "I just don't want to commit to the Sasser-Sarbanes proposal," Mr. Clinton said, "until I know that we have a way to pay for it and the money is going to be there."
J. Thomas Cochran, executive director of the Conference of Mayors, said that while Mr. Clinton was "really reaching out" among the mayors, his comments about the Sarbanes-Sasser plan "caused some concern."
Some mayors said they were encouraged by Mr. Clinton's proposal for a "genuine housing program" that provides housing for the homeless and and the "flat out poor who have fallen beneath the safety net."
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts assured the audience that "no matter which of us is elected President, you're going to be a lot better off than you are today." He want on to press for more private investment, saying, "The answer in the cities is the private sector providing private-sector jobs so that people have the dignity of that kind of work."
In offering their remedies for the cities, candidates often emphasized their basic speeches. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., of California, said the urban ills could be addressed by empowering the grass roots.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, citing a scheduling conflict, did not appear at the forum but addressed the mayors Wednesday. He vowed to meet with mayors in his first week as President.
Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore disputed some of the criticism of the candidates, saying, "They are concerned with the problems of the cities and they are not locking out the poor and minorities from their campaigns."

HEADLINE: Officials Defend Policies To Protect Bond Market

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Government officials who oversee the Treasury securities market asserted at a Senate committee hearing today that the changes they mandated on Wednesday would not disrupt trading and that they would move slowly before imposing the more contentious proposals.
A key goal of the regulators was to preserve the $2.2 trillion Treasury market as a place where speculators and investors can easily and quickly trade hundreds of millions of dollars of securities without causing a ripple effect on prices. 
 The intangible value of the Treasury market is great enough that David W. Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the committee that it was "a national resource." It is a market that has no trading floor but attracts tens of billions of dollars of speculators' money from around the world and in effect sets interest rates for other securities and home mortgages.
While the Securities and Exchange Commission favored broader changes than were supported by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve, the three agencies, which issued an outline of their plan on Wednesday, agreed that the new practices should go a long way toward preventing rigged auctions of Treasury securities, and other abusive trading tactics like those that Salomon Brothers admitted using last year.
Salomon, whose heavy-handed trading was the catalyst for the broad study that led to this week's changes, remains the subject of an investigation by the S.E.C.
Richard C. Breeden, head of the S.E.C. said about 150 witnesses had been interviewed and more than 25,000 pages of testimony collected, with more interviews scheduled. The time needed to finish the investigation will depend on the cooperation of various witnesses, he said.
Mr. Breeden said the difficulty of piecing together exactly what happened at Salomon was one reason that he supports the proposal of giving regulators the authority to require Treasury securities firms to provide records of all their trades, as is now the case in the stock and options markets.
Securities dealers in New York gave the changes and proposed changes in regulation of securities dealers and Treasury auctions mixed reviews today.
"It was a pretty decent effort that balanced the need for some changes in the market, but still preserves its efficiency," said Jon S. Corzine, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the largest dealers. Mr. Corzine and several other dealers said they doubted that one proposal to establish a new method of auctioning Treasury securities would reduce the interest rates the Government pays.
The Treasury, which is promising to automate its existing system of written bids, is also planning a new kind of auction in which the Treasury will poll dealers until it finds an interest rate at which all its securities could be sold at a single price, rather than various prices as is now the case. Dealers warned that prices and market conditions change minute by minute, and that the new system would be cumbersome because they fear it would take at least several minutes to complete. The auction is now conducted with a single deadline for all bids.
"It is an idea that needs a lot of study," said Stephen G. Thieke, president of J. P. Morgan Securities. "It may not cause any decline in participation at the auctions, but it may cost the Treasury some money."
Dealers dislike the proposal, favored by Mr. Breeden and the S.E.C. but not supported by the Fed or Treasury, to require large dealers to report their trades to regulators. "A lot of customers would find that intrusive," Mr. Thieke said. Other dealers said traders could shift their activity overseas or to other markets.
Another S.E.C. suggestion, that the amount and price of all trades be made public, was widely criticized by dealers who said the information would make them less willing to take the risk of trading large blocks of securities. Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where trades are disclosed and securities dealers generally act as agent executing trades for customers at prices set by stock specialists on the floor of the exchange, Treasury dealers buy and sell mostly from their own inventory.
Dealers approved of the Treasury's plans to issue more securities in cases where traders might have cornered the market in a particular issue. "It is an excellent idea," said Rafe de la Gueronniere, chairman of the Discount Corporation, a government securities dealer.

HEADLINE: Congressional Democrats Mount Offensive on Unemployment Pay

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Democrats went on the offensive today over another extension of unemployment benefits and dared Republicans to delay the measure by objecting to its financing.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, appeared as a witness before a subcommittee of the panel and said that another 13 weeks of benefits for the long-term unemployed were essential now while the jobless waited for the economy to recover. 
 Lynn Martin, Secretary of Labor, declined to appear at today's hearing to discuss the Bush Administration's policy in advance of Tuesday's State of the Union Message. A White House aide said that extended benefits would be discussed in the message but that the President would not endorse paying for them by declaring an emergency and increasing the deficit.
 
Vote Planned Before Speech
 Democrats responded by scheduling a vote of the full committee for Tuesday, hours before the speech and in time to make evening television news programs. An extension of unemployment benefits would follow a 13-to-20 week program enacted in November.
The Senate Finance Committee plans to hold a hearing on a bill of its own on Wednesday, the day after the State of the Union Message. A House vote is likely the first week in February.
Mr. Rostenkowski said most of the $4.5 billion cost of an additional 13 weeks of benefits for people already out of work at least half a year could be financed out of savings by Congress as reflected in a recent report by the Administration's Office of Management and Budget.
The report said Congress had voted savings that would amount to $3.7 billion over the five years ending Sept. 30, 1996.
He said Mr. Bush should declare an emergency under the 1990 Budget Act to allow the $4.5 billion to be spent.
 
'Real Pain in My Neighborhood'
 Citing aid approved last year under similar provisions for Kurds, Turks, Egyptians and Bangladeshis, Mr. Rostenkowski said the November extension would begin running out in mid-February. He said rising unemployment had caused "real pain in my neighborhood, in my city, in my state and across America.
"If this is not an emergency, then tell me what is," he said.
If Mr. Rostenkowski's bill is enacted, either with a Presidential signature or over Mr. Bush's veto, it would automatically declare that emergency. It would help between 2 million and 2 1/2 million people.
Mr. Bush vetoed such a benefits bill last fall and was sustained by two votes in the Senate. But neither he nor Republicans in Congress relish the idea of taking that stand again, and White House aides indicated today that they were trying to devise a compromise in paying for benefits that would not require an emergency declaration.
 
Hope for 'Creative' Solution
 November's extension was deemed to be paid for under budget accounting rules that counted future tax extensions as current revenue. An O.M.B. spending estimate that made the program less costly than Congress thought it was also made it much easier to pay for.
The House minority leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, testified at the same hearing that while he liked Mr. Rostenkowski's idea of using the $3.7 billion in savings to help the unemployed, "I can't conceive of the President using the emergency option." He said he hoped a "creative" way of finding money could be developed.
Representative Marty Russo, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee who faces a tough primary race in Illinois in March, challenged Mr. Michel, saying there already was money in the Federal unemployment trust fund to pay the cost of additional benefits. "We don't have to be creative," he said. "We already paid for it."

HEADLINE: Money Awaits at I.R.S., Working Poor Advised

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The nation's poorest working families can lose as much as $2,020 each by failing to file a Federal tax return this year, officials said today. About 2 million of these families failed to collect hundreds of dollars each by not filing tax returns last year.
The number of families eligible for this money -- called the earned-income credit -- is larger than ever because Congress raised the benefit and the recession reduced many workers' incomes, Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. of the Internal Revenue Service said at a news conference. 
 "This is a law that really does do good things for working families," Mr. Goldberg said. "The measure of our success is if every family entitled to this credit claims it and gets every dollar they are due."
Mr. Goldberg helped open a nationwide campaign to inform families with children and earnings under $21,250 a year that they are eligible for the credit. The campaign theme is "Two Simple Steps," reminding eligible workers that to claim the credit they must file a tax return and attach special schedule E.I.C., for earned income credit.
Wage earners whose incomes are so low that they have no income tax withheld can still receive money under the program. Government officials fear that many of these people are the ones who neglect to claim the benefit because they do not realize they are eligible.
More than 12 million families claimed the credit on tax returns filed last year and received a total of almost $7 billion. The I.R.S. estimated that 2 million eligible families failed to claim the credit and that 2 million more are eligible this year for the first time.
"This is the largest low-income and moderate-income program the Federal Government has," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit organization that is heading the campaign.
Mr. Greenstein's group, along with the United Way of America, organized labor, the United States Conference of Mayors and other organizations are distributing information about the credit.
The credit was enacted to help offset part of the Social Security tax and to give lower-income workers an incentive to stay off the welfare rolls.
The maximum basic earned-income credit is $1,235. Two supplemental credits, made available last year for the first time, offer up to $357 more for a child born last year and an additional $428 to offset part of the cost of health insurance for a child.
Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, speaking for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that part-time workers and employees who were on strike during part of 1991 may qualify for all or part of the credit.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Surpasses '91 Total

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Setting records is nothing new for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Fifty of its 80 annual appeals have raised more money than any before them.
But this year's campaign, which surpassed last year's total of $4.44 million yesterday, is one of the few to set a record during an economic downturn. 
 Since it was founded in 1912, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has been a fairly reliable barometer of the nation's economy. During times of economic growth -- the 1920's, the 50's and the 80's -- the Neediest Cases has posted healthy gains in the amount of money raised. During bad times -- especially the 1930's and the early 70's -- it has suffered declines.
But with records set in the 1990, the 1991 and now the 1992 campaigns, the current recession is the first extended downturn that has not brought a decline in giving.
"Last fall, none of the seven charities participating in the Neediest drive believed that total contributions this year would even come close to the remarkable record set the year before," said Arthur Gelb, president of the New York Times Foundation, which administers the fund. "The fact that the Fund has now moved ahead of that record, with five weeks to go before the drive ends, is a triumphant achievement in these troubled times.
"On behalf of the seven charities, we thank the thousands of Times readers who have contributed -- and who are planning to do so -- for their outpouring of generosity."
 
Early String of Records
 From the first campaign, when $3,630.88 was raised, the fund seemed an irresistible force. In each of the 18 subsequent years, it raised more than the year before, reaching its peak in the 1929-30 drive, when $345,790.65 was recorded.
But the 1930-31 appeal met an immovable object, the Depression. Receipts plummeted 14 percent, to $298,002. The long Depression was almost immediately followed by World War II, and the Neediest Cases did not set another record until 1945, when $386,608.56 was raised.
During the postwar era, the fund reflected the intial period of dislocation, registering declines from 1947 to 1949. It also reflected the boom that followed, posting gains in 17 of the next 20 campaigns.
But beginning with the 1977-78 campaign, the fund entered its greatest period of growth. During the next 13 years its receipts quadrupled -- from the $1,103,189 raised that year to the $4,439,093.47 recorded in 1990-91. It set records in 11 of those 13 years, but declines were posted in two years of economic downturn, the 1979-80, and 1983-84 campaigns.
Although the campaign has grown during the last 80 years, little else has changed since it was founded by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The Times.
The newspaper covers all of the expenses so that every dollar is passed to charities that work directly with the city's poor, sick and disabled. The fund has never engaged solicitors or agents but, as an editorial from the first campaign stated, has always trusted Times readers to respond simply by being shown "a world of famine in the midst of plenty; of cruel heart and body hunger with bounty in sight but not in reach."

HEADLINE: Big Jump in Jobless Pay Claims

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Government said today that claims for jobless benefits surged in the second week of January by about 46,000 from the previous week.
The jump in claims for unemployment pay might pressure President Bush, who has adopted the electioneering slogan of "I care," to extend jobless benefits for the longterm unemployed for a second time. 
 After being adjusted for the season, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for jobless benefits rose to 447,000 in the week that ended Jan. 11, up from 401,000 a week earlier. The rise probably reflects a surge in the number of people who delayed filing claims over the holidays, as well as an increase in layoffs at the end of the year, analysts said. "At almost 450,000, you are talking about rising joblessness," said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. "This is still at recessionary levels."
The number of people already receiving unemployment benefits also climbed, showing that the unemployed are facing a tough time getting another job. This number rose by 184,000 to 3.44 million in the week ended Jan. 4, the latest week for which the data is available, the department said.
That brings the number receiving unemployment pay close to the high of 3.49 million reached in mid-November, just before President Bush, under pressure from the Democrats in Congress, agreed to extend the six months of jobless benefits for another 13 to 20 weeks.
Those extended benefits expire in February, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Mr. Bush, abandoning his stance that economic recovery is just around the corner, is ready to extend benefits again. The unemployment rate stands at 7.1 percent.
One in three of the nation's 8.9 million unemployed in December had been jobless for at least 15 weeks, with many out of work for over half a year, the department said recently.
But in one encouraging sign, the four-week moving average for first-time jobless benefit claims dropped to 434,000 in the latest week, a decline of 5,000 from the previous period and its lowest since Nov. 2. Since weekly figures are highly volatile, the average rate is considered a more reliable indicator of trends.

HEADLINE: An S.& L. Is Going Back to Basics

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The savings and loan industry may be putting its notorious past behind it, but the legacy of its headlong rush into deregulation a decade ago continues to haunt some of the nation's largest savings institutions as they scramble to adapt to new regulations and cope with a weak economy.
Nowhere is that scrambling more evident than at GlenFed Inc., the parent of the nation's fourth-largest savings and loan. Considered by many analysts and industry executives to be among the biggest question marks hanging over regulators, GlenFed is virtually reinventing itself in an effort to assure its survival. 
 GlenFed is selling or winding down a host of businesses it entered in the 1980's, including title insurance, retail brokerage and real estate development. Under a plan developed by its vice chairman, Stephen J. Trafton, it has slashed costs more than a third by cutting employment and streamlining its operations, and it has bolstered its reserves for losses on loans.
Having been forced by Federal regulations to focus once again on the traditional savings and loan business of taking deposits and making residential mortgage loans, GlenFed has abandoned its dream of becoming a financial-services powerhouse. Mr. Trafton is instead trying to focus the company on community banking, which he defined as operating in towns and neighborhoods with branches that offer high levels of customer service. The authority to make loans, for example, has been pushed down to the level of the branches, eliminating bureaucratic delays as well as reducing costs.
GlenFed, parent of the Glendale Federal Bank, has 214 branches in California, Washington and Florida.
GlenFed's efforts come when most savings institutions, benefiting from declining interest rates and a renewed focus on their traditional deposit and mortgage businesses, are reporting improved profits. Two of the industry's strongest companies, the Golden West Financial Corporation of Oakland and the Great Western Financial Corporation of Beverly Hills, both in California, this week reported that 1991's earnings were records. H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles, the nation's largest savings company, which owns Home Savings, reported its second-best annual results.
Although rising default rates on home mortgages have led to increases in problem loans, the large losses on commercial real estate that battered results over the last two years have eased. And with almost all of the industry's most spectacular failures having been seized and sold off by the Government, the industry's overall results are showing marked improvement.
 
Fear Has Faded
 Through the first three quarters of last year, the most recent period for which figures are available, the industry's total loss narrowed to $2.6 billion from $9.7 billion in the similar period a year earlier, according to Sheshunoff Information Services Inc. of Austin, Tex., which tracks the industry. Three-quarters of the nation's 2,500 savings institutions were profitable and well capitalized in that period, and most of the losses were accounted for by fewer than 200 ailing companies.
"The amount of terror in the marketplace, the fear reflected in the valuations of the companies, has definitely faded," said Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York. "But while the hysteria is out of their values, I don't see any substantial strengthening on the part of many of these companies."
At GlenFed, there are signs that the overhaul is paying off. GlenFed posted earnings of $20.5 million, or 60 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $113.7 million in the corresponding 1990 period. The improvement came despite the deepening recession in California, which has caused more problems in mortgage loans and a decline in real estate values.
But to many analysts and industry executives, GlenFed's prospects remain unclear. GlenFed currently meets only two of the Government's three standards for financial strength. Although the company said it expected to bring itself back into compliance with the standard by the end of March, it acknowledged that it might fail to meet another new standard for capital strength that regulators are expected to impose soon.
Failure to meet the standards for capital, which is the financial cushion institutions keep to protect against losses, could lead to regulatory restrictions on GlenFed's growth or, in a worst case, seizure by the Government.
GlenFed would like to raise more capital by issuing stock or finding new outside investors. But Wall Street remains wary, especially because regulators have given no clear indication of how they plan to deal with the institution. GlenFed's stock price, which had been driven down to $3 last fall by investors who were worried about the company's ability to survive, has rebounded somewhat but remains far below the $25 level it was trading three years ago. The stock closed today at $6.375, up 50 cents on the Big Board.
"I think the effort that GlenFed has made to date puts them in the survivor camp," said E. Gareth Plank, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "On the other hand, a $6 stock says my opinion is not shared by everyone."
 
Question of Size
 Even if GlenFed and other institutions facing similar situtations can overcome the problems posed by the weak economy and tightening regulation, they still face the question of whether there is a place for any but the largest and strongest savings and loans in an increasingly competitive financial services field.
Bert Ely, an industry consultant based in Alexandria, Va., said it was easy to argue that GlenFed and other institutions in similar positions, like GlenFed'a Los Angeles rivals CalFed Inc. and Coast Savings Financial Inc., were not going to survive. "That doesn't mean they are going to become insolvent, necessarily," he said. "But even if they are able to avoid being seized, I still don't see how they can survive for the long term because their market share is too small."
The view at GlenFed is far different. "There is absolutely a role for a family bank in a community setting," said Mr. Trafton, the GlenFed executive.
Mr. Trafton studied zoology in college but has spent the last 20 years working in the deepest jungles of the financial services industry, helping troubled banks and savings institutions work their way out of problems. When he joined GlenFed from Buffalo-based Goldome a year and a half ago, he was charged by its chairman, Norman M. Coulson, with examining the company from top to bottom and coming up with a vision of what kind of institution it should be and how it should get there.
"We needed to rework and re-engineer the company," Mr. Trafton said.
Mr. Trafton said he did not want to begin simply selling off GlenFed's most profitable loans, a step that other institutions have taken to raise capital, because such a strategy tended to backfire in the long run by leaving a company with a higher proportion of troubled loans.
But he did sell some assets, particularly those that were considered risky under the new regulatory rules. GlenFed also agreed recently to sell $500 million of its home equity loans for an undisclosed price. The company also used one-time gains on the sale of loans and securities to increase its loan-loss reserves.
To reduce costs, Mr. Trafton cut employment by 40 percent over the last 15 months, to 3,800 people. The resulting decline in operating costs -- to $72.7 million for the most recent quarter, 38 percent below the similar period a year earlier -- has helped increase profit margins.
Mr. Trafton said that he was optimistic about the company's future. But with the industry and investors still guessing about both the economy and the severity of future regulatory actions, he said the company still had difficulties to overcome.
"We need more capital, and we are working very hard on that," he said. "But potential investors simply don't know what new capital requirement might be imposed. It's difficult to go to an investor and ask for capital, and then two weeks later have new requirements imposed that put them at risk of having the capital seized."

HEADLINE: Centel Says It's Studying Possible Sale

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Centel Corporation, one of the country's largest non-Bell telephone companies and one of the few large cellular telephone properties not owned by a giant phone company, said yesterday that because of increasing industry consolidation, it might put itself on the auction block.
As recently as Wednesday, the stock market valued Centel at just over $3 billion. But yesterday, reacting to the news, the market bid up the company's share price by $9, to $46, raising Centel's value to nearly $4 billion. 
 Analysts said the company might be worth nearly $5 billion. They cited the potential value of the cellular telephone business, one of the fastest- growing sectors in a telecommunications industry slowed by recession.
Formally, Centel, which is based in Chicago, said simply that it was looking to "enhance shareholder value" and that it had hired Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley & Company, which specialize in mergers and acquisitions, to advise management.
"All we're looking at is strategic alternatives," John P. Frazee Jr., chairman of Centel, said in an interview. "We think the consolidation of the telecommunications industry is inevitable, but we want to manage the process. A sale could be part of that, but I don't want to go into exact details of what we might do." He said there were "absolutely no bids on the table."
Centel's stock was the fourth most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. With the $9 rise in price, Centel's 84.9 million shares are worth $3.9 billion. Marion M. Boucher, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said Centel shares could be worth between $55 and $60 a share, or $4.67 billion to $5.1 billion, but that the maximum price seemed unlikely.
"The market is betting on the unrealized value of the cellular properties," Ms. Boucher said. "There really aren't any cellular properties left on the market, and all of a sudden this one is available."
Because Centel's biggest cellular telephone subscriber areas are in Nevada, Ms. Boucher said, Pacific Telesis, the regional Bell company in nearby San Francisco, is a logical buyer. But she said Bell South, Bell Atlantic and, to a lesser extent, the more cautious Ameritech, were also possible bidders.
And despite their recent large purchases of cellular properties, Ms. Boucher would not rule out GTE and McCaw Cellular, or an aggressive foreign company, like Britain's Cable and Wireless.
 
Steady Phone Earnings
 Centel is attractive because it is the 11th-largest local telephone company and the 10th-largest cellular-telephone company in the country. Local telephone carriers, despite heavy regulation, are attractive investments because of their steady earnings.
Centel has about 1.6 million telephone lines, about as many as Thailand, concentrated mainly in Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. All of its 1990 profits of $47 million on revenue of $1.15 billion came from local phone service.
Centel lost $14.5 million on its cellular operations in 1990, but Mr. Frazee said it made a small profit last year. The cellular telephone industry, after heavy capital expenditures and substantial losses for start-up ventures, is just beginning to break even or earn small profits.
Of the top 10 cellular telephone companies, which cover two-thrids of the population, only Centel's business is not owned by McCaw, GTE or a Bell company. With 16.3 million potential subscribers, Centel dwarfs the rest of the independent cellular providers in the remainder of the top 25 companies.

HEADLINE: Donors in Need Aid Those Even Needier

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Instead of spending more on gifts this holiday season, thousands in the New York region gave more to charity instead, producing a surge of small donations that enabled many charities to reach goals that had seemed out of reach in November.
The deluge of checks for $100 and less defied widespread predictions that the deepening recession and a rising sense of indifference or anger toward the poor would lead to a drop in donations. 
 Instead, officials of some of New York's largest charities now say, the increasing visibility of suffering stirred compassion, often from families facing tighter budgets of their own. The charities see the increase as a tangible sign of an abiding sense of community at a time when some particularly ugly crimes of bias and against children have riveted New York City.
 
'Little Guy Came Through'
 Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York received 31 percent more donations under $75 between September and December 1991 than in the similar 1990 period.
"This was the year the little guy came through," said Msgr. Timothy McDonnell, the charity's chief financial officer. "It shows that when times are tough, New Yorkers are still there to help one another."
United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York raised 10 percent more last December than the year before because the number of small donations rose 20 percent. The Partnership for the Homeless received twice as many donations -- and three times as much money -- from this year's holiday mailing than the year before.
And The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which yesterday surpassed last year's record-setting total, is on a pace to raise 13 percent more money from 11 percent more contributors by the time the appeal ends on Feb. 29.
 
Offsetting Corporate Cutbacks
 Many charities in New York said the increase in individual contributions was especially timely because of declines in corporate and foundation grants. The Partnership for the Homeless reported a 37 percent decline in corporate gifts and an 18 percent decline in foundation grants. The Children's Aid Society received about $100,000 less in major grants this December, but individuals donated $135,000 more.
Telephone interviews with 21 large charities in seven cities suggest that the outpouring was a national trend. Most charities echoed reports from the Salvation Army in Chicago, the American Red Cross in Houston and the Glide-Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco, all of which raised more money from more people.
The Neediest Cases and the independent campaigns run by the seven large charities it supports have so far raised $24.6 million from more than 34,000 donations. In addition, with a third of its campaign complete, the United Way of New York City is about 5 percent ahead of last year's pace, when $72 million was raised.
That more people are in need is clear, but donors said their decision to give was often the outcome of mixed impulses. Some described paring already tight family budgets to make sure there would be enough to give to charity; others talked of balancing anger at the problems that are so visible with the compassion that scenes of suffering produced.
On his way to work each morning, Larry Feldman, of Yonkers, N.Y., drives by dozens of tents set up by the homeless along the Bronx River Parkway. The tableaus of despair intensify as he gets closer to his engineering firm in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx: drug dealers sharing pay phones with addicts and prostitutes, crowds of homeless people huddled near trash bin fires, all oblivious to the cyclones of filthy debris that swirl around them on windy winter days.
At first, Mr. Feldman simply recoiled from these images. "Part of me says: I pay taxes; why do I have to put up with this," he said. "But another part of me says what a tragedy this is."
He finally decided to give $100 to the Neediest Cases Fund. "In the end the part of me that felt bad won out" Mr. Feldman said. "If people like me don't step forward and do something, then how will it ever change?"
 
No Restaurant Meals
 John Descovich, a 35-year-old mechanic for Con Edison, says things are tough for his family even though he has a job. His wife has begun clipping coupons religiously and working more hours at her part-time job. His two small children often wear hand-me-downs provided by his neighbors. He laughed derisively when asked how often he takes his wife out to dinner.
But when his company began its United Way charity drive he pledged money -- $1 a week -- as he has before, and served as an organizer for the first time. "How tough it's been for me made me realize how much worse it must be for a lot of other people," he said. "God knows, I could lose my job someday and be out there with nothing. I hope someone would help me."
 
Anxiety Proves Unfounded
 Many charity officials were anxious in late November -- at the opening of the holiday season that provides most of a year's donations -- when contributions were level or decreasing. Donations to The Children's Aid Society were down 7 percent from a year earlier, and unsolicited gifts to Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn were down 30 percent. As late as Dec. 21, the Neediest Cases was $115,000 behind the previous year's pace; yesterday, it was $546,000 ahead.
In response to early concerns, many groups deployed broader and more sophisticated direct mail efforts.
The Partnership for the Homeless hired an outside firm to prepare its two-page holiday appeal.
Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn -- which has received 67 percent more money from 32 percent more donors this year -- increased its Christmas mailing by 13 percent, sending out 186,000 letters. Patricia McElroy, who headed the campaign, said she also "toned down" the religious nature, replacing the picture of Bishop Thomas V. Daily on the cover with one of the Brooklyn Bridge.
But the focus is always personal.
Since she made her first contribution to the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies in December, Allyson Gail King of Manhattan said she has been able to visit some of the programs her money supports.
"Since I got involved I feel my life is more well-rounded," she said. "I've always known that a lot of people have a hard time in the world, and by giving my time and my money I know I'm helping. It's a great feeling."

HEADLINE: The New Buy-American Auto Sweepstakes

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Maybe it was President Bush's mixed success in Japan, or the Japanese official who said that American auto workers were lazy and illiterate. Maybe it is the deep slump in Detroit. But all of a sudden, companies around the United States are saying it would be good for America to be good to G.M., and they are offering inducements to their employees to buy from General Motors, Chrysler or Ford.
Some, groping to define just what constitutes an American car, are authorizing employees to buy autos made at the Honda plant in Marysville, Ohio, or Nissan's factory in Smyrna, Tenn. But other companies have ruled out cars carrying American nameplates if they are manufactured in Canada or Japan. 
 The incentives to buy American come amid a continuing slump, with auto makers reporting yesterday that sales of cars and light trucks built in the United States fell 1.9 percent in mid-January. [Page D4.]
Yesterday the Monsanto Chemical Company offered its 12,000 employees $1,000 each to buy an American car. Earlier this week, the Tosco Corporation, an oil refining company based in Stamford, Conn., made the same offer, with half the money coming from an executive compensation fund.
Thomas D. O'Malley, the chairman of Tosco, who owns two Mercedes, said he came up with the idea after he told his children that he was thinking of buying a Ford Explorer. His 25-year-old son -- who drives a Mazda -- told his father to look at a Range Rover, an Isuzu and other imports.
"I got mad," Mr. O'Malley said. Young adults, he said, have "been in the syndrome that America makes junk." Besides, he said, if his program induces his employees to buy American, that will keep auto workers employed, and they can buy his gasoline. His program covers only those cars with 90 percent American content.
"I'm no believer in protectionism; I think it's absolute utter nonsense," Mr. O'Malley said. He added, however, that while his company sold gasoline in many other places in the Far East, it could not sell it to Japan.
Some of the buy-American programs are tinged with anti-Japanese sentiment. Even though other countries send cars to the United States, only Japan seems to be viewed as a threat.
Companies offering incentives are ambivalent about American branches of Japanese companies. James H. Gill, a Detroit-based spokesman for Nissan, pointed out that his company and Ford would soon start producing a compact family van from a factory near Cleveland. All the vans will come off the same assembly line and be produced by the same workers, he said, but some will be labeled Nissan Quests while others will receive the Ford Villager nameplate.
Under some of the new corporate incentive programs, the Villagers would qualify and the Quests would not, said Mr. Gill, who added that Nissan employed more than 60,000 Americans.
 
Storm? No. Prizm? Yes.
 At the company that says it started the subsidy movement, the Brown Paper Company of Greenwich, Conn., Douglas G. Brown, the owner, specified that the car must come from a plant that was at least half-owned by General Motors, Ford or Chrysler.
"One of the gals here was looking at a Geo Storm, and I told her N.G.," Mr. Brown said, because that car is imported from Japan even though it bears a General Motors emblem. But should she cast her eye on a Geo Prizm, he indicated, she'd be in the money: the car is made by Nummi Motors in California, a 50-50 venture of General Motors and Toyota.
Mr. Brown, who has been driving Audis for the last 10 years, is offering each of his 45 employees $1,000 to put themselves behind the wheel of a new American car. Shopping for a new model himself, he compared the Cadillac with a Lexus LS 400, an Acura Legend LS and an Audi V-6. He liked the American candidate.
 
'It's Not Japan Bashing'

 "Some cars out there are certainly worth a look," he said, "but the attitude of the average American is, 'I'm not going to look at an American car.' " Simply getting Americans into the showroom will be a good start, he said, adding that it is up to United States businesses to provide the nudge.
At St. Louis-based Monsanto Chemical, the president, Robert G. Potter, announced "Project Get Rolling," yesterday, saying: "We're a major supplier of plastics, rubber chemicals, resins, fibers and other performance products to the North American auto industry. So, it's in our interest that the auto industry be healthy." The Get Rolling incentive covers any vehicle built in North America.
Near the buckle of the Auto Belt, meanwhile, the Franklin Savings Bank of Southfield, Mich., is also offering its employees, and the employees of all the companies carrying commercial accounts with Franklin, checks for $100 if they get rolling in a new American model. Buying an import, said Rebecca J. Christian, senior vice president for communications and marketing at Franklin Savings, is "like buying Girl Scout cookies from the little girl next door and not from your own daughter."
"It's not Japan bashing," she said. "It's supporting your own economy."
The subsidies do not sit well with some industry officials, including Gregory Dana, a spokesman for the Association of International Auto Manufacturers, a Washington group that represents all the major importers except Mercedes. "The capitalist society we live in says to allow consumer choice, and we think that's the way it ought to work," he said. "It seems to me, if American cars aren't selling, there's a reason."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Omnicom Group to Acquire Goodby, Berlin

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
In an ambitious expansion effort, Omnicom Group Inc. announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy thestock that it did not already own in Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, a fast-growing advertising agency with a reputation for brash creativity .
Omnicom, the world's fourth-largest advertising group and owner of BBDO Worldwide and DDB Needham Worldwide, intends to expand Goodby, Berlin, which is based in San Francisco, into a national operation that is expected to become its third agency network. 
 Omnicom's plans call for Goodby, Berlin, a midsized agency with about $250 million in billings, to open an office in New York sometime this year. Then, in all likelihood, it would expand overseas. If those plans pan out, Omnicom's three networks would match the number operated by two other global advertising giants, the Interpublic Group of Companies and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C.
"The other two big networks we own are driven by advertising people who have creative backgrounds," said Bruce Crawford, chairman and chief executive of Omnicom in New York. "Goodby, Berlin just fits in very well with us."
Goodby, Berlin was named agency of the year for 1989 by Advertising Age, which praised its work for "unexpected freshness, typically accomplished with wit and warmth." The agency recently opened an office in Los Angeles to handle its largest and newest account, American Isuzu Motors.
Goodby, Berlin has rocketed to prominence since it was founded in 1983 by three men who had been co-workers at Hal Riney & Partners in San Francisco. It has become known for audacious, attention-getting ads like its television commercials for The San Francisco Examiner, in which the newspaper's publisher, William Randolph Hearst 3d, stood up to the ghost of his legendary grandfather.
Omnicom "wants the same thing we want," Andy Berlin, a principal and co-founder of Goodby, Berlin, said in a telephone interview, "which is to make of Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, with their substantial resources, first a substantial national agency and then an international agency."
"I think you'll see in the course of the next year some bold and imaginative steps," added Mr. Berlin, who is likely to head the new New York office."
Such steps, comparable in their own way to the decision by General Motors to create the Saturn division to augment its five existing car lines, would be a challenge even during good times. But during an industrywide recession, it is nothing short of daunting.
"I'm an optimist, as opposed to some of the people who are whining a great deal," Mr. Crawford said, noting that the Goodby, Berlin purchase is the latest in a string for Omnicom that includes McKim Advertising, an advertising agency in Toronto, and the Boase Massimi Pollitt Partnership in London, an agency that had owned a 37.5 percent stake in Goodby, Berlin.
Mr. Berlin said he shared Mr. Crawford's perspective, adding, "At a time when clients are willing to move their accounts, the status quo might be as risky, if not more so, than change."
Agency companies like Omnicom, Interpublic and Saatchi have configured their agencies as independent, separate networks to attract, and retain, as many clients as possible, by allieviating potential client conflicts. Interpublic's three networks are Lintas Worldwide, the Lowe Group and McCann-Erickson; Saatchi's are Backer Spielvogel Bates, Campbell-Mithun-Esty and Saatchi & Saatchi.
The agency executives reassure clients that like parallel lines the networks never meet, so competitive strategies are safe from rival agencies. For instance, BBDO creates advertising for Chrysler's Dodge division, while DDB Needham handles Audi of America and Volkswagen of America.
"We've set it up so one has nothing to do with the other," Mr. Crawford said. Omnicom was formed in 1986 when three large agencies -- BBDO International, Doyle Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper Worldwide -- unexpectedly announced their amalgamation, under which BBDO remained separate, while Doyle Dane and Needham combined to form DDB Needham.
Already, Mr. Berlin said he was looking forward to battling BBDO and DDB Needham, anticipating that they will be "quite competitive" to Goodby, Berlin, particularly in New York. And, he added, the terms of the acquisition "give us all the independence and self-determination they have."
Mr. Crawford called it "premature to be talking about a third network." But, he said, "we're planning on expansion, no question about that."
While Goodby, Berlin's name might not now be a global advertising catch phrase, the agency has enjoyed a skein of American account victories that included The New Yorker, an image campaign for the National Basketball Association, the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain, various wine and liquor brands of Heublein Inc., and the Royal Viking Line.
That spate of billings gains was capped in August, when it was awarded the creative portion of American Isuzu's $90 million account in a fiercely competitive review.
Goodby, Berlin's first work for Isuzu, a television commercial to promote buyer incentives on the Rodeo sport-utility vehicle, began running earlier this week. The 30-second spot will also be seen during CBS's telecast of Super Bowl XXVI on Sunday. Typical Goodby, Berlin touches are evident in the spot, in which an unseen narrator, Mr. Berlin himself, discusses how the money to be saved by buying a Rodeo would enable consumers to afford other "stuff" like argyle socks and compact disks.
The transaction announced yesterday involves an agreement in principle by Omnicom to buy the remaining 62.5 percent of Goodby, Berlin's stock from the agency's four top executives, who will sign employment contracts. Three are the co-founders: Jeff Goodby, 40 years old; Mr. Berlin, 41, and Rich Silverstein, 42. The fourth is Colin Probert, 44, who became president in 1989.
In 1990, the last full year for which figures are available, Omnicom ranked fourth in both worldwide billings, at $9.7 billion, and worldwide gross income, at $1.34 billion.

HEADLINE: Ex-Officer Found Guilty of $17,000 Bank Fraud

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Jan. 23

 BODY:
After deliberating for less than an hour, a Federal jury today found Robert C. Fioretti, a former New York City police officer, guilty of stealing $17,000 from his first wife's savings account in 1986, two months after she vanished.
Mr. Fioretti, who is still the major suspect in the disappearance, sat motionless and stared blankly at the jury as the foreman read the guilty verdict. 
 The prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney Charles Rose, immediately moved to have Mr. Fioretti remanded to Federal prison. He told Judge Leonard D. Wexler that a witness had come forward and told the Government that Mr. Fioretti had confessed to killing his first wife, Rita, and that he would flee at the first opportunity.
Mr. Rose said the witness, who he declined to name in open court, had shared a prison cell with Mr. Fioretti a year ago.
Judge Wexler remanded Mr. Fioretti to the Federal Correction Center in lower Manhattan pending the outcome of a further hearing on Mr. Rose's request on Monday.
 
'Cut and Dried'
 Mr. Fioretti's lawyer, Michael Soroka, argued that his client should remain free on bond and noted that he wore an electronic anklet, was limited to house arrest and had never missed a court appearance.
The jurors in the bank fraud trial said on leaving the courthouse this afternoon that they had carefully reviewed all of the evidence in the case against Mr. Fioretti and had reached a unanimous verdict on their first vote.
"It was cut and dried," said Laurie Schiavetta, 23 years old, of Selden, L.I. "After viewing the evidence, we had no doubts."
Another juror, Jennifer Corbett, 24, of Huntington, L.I., said the jurors "had a lunch, ripped little pieces of paper up for an informal ballot and found we all agreed, without a doubt, that he was guilty." The jurors deliberated for 45 minutes.
Mr. Fioretti was charged with forging his 33-year-old first wife's signature on two bank withdrawal slips and with illegally removing more than $17,000 from her savings account. He then deposited the money in another account he jointly shared with his second wife, Maureen Brooks, with whom he had lived and whom he married a few weeks after the disappearance of Rita Fioretti.
Mr. Fioretti was dismissed by the New York City Police Department in 1990 when he was charged with bank fraud. He has remained unemployed since then and has served nearly two years in prison awaiting trial. He now faces a 35-year prison term for his bank fraud conviction. No date has been set for sentencing.
He has never been charged in connection with the disappearance of his 33-year-old first wife. But he is to go on trial again in late February in State Supreme Court in the Bronx on charges of sexually assaulting his present wife's 12- and 13-year-old daughters and raping one of them in 1988 and 1989.
Both daughters and a third girl born to Ms. Brooks two months after she married Mr. Fioretti are now living with the father of the two older girls in upstate New York, law-enforcement officials said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Before Meeting; Gold Prices Fall Somewhat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher against key currencies yesterday, strengthening largely on the uncertain outcome of a weekend meeting in New York by the finance ministers of the Group of Seven nations.
Gold prices weakened. At the Republic National Bank of New York, bullion fetched $354.60 an ounce as of 4 P.M., off $2.90 from Wednesday. At the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fetched $354.60 an ounce, off $3.30 from Wednesday. 
 Foreign exchange traders said the dollar's value rose out of concern that the financial emissaries from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, conferring on Saturday, would not directly address the question of what their currencies should be worth relative to each other.
Up until recently, many traders had expected the group would seek to promote world economic growth, particularly in the United States, by allowing the dollar to weaken versus the Japanese yen. They had sold the dollar partly on that expectation and hedged themselves yesterday by buying dollars.
John Lyman, a trader at the New York branch of the Bank of Tokyo, said the dollar also rose yesterday because of new weakness in the German mark, which stems from evidence that Germany's economy is deteriorating.
"There's a widely held feeling that the dollar's worth against the mark has bottomed, at least for the short term, so mark sales are occurring," Mr. Lyman said. "The market has got a whiff of recession in the air in Germany."
Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical Bank in New York, said the dollar also strengthened because of the timing of the Group of Seven meeting. The ministers are expected to release a communique late Saturday, when foreign exchange markets are closed. Many currency strategists protectively bought dollars, figuring that was less risky if there were any surprises in the communique.
"Everyone is very skittish," Mr. Perkins said. "You can't trade on the news" from the Group of Seven meeting.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 123.23 Japanese yen, from 123.34 yen on Wednesday. But later, in London, it rose to 123.85 yen. By the close of trading in New York, the dollar fetched 123.80 yen, up from 123.38 yen on Wednesday.
In London the British pound fell to $1.7960, from $1.8050 late on Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.7850, cheaper than its $1.8055 value late on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York versus those of late Wednesday included: 1.6064 marks, up from 1.5905; 1.4260 Swiss francs, up from 1.4090; 1.1596 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1556; 5.4780 French francs, up from 5.4210, and 1,209.25 Italian lire, up from 1,195.50.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term U.S. Issues Off Steeply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell sharply and long-term interest rates rose further yesterday, as anxiety mounted among credit market participants about the coming battle in Washington over fiscal policy.
Traders and analysts said the sell off had nothing to do with underlying economic fundamentals, which remain positive for bonds. 
 In that vein, automobile manufacturers reported that annual sales of new cars rose slightly, to a still-anemic 5.7 million units, during the middle 10 days of January.
"Car sales are very soft, and the fundamentals still dictate lower interest rates," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But right now the market is getting chopped to bits."
Prices of bonds and long-term notes took the brunt of the beating, but prices of shorter-term securities also moved lower, with most of the drop occurring after the Treasury announced the results of a five-year note sale.
 
Yields Up on 5-Year Notes
 At the auction, the $9.25 billion worth of securities were sold at an average yield of 6.28 percent, up from the 6.24 percent average yield at the last five-year note sale on Dec. 19.
The price of the issue eroded after the results were announced, and by late in the day the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.39 percent.
With the Federal Reserve Board seen as more likely to reduce short-term rates than to raise them in the foreseeable future, traders said the rise in short- to intermediate-term yields should generate some demand. But bonds are another matter, they added.
"I like the market, especially maturities of five years or less," one Government securities trader said. "But unless you can tell me what Bush is going to say next week, I won't go near bonds. And our clients won't touch them either."
Worries about whether Congress and the Bush Administration will concoct an overly stimulative package of tax cuts and other measures have been bubbling in the credit markets for months.
 
Waiting for the President
 Those concerns have mounted this week, since the President is expected to present his blueprint for recovery in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Given the market's uncertain, nervous state, a report from the Federal Reserve Board yesterday showing that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose by huge amounts in the week ended Jan. 13 compounded the pressure to sell securities.
The rise was bigger than most analysts had expected, especially a huge $37.3 billion increase in M-3, the broadest money measure.
But analysts said the big increases, coming on the heels of recent big declines, had more to do with year-end technical factors than anything else, and were not likely to have any policy significance for the Fed.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 103 1/4, down 1 1/8 points, to yield 7.71 percent, compared with 7.62 percent late Wednesday. Earlier this month, yields on long-term bonds were just under 7.40 percent.
 
Full-Point Declines
 Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year securities were offered at 101 7/8, down a full point, to yield 7.22 percent. And the new 4 7/8 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.12 percent, compared with 4.96 percent late Wednesday.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.78 percent, up 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 7 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.88 percent.
The rise in interest rates slowed, at least temporarily, the number of new issues priced in the corporate debt market. Two large issues were priced, however.
 
New Corporate Issues
 The General Motors Assistance Corporation offered $1.8 billion worth of securities backed by auto loan receivables through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 5.05 percent securities, which have an average expected life of 1.17 years, carry a final maturity of Jan. 15, 1997. They were priced at $99.883 to yield 5.21 percent, 1.10 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the bond equivalent yield of one-year Treasury bills.
The securitites are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for a $500 million offering of 10-year securities for Korea Development Bank.
The 7.90 percent notes were priced at $98.605 to yield 8.106 percent, 98 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-1 by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's.
The big drop in Treasury prices contributed to a drop in prices of outstanding corporate and tax-exempt bonds. Corporate traders said prices of most issues had fallen by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
And participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said most widely quoted bonds dropped by around 3/8 point.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Conservative Plea To Aid Ex-Soviets

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AID to the former Soviet republics has become an ideological issue in this country, pitting those who say the United States and its partners should move rapidly and generously to provide assistance against those who would wait for them to collapse. Favoring large-scale aid, according to the oversimplified version, are liberals, pragmatists and internationalists, and on the side opposing aid, at least until authoritarian structures are destroyed, root and branch, are conservatives, supply-siders and America Firsters.
But Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German Bundesbank, celebrated as a conservative and anti-inflationist around the world, strongly supports Western aid for the Commonwealth of Independent States. Calling the Commonwealth a "fragile construction," Dr. Schlesinger said last week that "the Western part of the world must help to stabilize these young states economically, with the goal of stabilizing them politically as well." He said "huge transfers of capital and know-how" would be necessary. 
 In a speech to the American Council on Germany in New York, he said investment in the new countries "will probably yield a high social return and contribute to a new order of peace, from which "all our economies will benefit." He urged the Western countries to "face up to these challenges in our own interest." The 47 nations attending the Washington aid conference, assembled by the United States, fell well short of that objective.
Economic policy makers, Dr. Schlesinger said, would have to cope with "a huge problem for years to come -- namely a worldwide capital shortage." Demands for capital are rising in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, the third world and the industrial countries as well, at a time when capital is being choked off by the decline in national savings, high budget deficits, and the weakneses of the world banking system. The sluggish growth of the world economy is both a consequence and a cause of the global capital shortage.
Germany itself is short of capital to help other countries. Dr. Schlesinger said public transfers from western to eastern Germany last year amounted to 140 billion marks ($87.5 billion at the current rate of exchange), or more than 5 percent of western German gross domestic product, and this year would exceed 170 billion marks.
By comparison, the aid proposed for the Commonwealth countries looks very small. Champions of Western aid are calling for total amounts ranging up to $30 billion a year. For the Commonwealth, with a population 15 times as large as eastern Germany's, that translates into less than $100 per capita, versus $5,000 in eastern Germany.
But capital transfers alone will not be enough to rescue the republics; they will also need technical help and organizational support from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Dr. Schlesinger said. He singled out the I.M.F. for praise, saying it had been more "neutral" than national governments, "which always tend to couple their own assistance with internal economic problems."
At a time when growth is crucial to both East and West, as well as the third world, is not Germany doing just that -- focusing on its own problems to the neglect of those of its European partners, the United States and the world economy?
On Dec. 19, the Bundesbank raised its discount rate and Lombard rate one-half of 1 percent to curb inflation as the Federal Reserve was moving to cut its discount rate by a full 1 percent to spur economic growth.
Dr. Schlesinger said in an interview that he had not opposed the half-point rise in the discount rate but had favored only a quarter-point rise in the Lombard rate. This dissent, he said, was "not very important," and the money market had corroborated his judgment that a smaller increase in the Lombard rate would have been enough.
But he defended the overall policy as necessary to prevent "an acceleration of inflation, an acceleration of the money supply and an acceleration in the demand for credit."
Yet, his tone was conciliatory toward the Bundesbank's critics in Europe and America, concerned about recession. He said that "the German priority is always given to price stability" but that the Bundesbank believed in flexibility; as inflation came down, interest rates would come down. He added that he thought "the world economy can still grow in the coming year," and there was "no cause for a new round of inflation."
With his concerns about the need to overcome the world capital shortage to help Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth, as well as the third world, he said he was in complete agreement with the conclusion reached by the Group of Seven major industrial countries in Bangkok, Thailand, stressing the importance of "strengthening global savings, substantial reductions in high budget deficits, and the need to curb unproductive expenditures."
Does this hold for the United States now? "It is not my task to give advice to any other country," Dr. Schlesinger said.

HEADLINE: $187.6 Million Loss Posted By Delta Air

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines said today that losses for the last three months of 1991 were $187.6 million, an improvement over its results a year earlier, when airlines were hit by high fuel prices and sluggish demand. In the previous year's period, Delta lost $207.8 million.
The nation's third-largest airline said it lost $239.5 million for all of the calendar year 1991, when the carrier underwent a major expansion that included the purchase of primary Pan American World Airways assets. 
 Atlanta-based Delta said costs related to the Pan Am deal, a weak economy and the decline in passenger travel that followed the Persian Gulf war had all contributed to its recent losses.
The airline industry as a whole was pounded hard in 1991 and is expected to show a loss of some $2 billion for the year.
Revenues for the recent period, Delta's second fiscal quarter, were $2.62 billion, compared with $2.13 billion a year earlier.
For the first six months of its fiscal year, Delta lost $174.5 million, compared with a loss of $259.4 million, on revenues of $4.3 billion.
In New York Stock Exchange trading today, Delta shares were off $1.125 to close at $73.125.
Delta said it took a $50 million write-off in the October-December quarter for costs related to its participation in Pan Am's failed attempt to reorganize as a smaller carrier. Delta's withdrawal from that effort was blamed by some for Pan Am's demise, although Delta said it had determined that pumping more money into Pan Am would not be enough to save the troubled carrier.
Thomas J. Roeck Jr., Delta's chief financial officer, said he was encouraged by declining fuel prices and a "more rational" pricing structure recently in the industry. But his outlook for 1992 was pessimistic.
"Continued soft economic conditions, unacceptably high unit-cost growth plaguing the industry and the cost of initiating service on the newly acquired routes," he said, "are expected to have a negative effect on Delta's fiscal 1992 results."

HEADLINE: Clorox Profit Is Up by 24%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Clorox Company said today that profit for its second quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 24 percent despite continued weakness in the economy and a substantial increase in spending to introduce new products.
The consumer products company reported earnings of $25.3 million, or 47 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31. Clorox earned $20.4 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Sales rose 5.3 percent, to $351.6 million from $333.9 million.
Clorox said profits were helped by elimination of losses from the detergent business, which the company left last year, higher shipments and a reduction in manufacturing costs.
In addition, costs associated with the 1990 acquisition of Pine-Sol cleaner and Combat insecticide lines had less effect on second-quarter earnings than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
Charles R. Weaver, chairman and chief executive, said Clorox was putting more emphasis on new products. The company plans to introduce a scoopable cat litter and a new Hidden Valley Ranch dressing in the next few months.
Clorox shares closed today at $43.75, up $1.875, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: A Large Loss For Tandem

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 23

 BODY:
Tandem Computers Inc. today announced a large first-quarter loss after taking a $98 million restructuring charge in an attempt to pare its operations and become more competitive.
The company, which makes "fault tolerant" computers with redundant parts to prevent crashes, reported a loss of $94.6 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31. That compares with net income of $7 million, or 7 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Revenues for the first quarter of the 1992 fiscal yearincreased slightly, however, rising 2 percent, to $454.5 million, from $443.8 million in the corresponding period a year earlier, the company said.
Tandem's president and chief executive, James Treybig, said the first-quarter revenues were below what the Cupertino-based company expected, even in light of the industry recession and typically slow year-end sales. But the news was not all bad, he said.
"Although revenues were disappointing, there were some positive notes to the quarter," Mr. Treybig said. "Year-over-year revenue growth in the United States improved for the second consecutive quarter. Worldwide, our business in the communications industry grew to approximately 25 percent of first-quarter revenues."
The company's stock closed today at $12.50, down 75 cents, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Approval of Japanese Bid to Buy Mariners Unlikely

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Last year two of the Yankees' limited partners were looking to sell their shares of the club and were approached by some Japanese businessmen.
"They inquired with our office what our policy was on non-North American ownership," Steve Greenberg, baseball's deputy commissioner, said. "They were told what the policy was and that's the last I heard of it." 
 The Yankees' partners, Jack Satter and Harvey Leighton, did not sell their shares to the Japanese, or anyone else for that matter, and it's highly unlikely that the Seattle Mariners will be sold to a combined Japanese-American group that would put a major league team under control of a Japanese owner for the first time.
The Yamauchi family of Tokyo, proprietors of Nintendo of America, which is based in the Seattle area, announced a proposal yesterday to join some Seattle businessmen in buying the Mariners for $100 million. Minoru Arakawa, the son-in-law of the Nintendo founder, Hiroshi Yamauchi, is president of Nintendo of America and has lived in the Seattle area for 15 years. His family would own 60 percent of the Mariners.
 
Vincent Douses Some Cold Water
 The offer brought a quick splash of cold water from Commissioner Fay Vincent.
"Baseball," Vincent said in a statement, "has addressed the issue of ownership of its franchises and has developed a strong policy against approving investors from outside the United States and Canada. It is unlikely foreign investors would receive the requisite baseball approvals."
If nothing else, Vincent's position is similar to the stance adopted by Japanese baseball officials, who have told their American counterparts that they would not permit Americans to own Japanese teams.
Two minor league teams, Birmingham (Ala.) of the Southern League and Salinas of the California League, are owned by Japanese interests, but ownership of minor league teams is not subject to major league approval.
The commissioner, the eight-owner ownership committee and the owners of all 26 clubs, in separate league votes, would have to approve the sale of the Mariners. Fred Kuhlmann of the St. Louis Cardinals, the ownership committee chairman, said the committee planned to have a telephone conference call today to discuss the matter. He declined comment pending the discussion.
 
'It's Not Anything New'
 "We've discussed it before," he said by telephone from St. Louis. "It's not anything new to us or something we haven't given a lot of attention to."
The committee's view would presumably match the commissioner's, which means the Japanese group won't get very far. If such a stance would ever be unpopular with the American public generally or baseball fans specifically, this is the time.
On Wednesday, for example, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, by unanimous vote, canceled a $122 million rail car contract with a Japanese company that had won the contract over an Idaho company.
Yet the Japanese interest in the Mariners comes with a political involvement. Slade Gorton, one of the Washington State's two United States Senators, is eager to keep the Mariners in Seattle and has, in past discussions about the team's status, suggested an assault on baseball's antitrust exemption if baseball officials allowed the team to move elsewhere.
There could be times in the future when, under different circumstances, the commissioner and the club owners would be concerned about a threat to baseball's exemption. But they aren't very likely to take a threat seriously now, knowing the existing political and economic climate as it is.
Gorton also suggested yesterday that it would be hypocritical for major league baseball to refuse Japanese interests ownership when Canadians are permitted to own teams. The difference, of course, is that the Canadian owners own teams in their own cities. The residence of Arakawa notwithstanding, owners would still view the matter as Japanese interests owning a team in the United States.
 
Owners May Show Reluctance
 Owners would be reluctant to let Japanese businesses into their club for another reason. With those businesses having so much money available -- the Nintendo people said they had $25 million ready to use beyond the $100 million purchase price to shore up the franchise -- existing owners would fear that the Japanese owners would gobble up the most attractive free agents with lavish offers and would pay such high salaries that they would escalate the salary scale even significantly higher than it is now.
On the other hand, Japanese entry into American baseball could create a new market for the major leagues. An American team with Japanese ownership could create intense interest in Japan, which could translate into a lucrative new television and licensing market.
Seattle has not been a good market for a baseball team. The Pilots failed there in 1969, and the Mariners have struggled for 15 years. The Mariners finally broke the 2 million barrier in home attendance last season after having averaged barely over a million fans per season in their first 14 years.
Jeff Smulyan, the team's owner, would ideally like to move the team to Tampa-St. Petersburg area, whose vacant domed stadium eagerly awaits a major league team. Smulyan went so far as to meet secretly with St. Petersburg officials earlier this month and now faces disciplinary action by the commissioner for his nonapproved venture.
At the same time, the city of Seattle faces its second loss of a major league team if Smulyan cannot find an owner by March 27. Vincent is not eager to see a move by the Mariners, but he evidently is less eager to see an incursion of Japanese ownership.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Thanking Sakurauchi

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The Japanese -- some of them are beginning to get under our skin. I'm thinking now of that politician who said that American workers are lazy and a third of them couldn't read.
Lazy? American men and women line up to get work -- sometimes thousands waiting in the cold for too few jobs at too little money. American workers can still outproduce Japanese person for person. American industry, working people and servicemen did not seem all that lazy by the time World War II ended. 
 As for Japanese executives, when I was a reporter in Japan, they never seemed to work harder than American business people I knew at home.
Often Japanese executives outnumbered the desks. By 6 P.M. the executives were in their company cars heading home -- the long way home, via bars and restaurants where they boozed, ate and fondled on the company expense account. American auditors would have daily heart attacks in Tokyo.
So take that, Mr. Yoshio Sakurauchi, Speaker of the lower house of Parliament. I am hardly a Japan-basher, usually the contrary. But take your caricature of Americans, I thought, and pour it in your sake cup!
But just as I was working up a good head of indignation the thought struck me that the man was half right -- the literacy half -- and maybe we should thank him instead of wallowing in defensiveness.
About 5 percent of the young-adult population is totally illiterate, not a third. But that is not comforting once you take a look at Table 368 of the Department of Education's 1991 statistical digest. The literacy skills that prevent people from drowning economically in modern society are held by only a minority of Americans between 21 and 25.
Only 20 percent can use bus timetables, which means they could not follow work manuals. Only 22.5 percent can figure out the percentage of a restaurant tip, which I suppose means the others could not even earn it. Forty-four percent cannot locate information in an almanac or news story; would you hire one of them for a clerical job in any communications or financial company?
Diane Ravitch, an outstanding Assistant Secretary of Education, says achievement trends in academic progress have been "essentially flat for the past 20 years." In a world ever more demanding for workers, flat means down. Ms. Ravitch writes plainly enough for anybody to read: What was good enough 20 years ago isn't anymore.
Who is to blame? People who know the field say that Bush has been great in fighting for modern literacy -- Barbara Bush. If her husband has become the education President, I am indeed the King of Saudi Arabia. But what President in the past 20 years has done the education job right, which Congress or big city?
We can of course simply blame root causes for destroying the "learning environment" -- guns, poverty, race, drugs, drink, schoolyard crime, teen-age pregnancy, and forcing schools to substitute for jailers, parents, cops, preachers and epidemiologists, instead of teaching.
But without follow-up action, that would leave American work, literacy and education where it is now -- and Mr. Sakurauchi having a good chuckle with his parliamentary pals.
We will have to pay for action -- with more money if necessary, and lots no doubt will be needed. At a time when we need more school computers, some teachers are themselves paying for classroom pencils; a shame for us all. We need more therapeutic communities to handle drug-ridden children, and police to sweep human garbage from schoolyards.
Parents will have to pay with constant attention to their children's schools and their children's work.
Private citizens and business will have to pay for marketable literacy with volunteer time and devotion -- as in New York do Elizabeth Rohatyn, Parker Ladd, the publishing executive, the columnist Liz Smith, the business executive Saul Steinberg and Gayfryd Steinberg, the members of the New York Public Library board and people like them in cities everywhere -- but not enough people.
No one thing -- taxpayers, volunteers, teachers, parental attention, business, politicians -- will fix our school system. But put them together and you have the formula of Japanese educational success -- which the U.S. can achieve as well and maybe a bit better, Mr. Speaker.

HEADLINE: On Any Given Sunday, Try Reading a Book

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
I don't care what the President said, there are at least 10 good reasons for not banning football, all of them on display this weekend.
 1. CIVIC PRIDE: Buffalo, we are told, is gripped by a Bills Bedlam as invigorating as the Mets Mania of 1969, which convinced New Yorkers that their health, educational and safety services would improve as dramatically as did their team. If the Bills win, Buffalo will be saved, as was New York City. It's a lot of pressure, especially for two players: Scott Norwood, the kicker, who should take the blame for plunging Buffalo into economic recession last year by missing a Super Bowl field goal that would have beaten the Giants; and Bruce Smith, the defensive end, who might have incited riots this week by threatening to leave town because of racist mail from fans who accused him of malingering after a knee injury. 
2. MEDICAL RESEARCH: Pro football has done for bone stress what the space program did for metal fatigue. Shoulders, hips, knees, you wreck 'em and the team docs will solder 'em so you can get right back on the field, even if it means permanent damage. According to a Ball State University study, two-thirds of all N.F.L. players who played after 1970 had some sort of debilitating injury when they retired. Another study concluded that midcentury pro players died 12 years earlier than did their nonplaying cohorts.
 3. DRUG STORIES: By the late Sixties, Olympic athletes knew more about chemicals than most doctors, but it took those bighearted, book-writing football players to tell us how big and strong and sexy you can get on steroids, how good you can feel on cocaine and how booze enlivens an orgy. And then, just before publication, they all had the strength to Just Say No!
 4. NATIONAL SECURITY: No more cheap shots at Bill Parcells for lying on television about his Tampa Bay dealings. He proves that football is a mental game, too. Think of what would happen if there was no football, and a smart, tough guy like Bill had to go into government, start shuttling from the White House to a defense corporation to "Nightline" analysis, always looking out for the next job. Aren't you glad he's taking care of business in football?
 5. HISTORY LESSON: After Florida State and the Atlanta Braves and the Kansas City Chiefs got Tomahawk Chopped, only the Washington Redskins remained to remind us that Columbus discovered America, not Crazy Horse. I have gotten more hate mail than Bruce Smith this year from people who think Indians should "lighten up." Tell them yourself. Demonstrators from the American Indian Law Alliance, the American Indian Community House and the Solidarity Foundation will be outside the CBS Building on 52d Street today at 5 P.M. in support of groups demonstrating in Minneapolis.
 6. FRAT HOUSE PHILOSOPHY: Is football a preparation for war, a moral equivalent to war, a safety valve, bread and circuses, opiate for the masses? Do those snuff-cute cassettes from N.F.L. Films -- "Ten Best Non-Fatal Injuries of '91", "Green Bay Splatter and Spleen", "Knees: Snap, Crackle and Pop" -- make people passive, aggressive, thirsty? How would a Japanese quarterback affect our national self-esteem? These dissertation-level questions allow intellectuals to watch football without worrying that they should be reading instead.
 7. MEN ON MEN: Watch the game so you'll know when to switch to Fox for the halftime counterprogram from those "In Living Color" clowns. Maybe they'll be able to get beyond the Frat House Philosophy and talk about why domestic violence increases on Super Sunday. Based on anecdotal evidence, it's the busiest day for abuse hot lines and battered women's shelters. Dr. Lenore Walker of Denver says, "Fans see athletes get away with violent behavior." This seems to give losers permission to act out their alcohol-driven angst.
 8. STUFF: My official N.F.L. gift catalogue, a kind of Victor's Secret, has "skin thin" receiver gloves ($39.95), half-liter porcelain hofbrau steins ($49.95), red rubber workout jackets (47.95) and best of all, a "Tear-Apart N.F.L. Stress Doll" ($24.95), made in China and available in the uniform of your favorite team. The box says "calm down by ripping off his head." His arms and legs also rip off, too, thanks to Velcro. The doll is not anatomically complete.
 9. CHURN: Like lawyers and stockbrokers, sportswriters feed on the "churn," the unnecessary business that generates more business; lawyers sue to draw suits, brokers buy and sell to pile up commissions. For us, churning means reports that can then be refuted or explicated, sometimes both at the same time. Because we are the Lost Boys of literature, there is nothing like the Neverland of Super Bowl week to keep us crowing. If you're still reading this, you know exactly what I mean. Or ask Bill.
 Hey. That's only nine good reasons for not banning football. If I can't come up with one more, President Theodore Roosevelt may have his way after all.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
BUSH CAMP RENEWS STRATEGY DEBATE

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Bush campaign today made public a television commercial apologizing to New Hampshire voters for their economic pain, but at the White House a renewed debate broke out over the general tone of President Bush's re-election campaign.
The discussion of whether Mr. Bush should be conciliatory or combative in his State of the Union Message next Tuesday began Thursday night when his two top political aides, Samuel K. Skinner, the White House chief of staff, and Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, summoned about 20 Republicans to a strategy session.
 
No Change in Program
 Bush aides have been saying all week that the address to Congress would kick off the election effort by offering Mr. Bush's plan to fix the economy. But Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter found themselves bombarded with demands that Mr. Bush also use his speech to declare war on the Democrats in Congress. 
 Today, White House officials said the program to be unveiled in the speech, including higher tax deductions for dependent children and a lower tax on profits from investments, would remain the same. But they were considering warnings from the Republicans that it was silly for the President to try to strike a statesmanlike attitude toward the opposition party in an election year.
The meeting and the release of the new commercial marked the latest White House effort to find powerful themes and a coherent approach for a sputtering campaign for which Mr. Bush has not yet officially announced his candidacy.
As part of that effort, Mr. Skinner has been reorganizing the White House staff, and officials said he told his aides tonight that he had chosen Henson Moore, a former Louisiana Congressman who is now the Deputy Energy Secretary, to be his deputy chief of staff. Mr. Moore will replace Andrew H. Card Jr., who was designated on Thursday to be the new Transportation Secretary.
 
Reviving Maladroit Trip
 The commercial uses videotape from a New Hampshire campaign trip last week that was regarded inside and outside the Bush camp as politically maladroit. Mr. Bush admitted that he had failed to realize the economy was in "freefall" and gave New Hampshire voters an assurance, "Message: I care."
Some Administration officials and Republican strategists said the White House still seemed to be struggling to dispel its aura of uncertainty and that the new commercial, entitled "Determination" by Mr. Bush's campaign advertising group, would do little to help because it revived the "I'm sorry" tone of the visit by Mr. Bush last week.
In the Administration, some officials continued to urge Mr. Bush to hold his fire with Congress and to take a conciliatory, bipartisan stand in the State of the Union Message in the hope of winning passage for his economic growth package.
But on Capitol Hill, where reports circulated that Mr. Bush would ask for passage of a tax cut within an extraordinarily short three weeks, Democrats were already preparing to take on Mr. Bush. And other Administration officials, and the strategists who met with Mr. Skinner and Mr. Teeter on Thursday night, said Mr. Bush had no hope of winning Democratic cooperation in an election year.
The strategists warned the two officials that Mr. Bush's approach was turning him into the status quo candidate and said he should, in the words of one strategist, "draw a line in the sand and take on Congress."
Mr. Bush's proposals are intended to help end the recession that has been hobbling the President's re-election campaign, even though Administration aides admit privately that the President believes there is little that can reasonably be done to that end. Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that after he speaks on Tuesday night, he will call on Congress to "put aside politics" and quickly consider his ideas before the campaign heats up.
"You can't put politics aside," said a Republican strategist. "It's a political year, and if the White House doesn't understand that, all they have to do is look at the pattern of votes that have come out of this Congress over the past 18 months. The Democrats have drawn the line and Bush should too."
The new commercial, which will be broadcast Saturday in New Hampshire, does not offer even a glimmer of Mr. Bush's plans for the economy. It is the first of at least two advertisements that Mr. Bush plans to run in New Hampshire before the Feb. 18 primary and is intended to prove that the President is not afraid to hear bad news and cares about people's problems.
But, with the exception of a brief opening from a woman who says, "I have never seen it so bad where people have to lose their homes," the words of those who deliver the bad news are muted. The voters mouth their words silently at the President while his voice is heard over their pictures.
But some Republican strategists said the Bush campaign was lingering too long on the phase of Mr. Bush's message in which he acknowledged the nation's economic problems and assured Americans that he cared, before moving on to say what the President was prepared to do about the economy.
"How can the President of the United States reconnect to someone who is crying about losing their house?" said one exasperated Republican with close ties to the White House.

HEADLINE: Tisch Proposal to Rescue Macy Falls Through as Creditor Balks

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Laurence A. Tisch's proposal to rescue R. H. Macy & Company from its crushing debt load at the expense of its creditors fell through late yesterday when a major creditor refused to agree to his terms.
In a statement issued last evening, the Loews Corporation, of which Mr. Tisch is chairman and chief executive, said it had ended its discussions to buy Macy. "The Loews proposal was conditioned upon the cooperation of various other parties," the statement said, "but was rejected by a major creditor of Macy's this afternoon." 
 Financial analysts and retailing experts say the Loews decision to withdraw its offer may have dashed Macy's last hope of avoiding bankruptcy and the stigma and operating restraints it carries. Of course, someone, including Mr. Tisch, could offer another plan.
Loews, which said it had been negotiating for several days, declined to elaborate. A Macy spokesman said the company would not comment on the discussions or the Loews statement.
 
$811 Million in Mortgages
 Discussions on the offer broke down when the Prudential Insurance Company of America balked at refinancing the $811 million mortgage it holds on some 70 Macy stores, about half the company's total. It is not known whether Macy's flagship store on 34th Street in Manhattan is one of those stores.
Frank McDougal, president of the Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, said in an interview yesterday that he was concerned about what might happen to Macy, but emphasized that his company's primary responsibility was to its policyholders.
"Everyone wants to avoid this company filing Chapter 11 if it is at all possible," Mr. McDougal said of Macy. "Our first and foremost job is to protect our policyholders."
As part of his offer to invest more than $1 billion to buy back a large part of Macy's junk bonds and get its financial structure into shape, Mr. Tisch asked Prudential to lower the interest rate on the mortgage it holds.
The Prudential mortgage has a base interest rate of 12 percent, although that could increase substantially depending on myriad complex formulas included in the mortgage agreement. Mr. Tisch asked the insurer to refinance the loan at a straight 9 percent rate. Prudential felt that such a substantial cut would hurt its own business.
 
Loans Were Renegotiated
 In late November and early December, Prudential and Macy renegotiated the loans to give Macy lower interest rates and Prudential extra interest if the company's sales exceeded certain targets.
Mr. Tisch now controls 17.7 percent of Macy's preferred stock through a Loews subsidiary, L.T. Holdings Inc., and he is on the Macy board.
When word of Mr. Tisch's plan got out on Thursday, analysts gave it strong chances of approval. Macy's overwhelming debt is propelling the retailer toward bankruptcy. Although investors were likely to lose much of their original stake in Macy under the Tisch plan, they would receive nothing if the company hobbled into bankruptcy.
But Prudential has more leverage than Macy's equity investors, banks and bondholders, and many analysts see the breakdown in talks as a standoff between powerful parties. Even if Macy is forced into bankruptcy, it would emerge operating virtually all of the stores it now operates.
"We feel we are adequately protected with our collateral, and we don't expect to lose any money on the principal," Mr. McDougal said.
Prudential may also be feeling pressure not to make concessions in its real estate portfolio. Yesterday, Moody's Investor Services cited Prudential's real estate problems as it reduced its triple-A rating of the insurer's financial strength.
Mr. Tisch's proposal was made at a critical time for the retail company, which operates the Macy's, I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains and several small specialty store chains. Macy had subtly signaled that it was virtually insolvent when it told its 20,000 suppliers on Jan. 10 that in order to meet the requirements of its $587.7 million revolving credit line, it would have to postpone payments to them for two weeks.
It assured them at the time that it would send the checks today, but it has not asked its banks to draw on the account.
Macy has satisfied bank covenants requiring it not to borrow more than $150 million from the credit line during the last 30 days, freeing up the remainder of the account today.
But to siphon any additional money from the credit line, Macy must show the syndicate of 40 banks that control it that the company has cash flow of $185 million for December and January.
 
Difficulty Meeting Requirement
 Macy is apparently unable to meet that requirement and thus cannot draw on the line to pay its suppliers.
The Loews statement yesterday said that in addition to a substantial equity infusion of cash by Loews, the discussions had contemplated "the payment in full of all Macy's trade creditors upon consummation of the transaction."
The banks had indicated that they would consider waiving some terms of the agreement while the Tisch plan was under negotiation. Now that Loews has withdrawn its offer, however, many analysts feel the banks may be unwilling to do anything that might result in even greater losses to them if Macy goes into bankruptcy.
Several apparel manufacturers said yesterday that they did not expect Macy to send out their checks today. All the major factors who finance shipments to Macy have told their clients they will not guarantee payments on goods sold to the company's stores until some suppliers start receiving checks.
Smaller manufacturers are not likely to ship any more merchandise to Macy without that protection. That could leave Macy's stores short of the new spring merchandise they need to keep shoppers from going to the competition.
"Every day they delay in resolving their financial problems, it jeopardizes their franchise, particularly on the West Coast," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of the Fashion Network Report, a newsletter focusing on the apparel industry. "In San Francisco, La Jolla and Los Angeles, if a woman walks into an I. Magnin or Bullock's store and can't find spring dresses, she'll go right across the street to Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus."
 
Some Still Shipping
 Some suppliers are still shipping merchandise to the company, but most of them are only sending parts of orders. Liz Claiborne Inc., one of the largest apparel manufacturers in the country, declined to comment about Mr. Tisch's proposal or Macy's, falling silent after saying publicly for several weeks that it was shipping orders to the retailer.
The price of Macy's junk bonds escalated sharply yesterday on news of the Tisch proposal. Lehman Brothers high-yield bond desk said Macy's 14.5 percent bonds due 1998 were quoted at 70 cents on the dollar, up from 58 cents at the start of the day. The Loews announcement that its plan had fallen through came after trading closed yesterday.

HEADLINE: From Russia with Hope: In America to Stay - A special report;
Seeking Shelter in U.S. After the Soviet Storm

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

 BODY:
The scene is familiar. Immigrants are crowded onto cots in the back rooms of a church in Los Angeles. But these are not Latin Americans escaping poverty and civil war. They are penniless Russians, members of a new wave of underground immigrants to the United States.
Sheltered under the gold domes of the Protection of the Holy Virgin, a Russian Orthodox church in Hollywood, are what might pass for a cross section of Russian society: a jeweler, an actress, a merchant seaman, a would-be fashion model, a Soviet Army deserter and a mother who fled with her three children from an outbreak of ethnic violence. 
 Just two or three years ago, only a carefully regulated flow of mostly Jewish emigrants were allowed to move to the United States from the Soviet Union. Visits were limited to a trickle of academic and cultural exchanges. But the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union have brought tens of thousands of tourists, businessmen, students, writers, athletes and government representatives from the former Soviet lands.
 
'Much Richer Cross Section'
 Most visitors from the former Soviet Union come to the United States legally, but a growing number of them, like the people who have taken shelter in the Los Angeles church, are going underground when their visas expire. One estimate puts their number at 30,000. But whether they are here legally or not, the immigrants' interaction with American society has helped to change long-held cold war suspicions and prejudices.
"It's quite a shocking difference in the types of people who are coming, just a much richer cross section," said Gregory Guroff, a Soviet expert at the United States Information Agency. "And I think there is a personal reaction: here you have people coming from what has been the enemy and the other superpower, and these people are coming here penniless."
Irina Paliashvili, a lawyer from Ukraine who has recently completed an exchange program with a law firm in Chicago, looked at herself through American eyes and said: "We used to be so uniform. Meeting one Soviet was like meeting another. Now each person has his own views and his own agenda."
One bureaucratic detail seems to symbolize the topsy-turvy nature of the changed Soviet-American relationship. In the past, when a Soviet citizen wished to travel abroad, his Government forced him to leave behind a close family member to help insure his return. Now it is American consular officials in Moscow who often require that a family member be left behind as proof that a tourist does not intend to overstay his visa.
The Soviet Embassy once tried to keep a careful eye on every one of its citizens in America. Now it has has all but given up.
"It is hard to keep track of all these people because there are just so many of them," said Andrei Rogov, an attache at the consulate in San Francisco.
 
Fleeing Home
Flood Unleashed By the Kremlin
 Since late 1988, when the Kremlin began to relax emigration restrictions, hundreds of thousands of people have flooded into Europe and the United States from the territory of the former Soviet Union.
The number of non-immigrant visas to this country for most types of temporary visits climbed to more than 100,000 in each of the last two years. In October, 11,732 Soviet citizens received non-immigrant visas, almost as many as the 12,028 who received them for all of 1987.
Among these visitors are students, researchers and other academics who come here on exchanges. There were only 60 of these in the 1986-87 academic year. The 1990-91 figure was 2,811.
Immigrant visas, primarily for family reunification, nearly doubled to 1,374 in 1990 from 782 in 1987.
In addition, the United States continues to offer refugee status to members of certain groups judged to be oppressed. Under this longstanding program, 61,000 people were offered entry in 1991. Most of these are Soviet Jews. The waiting list for these visas has grown to about 500,000.
 
The First Three Waves
 The Jews have long been considered the third wave of Soviet emigrants; the first wave came after the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the second after World War II. The new exodus is beginning to be called the fourth wave.
A striking set of figures characterizing this wave is the one showing how many arrive legally, mostly as tourists, then overstay their visas and apply for political asylum. The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that only 90 people applied for tourist visas in 1988, but the number jumped to 1,043 in 1990. And in just the first half of 1991, that number nearly doubled, to 1,891.
Mark Popovsky, a journalist with the Russian-language newspaper Novoye Russkoye Slovo in New York, who has written extensively about the phenomenon, estimates that there may be 30,000 illegal immigrants from the former Soviet Union who had not applied for asylum.
That figure seems certain to grow because the number of people leaving the former Soviet republics, already at an all-time high, will increase in the coming years even if conditions in that region improve, according to a recent study by the Rand Corporation, a research center in Santa Monica, Calif.
 
Settling In
Taking Advantage Of Old Contacts
 Sergei N. Khrushchev, the 56-year-old son of the former Soviet leader, seemed almost surprised when asked why he chose to do historical research at Brown University rather than at home in Moscow.
"If one has a choice between working in the best circumstances or the worst circumstances, one will of course choose the best circumstances," he said.
He said that as soon as he was permitted to, in 1989, he traveled to the United States for the first time since he visited with his father when he was Prime Minister in 1959. Now he is comfortably settled here on a one-year fellowship and says he is not certain when he will return home.
Mr. Khrushchev is one of many prominent figures who have traded on their contacts with American officials to find niches at universities and research centers in the United States.
 
The Politically Unemployed
 Among them are Genrikh Trofimenko, a former analyst at the Institute of the United States and Canada; Fyodor A. Burlatsky, former editor of Literaturnaya Gazeta, an influential Moscow weekly; Roald Sagdeyev, former head of the Space Research Institute in Moscow, and Sergo Mikoyan, former editor of the journal Latin America whose father, Anastas I. Mikoyan, was a Soviet head of state.
These are the people Anthony Richter, executive director of the Soros Foundation-Soviet Union, calls the politically unemployed: prominent figures who have been left behind by the fast-changing politics of their land.
"Essentially, you have a giant corporation, which is the Soviet Government, which is in Chapter 11," Mr. Richter said. "All the top executives are either on the market for a Russian Republic position, or being picked up as consultants by Western businesses and think tanks."
One such man is Vitaly Korotich, former editor of the magazine Ogonyok, who is now a visiting professor of journalism at Boston University. "I think my generation, the men of the 1960's, including Gorbachev and Yeltsin and others, has fulfilled its historical task," he said in explaining his move to America. "Now it is time for us to free the way for the next generation."
 
Trading Places
Chances to Study American Ways
 A rapid expansion of exchange programs is bringing to America everyone from rock musicians catching up on West Coast trends to environmentalists attending workshops in Pennsylvania to microbiologists working on a joint project at Columbia University to an Estonian photographer studying at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan.
One illustration of the hunger for American expertise and perspective is a program that offers internships to young lawyers intent on creating legal systems for the Commonwealth of Independent States, successor of the Soviet Union.
Miss Paliashvili, the lawyer who worked in Chicago, said that in view of "all these national fights and all these tragic events" back at home, "it's very hard to cool down our emotions and take a reasonable and practical pragmatic approach."
"That's why we need your help in America," said Miss Paliashvili, an ethnic Georgian. "We need somebody who can give a kind of look from the side and see things from a long-term perspective."
Another law intern is Yelena Barikhnovskaya, 37, who recently completed a six-month stint with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York and now plans to found a similar organization in her home city, St. Petersburg.
 
'What Kind of Changes?'
 "Our legal system does not work, and it should have changes," she said. "But what kind of changes? About this, I am even less clear than I was before, because I understand that American standards cannot be simply blindly transferred there."
For example, she said, Russian courts are preparing to introduce an Anglo-American style jury system in a nation whose people have learned the hard way not to assert their individual opinions.
"I would not like to be a defendant tried by a jury of Soviet citizens," Miss Barikhnovskaya said. "They have been brought up in a Communist system. They were brought up on lies and hypocrisy. They need to be a little bit enlightened first before they can be responsible for human life."
The number of people making private visits to the United States has also soared in the last two years. Among them are a small but growing number of Russians and others who are arriving on business visas. Some have come to learn from large American companies, while a few others are trying their hand at American-style entrepreneurship. In addition, people from the former Soviet Union can now apply directly for admission to American colleges.
The new freedom of travel has produced an increasing number of ordinary human contacts for people like Olga Kamp, who was visiting on a tourist visa two years ago, fell in love, married and settled down in Spokane, Wash. Her brother joined her and is now selling cars in Seattle, and her mother, Nina Bergoltsev, recently visited from Moscow for Christmas.
Circuses, dance troupes and hockey and basketball stars are also seeking a share of the American entertainment dollar, joined by former political figures who are coming not for arms negotiations but for book tours.
Yelena S., who is 28 years old, was a civil judge in Moscow when she came to New York on a tourist visa last year and decided to stay. Bridling at the bureaucratic pressures and corruption at home, she was taken with what seemed to be the broad horizons of life in America.
Now she is working as a housekeeper in Manhattan. "It's really difficult," she said, speaking on the condition that she not be identified by her last name. "I try to live. I try."
 
Getting Help
How Newcomers Are Welcomed
 All around her in New York and elsewhere, other members of this fourth wave of immigration are struggling to live alongside other illegal immigrants from around the world. Many work as laborers or housemaids and live crowded together in what amounts to a Russian import: communal apartments.
Among them is the three-member Limpopo band that arrived a year ago with balalaika, guitar, trombone and tourist visas. And as they play on street corners, they seem so happy to be here that passers-by sometimes begin to dance along with them.
For the most part, these new immigrants have not yet had time to put down roots and achieve the economic success of members of the third wave.
But despite their privations, the clamor to come to America is so great that a cottage industry has been formed to serve these illegal immigrants just as it has for other illegal-immigrant groups.
 
Many Choose Anonymity
 Gregory Maizus, an aide to New York State Senator Donald M. Halperin, said entrepreneurs were selling the personal invitations that are required for exit permits. Other organizations charge fees for advice on how to apply for political asylum.
But thousands prefer illegal anonymity, perhaps recognizing that they would fail the test of "a well-founded fear of persecution." Larissa L., who spends her days at the church in Los Angeles, said that when she was interviewed by the immigration service she was asked, "What are you running from?" The interviewer went on: "You don't have Communism. You don't have the K.G.B. any more." She also agreed to be interviewed only on condition that her last name not be used.
Zoya Arzamastseva fled with her children and her mother after her husband was killed in anti-Russian riots in Moldova and now spends most of her days and nights at the church, uncertain about what she will do next.
Given the fast pace of changes in the former Soviet Union, officials say they have not yet had to face the question of whether to send people like these back home. At least one applicant in New York has already received a preliminary "notice of intent to deny" from the Immigration and Naturalization Service based on what the letter called "political change in the Soviet Union."
"It's going to be hard to make a case of discrimination against you by officialdom," said Jack F. Matlock Jr., a former United States Ambassador to Moscow. "Everybody is having a pretty rough time."
Tsilya Kacheva, a recent immigrant who lives in Philadelphia, is the widow of an army colonel and, at the age of 74, is as old as the former Soviet Union. She believed and hoped and suffered through all the hard years of Kremlin rule.
"We didn't understand how badly we lived," she said. "We thought it was the only way to live." But at last, she said, she gave up.
"We lived through a lot during the war: famine and hardship. But we lived on hope for a better life. Now we know there is no better life. We have lost our belief. There is nothing more to believe in."
 
Hopes Rekindled
 America, on the other hand, seems to offer the sense of hope that has been lost in the collapse of the Soviet empire.
"I would like to stay here two or three years and then try something new -- Africa, China," said Igor Yuzov, the 28-year-old guitarist for Limpopo band, as he gloried in his new horizons, no longer limited by international boundaries.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Assist Peru's Army in Fighting Cocaine and Rebels

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
After months of Congressionally imposed delays, the Bush Administration is preparing to release $10 million in military aid to Peru as the first stage of a new policy to help the Peruvian military fight drug traffickers and Maoist guerrillas involved in the cocaine trade.
The program marks a change after more than two decades of limited relations between Washington and the Peruvian military, which had long retained close ties to the Soviet Union and which had recently been criticized by Administration officials for its dismal record on human rights. 
 Moreover, as recently as two months ago American officials accused elements of the army of taking payoffs from drug traffickers and of blocking Peruvian police efforts to interrupt the cocaine trade.
 
U.S. Aid Up in Last 5 Years
 United States involvement in Peru has slowly increased in the last five years. The Drug Enforcement Administration and antidrug officers under State Department contract have worked at the Santa Lucia police base in the Upper Huallaga Valley advising the police on eradicating drugs and maintaining helicopters. In the last two years, members of the United States Army Special Forces have trained Peruvian police units but up until now have not trained military units.
State Department officials now say the Peruvian military is being reformed, can be vital in the war against drugs and will only improve with increased American tutelage.
"The Peruvian Army is making rather impressive gains to the degree they have opened themselves up to the judicial authorities," said a senior State Department official, who added that the aid would begin to flow in the next few weeks. "Together we have the beginnings of a serious counternarcotics program. They need our help."
The initial aid package will include sending about 15 military trainers to instruct a Peruvian marine company and police antinarcotics units, spare parts for helicopters and jet aircraft, and road-building equipment for army civic action. The package is far smaller than the original $34 million program the Administration proposed to Congress last year, which included sending dozens of military advisers to train three special army battalions.
 
Fear of Bigger Role
 Still, Congressional critics and human rights groups warn that the program could open the door for a growing American role in Latin America's most vicious guerrilla war. Such fears were reinforced this month when three Americans under contract with the State Department to help maintain Peruvian police equipment were killed in a helicopter apparently downed by Shining Path rebels high in Andes.
With the close of the cold war and the shrinking military budgets, the war on drugs is one of the few growth areas the Pentagon has left. Its antinarcotics spending has increased to a projected $1.2 billion this year, from $440 million in 1989. For years the American military expressed reluctance about engaging in operations that they considered police work, but today the United States Southern Command in Panama fields about 500 soldiers working on intelligence and antinarcotics training programs in Latin America.
Administration officials say their strategy in Peru is to improve the coordination of the Peruvian Army and police, so that law-enforcement units can safely operate in the Upper Huallaga Valley where the Shining Path guerrillas operate. Along with the military aid program, the Administration is sending $60 million in economic assistance to help peasants switch from coca cultivation to other crops.
More than half of the cocaine consumed in the United States originates from coca plants cultivated in Peru, making anticocaine efforts there crucial to the Administration's declared war on drugs.
American officials insist they have no interest in deploying ground troops in Peru to fight the guerrillas, who have been accused of not only serving as middlemen between peasant coca growers and the traffickers but also of trafficking to finance their operations. Nonetheless, in a Jan. 17 letter to four senior members of Congress, Janet G. Mullins, Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, said the Administration intended to send nearly $25 million more in military aid once Lima demonstrated better antidrug and human rights efforts.
 
Congress Sets Conditions
 Congressional leaders are meeting to decide how to respond to the Administration's intentions. Although lawmakers released their hold on aid late last year when the State Department agreed to release the funds only after Lima fulfilled a number of Congressionally set targets on human rights, they could block future aid proposals from the Administration.
Those targets included a commitment from Lima that all military aid would be channeled through President Alberto K. Fujimori to reinforce civilian rule, that military prisons be open to international inspection and local civilian prosecutors, that military prisoners be listed on a national registry, and that a number of politically charged human rights cases involving military officers be prosecuted.
In her letter to Congress, Ms. Mullins said the aid would be released because Congressional conditions "have been fulfilled." She noted that the International Red Cross had been allowed to tour military and police prisons unhindered on a regular basis since late September and that Lima had developed a registry of detainees.
But international human rights monitors are expressing doubts.
"It is clear that while limited progress has been made in complying with certain conditions, the overal human rights situation has not improved and may in fact be getting worse," said Coletta Youngers, senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. Ms. Youngers said Peruvian human rights monitors were reviewing and trying to verify 70 reported cases of disappearances linked to the security forces in the last few months.
In a trip to Peru this month, Ms. Youngers said she had found that Red Cross visits to military installations were prearranged and therefore unspontaneous and that Peruvian human rights workers said the registry of prisoners was incomplete.

HEADLINE: Japan Premier, Under Pressure, Opens Parliament

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Shaken by scandals and new frictions with Washington, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa opened a new session of Parliament today pledging to "make every effort to cooperate" with the United States to solve its economic problems.
He also offered "profound apologies" for the fact that one of his closest aides had been arrested on a "most regrettable" bribery charge and said he would push for political reforms "so politics does not languish because of such incidents." 
 Mr. Miyazawa's comments were a clear attempt to overcome not only the scandals but also a sagging economy, opposition to several of his legislative measures and, most of all, an image of disarray that threatens to bring his time in office to an early end. After real estate and stock market prices dropped sharply last year, projections for economic growth for the fiscal year that ends in March flattened to about 3 percent.
But analysts predicted that the Prime Minister, after only three months in office, would have enormous difficulty enacting more than a minimum legislative program in the new parliamentary session, which is to last five months.
 
Bill on Joining U.N. Forces
 Among the key measures backed by Mr. Miyazawa, but considered unlikely to pass soon, are a bill to send Japanese troops abroad to take part in United Nations peacekeeping forces and another set of bills to curb the flow of private money into politics.
Mr. Miyazawa's approval ratings in the polls are in the range of 40 to 50 percent, a respectable level, helped in the view of politicians by the way he comforted President and Mrs. Bush this month when Mr. Bush collapsed with the flu during a dinner in Tokyo.
But some Japanese fear that if he handles his political problems badly and fails to accomplish much of his legislative program, his popularity could plummet to 20 percent or so. If that happens, some feel he could be ousted and replaced before the next national elections this summer.
"He has yet to make a clear-cut start," a senior party leader said this week. "It is still not too late, but he should clearly set out a program indicating what he will be doing."
The governing Liberal Democratic Party is concerned about elections in the upper house of Parliament in May or June. If the party loses many seats, Mr. Miyazawa could be forced out.
 
Problem of U.S. Anger
 Another wild card is the new burst of anti-Japanese feeling in the United States, caused in part by a senior ally of Mr. Miyazawa's belittling American workers as lazy and illiterate. The Prime Minister could suffer if he is seen as failing to respond to American anger on this subject.
Mr. Miyazawa did not specify what he would do to ease American anger, but he alluded to agreements reached with Mr. Bush to step up Japanese purchases of American automobile parts and other products, again saying Japan should take such steps out of compassion for the United States.
"Japan-U.S. relations are the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy," Mr. Miyazawa said. "It would be no exaggeration to say Japan could not have achieved its postwar prosperity had it not been for the good-hearted support of the United States." He added:
"Today the United States has some problems of its own, and it behooves Japan to make every effort to cooperate with the United States as it works to overcome these problems."
In international trade, Mr. Miyazawa is widely reported to have decided in principle to ease Japan's ban on imported rice, possibly by instituting tariffs, but no such system has been announced.
 
Apologies for Arrest
 Mr. Miyazawa sought to put a raging scandal behind him by apologizing for the arrest of Fumio Abe, a former top aide of his, on bribery charges. "I would like to offer my profound apologies to the people that such an incident has ever taken place," he said.
Mr. Abe was arrested on Jan. 13 for allegedly taking $650,000 in bribes from the Kyowa Corporation, a bankrupt steel-frame maker, while he served as a state minister in charge of development in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of the Japanese archipelago. He has denied the charges of bribery.
Although it is common for senior politicians to receive gifts from corporations it is illegal to do a specific favor in return. Mr. Abe is charged with helping the company in resort development in Hokkaido.
Opposition parties are demanding a thorough investigation, charging that some of the money may have directly benefited Mr. Miyazawa's political organization, which Mr. Abe served as secretary until recently.
 
Long-Promised Law Unlikely
 But politicians say that despite the furor over the scandal, it is unlikely that any of the long-promised legislation to curb the flow of money into the political system will be enacted soon.
Mr. Miyazawa's predecessor as Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, had made it a priority to enact new ceilings on corporate contributions, along with new government subsidies for elections. But these bills have foundered because they have been tied to a legislative redistricting program that has drawn widespread opposition.
Mr. Miyazawa has offered to separate the political reform measures from the redistricting but this ploy will probably not revive the chances of the package, according to politicians.
And few expect the bill regarding peacekeeping forces to be brought to the floor in the new session. The public has deeply mixed about the possible rearming of Japan, and the sending of Japanese troops into harm's way.
 
Hopes for New Budget
 Legislative aides to Mr. Miyazawa say his main hope for success lies in approval of a budget this year that would fulfill his pledge to revive the economy and make it serve as a "locomotive" to pull the United States and other countries out of a slump.
But the budget plans are drawing fire, especially from Socialists and other opposition parties that want military spending trimmed fast.
Mr. Miyazawa told reporters this month that they should have patience with him. Leading Japan, he said, "is not like riding a white horse and telling the people to follow me."
"In a large country like Japan," he added, "it's more like being a captain of a huge tanker. Sometimes the captain is not seen very often. But the captain is here doing his job."

HEADLINE: White Collars and Mortarboards Are No Shield in This Recession

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The recession loitering in the region for three years now has been paying surprise visits to the homes of many people who had always thought that blue-chip educations and white-collar jobs made them immune to cutbacks and unemployment.
For these people, the economics of the slump have brought home a hard truth: recessions that used to spell trouble mostly for factory workers are now also disrupting the lives of the educated and the professional elite. 
 Their problems are still small, compared with the devastation succeeding slowdowns have caused blue-collar manufacturing employees in the region. But visits with some of the people affected show that the fact that jobs paying $50,000 and more can be scaled back or lost has come as a shock to many.
"I think we really got spoiled," said Georgianne Phipps of New Canaan, Conn., whose son, Bill, is unemployed. Mrs. Phipps, who heads the development office at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, reports a sense of fear across her community, one of the country's wealthiest.
"We were lulled into this complacency that was not founded on anything," she said. "We thought the economy would continue to grow and our wages would continue to grow year after year. Now economic reality has set in, and the bills have come due."
Mrs. Phipps is not alone in her concerns. Although the recession has stung college-educated and professional workers in many areas of the country, the New York City region has been particularly hard hit, both because the recession started here before it did in the rest of the country and because several industries that are concentrated in the New York region, notably advertising and financial services, have suffered disproportionate employment losses.
Mrs. Phipps was one of 1,726 adults interviewed in a recent New York Times poll of residents in the region immediately surrounding the city. The poll showed, among other things, that even among college-educated respondents with family incomes of $50,000 a year or more, many are coping with worsening family financial situations and unemployment.
When asked if their family financial situations had gotten better, worse or stayed the same in the last year, 22 percent of people in that well-off group said their situation had gotten worse.
Nineteen percent said it was the same as it was a year ago, but still something with which they were dissatisfied. Twenty-nine percent said their family's finances had gotten better, and another 29 percent said their finances had stayed the same and were satisfactory.
The telephone poll was conducted Nov. 2-12 with adult residents of 14 counties immediately surrounding the city in New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut. The poll included 463 adults who said they had a college education and a family income of $50,000 or more in 1990. The margin of sampling error for this group is plus or minus 5 percentage points.
 
'I See Real Despair'
 "Out here in suburbia, in an affluent community, I see real despair," said Ms. Phipps, one of several poll respondents who agreed to be re-interviewed after the poll. "I see families living in million-dollar homes declaring bankruptcy, fathers who have lost their jobs and who can't find a new position. People just can't understand it."
Even among the well educated and highly paid, more than one in five said that at some point in the last year at least one adult in their household had been out of work and actively looking for a job.
Twenty-eight percent of all residents in the 14-county region surrounding the city said an adult in their households had been out of work and looking for a job.
"This is a different kind of recession because it has hit many of these white-collar people for the first time," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "These are people who thought, 'Unemployment never happens to me.' Who ever heard of I.B.M. laying off workers? Who ever thought that young lawyers, full of vim and vigor, would be out on the streets looking for a job? But the white-collar job just ain't what it used to be."
In fact, blue-collar workers have been hit far harder in this recession, which the B.L.S. dates from the end of January 1989, than professional and office employees, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. In the region, white-collar unemployment has inched up, from 2.3 percent in 1988 to 2.9 percent last year, while blue-collar joblessness has climbed to 15 percent, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
But for people who have never experienced anything but the upward arc of prosperity, the white-collar recession has been unsettling. The exasperation at having even a big salary trimmed, of being cut back on work hours, of having a newly graduated son or daughter at home, jobless, or of losing one's position outright and finding the job market radically changed -- these are the elements adding economic insecurity to the comforts and privileges of middle-class suburban living.
"I asked myself, 'I made all this money, how can we have all this debt?' " said Cynthia Cobb of Stamford. "And I realized that we spent all the cash and used up all the credit. That may be the great summary of the life in the 80's -- we spent the cash and used up the credit, and now the reckoning comes."
This is not from someone who suddenly finds herself on the street. Mrs. Cobb, 37 years old, made about $100,000 in 1991. The problem is that during the last decade she was making $170,000 a year creating and selling newspaper advertising inserts, the glossy fliers that come in the Sunday paper.
During that time, she and her husband, a musician recently retrained as a computer consultant, accumulated the trappings to go with those numbers: a Jaguar, furs, a condo in Vermont, private school for their young daughter.
Now the advertising business, one that is as synonymous with New York City as Wall Street and the Yankees, is in a slump. The Cobbs's condo is for sale, and the Jaguar would be, too, if Mrs. Cobb could get out of the lease. "I'm stuck with this," she said. "Nobody else wants it, either."
Like others who were interviewed after the poll, Mrs. Cobb said the workplace itself has changed with the recession. Her company, hurt by the slump, was bought by another, and that put her in competition with the new owners' sales people and forced her into a less profitable side of the business. Even that arrangement may end, with worse to come, she said.
Bryan Lovelace, who handles props for filming TV commercials, has seen his income drop from $80,000 in the mid-1980s to about $40,000 in 1991, and blames not only cutbacks in advertising spending, but also cost-cutting in the way films are made.
"They don't want to put as many people on, and they don't want to work as long," he said. "For a car commercial, we would get a couple of days prep, a couple days shooting, and end up with a week's work. Now they want to do it all in two days."
 
Living Like College Students
 Mr. Lovelace, who is 37 years old and single, left Manhattan for an apartment in Nyack, N.Y., to save money. He knows that he is hardly alone in making these adjustments.
"We have seen a whole generation of advertising people just absolutely canned," he said. "The guys 40 and over, who have been in business for 20 or 25 years, if they didn't own a piece of the agency, they were just ditched, because they had their seniority and would want more money. People my age are living like college students, they're stuffed in $1,200-a-month studio apartments, living with roommates. It boggles the mind."
He lives with a sense of stalled progress. "I thought, at this point in my life, that I would own several pieces of property," he said. "I don't own anything."
Of course, money worries are relative, and the problems that college-educated, middle-class suburbanites face in the trough of the business cycle are easier to bear because of the options they have.
"One of the things my husband and I did was to say, 'Hey, we're red-blooded Americans. We are going to take this situation in our own hands make this work,' " Mrs. Cobb said.
So, despite her $2,000-a-week income, she took a second job at Macy's over the holidays, selling jewelry for $7.50 an hour plus 1 and a half percent commission. Her husband did carpentry and freelanced as a computer installer. They had an all-cash Christmas.
"The first time ever," she said. "No Mastercard, no Visa, no Lord & Taylor bills hanging over my head."
Mr. Lovelace, meanwhile, works part-time in a recording studio to stretch his income. And Victoria Faggiano, 40 years old, a former municipal bond saleswoman on Wall Street who lives in New Brunswick, N.J., took a three-month secretarial job to stretch her unemployment compensation until things get better.
She was earning more than $80,000 a year on Wall Street before losing her job, but a rent-controlled apartment and a frugal lifestyle let her get by on her $140 a week in unemployment insurance.
"Things are really dead out there," she said. "I've put out some resumes and gone for some interviews, and I've heard nothing since Thanksgiving."
Ms. Faggiano says she is sure that, with her bachelor's and master's degrees, she will eventually find a job. But echoing Mr. Lovelace's warning that employers have changed the way they do business, she said that unemployed professionals like her will find the office a different place.
"The firms may start to hire, but they have a tremendous number of experienced people to choose from," she said. "When I started in Wall Street in the early 80's, there were the grunts like me and the front men who went out and kissed the babies and had four-martini lunches and made the deals. Now they're looking for the rocket-scientist guys who can do computer trading, technical analysis of the stock market and that sort of thing."
Ms. Phipps, of New Canaan, spoke of the frustrations of the coming generation of professionals who graduated from college with high hopes, only to confront the teeth of the recession. Her son, Bill, earned a degree in government from St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., 18 months ago, she said, and has not been able to start on a career path since then.
An unemployed college graduate affects the lives of parents, too, said Ms. Phipps. "The kids who are finding work are starting out at $15,000 a year, and they're living at home -- aren't we lucky?" she said with an affectionate laugh.
"I was always envious," she said. "I have always worked for nonprofits, and I used to think if I worked in a corporation I would have a corporate salary and the expense account and take those big trips. But now I think I am better off than that. At least nobody's taking my Mercedes away, because I never had one."

HEADLINE: 6th Quarterly Loss in Row for Texas Instruments

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc. today reported its sixth consecutive quarterly loss, but analysts said cost-cutting moves taken last year by the giant chip maker appeared to be working.
The company trimmed 6,000 jobs through voluntary retirement, layoffs, attrition and assets sales during 1991 for a one-time charge of $240 million, leading to a loss of $85 million. But the $220 million in yearly savings projected today by Jerry R. Junkins, chairman and chief executive, contributed to a small operating profit of $12 million in the fourth quarter. 
 "The actions to reduce fixed costs, overhead and operating costs have begun to have some impact," said Thomas A. Thornhill, semiconductor analyst and principal at Montgomery Securities, in San Francisco. "The operating profit was above expectations."
The fourth-quarter loss compared with a loss of $56 million in the period in 1990. Revenues fell slightly, to $1.75 billion from $1.76 billion.
The company's biggest struggle now is improving lagging production of dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAM's, capable of storing four million characters of information, or four megabits. Global demand for these higher-capacity memory chips took hold in 1991, but Texas Instruments was left in the dust by big Japanese suppliers, led by Hitachi, Toshiba and NEC.
According to Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose, Calif., those three companies combined sold 86 million four-megabit memory chips, compared with 3.5 million by Texas Instruments. The total market was 140 million units.
Falling prices also squeezed profit margins. The current price for the four-million-character D-RAM is about $13, down from nearly $20 a year ago. "Because T.I. got in late, they have to be more aggressive in pricing to win business from companies who are more established," said Lane Mason, a Dataquest analyst.
Worldwide sales for the chips will amount to $20 billion through 1994, he said. William P. Weber, president of the semiconductor group at Texas Instruments, said the company would increase market share of four-megabit chips in 1992, with three plants -- in Italy, Japan and Taiwan -- now in various stages of production. Within two years, he added, the company would increase its chip output capacity to eight times last year's level.
 
Share Price Dips
 In a statement, Mr. Junkins said the company was "planning to return to profitability in 1992" but he did not say in which quarter. The company's share price fell by 75 cents, to $35, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"If we get a decent economy, as the stock market is anticipating, they clearly will make money," said Richard L. Whittington, an independent analyst in New York. "If they get those D-RAM plants cracking, they could take a lot of market share in '92 because of cutbacks the Japanese have made in their own D-RAM capacity."
The recent quarter included a $55 million charge related to cutting 1,000 additional jobs beginning today, mainly in computer chip and information technology business segments, and phasing out older chip production equipment. The total charge of $80 million was reduced by a $25 million gain posted from a pension plan involved in the voluntary retirement program.
Royalty income from chip-licensing agreements was $57 million in the quarter, compared with $53 million in the quarter a year ago.
For the year, Texas Instruments posted the steepest loss in its history. The company lost $409 million, compared with a loss of $39 million in 1990. Revenues rose by 3.2 percent, to $6.78 billion from $6.57 billion.
Semiconductor sales rose to $3.4 billion, from $3.1 billion in 1990, with the loss rising to $188 million, from $76 million. Operating profit in the military-supply unit fell to $111 million, from $170 million. The unit's revenue fell to $1.95 billion, from $2.12 billion a year ago, but orders surged by 84 percent as the Pentagon moved to bolster supplies of missiles and other equipment made by Texas Instruments that were used in the Persian Gulf war.

HEADLINE: Bush to Seek More Money for Major Space Missions

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Telling an enthusiastic group of young people that even in hard times the public must invest in the future, President Bush said today that he would seek additional money for the space station, robot missions to the moon and other aerospace projects.
Mr. Bush, surrounded by 23 space shuttle astronauts who were visiting Washington, told more than 100 cheering school children and their advisers, "America's destiny must include manned exploration" of space. 
 Noting that he has committed the country to returning people to the moon and reaching further into space, the President said his 1993 budget proposal to be made public next week would include $2.25 billion for Space Station Freedom, an 11 percent increase over the current amount.
 
'We've Challenged America'
 In addition, he said, the Administration will seek $250 million to triple spending on a new series of unmanned space rockets, request more money for a hypersonic plane that could fly from an airport runway directly into low orbit and ask for money to start a program to send two robot craft into lunar orbit to complete the mapping of the moon.
"I set a goal for young Americans like you to travel to Mars," Mr. Bush said to the Young Astronauts' Council, a national group of grammar school children interested in space exploration. "We've challenged America to go back to the moon to stay and then on to Mars."
Mr. Bush stressed the economic value of investing in space to create jobs and economic opportunity for the country. The United States exports more than $1 billion a year in space goods and services, an effort that is worth 20,000 jobs, he said.
"I'm asking Americans to make a far-sighted commitment, one that looks dozens of years and millions of miles beyond the recession and the other things that preoccupy us today," Mr. Bush said.
Administration officials familiar with the space program said the President's 1993 budget request for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would not match the increases sought in previous years, but would exceed the current 3 percent rate of inflation. NASA's $14.3 billion budget will go up modestly under the proposal, a concession to the recession, the officials said.
The proposal also shows continued support for projects that did not do well in the Congressional budget process last year, said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Bush said he would ask for $80 million for NASA's share of the hypersonic plane, which is to be built in a cooperative program with the military. Last year Congress cut the Administration's $72 million request on behalf of NASA for the plane to $5 million, and reduced the Defense Department's share from a requested $232 million to $200 million.
Dr. John Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said Mr. Bush appeared to be putting forth a budget that emphasized newer technology rather than upgrading old capability, like building new expendable rockets instead of recycling old military models. "This is the kind of budget that should be put forward if the country expects to move ahead in space in the future," he said.
Representative George E. Brown Jr., the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, said he was pleased the President's proposal appeared to maintain a balance between space exploration and science. But he said finding money for an expanded space program in the current economic climate "will be challenging."
Mr. Bush met with the children and the crews of four of NASA's most recent space shuttle missions as part of a program to kick off International Space Year, a yearlong worldwide celebration of space cooperation that involves 29 national space agencies, 10 international groups and the United Nations.
 
Talked to Crew in Space
 Mr. Bush and some of the children talked with the crew of the space shuttle Discovery, which went into orbit on Wednesday carrying astronauts from three countries and an international microgravity laboratory.
The astronauts, whose picture from inside the laboratory was projected on a large screen to the surprise of the children meeting Mr. Bush at the White House, said most of their experiments were going well and encouraged the children to study science and mathematics if they wanted careers in space. During the television hookup, the astronauts juggled a 120-pound camera on their fingertips to show how light things are in space and performed some acrobatics.
NASA said the planned weeklong mission was going well, despite problems with a balky toilet and unexpected difficulty growing a rare kind of crystal. Members of the seven-member crew were trying to fix a loose handle on the shuttle's toilet that prevented it from flushing. If a solution cannot be found, the six men and one woman aboard will have to use plastic bags carried aboard for such emergencies, an agency spokesman said.
The astronauts were able to grow an unusually pure mercury oxide crystal in the absence of gravity, said Keith Robinson, a spokesman at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Mercury oxide crystals are used to detect X-rays and gamma radiation, and are difficult to grow in the ideal shape and size on Earth because of the influence of gravity.
Early today when astronauts looked at the seed crystal used as the core of the one to be grown, they found numerous small, imperfect crystals growing at its base that threatened to ruin the experiment. But Ulf Merbold, a German physicist and crystal expert, was able to manipulate the temperature in the growing chamber to dissolve the small crystals and later reported that a smooth, perfect main crystal was beginning to form, Mr. Robinson said.

HEADLINE: Boston Journal;
When Gilding the Roof Can Tarnish One's Image

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Oliver Wendell Holmes called the State House that sits proudly atop Beacon Hill here "the hub of the solar system."
Even allowing for hyperbole, in Massachusetts, at least, the State House's golden dome has traditionally served as the measuring rod by which distances to Boston are calculated. The building was designed in 1795 by Charles Bullfinch, the noted architect whose elegant creations transformed Boston. 
 So when word recently spread that the gold foil that covers the dome is flaking off in spots, revealing an unsightly black undercoat, it might have been expected that Gov. William F. Weld, one of whose ancestors helped found Harvard College in 1636, would have acted expeditiously to restore the famous dome.
But no. Instead, Governor Weld last week ordered his Department of Capital Planning and Operations to stop its plans to re-gild the 9,073-square-foot dome, at a projected cost of about $250,000. "The Governor ordered a halt to any gilding pending a structural evaluation of the dome to see if there is any public safety reason for doing it," said his spokesman, Ray Howell.
Re-gilding the dome, with the necessary 13 pounds of gold foil, threatened to become an unhappy symbol for Mr. Weld, a Republican and avowed libertarian who, as part of a major effort to reduce the size of state government, has sharply cut state spending for education, welfare and other human services. How would it look if he spent a quarter of a million dollars on gold for a dome?
Moreover, Massachusetts is in its worst economic slump since the Depression, having lost more than 11 percent of its jobs in three years. Demonstrators troop through the State House almost daily, protesting cuts in spending for welfare, teachers, police officers or firefighters.
Perhaps seeking to minimize any political fallout, Russ Aims, an official of the state's capital planning agency, said the only reason talk of re-gilding the dome had come up at all was that the department was preparing to replace the State House roof. The roof has been leaking for years, he said, with rain and snow seeping into the building's walls and ceilings, causing stains and other damage. Replacement of the roof, exclusive of re-gilding, is expected to cost $2 million, Mr. Aims said.
The interior of the State House is now being repainted by about 20 inmates from Massachusetts. This is part of a program begun by Governor Weld to get tougher on crime and make inmates work.
When the State House was originally completed in 1798, on the site of a cow pasture that had belonged to John Hancock, the dome was shingled and painted. But it leaked then, too, so Paul Revere, naturally, came to the rescue, putting his metal-working skills to work and sheathing the dome in copper in 1802.
The dome was not decked out in its full finery until 1872, when it was covered with 23-karat gold leaf, in the period of American history known as the Gilded Age. The cost was $2,862.50.
In the late 19th century and early 20th century the dome was re-gilded every five or 10 years. In World War II it was painted gray to shield Boston from the eyes of German U-boats.
Mary Ellen Shattuck, a member of the Doric Dames, a group of volunteers who give tours of the State House, can recall those days, but said the darkly painted dome did not concern her then. In her blunt Yankee fashion, she curtly said, "I was working at Harvard," as if that ought to explain everything.
Mrs. Shattuck, whose husband's family came to Massachusetts in 1630, takes enormous pride in the State House, but she said she understands Governor Weld's decision to hold off on the re-gilding, which was last done in 1969. "It's just not a top priority now, with the way our economy is," she said.
What she would really appreciate, she said, would be fewer demonstrators disrupting the decorum of the State House. "It's such a lovely building," she said, "and they make such a fuss."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Clintons to Rebut Rumors on "60 Minutes"

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and his wife, Hillary, have agreed to appear together on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" on Sunday night after the Super Bowl to respond to accusations that he has had extramarital affairs.
Campaign aides spent the day sifting through invitations to appear on news programs over the weekend before deciding on "60 Minutes," a Clinton campaign spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said. CBS said the program would start about 10 P.M. 
 The Democratic Presidential candidate, who spent yesterday in Little Rock, and his wife, who campaigned in Georgia, will record the segment in Boston on Sunday, Ms. Myers said.
Mr. Clinton stayed with his announced schedule today, meeting in Little Rock with his cabinet and staying in the state for the execution of a convicted killer. He is scheduled to appear Saturday at a Rainbow Coalition forum here and deliver a speech in Boston before traveling to New Hampshire for a rally.
Campaign officials said the joint appearance reflected an intention to engage the candidate's wife in the effort to combat allegations that he had a 12-year extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers, who now works for the state.
The accusations have been published in Star, a tabloid that says it paid Ms. Flowers for her account but declined to say how much.
Mr. Clinton has acknowledged knowing Ms. Flowers. She started working for the state last June as an administrative assistant at the Arkansas Board of Review, which hears appeals involving unemployment compensation. William D. Gaddy, director of the state's Employment Security Division, which provides administrative suport for the board, said an aide in Governor Clinton's office referred her to the board as part of a routine process.
Her supervisor, Randall Wright, said she was hired from a merit list because she was the best qualified. He said no one from the Governor's office contacted him about hiring her.
At a news conference in Savannah today, Mrs. Clinton said: "As with most married couples, we've had our good times and our bad times. We are more committed, more stable and more in love now because when the tough times came we didn't cut out. When people get to know us and talk to our friends in Arkansas, they won't give that story the time of day."

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighing Aid for Russian Nuclear Scientists

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is considering several plans to provide assistance to Russian nuclear scientists to keep them from accepting offers to work in developing nations trying to build weapons, the State Department said today.
Congressional leaders and private organizations concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons are pressing the Bush Administration to act quickly to provide assistance not only to prevent a brain drain but also to speed up the process of dismantling weapons in the former Soviet Union, a process that the scientists could assist. 
 "There is a lot of serious thinking going on on this subject," the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said today. "But that there is an interagency single proposal or one that has been forwarded to the White House for approval -- we're not at that point yet."
 
Fellowships and Employment
 The proposals, reported today by The Los Angeles Times, include providing fellowships to scientists and employing them in the dismantling of Soviet weapons, members of Congress and nongovernmental nuclear experts say.
Some officials expect that President Bush will announce an American initiative in his State of the Union speech next week. Reginald Bartholomew, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, returned Thursday from a trip to Russia, where all issues about the disarming of Soviet weapons were discussed, the State Department said.
A team of American nuclear specialists remained in Moscow for in-depth studies, Miss Tutwiler said, adding that the specialists are expected to return to Washington in time to brief Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d before he leaves for Russia on Sunday. Mr. Baker, who will meet the Russian Defense Minister and attend an international conference on the Middle East, was briefed by Mr. Bartholomew today, Miss Tutwiler said.
 
Backing for European Idea
 On Wednesday, Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asked in a Senate speech that the Administration support "enthusiastically" a European proposal for a fellowship program that would pay to keep Russian scientists in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr. Pell recently returned from a trip to Russia and Ukraine, where he said he found many people eager to see nuclear weapons moved or dismantled.
On the same day, Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, proposed an international agency to find employment for the scientists. His proposal has won wide backing in Europe.
 
Salary Plan for 2,000 Experts
 Senator John W. Warner, a Virgina Republican and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirmed in an interview today that the Administration was seriously considering, among other proposals, a plan to provide money to pay 2,000 experts in the former Soviet Union to oversee the destruction of weapons.
"The cost effectiveness of this is astonishing," the Senator said. "For a small amount of money, you can give them the opportunity to work with the U.S. private sector in demilitarizing and also cleaning up the nuclear sites."
Congress has authorized $400 million to assist in the dismantling of weapons in the former Soviet Union. Miss Tutwiler said today that she could not say how that money would be spent until proposals had been formalized and sent to the President.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Campaign's New Prop: A Prescription in Print

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Last Sunday, when the Democratic candidates met for a televised debate, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas brought a prop: a copy of his 86-page prescription for solving the country's problems.
"This is not rhetoric," he said at one point, waving the gray booklet in front of the camera. "This is a real economic plan." 
 What the gesture lacked in genuine drama it made up with its sober show of specificity. After getting a bad reputation during the last few campaigns, details -- or at least the idea of them -- are making a comeback in the 1992 Presidential election.
Indeed, so high a premium is being put on specifics that one of the hot new issues of the primary campaign is which candidates have published bound volumes of their plans, and which have not.
 
A Three-Volume Set
 So far, three of the five major Democratic candidates -- Mr. Tsongas of Massachusetts, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa -- have published novella-length booklets. Mr. Tsongas's plan, "A Call to Economic Arms," was the first in the series and remains the lengthiest. Mr. Harkin's plan, "A Blueprint to Build a New America," which weighs in at a more modest 35 pages, was released just this week and appears in large part to be an effort to keep up with the competition.
The biggest build-up belongs to Mr. Clinton's booklet: "A Plan for America's Future." In a television commercial that is being broadcast in New Hampshire, Governor Clinton sits in front of an American flag and assures voters that they "deserve more than 30-second ads or vague promises." Then he urges them to visit their libraries to review his plan, or to call his office and receive a free copy.
"Campaigns have always had position papers," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic consultant. "But I don't think they've ever been marketed in quite the same way."
At least for the time being, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska has declined to publish a special booklet. This decision is one that he seems increasingly compelled to justify.
"I don't believe this election is going to be won by presenting a flurry of position papers," he said in Sunday's debate.
Despite Senator Kerrey's efforts, however, the "plan gap" has become a point of contention between him and Governor Clinton.
"Our opponents are complaining that we shouldn't be measured by position papers," said Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media adviser. "Well, they may not think so, but the voters think so."
The Kerrey campaign, meanwhile, portrays the whole battle of the booklets as vaguely ridiculous. It has tried to recast the issue as one of comprehensive plans versus clear priorities.
"The Clinton people keep repeating like a new mantra that specificity is the new character issue," said Michael McCurry, an adviser to Senator Kerrey. "People do want specifics. But it's not quantity that counts, it's priorities."
Mr. Kerrey has made health care his first priority, and has introduced in the Senate a detailed bill to provide national health insurance. The campaign has no plans to publish a plan, Mr. McCurry said. But if it did, he said, "I guess we should come in higher than Harkin and lower than Tsongas; if we clocked in at 40 to 45 pages, that should be about right."
Political analysts attribute this year's proliferation of plans to the recession, and to the disillusionment it has produced with the glib nostrums of the last few elections.
 
Studiously Vague
 But even though the candidates advertise their plans as carefully detailed solutions to the country's ills, truly cynical voters may still find grounds for skepticism. While they are chock-full of statistics, when it comes to paying for their proposals, the plans are studiously vague.
Mr. Clinton, for example, advocates an increased tax exemption for families with children; he says the increase could be paid for by cutting the Federal bureaucracy but never mentions how much the plan will cost, or where he intends to cut. Similarly, Mr. Harkin asserts in his plan that he will provide health care to all Americans. But he never puts a price tag on the plan, and the only savings he mentions, cutting "bureaucratic waste, red tape and padded prices," are not quantified.
In the end, though, what seems to be more important than what is proposed in the plan is the idea that the plan exists. While all of the campaigns report that demand for their plans is brisk, it is unclear whether voters are actually reading the plans, or just collecting them, the way one might collect clippings on important but dull topics, to be perused at some unspecified time in the future.
For example, the reference librarian at the Bedford Public Library, Susan Rotch, had a copy of Governor Clinton's plan on her desk. She said she thought the plan was a "very good idea." But when asked whether she herself had read it, she shook her head regretfully.
"I know I should have," she said.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Mail-Order Rule Likely to Change

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If the Justices' questioning during oral arguments is any guide to their ultimate decision, the Supreme Court seems likely to overturn a landmark 1967 ruling and decide this spring that a state may levy sales taxes on mail-order merchandise from outside its borders.
The Court seemed quite unsympathetic on Wednesday to the position of the Quill Corporation, an Illinois-based marketer of office supplies. Its sales in North Dakota have produced a high-stakes challenge to the principle that states could not make tax collectors of companies with no physical presence within their borders. 
 North Dakota asserts that this gives mail-order houses a significant advantage over local merchants and that modern technology has made the physical-presence requirement obsolete.
One Justice whose comments pointed to overturning the 25-year-old precedent, which involved National Bellas Hess Inc., was Antonin Scalia, who demanded of Quill's lawyer: "I want you to tell me why collecting the tax is worse if you use the phone to sell than if you use salesmen." He added, according to an account by Tax Analysts' Daily Tax Highlights and Documents: "You're elevating the method of selling to a point of principle."
The tide seemed so strong, in fact, that some Justices wondered aloud about how, assuming they overturned National Bellas Hess, the Court or Congress might deal with a potential consequence: North Dakota and other states seeking to collect the tax retroactively.
Economists have debated for years whether individual retirement accounts prompt people to raise their savings or merely confer tax benefits on those who shuffle around money they would have saved anyway. In the latest analysis, Jonathan Skinner of the University of Virginia concludes that I.R.A.'s do indeed raise savings, though he acknowledges a continued lack of hard evidence. Professor Skinner cites psychological factors, like advertising, peer pressure and, most importantly, the "lockup" effect, under which available money is put out of reach, subject to a stiff penalty for early removal. "I call this soft evidence, but to me it's fairly compelling," he said. His results come as Congress is about to consider amendments the I.R.A. rules, including one for penalty-free withdrawals by people buying their first homes.
Even if an investment in an I.R.A. is initially shifted from, say, a money market fund, Professor Skinner contends, the lockup effect tends to increase this person's savings since he or she will, put back part of the money market account.
"I view people as thinking about their financial planning through this hazy fog," he said, denigrating the assumptions of orthodox economic models that have studied behavior during and since the heyday of I.R.A. deductibility between 1982 and 1986. One of the most effective tools for promoting new savings, he says, would be for the Government to send each taxpayer an annual notice stating the amount currently eligible for contribution.
 
Footnotes
 * Paul Craig Roberts, a Treasury official in the Reagan Administration, said this week that President Bush could cut the capital gains tax unilaterally by changing the definition of cost to include inflation. He contended that the cost basis of an asset, the starting point for calculating gain, was defined by regulation rather than statute.
* The House Ways and Means Committee has rescheduled its Long Island field hearing for Feb. 10 at the Nassau County police headquarters auditorium in Mineola. Representatives Raymond J. McGrath and Thomas J. Downey will preside over the session on the local economy and various issues that are scheduled to come before the tax-writing committee.

American Brands Profit Sets Record

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: OLD GREENWICH, Conn., Jan. 24

 BODY:
American Brands Inc., the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes and Jim Beam bourbon, today reported record profits of $216.6 million in the fourth quarter.
For the year, the company's profits rose by nearly 37 percent. 
 Despite the recession and new taxes overseas, American Brands had strong increases in tobacco and liquor sales, William J. Alley, the chairman and chief executive, said.
"Over all, our operations are generally performing very well in their markets," he added. "We remain optimistic about the future and, despite continued weak economic conditions, we expect another record year in 1992."
 
$1.04 a Share
 The fourth-quarter earnings of $216.6 million, which amounted to $1.04 a share, were up from $7.1 million, or 2 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter. In the 1990 period, the company had recorded a $214.6 million write-down of the preferred stock it held in the McGregor Acquisition Corporation.
American Brands' revenues edged up slightly in the quarter, to $3.79 billion from $3.75 billion.
For all of 1991, American Brands' earnings totaled $806.1 million, or $3.91 a share, compared with $588.6 million, or $2.95 a share. Its revenues last year were up by 2 percent, to $14.06 billion, from $13.78 billion in 1990.
The results helped American Brands' stock advance 87.5 cents today on the New York Stock Exchange, where it closed at $45.875.
 
Solid Tobacco Sales
 Besides its tobacco and liquor businesses, American Brands, based in Old Greenwich, has operations in hardware, office products and life insurance.
Tobacco sales, through its American Tobacco Company and British-based Gallaher Tobacco units, posted strong quarterly results, the company said. Its total tobacco revenues during the year rose 1 percent, to $8.2 billion. American Tobacco's brands also include Carlton and Pall Mall.
American Brands' distilled spirits operations reported 12 percent higher earnings in 1991 than in 1990. Besides Jim Beam bourbon, the company's other brands include Lord Calvert Canadian whisky and Gilbey's gin. British sales were offset by a 12 percent rise in taxes.
 
Record for Hardware Unit
 Despite the worst year for housing starts since World War II, the company's Masterbrand hardware and home-improvement group had a record year. The division's income totaled $141.5 million.
Income during the year dropped by 57 percent, to $37.7 million, at American Brands' ACCO World office products unit. The division blamed the recession and fewer white-collar jobs. ACCO cut 10 percent of its workers last year.
At the Franklin Life Insurance Company unit, meanwhile, its revenues totaled $870 million in 1991, up by 8 percent from a year earlier. The operation's revenues rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Legislators Try to Save Seawolf Program

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
With Connecticut's vital defense industries already hard hit by layoffs and preparing for more, the state's Congressional delegation is desperately trying to save the Seawolf nuclear submarine and the thousands of jobs it provides.
"It's like standing in the face of a blizzard and a hurricane simultaneously," said Christopher J. Dodd, the state's senior Democratic Senator. "It's a real maelstrom. And obviously we're bracing for more tough news." 
 Just days ago, the state's largest private employer, United Technologies, announced that it would be cutting 6,400 jobs in Connecticut. And worse news could come as soon as Tuesday, when President Bush is to outline his budget priorities in his State of the Union Address. There have been reports that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may choose to slash the attack-submarine program, sending tremors through the state and its Congressional delegation.
 
Legislators Mount Campaign
 And so, in what could be a major political test for some members of the state's delegation, the legislators have banded together in an impassioned press to save the submarine, which is built in Groton by Electric Boat, a division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Electric Boat is the second largest private employer in Connecticut and a major employer in neighboring Rhode Island.
"It's very important," said Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, the New Haven Democrat. "The issue is larger than a single program or company. It's the entire defense industry in Connecticut."
The campaign on behalf of the submarine, which costs about $2 billion a copy, is a microcosm of the skirmishes breaking out across Capitol Hill as legislators battle to save home-state weapons systems and bases threatened by cuts in the defense budget in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war.
The entire Connecticut and Rhode Island Congressional delegations met this week to present the case for the Seawolf to Mr. Cheney. The legislators said the Defense Secretary listened politely to their argument that the submarine's cancellation would lead to the loss of pivotal manufacturing skills but gave them little reason for optimism.
The legislators also have sought to build a Congressional coalition behind the submarine by calling in political chits from colleagues, while Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has pleaded the attack submarine's case in an open letter to the Bush Administration.
Connecticut is in particularly dire straits. Its economy has been dependent on defense industries since the time of the quintessential Connecticut Yankee, Eli Whitney, whose inventions included a rifle with interchangeable parts.
At no time was the relationship between Connecticut and the military closer than in the 1980's. Although represented in Congress largely by doves, the state grabbed a substantial share of the Reagan Administration's defense buildup. While it had only 1.3 percent of the country's population, Connecticut in 1988 received 2.61 percent of defense spending. At its peak in the late 1980's, defense spending in the state totaled almost $3,000 per resident. That was the engine for an economic boom that pushed Connecticut's per capita income to the highest in the nation.
But now the boom has turned to bust, and the state's big defense contractors have announced layoffs. Connecticut's unemployment rate in November jumped to 6.9 percent from 5.3 percent a year ago.
"We're a victim of our own success," said Senator Dodd.
The United Technologies announcement is the latest such decision to stagger the recession-racked New York metropolitan region, which has long relied heavily on the defense industry. On Long Island, the Grumman Corporation and myriad other smaller military suppliers have lost an estimated 20,000 jobs since the procurement boom of the mid-1980's. And Electric Boat said some months ago that it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, many of them in a previous scaling back of the Seawolf program.
Even tougher times may lie ahead. A cancellation of the Seawolf program, Electric Boat officials have indicated, could lead to the shutting down of the company, which employs 22,000 people in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Even a sharp cutback in the current procurement program would lead to the termination of many of those employees, company officials said, and would bring about layoffs at thousands of subcontractors throughout the region.
 
The Importance of Seawolf
 Unless the Federal cutbacks are balanced by an influx of money for new domestic programs, the impact is likely to be especially painful for the region, which gets less Federal money per capita than almost any other region in the country. Connecticut, for instance, which sends Washington 2.1 percent of the taxes it collects, receives only 1.27 percent of Federal expenditures for programs other than defense.
"That's why the defense cuts hit us with a double blow," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Connecticut's junior Democrat. "It will have a disproportionate effect because we've been very able, very fortunate when it comes to defense spending. But when it comes to social programs, Connecticut doesn't get its fair share."

HEADLINE: Crossland Is Seized By the U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The slumping New York real estate market claimed another victim yesterday afternoon when Federal banking regulators closed Crossland Savings, the city's largest savings bank. One hour and $1.2 billion later, they opened the new Crossland Federal Savings Bank, with new management and Federal ownership.
The seizure has no immediate effect on the bank's 400,000 customers. Depositors at Crossland, which is based in Brooklyn and has 44 branches in the New York area, continue to be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for up to $100,000 an account. Interest rates on certificates of deposit will not be changed until the deposits mature.
 
Notes Taped to the Doors
 Notices taped to the doors of all Crossland branches at 3 P.M. told customers of the change, and said branches that normally stayed open late on Fridays would reopen at 4 P.M. About a dozen branches in Nassau County that are open on Saturdays will also be open today for business as usual. 
 To put the new Crossland on a strong financial footing after heavy losses on bad loans for construction of commercial buildings in the city, the F.D.I.C. invested $1.2 billion in the company. About $800 million of that was immediately absorbed by losses on bad loans, and $400 million is the bank's capital now. F.D.I.C. officials said they planned to try to sell the new Crossland within a year or two, and they estimated that after the sale, the Government's loss would be $500 million to $1 billion. It will be one of the F.D.I.C.'s 10 most costly bank failures.
 
No Buyers for Bad Loans
 William Taylor, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said the cost of the Government's investment in Crossland would be less than the cost of selling the old Crossland. Although the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Republic New York Corporation had bid for Crossland, they were not willing to accept most of Crossland's loans, which would have been left with the F.D.I.C.
"It is more cost effective for us to spend on repairs for Crossland than to rip out its wiring and sell its parts," Mr. Taylor said at a news conference in New York.
The decision to strengthen Crossland rather than sell it may be good news for some Crossland borrowers strained by the local economy. Mr. Taylor said that if the bank had been sold, there were about $2.5 billion of loans that are not delinquent but that the buyer would not have accepted, and would have been transferred to the F.D.I.C.
The transfer of those loans would hurt borrowers and the Government, Mr. Taylor said, because the F.D.I.C. has a low tolerance for any delinquencies and is prone to foreclose quickly. Quick foreclosures mean losses for the Government that are generally higher than would be suffered by a private owner, who is more likely to work out new loan agreements to keep borrowers afloat until the economy improves.
To manage the new Crossland, the F.D.I.C. hired Richard A. Kraemer, a banker who spent his entire career at New York savings banks, starting with Dime Savings in 1962. Known for his experience in handling the kinds of commercial real estate loans that got Crossland into trouble, Mr. Kraemer has been chairman of the Bowery Savings Bank and Home Savings Bank, and a top official at H. F. Ahmanson & Company, the California company that owns both New York savings banks.
 
Shift in Concentration
 Mr. Kraemer said Crossland would concentrate on issuing new-home mortgages, and steer clear of the commercial real estate business -- "where we have more than enough loans to work out before we even think of doing more."
Maurice L. Reissman, Crossland's chairman, who started his career as a branch teller, left the bank yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Taylor stopped short of saying that the F.D.I.C.'s $1.2 billion investment indicates a change in its policy for weak and failing banks. The agency has previously made similar investments, like that in Chicago's old Continental Illinois Bank in the mid-1980's, but for the most part has preferred to sell or close failed banks.
"In cases where we can find good management, and where the bank is viable with a strong business," Mr. Taylor said, the F.D.I.C. is more willing to consider investing in a bank to keep it alive. Mr. Taylor, whose office is in Washington, visited some Crossland offices in Brooklyn a month ago and saw firsthand the bank's loyal following at neighborhood branches.
Because Crossland's branches average more than $100 million of deposits, with some exceeding $300 million, the bank's branch system would be an attractive source of low-cost deposits for other banks. But Crossland's inability to invest those deposits in good-quality loans has been a long-standing problem.
Beginning in the mid-1980's, the bank began to make a splash in the New York real estate market by financing new apartment buildings, office towers and stores. Today, it has about $2 billion in loans that are not expected to be repaid in full or have already been foreclosed, and another $2.5 billion of loans that are not yet badly delinquent but are for such risky real estate projects that losses are possible.
 
Earlier Deal Fell Through
 In 1989, Crossland talked with the Pritzker family of Chicago about making a large investment in the bank. Those talks ended in early 1990, and by the summer of 1991 regulators said Crossland was insolvent but would remain in business until it could be sold. In the 21 months ended Sept. 30, Crossland lost $739 million, as prices of New York real estate fell and regulators forced the company to recognize its losses.
Shareholders in Crossland were wiped out last year after regulators said the bank was insolvent.
The grandiose expansion plans of the company, encouraged by its expansive real estate lending and typified by its change of name in 1985 to Crossland from Metropolitan Savings, led Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, in an interview yesterday, to call it "a case study of what is wrong with our banking system, with institutions soaking up insured deposits and using them to fund high-risk, speculative loans."
Peter Treadway, an analyst of savings institutions at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said Mr. Kraemer, Crossland's new chairman, has "a very good reputation, but he faces a tremendous challenge in finding profitable assets" where the deposits may be invested.

HEADLINE: Profits Drop for Exxon, Mobil and Chevron

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Three of the nation's biggest oil companies reported lower earnings today for the fourth quarter, as world crude prices slumped and the recession slowed sales of gasoline and other refined products.
Exxon said net income fell 28.2 percent. Mobil reported an earnings decline of 38.5 percent. And Chevron, which took a one-time charge against earnings of $244 million, said net income plunged 93.8 percent. 
 The reports followed the trend of sharply lower earnings for the oil industry in the quarter, which partly reflected the unusually high profits most oil companies posted in the last quarter of 1990.
Profits in exploration and production units soared then amid worries of war and destruction in the Persian Gulf oilfields that pushed crude prices to an average of nearly $30 a barrel.
Over all, Exxon, Mobil and Chevron each reported better results overseas than in the United States during the recent quarter, in both exploration and refining operations.
"U.S. refining and marketing operations were particularly disappointing, but that's starting to turn around," said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "December was the first month with evidence of improvement, and profit margins have improved the first two weeks in January for most companies."
Allen E. Murray, the Mobil Corporation's chairman and chief executive, said business conditions were not improving. Prices were weak for crude oil worldwide and for natural gas in the United States; refinery profit margins were "very weak" in the United States, he added.
Following are details from each of the three companies' earnings reports:
 
Exxon
 Net income at the Exxon Corporation, the world's biggest oil company, was $1.12 billion, or 89 cents a share, compared with $1.56 billion, or $1.23 a share, in the period a year ago. Revenues fell 12.1 percent, to $30.87 billion from $35.12 billion.
The company, based in Irving, Tex., said the price for its crude sold in the fourth quarter fell by an average of $10.50 a barrel from the comparable quarter in 1990. For that reason, earnings from worldwide exploration and production also fell, to $616 million from $862 million.
Worldwide refining profits declined, to $261 million from $304 million. The company posted an $84 million charge in the fourth quarter for projects to improve environmental standards at its refineries, compared with a charge of $108 million a year ago.
Chemical earnings fell, to $96 million from $102 million, as global demand weakened, but Exxon's chemical unit in the United States doubled its profits in the period, to $73 million from $37 million.
For the year, the most profitable in Exxon's history, earnings rose 11.8 percent, to $5.60 billion, or $4.45 a share, from $5.01 billion, or $3.96 a share, in 1990. Revenue was nearly flat, at $116.34 billion, compared with $116.94 billion.
Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman and chief executive, said virtually all of the higher profit came in the first quarter, when big refining profits in Europe and the Middle East enabled Exxon to earn $2.2 billion, or double the level of the following three quarters. He said that three-fourths of Exxon's profits and all of the profit growth came from outside the United States.
Exxon's share price rose $1.25 today, to $60.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Mobil
 Net income for the nation's second-largest oil company fell to $401 million in the quarter, or 97 cents a share, from $652 million, or $1.58 a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Revenues declined 14.2 percent, to $16.63 billion from $19.38 billion.
Mobil's operations for the quarter posted a deeper decline of 51.2 percent, after removing the effects of special charges in both quarters. The company added $12 million to operating earnings because of one-time charges in the most recent quarter. In the quarter a year ago, special charges pared earnings by $145 million.
Profits in worldwide exploration and production fell to $419 million, from $573 million, as prices for both crude oil and natural gas plummeted. Mobil's crude prices in the United States fell by an average of $10.64 a barrel, to $16.29, and in international operations by an average of $11.65 a barrel, to $20.60.
Refining earnings plunged to $37 million, from $258 million in the corresponding period a year ago. Excluding special items, earnings from operations were not as depressed, falling to $113 million from $224 million. The unit recorded a one-time gain of $74 million from asset sales in the 1990 quarter.
For the year, Mobil earned $1.92 billion, or $4.65 a share, compared with $1.93 billion, or $4.60 a share, in 1990. Revenues fell by 2.8 percent, to $62.68 billion from $64.47 billion.
Mr. Murray said Mobil, based in Fairfax, Va., increased its reserves during 1991, adding more oil than it produced. Production rose to record levels in Indonesia, the Beryl field of the North Sea and Nigeria.
Mobil's share price rose by 37.5 cents today, to $67.125, in trading on the Big Board.
 
Chevron
 The Chevron Corporation's net income was $39 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $633 million, or $1.80 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1990. Revenues fell 24.6 percent, to $10.40 billion from $13.80 billion.
The nation's fourth-largest oil company, Chevron reported last week that it would take a $244 million charge in the quarter, with $185 million allocated to layoffs and operating cutbacks at its refinery in Port Arthur, Tex.
In the United States, earnings from exploration and production fell, to $28 million from $325 million. The figure for the recent quarter was calculated following a charge of $84 million accumulated from losses on asset sales, reserves for environmental costs and unfavorable tax rulings. Profits for international exploration operations fell, to $157 million from $356 million.
The domestic refining unit lost $226 million, including the special charge of $244 million, while the international refining operation earned $150 million, down slightly from $160 million.
For the year, net income for the San Francisco-based company fell 40.3 percent, to $1.29 billion, or $3.69 a share, from $2.16 billion, or $6.10 a share, in 1990. Total revenues declined 4.0 percent, to $40.90 billion from $42.60 billion.
Chevron's share price fell 50 cents today, to $66.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expected to Push Germany to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
When the Group of Seven finance ministers meet Saturday on Long Island, the United States will continue its campaign to put pressure on Germany to lower interest rates as a way to promote economic growth around the world, American officials say.
With the American economy continuing to languish, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is expected to enlist France and some other industrial countries to call on Germany's central bank to reduce its interest rates. 
 But how successful he will be is unclear. When Germany raised its rates last month, its European allies complained to no avail.
The one-day meeting, which brings together the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada, has been called to discuss the world's economic situation and to confer on economic policies. The meeting is being held at the Garden City Hotel on Long Island because of its convenience to Kennedy Airport, where most of the Group of Seven officials will be arriving, Administration officials said.
 
Germany's Preoccupation
 Britain, France and Italy, which are all suffering from economic weakness, share Washington's concern that Germany's preoccupation with holding down inflation through high rates is braking their hopes for economic recovery.
"The Europeans are very concerned about the German policy mix," a senior Treasury official said.
But German officials said in interviews this week that they would continue with their tough anti-inflation policies, which aim in part to resist the double-digit wage demands of several large German unions. These officials say they hope the Bundesbank may be able to begin lowering the rates before long.
"Some countries will say we don't like the interest rate policy of the Bundesbank," said one official in Germany's Finance Ministry. "But we think it's better to have an economically stable Germany. If we adopt an easier monetary policy, it won't have much short-term effect in other countries and it could produce unfortunate developments for inflation in the longer term."
 
Aid for Ex-Soviet Nations
 The finance ministers are also expected to discuss the economic situation in the former Soviet Union. Following up on the 47-nation meeting in Washington this week on aiding Russia and the other republics, the seven finance ministers are expected to focus on the state of reforms and the details of allowing the republics to become members of the International Monetary Fund.
American officials say they hope that Russia and some of the other republics will be officially invited to join the I.M.F. this spring.
The officials are also expected to discuss exchange rate parities. Several European officials say they see no reason to change the dollar's parity with European currencies. However, as last week's intervention by the Federal Reserve to buy Japanese yen showed, at least some countries thought the yen was too weak against the dollar, especially with Japan's trade surplus with the United States growing.
In addition, the French Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, has called for allowing the yen to float upward against European currencies to help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the European Community.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower Amid Jitters on Conference

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against major foreign currencies in volatile, rumor-driven trading yesterday, with currency dealers jittery about the meeting of the finance ministers of the leading industrial democracies this weekend.
Gold prices fell. At the Republic National Bank of New York, bullion was quoted at $354.50 an ounce as of 4 P.M., off 10 cents from Thursday. At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fetched $354.40, down 20 cents from Thursday. 
 Hubert Pedroli, manager of corporate foreign exchange at Credit Suisse, said there was no rhyme or reason for the volatile trading during the session.
The dollar fell after a rumor circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying dollars. But traders said they saw no evidence of any central bank intervention.
Mr. Pedroli said intervention was unlikely ahead of the meeting of the Group of Seven nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- in Garden City, L.I.
A large portion of the trading was based on technical factors, with traders taking profits from Thursday's rally and staking out positions in advance of the Group of Seven meeting, Mr. Pedroli said.
Jeff Mondschein, foreign exchange manager for the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago, said traders exhibited anxious anticipation ahead of the Group of Seven meeting.
At such meetings, the finance ministers can strike agreements on valuing their currencies for global economic growth. Such agreements would have a significant impact on the foreign exchange markets.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8070, from $1.7960 late Thursday. In New York, the pound was worth $1.7955, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7850.
The dollar fell to 1.5865 German marks in London, down from 1.5950. In New York, the dollar closed at 1.5950 marks, down from 1.6064 late Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.34 yen, to a closing 124.57 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 123.45 yen. And in New York, the dollar fetched 123.53 yen, down from 123.80 yen late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.4165 Swiss francs, down from 1.4260; 1.16965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15955; 5.4375 French francs, down from 5.4780, and 1,200.50 Italian lire, down from 1,209.25.

HEADLINE: Where Recession Is an Ocean Away

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Less than four hours at sea, Stephen and Marion Bartlett of Mount Bethel, Pa., were at their usual table in the Queen's Grill on the Queen Elizabeth 2. "I don't care where the ship's going," Mrs. Bartlett said with a laugh, "just as long as it takes me with it."
As it so happens, the QE2 is taking the Bartletts around the world. They and about 250 other people who paid as much as $126,900 (double occupancy) are on board for a 100-day voyage to Honolulu, Bali, Hong Kong and 28 other warm-weather ports. By the time the ship returns to New York on April 14, winter and opening day of the 1992 baseball season will be only memories. 
 At a time when most of the travel industry still feels battered by the recession and fallout from the gulf war last year, the cruise business is one of the few bright spots. Spurred by heavy discounts and heavier advertising, cruise ships had an occupancy rate last year of about 90 percent for their 90,000 berths. Most of those bookings were for cruises of a week or less.
But no discounts are needed to attract world cruise passengers, at least not repeat passengers who have the time, money and inclination. Cunard, the QE2's owner, depends more on word-of-mouth publicity than on marketing.
Company officials estimate that only 20,000 such people in the world are circle-the-globe potential, and 9,000 of them belong to Cunard's World Club, which bestows an array of privileges on frequent travelers.
"Assuming they have the funds," said John Maxtone-Graham, a sea-travel historian, "world cruise passengers need make no other decision than to buy a ticket. Theirs is a moving resort that brings them to every corner of the globe. They enjoy impeccable service and unlimited servants, so nothing is required save their presence."
Of the thousands of cruises that will be offered this year, only five go around the world. It is easy to see why: World cruises tie up a ship for more than 25 percent of the year, making them a huge risk and a tremendous expense for a company. The 67,000-ton QE2, launched in 1967, carries a crew of more than 1,000 and burns 18 tons of fuel an hour, at an average cost of $75 a ton. Panama Canal tolls are $110,000 to $160,000, depending on the number of passengers.
The Sagafjord, a smaller vessel in Cunard's seven-ship fleet, left Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Jan. 6 for a 107-day world cruise. Aboard are 418 passengers who paid $30,340 to $74,490. The other world cruises, all currently under way, are the Canberra (90 days) and the Sea Princess (92 days), both of which belong to P & O Cruises. The other is Costa Cruise Lines' Danae, which left Genoa, Italy, last month on a 101-day cruise.
These days, such long cruises are economically possible only because they are segmented to fill the other berths with passengers who want to sail just 11 days or 2 weeks. That is what the other 3,750 QE2 passengers are doing.
"In the old days passengers could not sail on segments," Mr. Maxtone-Graham said. "They had to take the whole cruise or nothing."
 
Many Repeat the Trip
 But there certainly are people who want the whole cruise. The Bartletts, who have also made more than 30 trans-Atlantic crossings, are on their eighth world cruise aboard the QE2. That is far from a record. Kay Trafford, a soft-spoken widow from Norfolk, England, is on her 17th time around. Several other passengers have circled the globe on the QE2 at least 10 times since 1975. That is when Cunard reinstituted the world cruise, which it originated in 1922.
"But the record for world cruises probably belongs to a widow from Houston who died about a year ago," said Priscilla Hoye, a Cunard vice president. "She had taken 39 world cruises, the last 15 on the QE2."
Like Floyd Ingram, a well-weathered 84-year-old widower from Ogden, Utah, most of the world cruisers are Americans and average over 70 years old. Less than a day into his 15th world cruise, Mr. Ingram said, "I'm already planning to sign up for next year." On this year's cruise, he is looking forward to the ship's first calls at Monte Carlo, Monaco, and Rhodes, Greece.
Those "ancient mariners," as some crew members affectionately refer to the world travelers, are hardly symptomatic of the estimated four million passengers who took $5 billion in cruises last year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. One-half of all passengers are under 45, the association said, one-half earn no more than $35,000 a year, and the average fare is $185 to $240 a day, double occupancy, including air fare.
 
From $25,935
 The cost per person to go around the world on the QE2 is $25,935 for the lowest of the ship's 22 price categories, to $126,900 for the highest of four luxury categories. Almost 70 passengers are paying 15 percent more to room alone. In addition, two $453,170 apartments and two $407,800 apartments are booked for the entire trip. World-cruise passage includes first-class air fare.
"The economy clearly had an impact this year, because bookings are off about 20 percent," said Ronald A. Santangelo, Cunard's senior vice president of worldwide marketing and sales. "But the top 250 beds are filled, 80 percent of them for the full journey, and the next category is also close to being fully booked."
Founded in England by Samuel Cunard in 1840, the line was acquired in 1968 by Trafalgar House, P.L.C., a multinational conglomerate with headquarters in London. Its properties include seven hotels and resorts, including the Ritz in London and the Hotel Atop the Bellevue in Philadelphia.
For the first time in his 20-year experience, Mr. Santangelo said, the cruise booked "from the top down" -- that is, from the highest-priced berths to the lowest.
One possible explanation, Mr. Santangelo said, is that the low interest rates on savings have taken a toll even on people who normally could have afforded the lower-priced berths.
"There's a financial crisis, no doubt about it," said Nicolas Meliniotis, a chain-smoking resident of Nice, France. An inveterate traveler since his retirement in 1965 as a textile salesman, the spry Mr. Meliniotis, 82, considered staying home this year. But only briefly, because he stayed away last year out of worry about the impending Persian Gulf crisis. There were no QE2 world cruises in 1989 or 1990, because the ship was chartered by the Japanese ports of Yokohama and Osaka.
The QE2, longer than three football fields, also boasts a casino as well as more than a dozen designer boutiques featuring such names as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Harrods and Dunhill. It has a florist and, for the eight formal balls, a tuxedo rental shop.
 
'A Testament to Survival'
 For repeat passengers "the cruise is less an excursion than a testament to survival," Mr. Maxtone-Graham said. He lectured aboard the QE2 before debarking at St. Thomas, in the Virgin Islands.
Not all world cruise passengers are elderly. Joseph and Eileen Miele of Mendham, N.J., who are on their first world cruise, are 51 and 41, respectively. But the youngest of their three children is 21, and Mr. Miele is confident that his 20 companies (including a law office and real estate development) are in good hands. "We want to see the world while we can still walk," he said.
For the elderly, however, the world cruise offers passengers a chance to spend a lot of time with peers.
For Mrs. Trafford a world cruise is like a family reunion. "I have so many friends here, and I get such a welcome from the crew," she said. "I call them my QE2 family. We write letters and cards at Christmas. And it's much better than staying home in an empty house."
Mrs. Trafford's daughter, Susan Pollok, sailed with her from New York to Los Angeles, and her son and daughter-in-law will board in Singapore and sail to Athens.
 
Favorite Cruise Stories
 Many world cruisers know the crew and the officers. "A lot of them ask about our wives and families," said Colum Sanders, a butler on one of the ship's 13 decks. The convivial Mr. Sanders, a 42-year employee of Cunard, lives in Dublin the three months each year he is not at sea.
Regular passengers also delight in regaling newcomers with stories of life aboard a floating resort hotel.
Some love to tell about the passengers who spend their $100,000 for the cruise and then take every meal in their cabins, never emerging the entire trip.
Other favorites are about marriages that dissolved during world cruises. It seems that even wealthy couples married for years found out they could not bear being confined with each other for 100 days.

University Tightens Its Belt, Loses a Head Football Coach

 BODY:
JIM REID, a longtime football coach at the University of Massachusetts, resigned yesterday after being told that budget cuts would curtail athletic scholarships.
"All I am is just one more victim of what has been a disastrous economy statewide and nationally," said the 41-year-old Reid, who had been a coach at the school in Amherst, Mass., for 18 years, the last six as a head coach. 
 RICHARD O'BRIEN, chancellor of the state university with an enrollment of 17,400 students, said that three years of reduced state funding, shrinking revenues from student fees and higher operating costs meant less money for the football program.
Reid said he was told on Thursday by the UMass athletic director, FRANK McINERNEY, that all $80,000 allotted for football scholarships in 1993 would be withheld.
"When you go into people's homes and make promises, they listen to you, they believe you," Reid said. "When you have to come back and take away those promises, there's no alternative. You have to resign."
Reid's teams had an overall record of 37-28-2 and won three Yankee Conference championships, the last in 1990. UMass had a record of 4-7 last season.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Uproar Over Mariners Creates Bad Feeling in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Government officials and businessmen in Japan reacted with indignation and puzzlement today over reports that American baseball officials were opposed to the offer by a Japanese company to help buy the Seattle Mariners.
Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of the Nintendo Company, which has teamed up with a group of businessmen in Washington State to bid for the Mariners, held a news conference today to explain the offer. He said he might be forced to withdraw the bid if the public reaction was negative. Although the reception in Seattle was favorable, the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, said it was unlikely the bid would be approved. 
 Yamauchi said the company should not be criticized for making a takeover attempt because it was first approached by political leaders in the United States.
"This is entirely different from an acquisition of an American corporation by a Japanese corporation," said Yamauchi.
 
'Simply a Response'
 "It is simply a response to the urgings of the Senator and Governor of Washington," Yamauchi said at a news conference in Kyoto, where his company has its headquarters. "A foundation was established, and upon request, I invested in that foundation."
If accepted and approved by baseball officials, the offer by the family that founded Nintendo would represent the first time that a potential investor outside North America had bought a controlling interest in an American club.
The controversy over the bid for the Mariners was one of a string of episodes in the last week that have emphasized what some say is growing American resentment of Japanese economic strength.
News reports have focused all week on American anger over a comment by a leader of the Japanese parliament that American workers are lazy and illiterate. There has also been considerable publicity over the rejection by Los Angeles of a previously awarded bid by subsidiary of the Sumitomo Corporation for construction of railway cars.
Japanese officials have been careful not to denounce the County of Los Angeles by name, but some warn that the cancellation of the Los Angeles contract could have damaging repercussions for the American drive to get construction contracts in Japan.
"This new Japan bashing is very unfortunate," said a senior economic policymaker, asking not to be identified. "Any backlash in Japan will make it more difficult to make progress in our own government procurement procedures."
He was referring to Japan-United States pacts in recent years permitting American construction companies to bid on dozens of projects, many of them airports and other projects put up by local authorities.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Masamichi Hanabusa, said that the latest efforts to block Japanese activity may be part of a wave of criticism or Japan bashing, but that this was a temporary phenomenon caused in part by the recession.
In defending the Nintendo baseball proposal, Yamauchi said the bid was in keeping with the community-minded spirit of the American subsidiary of the company, which has made considerable money in America.
"This is a kind of social service, not a business activity intended to make a profit," Yamauchi told The Yomiuri newspaper today. He said it was not his intention to change the name of the Mariners or to utilize the Mariners' name in the Nintendo business.
Echoing this view, Hanabusa of the Foreign Ministry said he could not understand why there would be a negative reaction to a possible Nintendo purchase, because it should be seen as part of Japanese efforts to support community activities.

HEADLINE: Just Who Can Raise the Shades and Peek Into Private Matters?

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Louis Brandeis once said that "privacy is the most comprehensive of all rights."
Now the issue of privacy is inspiring new and heated debate. On the one hand, credit bureaus and others who gather personal data about consumers say that they must have it to provide lenders and employers with information they need to do business. On the other are those who say that too much private information about the way people live, spend and save is becoming available to industry and government without the knowledge of the individuals involved. This, they say, infringes people's rights. 
 A group has now been formed to strengthen the right of privacy and develop new ways to do so. The coalition, established in June, is the United States Privacy Council, and its leaders are some of the foremost proponents of privacy in the United States.
Evan Hendricks, publisher of the Privacy Times newsletter, is chairman. The 10-member board also includes Mary Gardner Jones, a former member of the Federal Trade Commission; Eli Noam, a former member of the New York State Public Service Commission, and John Barker, a senior program associate of the National Consumers League.
 
What the Computer Reveals
 "Privacy has exploded into a major consumer issue of the 90's, because how one fares as a consumer increasingly depends on how one looks in the computer," Mr. Hendricks said. "A lot of times people lack the legal ability to control their personal information."
Who has the information? Not only are Federal, state and local governments repositories of an array of facts and figures, but credit bureaus, direct marketing companies, credit card issuers, insurers and other private concerns are big collectors of personal data. And the way this private information is sometimes used for commercial purposes is a continuing concern for privacy experts.
The Privacy Council, which has an office in Washington, has developed broad objectives, many of which would require Federal legislation. Here are some of them:
*Requiring companies to get the individual's consent before transferring personal information electronically.
*Encouraging the development of new technology to protect privacy.
*Analyzing how government record-keeping systems affect privacy.
*Opposing the idea, popular among some law-enforcement agencies, of a national identification card.
On March 17, the group will hold its first seminar in Washington on specific privacy problems and possible solutions. The seminar will precede a three-day conference on broader issues involving computers and privacy, sponsored by organizations that include the Privacy Council.
The Federal Office of Consumer Affairs, a White House agency, has supported a variety of ways to tighten the protection of privacy. They include letting consumers decide whether they want their names and information about them to be given to direct marketing programs, and telling people when and why certain personal information is collected.
Last month, Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which seeks to reduce unwanted telephone and facsimile solicitations. The measure, which has been signed by President Bush, requires the Federal Communications Commission to establish a system for listing people who do not want unsolicited sales calls, especially from dialing machines that play recorded messages.
"We're trying to balance what the business community's interests are with consumer concerns," said Ann Windham Wallace, director of the Consumer Affairs Office. "We feel that we are making progress."
But privacy advocates maintain that there is much more to be done.
"The Government traditionally thinks it has the right to collect arbitrary information about people and make it available to anyone," said John Gilmore, a council board member. "I think privacy is fundamental to having a tolerant society, and tolerance is a way to avoid friction and violence." Mr. Gilmore is also a director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which focuses on the interaction of computers and society.
One issue for council members is that private companies often have unrestricted use of information that individuals originally provided voluntarily for a specific purpose. Many consumer advocates say that such use violates an understanding established between two parties when the information was first provided.
"Consumers don't realize that when they sign warranty cards they can give others a detailed profile of themselves," said Ms. Jones, the former trade commission member. "They give people who want to abuse it potentially damaging information." Ms. Jones is now president of the Consumer Interest Research Institute, an organization that specializes in privacy and telecommunications.
Another issue is the growth of technology that makes it easier to collect personal information. For instance, some companies are already issuing "smart cards" that look and act like credit cards and contain a great deal of data about individuals on a tiny memory chip. One example is a plastic medical history card issued by health insurance companies to policyholders, who are required to use it when having prescriptions filled.
"We're particularly worried where a person has a smart card, but doesn't know what information is on the card," said Mr. Barker of the National Consumers League. "It might save you a lot of time and trouble to carry one small plastic card listing your blood type and medications. But you may also be carrying around a lot of derogatory information about yourself on that card that somebody else can read."
 
Privacy Commission Sought
 The council is also trying to foster the establishment of a Government data protection board or privacy commission, similar to those in Great Britain, France and Germany. And the European Community is proposing to standardize privacy laws and to guarantee individual privacy in its member countries, particularly for data on race, religion and health.
"There are problems in maintaining an international free flow of information," said Mr. Noam, who is now a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. "Some countries are extremely protective of data, while others are less so."
The sparkplug of the Privacy Council is Mr. Hendricks, who founded Privacy Times in 1981 and has been trying ever since to raise public interest and awareness on the subject. Consumers, he said, should "demand the right to know what information is being kept on them, the right to correct it when it is wrong and the right to stop it from going to people who have no business seeing it."

A New View of History

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
There is a one-liner I first heard in the 9th or 10th grade that has become a metaphor for the reality of loss, gain and fairness in America.
It came after someone had left a seat at the movie, only to return moments later to find that seat had been taken. 
 "This is my seat," he said. "I was here first."
The person sitting down looked up and grunted: "So were the Indians."
For me, that line and this Super Bowl are trenchant reminders of loose ends and business that must be respectfully addressed and finished.
The residue of this nation's unresolved history continues to filter through the vents and ducts of our society, despite feverish efforts to seal them up. Beginning last summer with the Major League Baseball playoffs, and continuing here at Super Bowl XXVI, American Indians have demonstrated against the use of their religious and spiritual symbols as mascots for teams.
There is perhaps no better place than Minneapolis, no better institution than the National Football League, no more fitting event than the Super Bowl to play out the issues of race and territory that are tied up in the protest.
Minneapolis has the United States' eighth largest urban population of American Indians. The N.F.L. has a persistent racial problem that is more spiritual than numeric. The Super Bowl is a grand mirage of excess amid a recession.
Super Bowl week began on Tuesday when Deacon Jones, a Hall of Fame defensive end, fired a shot at the N.F.L. from Calgary, where he said that racism in the N.F.L. forced him to take a job in marketing with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League.
Later that day, Bruce Smith of the Buffalo Bills told of hate mail he had received in Buffalo.
On Saturday, members of the American Indian Movement will be at the University of Minnesota to protest the University of Illinois' use of an Indian mascot. On Sunday, A.I.M. and other groups will demonstrate at the Metrodome.
Growing numbers of people wish it would all just go away. Unfortunately, the nation's complex and bitter racial history never percolates far from the surface, and it's virtually impossible to escape. No matter how much the history is revised, expunged, misrepresented or ignored, the truth never entirely disappears. It always seems to be there, waiting to be discovered -- be it at the World Series, the Olympics or here at frosty Super Bowl XXVI.
Obviously, Washington has been a primary target of criticism. Most Indians feel that the organization's nickname is a vulgar, commercial denigration of a proud heritage.
The irony of the Indians' protest is that "Redskins" is the offensive term, but the man after whom the Bills were named played a major role in facilitating the Indians' current predicament.
Bill Cody may have been a great person in the context of American folklore, but in relationship to American Indians, Cody -- like Christopher Columbus -- was no hero.
Buffalo Bill helped find and kill Indians -- along with the buffaloes on which they depended for food, shelter and clothing. He participated in several major campaigns against the Indians, and as a scout for the United States Cavalry, Cody was part of the early "urban removal project" in which land was cleared -- of Indians -- to make room for settlers. While descendants of Africans worked the plantations, Indians were gradually forced onto reservations.
Decades later, the plantation and the reservation motifs represent profound truths about the United States that, it would seem, must be reconciled before we truly become united.
And there's a lot of reconciling to be done.
During a symposium on racism in sports and the news media here this week, Matthew Little, president of the Minneapolis National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, called on all professional athletes, especially black ones, to protest the use of emblems and nicknames offensive to American Indians.
That will be a hard sell.
Black athletes in particular sometimes fail to hear the echoes. They fail to see the connection between the way they are viewed by management, the manner in which management trivializes something like the Indian issue, and the failure of even great black athletes to be reabsorbed by the system in significant numbers.
So they retire after how many ever Pro Bowl years of toeing the line, then rush back to the table only to discover that their seats have been taken.
Then they say: "But I was here first."
So were the Indians.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXVI NOTEBOOK;
Gambling Hot Line Awaits Flood of Calls

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Super Bowl XXVI is the jewel in the crown of the National Football League season, but the frenzied interest in the game also produces the single biggest day of betting fever for the nation's compulsive gamblers.
As legal sports books in Nevada prepare to handle at least $45 million to $50 million in Super Bowl wagers, the Compulsive Gamblers Hotline (1-800-332-0402) is planning for the usual onslaught of crisis calls during and after the game. 
 "Last year we had 400 calls in two days, compared with 300 calls in a month," said Dr. Valerie Lorenz, executive director of the National Center for Pathological Gambling in Baltimore, which operates the hot line. Calls usually start coming in during the game, she said, and continue for a few days afterward.
"For a compulsive gambler," she said, "the anxiety level during the game is most stressful to their bodies. They are so stressed out that they have heart palpitations, migraines and skin rashes. When they lose a lot of money, the bookies and guilt come after them."
Lorenz said the Super Bowl comes at a particularly bad time for compulsive gamblers, a month after Christmas, compounding feelings of guilt for losing money and the shame of continuing to hide the gambling addiction from friends and families. The Super Bowl is likely the culmination of a season's worth of losing money, exacerbating the compulsive gambler's illness.
"We expect to get a lot of suicide calls," Lorenz said. "We've gotten people who say they're going to rob a bank to pay their bookies."
Callers are told of options for help. "We let them know we understand their illness," said Lorenz, "and it helps that people like Art Schlichter and Pete Rose had gambling problems."
Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Nev., the sports books are preparing for the anticipated onslaught of last-minute weekend betting. "People don't get going until Sunday, really," said John Harper of Las Vegas Sports Consultants, an oddsmaker and consultant to 40 sports books in Nevada.
"People make it a holiday to come in over the weekend and make a bet on Sunday," he said Friday. "Seventy-five percent of the action is yet to come."
Until the bets are in, however, Harper said it's too soon to tell whether the country's recession, which has started to affect the Las Vegas resort business, will impact betting, legal and illegal.
Estimates of illegal gambling in all its permutations on the Super Bowl range as high as $3 billion. But Eugene Christiansen, whose consulting firm, Christiansen-Cummings Associates, has studied gambling extensively, says virtually any estimate is dubious.
"We estimated all forms of illegal gambling at $26 billion in 1989," he said, "but we found that the statistical basis, by the National Gambling Commission, had no meaning."
 
Not Counting Chickens . . .
 Coach Marv Levy of the Bills refused to have his picture taken with the Super Bowl trophy today, saying it would be presumptuous to do so.
"Fellows, I'd prefer not to pose with the trophy," Levy said when photographers made their way to the stage after his news conference here today. "I'll be glad to pose with it on Monday if we win. I posed with it last year and they told me that the pictures wouldn't be used if we didn't win, and they were used."
Coach Joe Gibbs of the Redskins had no problem posing with the trophy today.
 
Madden on Instant Replay
 "What do you hear about instant replay?" asks CBS's John Madden. "I hear they may not keep it."
Indeed, National Football League owners may vote out the oft-criticized system for reviewing officials' calls via instant replay. But Madden insists they should improve the system, not junk it.
"They can improve it," he said. "First, make the screens larger. Second, give them clickers to watch the tape, the way coaches look at tape, rather than going back and forth the way they do. Third, get younger guys in there to run it. Old guys aren't used to VCRs. The older you are, the more likely you are to have the '12:00' blinking on your VCR. Young guys are better at things like this. I can't even win the video game I created. My kids beat me and younger kids can beat them."
 
Just Another Assignment
 CBS's Lesley Visser, who has been following the Washington Redskins, will preside over the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the winner of Super Bowl XXVI.
Visser's presence in such a role Sunday is believed to be a first for a woman, but she is approaching it as just another assignment. "I'll know what questions to ask," she said, "and I hope it will be entertaining and smooth."
 
'Road to the Super Bowl'
 Call it SabolVision: For 24 hours a day, televisions at major hotels in Minneapolis are playing the grandiose, filmed epics made by NFL Films, of which Steve Sabol is president, producer and chief mythologizer.
"Steve, you're my night light," a friend told him the other day, referring to the round-the-clock onslaught of Sabol's works.
Sabol's films are the type that the peerless Russian director, Sergei Eisenstein, might have made if he had graduated from the battleship Potemkin to the battleground of men and pigskins.
Thunderous music, dramatic camerawork and terse, muscular narration make Sabol's films into stories of courageous men who clash like titans from the University of Mount Olympus each Sunday on fields as contested as St. Lo.
The apex of Sabol's season is his annual "Road to the Super Bowl," which recaps the themes and major stories of the season and how the Buffalo Bills and Washington Redskins made it to Minneapolis. The hourlong film appears at 3 P.M. today on WNBC (Channel 4), and if there's a star of the program, it is the dancing, rapping Atlanta Falcons and their head coach, Jerry Glanville.
Sabol films are easy to spot, with their strong storylines, heavy use of slow-motion, generous helpings of comments from players and coaches wearing microphones, and never, ever, any videotape.
Sabol, who is 49 years old, said, "We deliver the metaphor for the joy of competition, no matter how cynical you are."
Perhaps the most dramatic moment of "Road to the Super Bowl" does not take place on the field, but on the sideline, when Kansas City Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer talked to an upset linebacker, Derrick Thomas, like an exasperated parent to a recalcitrant child. "Look at me, son!" he implored. "Listen to me!"
Said Sabol: "We work six months a year to get coaches to be miked. We have no privileged access. It's a sales job."

HEADLINE: P.O.W.'s Questioned by K.G.B. in Vietnam

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was bewildered on reading your Jan. 13 editorial on the continuing question of U.S. servicemen missing in action in Vietnam. At no time in the United States or anywhere else did I say, as you assert, that American prisoners of war were interrogated by K.G.B. agents inside the Soviet Union years after the war was over. The public record shows that all my statements on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue related to a handful of American servicemen who were interviewed by Soviet intelligence officers in Vietnam, not in the Soviet Union. 
 I first broached this subject many months ago, and cited it simply as a K.G.B. field operation, just another episode in the cold war. All my later statements are based not so much on my own recollections as on conversations with my former subordinate, Col. Oleg Nechiporenko, who elaborated on the circumstances of his two visits to Vietnam.
These conversations took place from September to December 1991 after several journalists and at least two United States officials asked me to clarify certain points.
I must admit I was shocked and chagrined by Colonel Nechiporenko's retraction of his own words, a cowardly act prompted and probably dictated by his former superiors in the intelligence service. But this is yet another story that merits separate consideration.
I fully comprehend the emotional side of the P.O.W. story and sympathize with American families as well as with untold numbers of Vietnamese whose kin fell victim to the war.
For this reason, I suggest we look beyond the inaccuracies and discrepancies, however nagging they may be, and concentrate on the principal issue: Are there United States P.O.W.'s still in Vietnam? Are they kept against their will in concentration camps or solitary confinement?
One may call my statement risky, but I do state unequivocally that I see no reason -- political, military, economic or practical -- why the Vietnamese should keep any United States servicemen in detention. Vietnam is far more interested in normalizing its relations with the United States than in creating additional obstacles to progress in this area.
I do not exclude a possibility that a few former U.S. servicemen, for personal or other reasons, got stuck in Vietnam or neighboring countries, but I'm sure that was their choice rather than due to pressure from local authorities or deliberate policies of the Vietnamese Government.
I hope the joint U.S.-Vietnamese commission now set up to look into the matter and possibly a similar U.S.-Russian commission will produce sufficient evidence to eliminate suspicions and unwarranted accusations from whatever source.

HEADLINE: Syria's Game

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is a staff writer for this magazine.

 BODY:
At a school in Damascus on a rainy day in early December, a well-dressed young woman stepped up to the ballot box to vote on whether Hafez al-Assad, Syria's sole ruler for 21 years, should be given an unprecedented fourth seven-year term as President. Smiling broadly, she withdrew a safety pin from her purse, pricked the index finger of her right hand and marked the green circle labeled "Yes" on the ballot in her own blood.
Not all Syrians were as enthusiastic. At the school that day, two hapless voters filled in the black "No" circle instead of the green, the color of Islam. But members of the President's ruling Baath Party overseeing the balloting quickly detected the mistakes. Surely, the officials asked the befuddled pair, they had intended to vote for the President? Yes, indeed, each rapidly agreed. The ballots were promptly discarded and replaced by Syria's version of politically correct votes. 
 To no one's suprise, the Syrian people voted overwhelmingly -- by 99.9 percent, according to Government statistics -- to extend President Assad's rule, with only about 50,000 of the 6.5 million electorate failing to vote, an extraordinarily high turnout.
"Even if Allah had run, he wouldn't have done as well," a Syrian writer said.
Inexplicably, some 360 people were reported to have voted no. According to a diplomat who discussed the results with the Minister of Interior, 334 of them were Syrians living overseas who had voted at their local embassies. And the others? "We're looking for them," the local joke goes.
But to many Syrians, the "bayaa," as the election was called -- an Arabic term referring to the pledge of loyalty Islam's elders gave their prophet Mohammed's successor -- was no joke. Rather, it was bizarre, disturbing and deeply embarrassing.
"Even Romania knew it had to have an alternative candidate on the ballot," sputtered a long-serving Western diplomat who professes to admire the country.
Syrians agree the event was, as the state-controlled press called it, "unprecedented." There were days of rallies and endless tributes to "our father," "our saviour," "our beloved," the "darling of the people;" displays of sword-twirling and folk dancing at night; banners professing unswerving devotion to Assad from all of Syria's unions and professional and trade associations -- "Syria's pharmacists salute the nation's No. 1 pharmacist" proclaimed one -- and hundreds of thousands of posters and photos of Assad in more than a hundred different guises that plastered windows of buses, cars and almost every urban inch of the country.
For days, Syrians speculated: Why had Assad, a man noted for his political cunning, sanctioned such an obvious sham? Why had the man who had destroyed any semblance of unmonitored political opposition and who enjoyed a genuine, if narrow, base of support, felt the need to stage an $80 million show of devotion? Why had he resorted to the discredited tactics of the defunct Kremlin to justify his legitimacy at the same time that he was repositioning his traditionally pro-Soviet state in America's orbit? Why had he authorized an election that borrowed as much from the Marx Brothers as from George Orwell?
Some dismiss the display as standard dictatorial behavior. "You can't judge this in Western terms," a Jordanian analyst says. "It's the only thing leaders like Assad know how to do or risk doing."
But others see it as a message from Assad to the United States, whose influence in the region after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the crushing defeat of Iraq, is paramount: Don't impose your values and institutions on us. Syrians support me because I represent stability and security.
"The election was an insult to us and to you," says Jamal Atassi, a former Cabinet minister and one of the few opposition politicians permitted to criticize the Government openly because of his participation in Assad's takeover in 1970. "It is a way of saying: 'You want democracy? Here it is.' It is a way of portraying Syrians as backward, as a rabble who should appropriately be ruled by a strongman."
If nothing else, the absurd spectacle demonstrated the regime's total control over its citizens' public behavior. "Ten years ago, when the Moslem Brothers were assassinating officials and blowing up buildings, we couldn't have risked turning a million people loose in the streets," one Syrian official observes, referring to the efforts in the early 1980's by Islamic fanatics to topple the Assad regime. In 1982, Assad responded by ordering the massacre of the activists, along with some 10,000 Sunni Moslem civilians, in the city of Hama. Protests have since ceased. "For the referendum, you had a million people in the street and not a stone was thrown," the official says.
But above all, this complex signal to the outside world and to the "masses," as Syrian political rhetoric continues to label its citizens, reflects Assad's determination to adjust his country's policies without fundamentally changing the country itself, to adapt to an American-dictated new world order without relinquishing political control and to hold firm in playing what he believes is Syria's natural role as a power broker in the region.
In a world of crumbling dictatorships and decentralized communications, of faxes and mobile phones that intelligence services find frustrating to monitor, Syria's centralized, autocratic and repressive regime is an anachronism, as antique as its staged election rallies, its frayed telephone lines and the 1950's-vintage DeSotos, Packards and Studebakers that hurtle through the ancient streets and broad modern boulevards of Damascus.
The Soviet Union, its key patron and weapons supplier, is gone. America and its concerns must be placated. As a result, there are fewer arrests or reports of torture. Syrians feel freer to voice their civic anger publicly, so long as they stop short of criticizing Assad directly.
The regime faces another source of pressure: the decrepit economy. Assad has embarked on a program of economic liberalization and privatization to redress the heavy-handed statist policies that crippled his country's Soviet-bloc counterparts. But the economy, a mix of textiles, agriculture and, lately, oil, is still a mess. It depends heavily on smuggling and drug revenue for hard currency and has yet to win the confidence of wealthy investors at home and abroad. Most ominously, its middle class, once the largest and most entrenched in the Arab world, is being pauperized.
These pressures -- from within and without -- have produced what Patrick Seale, a British journalist who has long followed Syria, calls "a quiet revolution" that reflects Assad's mastery of his political environment.
Assad knows that Syria must continue opening up economically, or risk disappearing. Yet, if the change is too fast, too poorly managed or too profound, his regime will also be jeopardized, as the fate of the Eastern European regimes demonstrates. Can Syria open up economically, without opening up politically?
A familiar predicament of aging dictatorships, it is one that Assad has never before had to confront.
NOTHING SEEMS TO infuriate Assad as much as comparisons with Saddam Hussein. Syria and Iraq are ruled ostensibly by rival factions of the Baath Socialist Party, but in reality, by stubborn, often ruthless men who operate, more or less, alone. Both men come from minorities and depend heavily on family and clan ties to survive: Saddam is a Sunni Moslem in a majority Shiite country; Assad is an Alawite, a secretive offshoot of Shiite Islam, which constitutes only 12 percent of Syria's population. Both regimes are secular, vehemently anti-Israeli and outwardly proponents of socialism; both are notorious violators of human rights and anti-terrorism conventions.
Yet at closer glance, the differences are more striking than the similarities.
"Syrians are Levantines, people of the Mediterranean, natural traders by virtue of history and geography," says Mohammed Salman, Syria's Minister of Information. Iraqis, by contrast, are "tough central Asians."
Sadallah Wannus, one of Syria's finest playwrights and critics, agrees. "Saddam Hussein is very stupid," he says. "Hafez Assad's Government is much smarter."
And unlike Iraq, Syria is no longer ruled primarily through acts of terror, but rather by the mere threat of it. After the Hama massacre, the arrests of thousands of prisoners for political dissent and what Middle East Watch, the private, New York-based human rights group, estimates is the killing of at least 10,000 Syrians in the past decade, Syria has largely been subdued. Most troublemakers are in jail or in exile, so the Government no longer needs to be brutal to make its point. "The most deadening censorship is now self-censorship," says Mamduh Udwan, a witty and popular Alawite playwright.
The regime functions thanks to what one Syrian political scientist calls a "merchant-military complex." The Alawite ruling clique, which controls the military and Syria's 15 different intelligence and paramilitary services, needs the country's merchants to survive, this observer explains. "The merchants have risen largely at the expense of the country's traditional elite, the Sunni landowning aristocracy. As long as they avoid politics, the merchants are given considerable latitude."
Whereas Iraqi businessmen before the Persian Gulf crisis were terrified by contact with foreign journalists, most Syrian businessmen are open and hospitable, eager to entertain foreigners in their apartments with lavish buffets of endless trays of excellent food and wine, to talk frankly about their country, even to complain about its economic management, or mismanagement. And unlike the sinister disco culture and artificial night life of Baghdad, Damascus is a genuinely lively capital by Arab standards, with some experimental theater, an occasional film festival, poetry readings, concerts, a celebrated souk (or bazaar) that stays open late and restaurants serving Arabic and Western cuisine that are crowded night and day.
SOMETHING OF AN intellectual life has survived in Syria. Although many of the country's best writers, artists and intellectuals have been driven into exile, some have refused to budge, risking harassment or worse but providing Syrian culture with refreshing pockets of vitality.
Wannus, the playwright, says the Government needs intellectuals like him to demonstrate to Western journalists that there is freedom of expression and democracy in modern Syria. His last play, "The Rape," which contains a sympathetic and hopeful dialogue between the author and an anti-Zionist Israeli psychiatrist, was performed in Cairo and Amman, but not in Damascus. "Do you know that Al Thawra and al-Baath newspapers are barred from even publishing my name?" he says. "Like Israel, I have become an abstraction."
Protest poetry, in particular, retains its traditional popularity here in what the state-controlled press, ever faithful to the empty slogans of Arab unity, calls "the beating heart of Arab nationalism." University students in Aleppo recently packed a hall to hear the poet Ali Kanaan recite "Shards," which appears to attack Assad: "The King is made of glass. His castles are of clay. But back in the henhouse, rights are luxuries. So beware of fleeing the coop, and don't bother spending too much on fodder."
Duraid Lahham, a slapstick comedian and film director who often presents savagely satirical portraits of Arab life and politics, says he avoids censorship by never mentioning venue. "All of my signs, streets and names are fictitious," Lahham says. "You can never tell what country you're in. But invariably, audiences in each Arab country believe my film is about their country."
Lahham has been permitted to work, thanks in large part to the influence of a powerful fan -- President Assad. But even some of Lahham's recent work has not been shown in Syria. In "Cheers for the Nation," the hero, played by Lahham, is interrogated by the security forces for protesting his daughter's death in a letter to Amnesty International. "Why are you laughing and not screaming?" the security agent shouts as he sends an electric shock into the hapless Lahham, who is tied to a crudely wired chair. "Because the electricity has reached my tail before it has come to my village," he replies.
Lahham blames Syria's "demigod bureaucrats" who "outdo each other in poetic obsequiousness" to the leader.
The election is a case in point. Shortly before the voting, Assad appeared on the balcony of his modest villa -- he has never moved into the new lavish, Saudi-financed Presidential Palace atop the sand-colored mountain that dominates Damascus -- to greet his fans and thank them for their support. That night, 23 minutes of Syria's 30-minute evening news program was devoted to the balcony scene, in which Assad uttered not a single word.
Rivaling such looniness were two Government-organized "spontaneous" outpourings of affection and support for the chief staged by Syria's now-tiny Jewish community of 3,800, whose numbers stood at 50,000 in 1900 before mass emigration began. The first was an evening auto rally, which the Syria Times, the only English-language newspaper, described as an occasion for Syria's Jews to drive their "fancy cars" through the streets of Damascus, a not-so-subtle reference to the widely held Syrian belief that the country's Jews are the richest minority.
But the rally was not covered in the Western media, as the Ministry of Information had hoped. When news groups complained that a procession of cars -- at night, in the pouring rain -- was hardly compelling television, a second spontaneous demonstration for Assad was organized -- this time a march -- on foot, in broad daylight -- through the Jewish quarter of the Old City.
Since there were too few Jews for a proper march, other Syrians were added to the procession. For the first time ever, Syrian television broadcast the Jews of Damascus parading through the streets under a banner in Hebrew letters. But when a Jewish merchant whom the Government had ordered to attend the rally was asked what the banner said, he answered that he could not read it: "Most of us speak only Arabic and English."
The banner was eventually translated by one of the many young men there dressed in black leather jackets and white bobby socks, standard attire of the Mukhabarat, one of the main intelligence agencies. It read: "Yes to Assad, Man of Peace."
Jews, even more than other Syrians, are closely monitored. And though they are free to practice their religion, many would emigrate if they could. "I think about three-quarters of the community would leave," a young Jew says. "But I admire Assad; I support him. If it weren't for him, the Moslem Brothers and the Sunni majority would slit our throats."
Almost every human rights report asserts that Jews are unable to travel outside the country as a family, but Syrian officials deny that they are virtual hostages.
"They are citizens like everyone else," Farouk al- Sharaa, Syria's Foreign Minister asserts in an interview. "In fact, they're better off than other Syrians. They don't serve in the military. That is a privilege."
HARAA HAS become a kind of folk hero since he attacked Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir of Israel at the Mideast peace talks last October in Madrid. It was Sharaa who cast aside his prepared text and waved around a photo of a much younger Shamir, whom he called a terrorist on the run from the British mandate government. The display, which befuddled or enraged Westerners, won praise among Arab audiences. The Syrian Foreign Minister articulated a widespread rage about what many Arabs see as an unending stream of American-sanctioned concessions to Israel in the peace process and a reflection of a perceived American double standard in its views of terrorism.
"Syrians desperately want peace," one Western diplomat says. "But intellectuals and businessmen alike don't want to 'surrender' or 'capitulate' to the Israelis. Many see this peace process as fatally skewed in Israel's favor. They don't believe that Israel is willing to trade occupied territory for peace, and they don't believe the United States is going to force it to do so."
In fact, one of the most striking aspects of political rhetoric in Syria is the extensive and growing skeptisism about Assad's participation in the peace talks, as well as lingering disgust with Syria's support for what is called America's "massacre" of the Iraqi people in the Gulf war.
In a new book on Syria, two Middle East scholars, Alasdair Drysdale and Raymond A. Hinnebusch, argue that Assad has long believed that an accord with Israel -- one restoring Syrian sovereignty to the Golan Heights and granting Palestinians some political rights -- would enhance his standing within Syria and the Arab world. But Syria's intellectuals are still steeped in the rejectionist Arab nationalism that their leader had preached until the Gulf war. Their hard-line rhetoric also reflects their country's isolation under the Assad regime.
Indeed, many of the most ardent champions of liberalization and democratization within Syria are also the harshest critics of Syria's participation in the Gulf war and the American-sponsored peace talks. Udwan, the playwright, for instance, was among 60 writers and intellectuals who signed a petition protesting the American bombing of Baghdad. While several signatories were questioned by police for having signed the petition and three freelance writers for Syrian radio were barred from entering the broadcast center, no one was arrested or tortured. "This is a sure sign that things are loosening up," Udwan suggests.
But it may also indicate that Assad, too, is a cliche Arab who shares his people's visceral disdain for contacts with the neighbor and enemy whom 40 years of Syrian propaganda has branded the Zionist entity. Assad may talk of his sincere desire for peace to visiting dignitaries, but the message at home is different. During the Madrid peace conference, for example, Syrian television never showed a single picture of an Israeli delegate. And the Government has continued to jam Jordanian television, only two hours away from the Syrian capital, which provides detailed coverage of Israel and the peace process.
"Syria, a country of wonders!" Wannus says with a sigh. "Three years ago, they arrested people for not being anti-American. Today, they threaten to arrest you for being anti-American."
PARTICIPATION IN THE peace process is just one of many concessions President Assad has made to win Washington's favor. His adroit political maneuvering and dazzling shifts in foreign policy -- among them, his literal and figurative embrace of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, whom he had ostracized for eight years -- reflect a dexterity that Arab and Western diplomats alike have long begrudgingly admired.
"Assad is going to the talks because he has no choice," a friend and admirer says. "But he also thinks that it's safe for him to do so. At best, he stands an outside chance of getting all his territory back and securing political rights for the Palestinians. While he fears that America may try to pressure him into making unacceptable concessions, he has become convinced that Israel will not yield land for peace, and therefore, that there is little danger of an accord."
In the meantime, the friend argues, Assad loses nothing -- indeed, gains a great deal -- by talking to Israel: trade with the West, Arab cash and recognition of his indispensable role in restoring stability in Lebanon and, not incidentally, securing the influence there that he has sought for 16 years. Assad, true to his nationalism, has always considered Lebanon part of "Greater Syria," as indeed it was until the French and British carved up the realm, which also included Jordan and what is today Israel.
He is careful to remain on close terms with revolutionary Iran, which much to the horror of fellow Arabs, he supported throughout the Iran-Iraq war.
And while he waits and plays the American game, new options may appear. If and when Saddam Hussein is overthrown, Syria could well resume contacts with Iraq, a senior Syrian official suggests. In fact, another high-placed Arab official reports, Iraqi and Syrian oil officials have already discussed a possible reopening of the pipeline between them that was closed during the Gulf crisis. Moreover, Assad, in his last meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, threatened to make the exclusion of Iraq from the Middle East peace talks an issue if he felt ill-served by the Americans, Syrian sources say.
According to Mustafa Tlas, Syria's Deputy Prime Minister and long-serving Defense Minister, Assad began repositioning his country long before Moscow informed him in 1989 that it would not -- indeed, could no longer afford to -- provide Syria with weapons that would supposedly guarantee it "strategic parity" with Israel.
The 1980's were tough years for Assad. The Gulf Arabs cut off aid because of his support of Teheran. In 1986, Britain severed ties and trade with Damascus after Syria was implicated in the botched attempt to blow up an Israeli airliner at Heathrow Airport.
Then came a godsend -- the Gulf crisis. Once again, Assad ignored the sympathy so many Syrians harbored for Iraq and sent 20,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia.
According to Saudi and Syrian accounts, Assad's critical decision to join the American-led coalition was made in less than five minutes. Soon after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Saudi King Fahd sent Prince Bandar bin Sultan to seek Assad's help. "Assad asked only three questions," an Arab official recounts. "Are the Americans serious about stopping the Iraqis? Will they finish the job by going all the way? And do you trust them?"
Syria was richly rewarded for its charter membership in the coalition and for subsequently providing Washington with critical information about planned terrorist attacks on Western targets. Though reports of Gulf Arab gratitude have been exaggerated, Arab officials say that Saudi Arabia alone provided an initial check of $500 million in 1990, most of which was used to buy Scud-C missiles from North Korea and 100 T-72 tanks from Czechoslovakia, and pledged some $500 million in project aid in subsequent years. An additional $2 billion a year in aid was promised as a result of Syria's willingness to participate in an Egyptian-Syrian defense force in the Gulf -- the so-called Damascus accords of March 1991. Though neither the force nor the funds has materialized, other funds might. Damascus has become the foreign nexus of the emerging dissident movement within Iraq, which is bound to be supported by former coalition members.
The growing coziness with Washington has prompted Assad to make other changes to improve Syria's image. For example, he has evicted some of the most infamous terrorists and international pariahs who have long called Damascus home. Chief among them are the terrorist Carlos, who is said to have sought refuge in Baghdad or Sanaa, and the Damascus-based representative of the Japanese Red Army Faction.
But Assad has refused to expel Ahmed Jabril, head of a radical Palestinian group known as the P.F.L.P.-G.C., which the President insists is a resistance group fighting Israel for the liberation of Palestine. In effect, Assad argues that terrorism against Israel and Israeli citizens is legitimate. He has also refused to use his 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon to disarm Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militants who kidnapped and held most of the American hostages until Syria and, more critically, Iran found it in their interests to have them released. "When Israel withdraws its forces, we'll disarm Hezbollah," Defense Minister Tlas says, "and that's a promise."
Until recently, the United States and Britain suspected the P.F.L.P.-G.C. of playing a leading role in the downing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. But now spokesmen for both countries have blamed Libya for the disaster. However, L. Paul Bremer 3d, a former ambassador at large for counterterrorism in the Reagan Administration, maintains that the Bush Administration has "clear information" that Iran contracted with the P.F.L.P.-G.C. to blow up United States airlines. Only after its operation was uncovered in Germany did it hand over the Lockerbie mission to the Libyans.
Syria is furious that Washington has not yet removed it from its terrorist list after the exoneration in the Lockerbie affair. "The list prevents us from becoming a major trading center again," says Mohammed Imady, the Minister of Economy, an avid proponent of economic liberalization. But United States officials say that Syria is not likely to be removed from the list anytime soon.
"Where Syria shows willingness to change its behavior, to act in ways consistent with our interests, it's crazy not to encourage it," says a senior Administration official, echoing impulses disquietingly similar to those that molded American policy toward pre-Gulf-crisis Iraq. "Syria is a fact of life in the Mideast. We have to deal with them, but we have no illusions about the Syrians. We're not about to make them B'nai B'rith men of the year."
SYRIA WAS ONCE, and could be again, a very rich country, with an estimated 1.7 billion barrels of oil reserves and, thanks to help from Western oil companies, recent oil exports of almost 300,000 barrels a day. More importantly, Syria has a wealth of human talent, including a million university graduates, with one of the highest proportions in the Mideast.
But it is precisely these people whose sense of enterprise has been smothered by the Government's heavy-handedness, its clumsy "socialism" and what one businessman calls the "mediocre tyranny of bureaucrats." The Government, which between the military and civil service employs about 40 percent of the work force, pays a civil servant an average of less than $75 a month. Second jobs are a necessity.
Since 60 percent of Syria's budget goes to the military, the Government cannot afford to raise wages. So people who once considered themselves bourgeois have become poor because of steady inflation. "Economically, Syria desperately needs peace," one Syrian businessman says. "Everyday life is now so difficult that the average Syrian is preoccupied with survival. Assad no longer needs prisons."
To make ends meet, smuggling and corruption have become widespread, and essential. The prime beneficiaries are Alawites, senior Baath Party officials and generals and their children, the "sons of the revolution" as they are sarcastically known, or the "Abu and sons club," abu meaning father of.
Assad's brother, Jamil, and Jamil's sons are said to be major smugglers in Latakia, an Alawite stronghold in northwest Syria. And Assad's son Basil, head of the presidential guard, also has business interests. In Damascus, the villas of senior military men are readily identifiable by the brand new Mercedes parked in front of them. "I think there are more Mercedes here than in Germany," says one disgruntled Syrian, noting that the Government alone authorizes car imports and that even a 30-year-old car can cost about $25,000, when one can be found.
Resentment of payoffs to military officers is also building. In Madaya, for example, a picture-postcard mountain town near the Lebanese border, shops are full of smuggled goods from Lebanon. But in early September, a local wood smuggler and his brother refused to make their routine payoff of 25,000 Syrian pounds a week, about $600, touching off a shootout in which several Syrian officials were killed. The Syrian military cordoned off the town and went on a rampage through its shops and houses.
Minister Imady says Syria must reform its economy if smuggling is to be eliminated. The Government, which granted 300 private import licenses in 1985, gave out 5,000 last year, mostly for raw materials and manufactured parts, the latter a boon to Western Europe. And private sector exports, chiefly marble, textiles and fruits and vegetables, which account for almost 60 percent of all export revenue, rose from 3.5 billion Syrian pounds in 1987 to 23 billion Syrian pounds in 1990. A key element of the privatization process is the creation of joint-venture companies between the public and the private sectors. So far, 140 have been formed, initially in tourism and more recently in industry and agriculture.
But the Government still monopolizes banking and insurance. While Kuwaiti money is financing the installation of 600,000 new German-made telephone lines, Syrians without political connections wait an average of 14 years and pay about $2,500 for a telephone. Syria's Prime Minister is said to approve the allocation of each and every line.
Some 500,000 Syrians work overseas, and recently thousands more have left for lucrative jobs in the Gulf, where they are replacing Palestinians, considered politically unreliable in the aftermath of the war. The brain drain of Syria's most capable youth is among the country's most daunting problems.
Syrians also complain that the new economic opening has largely been limited to entrenched businessmen, the ruling elite and their sons and daughters. "Assad knows that economic power is political power," one diplomat says. "And he is loath to share it."
Those who hoped that economic liberalization would lead to political relaxation have so far been even more disappointed. In the spring of 1990, some opposition politicians were invited to return and two minor new parties were allowed to operate. The Government also increased independent seats in Parliament, a powerless forum. But most of the political changes have been, as Drysdale and Hinnebusch concluded, "meager and mostly cosmetic."
THE ISSUE OF succession is much on the minds of Syrians. A history of heart trouble has made Assad's health a subject of intense speculation. Many analysts fear that his sudden death any time soon would plunge Syria into a fierce, bloody power struggle among its many ethnic and religious groups.
From the time of independence from France in 1946 until Assad came to power in 1970, Syria experienced more than 15 military coups, or attempted coups. Assad's essential strength, and the core of his support stems from the stability he has provided for so long. Syrians under 20, who make up 60 percent of the country's 12.5 million people, have never known any other ruler. Even Assad's harshest critics fear a resurgence of chaos if he dies soon.
Those who hope for a democratic Syria after Assad often cite Spain's Franco as a model. They hope that their strongman, too, will lay the groundwork for a pluralistic society.
But Assad seems to envision a different future, the clue to which was apparent during the election. For the first time, election banners and the media referred to Assad as "Abu Basil," or father of Basil, his 30-year-old son.

HEADLINE: POWER STRUGGLE

 BODY:
Verhovek's fine article on the Quebec power problem doesn't fully portray the New York Power Authority's aggressive efforts to insure a thorough environmental review of the proposed Great Whale project and to reopen our Hydro-Quebec contract to reflect current economic realities.
Largely at my urging, Hydro-Quebec agreed not to begin construction of roads and other ancillary features until the entire project has undergone review -- a major victory for those who feared that such work would make the project itself inevitable. I have personally advised Hydro-Quebec that we will not buy a single kilowatt of its power unless environmental and native peoples' concerns receive full scrutiny under Canadian procedures. To facilitate this process, I negotiated an 11-month extension, through next Nov. 30, in the deadline for a decision on the contract. 
 The extension also will permit review of the contract's economic benefits in light of changes in New York's energy needs, due largely to successful conservation programs by the Power Authority and investor-owned utilities.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Down on the Farm;
Million-Dollar Mansions Near Princeton

 BODY:
As Kevin Dey watched the region's economy unravel in the late 1980's he wondered about the timing of his family's decision to turn Dey Farm, its 78-acre homestead near Princeton, N.J., into a new community of mansions on large lots.
But since then five residences have been built at a cost of about $1 million each at Dey Farms Estates, where lot sizes average six acres, and construction is to start in March on a sixth.. All but five of the development parcels there have been sold. 
 "Princeton is a fairly wealthy area," said Mr. Dey, whose family owned the farm for more than 100 years. "But I am surprised that all of the buyers so far are from this general vicinity."
Dey Farm Estates is in West Windsor Township just north of the intersection of Route 571 West and Rabbit Hill Road.
The property was an active potato and grain farm until 1985. Mr. Dey said that local zoning rules would have allowed up to 72 residences, but he decided to limit the number of homes to 13 to maintain the farm's rural quality. Mr. Dey also decided that the minimum size of each home built should be 4,000 square feet.
Michael Macaluso, the architect who has designed the sixth of the new residences, said the plans call for it to have 18,000 square feet of space; 13,000 square feet on the main level and 5,000 square feet below grade. Among the amenities planned are an indoor swimming pool with a retractable skylight, a gymnasium, tennis courts, a workshop and a 3,000-square-foot master bedroom suite.
The asking prices of the five unsold parcels start at about $300,000.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: New York City Growth Symposium;
Planning the Use of Land

 BODY:
You won't be able to attend -- it's already playing to a sellout crowd. But it's worth noting, in part because the issue is so important, and in part because you can catch it on television some weeks hence.
On Thursday, from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., 16 lawyers, city planners, architects and academics, among them such notables as Peter Salins, an urban affairs professor; Michael Kwartler, an architect, and R. Susan Motley, a former City Planning Commission member, will gather at the New York University School of Law to present -- and debate -- papers about land-use plans and rules for New York City. 
 The session is part of a year-long effort by the City Planning Commission that will culminate in December in a comprehensive new zoning and land-use plan.
The symposium will discuss both the history of planning in the city and alternate scenarios. The morning symposium will run through the permutations of New York's zoning law since its passage in 1916. In the afternoon, planners, consultants and academics will offer up ideas on whether to maintain the status quo in zoning rules, or to change them to yield a more efficient city, a more esthetic city or a more equitable city.
Whether those are mutually exclusive goals is likely to make for heated debate.
A tape of the proceedings will be aired on cable television in a few weeks. (Call 720-3277 for details). Also, the Center for Urban Policy Research Press at Rutgers University will offer copies of the papers in a few weeks. (For timing and fees call 908 932-3101).

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Owners' Outlook;
Sounding the Alarm on Mortgage Loans

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE normally ebullient Bernard H. Mendik seems an unlikely messenger for unpleasant news. "I try to be upbeat," he says. He usually is.
But as the new chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York, Mr. Mendik deems it a duty to deliver woeful news to Washington. This is that owners of investment property are being driven into a corner by the unrealistically harsh standards of banks on mortgage refinancing. He wants a relaxation of rules that he says are obliging banks to judge value on the basis of current rents only, rather than projected rents after building improvements or market gains. 
 The banks' tighter lending policies have led to lower loan-to-value ratios on mortgages, which is particularly tough in a slow market when properties must compete for tenants with costly space improvements. Even well-leased properties may have trouble meeting the new terms of mortgage refinancing. In part the new practices reflect lenders' own decision to lighten their real-estate portfolios.
"That's the difference between today and 1974 and '75," Mr. Mendik said. The market recession was more severe then, but banks were helpful. "We could borrow money, and the banks preserved equity," he said. "We never lost buildings." In the end, the market rose.
In fact, it surged. That brought a new assessment system, designed to let New York City benefit sooner from the gain. In the current downturn, valuations have receded more slowly, and current tax bills reflect the prices of four and five years ago. That adds to the problems. Average property taxes on midtown office buildings are the highest in the country at $10 a square foot, according to a survey by Julien J. Studley, the brokerage firm.
There are problems on the development side too, Mr. Mendik said. Over time, he said, the city will lose major tenants if it cannot accommodate them at competitive rents in new buildings. He believes that means continuing the short-term tax incentives that help make this possible. But the city appears prepared to discontinue them in key Manhattan locations. "I think it's very shortsighted," Mr. Mendik said.
SO with all this, how does he stay upbeat? It may come from living through cycles past. It may also come from the recollection of successes past. There have been disappointments, too -- a $10 million out-of-pocket loss by himself and close associates on the MacArthur Foundation properties, the 6,250 Manhattan apartments, including Lincoln Towers, that he bought with Equitable Life and Martin J. Raynes for $500 million in 1985. The combination of tax law changes and market collapse was fatal.
Mr. Mendik is the 63-year-old chairman of the Mendik Company, the owner of 12.1 million square feet of investment real estate, most of it in Manhattan office buildings and some in Connecticut, Westchester and Long Island. He was born in Scotland. His parents emigrated to the southeast Bronx in 1930. His father was a handyman in Manhattan apartment houses. The son found his way to Bronx High School of Science, City College, and, at night, to New York Law School. Three years ago he became chairman of the law school's board of directors.
At law school he met and eventually married Annette Silverstein, who died in 1981. Her father, Harry G. Silverstein, was a real estate broker who later established a syndication firm, Harry G. Silverstein & Sons. The sons were Larry A. Silverstein and Mr. Mendik. They purchased mainly Manhattan loft buildings, acting as general partners in private syndications with anywhere from 25 to 60 investors. Harry Silverstein died in 1966.
As partners Larry Silverstein and Mr. Mendik continued to acquire properties until recession reined them in in 1972. Five years later the partnership broke up. One reason was that Mr. Silverstein was interested in development, Mr. Mendik said. He himself had no patience for it. "It's a long tedious process and it's at least three to five years before you see any fruits of the tremendous risks," he said.
The two men established separate partnerships for the syndicated properties, each one operating about half as managing partner and maintaining investment interests in each other's buildings. Each separately continued to buy properties.
The 12.1 million square feet acquired by Mr. Mendik include 2 Penn Plaza, a 1.7-million-square-foot office building purchased from Gulf & Western; 330 Madison Avenue, an 800,000-square-foot building between 42d and 43d Streets; 909 Third Avenue, the 1.2-million-square-foot building at 54th Street, and eventually the MacArthur properties. Sometimes wealthy partners have participated, but at other times, as in the MacArthur purchase, all the equity came from Mr. Mendik with close associates within the company.
In all the time since 1957, Mr. Mendik says, he has experienced only one great upcycle in commercial real estate in New York City. It lasted three years -- from 1979 through 1981. "It was extraordinary," he said.
At 330 Madison Avenue, where he now has his office, rents went from $13.50 a square foot to $35 a square foot in that period. Mr. Mendik had bought it for $35 million in cash -- or $45 a square foot -- in July 1979. There had been so little new construction in the 70's that even the national recession that began after 1981 barely had an impact on New York City real estate. The higher rents held firm.
The formula worked again at 11 Penn Plaza, the former Equitable Life headquarters at Seventh Avenue and 32d Street. It was purchased for $40 million in cash when rents were averaging $7.50 a square foot. The building was improved, new space was leased out at $25 a square foot and three years later a $60 million mortgage was placed on the property. The partners got their cash back, and a continuing income.
NOT so on the MacArthur properties. Mr. Mendik and his close associates had a 25 percent equity position in the purchase of the 6,250 apartments, 3,850 of them at Lincoln Towers. The majority partner, Equitable Life, with a 50 percent interest, also was responsible for guaranteeing 90 percent of the financing from a consortium of banks.
"We were buying apartments with a 1 to 2 percent yield for co-opping," Mr. Mendik said. The partnership had paid $80 a square foot for the real estate, and sold 55 percent of the apartments to insiders on the first round, averting costly litigation with tenants.
The objective was to sell the unsold renter-occupied apartments to investors. But the tax law change made syndications of renter-occupied apartments impossible. And in 1989 many people turned against co-op buying in mixed-occupancy buildings, making vacancy sales difficult.
When Equitable decided to pay up its own $40 million guarantee to reduce the bank indebtedness, Mr. Mendik followed suit. Later Martin J. Raynes' interest was converted to that of a limited partner.
"I still think it was the best deal I ever made," Mr. Mendik says.
Now he is back to buying for all cash. He did it last year, paying $108 million for the Mutual Life Insurance of New York building at 1740 Broadway, at 56th Street. Ninety percent of the cash came from an individual overseas investment client of the United Bank of Switzerland and the rest from the Mendik Company.
"The building has good leases running for 7 to 12 years at modest rents. We'll ride out the recession and get the upside. If I'm wrong, at least there's no mortgage. It's hard to get hurt."
But in the credit crunch, it is easy to get hurt. Tight credit leads to foreclosures or workouts, a weakening ability to compete for tenants, and ultimately a weakening of the tax base.
UNDER current rules, Mr. Mendik says, "banks are being forced to write down real estate to liquidation values." Even with changes on that front, he says, owners will have to look to new sources of capital. Pension funds are considered a possibility.
Beyond all this, the Real Estate Board under Mr. Mendik hopes to work harder at rallying community organizations to a concerted effort in behalf of a "safe, clean and functioning" central business district.
Among other things this means a stronger effort to reduce sidewalk peddling, he said. And the pathways between the airports and central Manhattan should be made more attractive, he said, so that tourists get a good impression of the city on first arrival.
"Atlanta did it, and Chicago is trying," he said. "So why not New York?

JOYCEAN PARTY
 For 10 years Paperback Alley, a bookstore in South Windsor, has unfailing celebrated the birthday of James Joyce. This year's do will take place Saturday and next Sunday in the bookshop at 984 Sullivan Avenue (Route 194).
At 11 A.M. on both days the film "Ulysses" will be shown, followed at 1:15 P.M. by "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," and a screening of "Joyce's Women" at 3 P.M.
Dr. Richard Bonaccorso, a specialist in modern Irish literature at Central Connecticut State College, will deliver a lecture about the two central characters of "Ulysses," "Dedalus and Bloom: Getting to Know Them," at 7:30 P.M. on Saturday.
At 6:30 P.M. on Sunday Milton Moore will discuss "Saturn's Choice," an astrological study of Joyce, attempting to explain his life in zodiacal terms. Copies of the horoscope will be distributed to the audience.
Throughout next Sunday, which is Joyce's birth date, recordings of the writer singing and reading from his works will be played, and soda bread and Irish tea will be served. After each evening program a cake on which the first page of "Ulysses" is reproduced in icing will be shared by the audience.
Lila and Marshall Cohen, proprietors of the bookstore, will be on hand all weekend to welcome visitors and talk about their muse. Everything is free, but reservations for the evening lectures are advisable. Call 644-9979.
 
WILD BIRDING SPOTS
 A preview of a nature film featuring Roger Tory Peterson may be seen Tuesday at 7:30 at the Connecticut Light and Power Building on New Road in Madison. The film, made by Michael Male and Judy Fieth, will be shown on the PBS "Nature" series on Feb. 16.
In "A Celebration of Birds" the 83-year-old naturalist travels from one end of the Eastern seaboard to the other, visiting his favorite wild birding spots. Mangrove swamps and heron rookeries in Florida, shorebirds on Delaware Bay, ospreys, least terns and piping plover near Mr. Peterson's Connecticut home, and puffins on a remote Maine island are among the areas he explores for the camera.
His "Field Guide to the Birds," first published in 1934, has played a substantial part in awakening Americans to the endangerment of its birds and other wildlife. The film includes segments about people who have been inspired by his message, including a group out birdwatching in the wee hours in Central Park.
Admission is free. For more information call 245-9056.
 
BATTLE OF WILLS
 "Crazy Horse and Three Stars" by David Wiltse, the new workshop production at Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, describes a battle of wills between Crazy Horse, leader of the Lakota nation, and three-star Gen. George Crook during the Indian wars of the 19th century. On a collision course, the two leaders were driven by the needs of their people -- to maintain freedom and dignity for American Indians on one hand, and to acquire land and economic opportunies for a growing nation of immigrants on the other.
Mr. Wiltse is no stranger to Long Wharf. His plays "Grand Romance," "A Dance Lesson" and "Temporary Help" were presented there from 1985 through 1990. In New York he received the Drama Desk award for "Suggs," and "Doubles" ran on Broadway for eight months.
The workshop series is a laboratory for developing new works by established playwrights and by newcomers to the field. Presented with a minimum of sets, costumes and lighting, the series focuses on the plays themselves, soliciting written comments from the audience after each performance.
Curtain times are 8:15 Tuesday through Saturday, Sunday at 2:15 and 7:15, and Saturday matinees at 4:15. The play will run through March 3. For tickets, priced at $27 and $32 call 787-4282.
 
ANTIQUE MIRRORS
 Antique framed mirrors go on display at the Yale Art Gallery in New Haven Saturday through March 22. Many examples, from 1775 through 1850, in an exhibition titled "Looking Glasses in America," will be out of storage and on view for the first time. The majority were imported from Europe and England.
Prized for their elegance and fragility, they were stylish and highly ornamented status symbols. The more elaborate they were, the more they attested to the wealth of the owner.
Some 50 pieces are in the exhibition, displayed in period settings among antique prints and furniture. Two sections show how the looking glasses were carved and gilded, and how genuine antique mirrors may be distinguished from reproductions and fakes.
A symposium on vintage American mirrors will be held on Feb. 29 from 9:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. in the art gallery lecture hall. Speakers will include Geoffrey Beard, chairman of the Furniture History Society in England; Elisabeth Donaghy Garrett, director of Sotheby's educational studies in New York, and Brian B. Considine, conservator of decorative arts for the J. Paul Getty Museum in California.
Admission will be $25, or $15 for students. For reservations or more information call 432-0615.

Eligibility for Housing
 
Question: My sister and I have applied for an apartment in the Penn South co-op in Manhattan. Our first choice was for a two-bedroom apartment. But we were told that we would have a better chance if we accepted a one-bedroom apartment and switched to a two-bedroom apartment once we had moved in. 
 When I inquired last about the availability of apartments I was told that we would not qualify for a two- bedroom apartment because of city housing rules. Can this be true? . . . Catherine Gordon, Manhattan
 
Answer: Yes. A spokesman for the management office said that some policies have changed because of the demand for apartments in the complex. Now two-bedroom apartments, for which there is a 12- to 14-year wait, are reserved for families of three or more.
According to Roz Post, a spokesman for the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, when Penn South, which is a limited equity co-op, decided not to become private a few years ago, the corporation accepted more stringent rules imposed by the city in exchange for continued tax benefits.
You and your sister are still eligible for a one-bedroom apartment in the complex.
 
Harassed Tenant
 
Question: I am unemployed and two months behind in my rent. Understandably, my landlady is concerned about my ability to pay. But recently she has begun to bother me by coming into my apartment without my permission. She uses her own keys and has even used a hammer to disengage the chain. Once when the check I wrote for the rent was returned, she had her son unlock my door.
I understand that she is within her rights to file for an eviction, but in the meantime do I have to endure her tactics to try to scare me out of the apartment? . . . Cindy Wardell, Manhattan.
 
Answer: No. Tenants do not loose their statutory right to privacy when they fall behind in rent.
"The only legal reason," said Bruce D. Friedberg, a Manhattan real estate attorney, "for a landlord to enter a tenant's apartment without permission would be to address an emergency. The bullying tactics are against the law."
Mr. Friedberg said that Section 235 of the New York State Real Property Law prohibits the use of violence, the threat of violence or tactics like removing a tenant's belongings or lockouts, as a means of eviction. An eviction must be through a Housing Court order.
State law also says that landlords who use illegal methods to force tenants to move can be open to criminal and civil charges. Mr. Friedberg said that you might have grounds for a trespassing or harassment claim against your landlord. Tenants forced from their apartments unlawfully may collect treble damages.
If your landlord comes into your apartment again or unlocks the door, you should call the police.
 
A Leak in the Ceiling
 
Question: I live in a co-op and for several months an interior leak has caused stains and bubbles in the paint on the ceiling and walls of the entry. I have been in touch with the management agent and board since last May but there has been no response to the complaint. Should I withhold maintenance and place it in an escrow account until the problem it is corrected? . . . Scott Rubin, Manhattan
 
Answer: Probably not. Withholding maintenance is risky in all but the most serious circumstances. In all probability, it is a violation of your co-op's proprietary lease and could result in eviction from your apartment.
David L. Smith, a Manhattan attorney specializing in real estate, said that if you do establish the maintenance escrow fund you should leave it with your attorney after giving written notice -- through certified or registered mail -- to the co-op's board.
As an alternative, he suggested an action in Small Claims Court."The cost would be low," said Mr. Smith, "It would get the board's attention because it would be forced to hire an attorney. And there would be no risk of default on the lease."

HEADLINE: Vision of Rail and Office Complex Moves Nearer to Reality

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
STANDING at the window of his fifth-floor office in Rutherford, William E. McCann looks out over an expanse of rooftops and meadow grass to a spot nearly four miles away in Secaucus. There, amid a jumble of railroad tracks and swaying cattails, he imagines a gleaming oasis of glass and steel rising above the marshlands.
In his mind's eye, Mr. McCann sees five office towers set atop a sprawling train station that would serve nearly 70,000 commuters a day and create thousands of new jobs for New Jersey residents. 
 For the last six years Mr. McCann has watched his dream take shape -- not in the Meadowlands in Secaucus but in the plans, charts and architectural renderings that line his office walls. Last month that dream came one step closer to reality with the passage of a Federal appropriations act that provides billions of dollars of transportation aid for New Jersey.
"This gives us the opportunity to take New Jersey out of the shadows of New York and create our own skyline," said Mr. McCann, who is president of the Rutherford-based Allied Junction Corporation. The company is the developer of the proposed train station and office complex, called Allied Junction.
Despite the good financial news, Allied Junction officials must still obtain a construction permit from the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission -- a permit that may be contingent upon the construction of a new turnpike interchange that turnpike officials say is unlikely to occur in the near future.
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which was led through Congress by Representative Robert A. Roe, Democrat of Wayne, will provide New Jersey with as much as $5.6 billion in Federal highway and mass transit funds over the next six years.
Among the many projects that will benefit from the infusion of Federal dollars, officials say, are a light rail line along the riverfront in Hudson County and two railroad track modifications -- one in Secaucus and the other in Kearny -- that are the linchpins of the Allied Junction project.
The waterfront plan and Allied Junction are two of the last remaining elements of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean's much-publicized "circle of mobility." The circle of mobility, a public-private venture that was proposed by Mr. Kean in 1989, was intended to improve mass transit within the Meadowlands and waterfront areas, while increasing the efficiency of commuter traffic to New York.
The concept included plans for a monorail that would connect the Meadowlands with the waterfront and the rehabilitation of some long-abandoned railroad rights of way as an east-west commuter highway.
"The circle of mobility contained several extraordinary transportation benefits," said the Hudson County Executive, Robert C. Janiszewski. "Its goal was to provide a mass transit alternative that would separate New York City-bound traffic from waterfront-bound traffic."
Though many of the original elements of the circle of mobility are no longer under consideration, Mr. Janiszewski said, the waterfront transportation plan and the Allied Junction project, which are both being actively developed, could accomplish much of what the original plan intended.
The waterfront transportation plan, he said, would provide public transportation for residents and visitors who wanted to commute to the waterfront itself rather than New York, while the Allied Junction and Kearny rail connections would make it possible for New York City-bound commuters to travel directly into Manhattan without having to switch at Hoboken.
Mr. Janiszewski said that though the waterfront plan and the rail connection plans were being actively pursued, no one was sure where the money would come from when the plans were finalized. Passage of the transportation act, which provides the state with billions of dollars in mass transit aid, however, removed much of that doubt.
"All the elements are now coming into place," Mr. Janiszewski said.
Martin E. Robins, the director of waterfront transportation for N.J. Transit, said the plan that officials would present to the public was a blend of eight alternatives that had been studied over the years. "We expect to be in public hearings by June," he said.
Mr. Robins said the current waterfront transportation plan consisted of a light rail line that would go from Route 440 in Jersey City east toward the waterfront. From there it would travel up the waterfront to Weehawken and then west, through an existing tunnel in the Palisades. The rail line would then go north to the New Jersey Turnpike's Vince Lombardi Service Area park-and-ride lot in Ridgefield, where Manhattan-bound commuters can make connections to public transportation.
The plan also calls for a bus route that would go through the Weehawken tunnel through the Palisades.
"It's about a 15-mile system," Mr. Robins said, adding that the total project would cost about $550 million. "We think our project is looking more and more positive all the time. We are heartened by the fact that New Jersey is expected to receive $6 billion, and we are going to be competing for some of that money."
For Mr. McCann at Allied Junction, the transportation act has also made it possible for him to move ahead with plans to build an office complex, hotel and train station, totaling 4.7 million square feet, on property it owns in the Meadowlands.
The Allied Junction Corporation, a company formed by Allied Outdoor Advertising Inc. in South Hackensack, owns a 28-acre parcel of land in Secaucus through which nearly every major passenger rail line in New Jersey passes. Converging on Allied's property are all the N.J. Transit northern New Jersey commuter lines that eventually terminate at the Hoboken train station or Pennsylvania Station in New York.
Also passing through the property is Amtrak's Washington-to-Boston "northeast corridor," one of the busiest rail lines in the country.
For years officials have been contemplating a more complete connection between the N.J. Transit system and the Amtrak northeast corridor line. Such a connection would make it possible for commuters to change trains there and head directly into Penn Station in New York rather than have to take PATH trains into Manhattan from Hoboken.
 
Cost of Nearly $1 Billion
 Seeking to take advantage of what they regarded as an ideal location in the Allied Junction site, company officials drew up an elaborate development plan for the site, including a 200,000-square-foot train station, a 600-room hotel and conference center, 100,000 square feet of retail space and about 3 million square feet of office space. There would be a 40-story central office tower, Mr. McCann said, and the project would cost the company nearly $1 billion.
The company could not proceed with the development, however, until the Amtrak northeast corridor was increased to four tracks. "You can't stop a train on the northeast corridor today because it's only two tracks," Mr. McCann said.
The transportation act, however, has designated about $400 million for the installation of two additional tracks on the northeast corridor where it passes the Allied Junction site. "We'll be able to take trains off the northeast corridor, bring them into Allied Junction and then put them back onto the track," Mr. McCann said.
As a result, he said, passengers could switch from any N.J. Transit train to any other N.J. Transit train, including those running into New York's Penn Station.
 
4-Lane Road Extension
 In addition, he said, Allied has agreed to build a connection between N.J. Transit's Bergen County/Pascack Valley Lines and the Main Line, which would then continue into Allied Junction, and use the resulting abandoned rail bed to create a four-lane extension of a local roadway.
"We're putting in in excess of $100 million," Mr. McCann said, referring to money that the company has agreed to spend on infrastructure improvements and construction of the train station.
When the connection between the northeast corridor and the N.J. Transit system becomes operational, Mr. McCann said, "it will be a six-minute train ride to Manhattan." He added, "It's going to remove over 10,000 automobiles and 500 buses from the tunnels."
Amtrak officials say they have been working with Allied Junction in developing plans for train movement in the proposed station. "We have made it clear from the beginning that we have no opposition to the project as long as it in no way impedes intercity train traffic on the northeast corridor," said Clifford Black, Amtrak's director of public affairs.
Mr. Black said that though Amtrak currently had no plans to stop its trains at Allied Junction, "it's not out of the realm of possibility."
In a recent interview, Mr. Roe, who is chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee, called the Allied Junction project "extraordinarily important not only for New Jersey, but for the entire East Coast."
Mr. McCann said that when the planned development was complete, it would serve 70,000 commuters each day and create as many as 15,000 new jobs. He said that the project could be completed within five years and that he was already negotiating with prospective tenants.
"I look at this project, and unless I have rose-colored glasses on, I think it's the greatest thing that could happen to this state," he said.
 
Facing a Major Hurdle
 There is, however, one major hurdle that Allied Junction must overcome before it can start construction. Though the company has already obtained nearly all the approvals it needs for the project, it has not yet received final approval from the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission.
Bob Grant, a spokesman for the commission, said such approval would most likely be contingent upon the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's agreeing to build a new interchange adjacent to Allied Junction.
"The staff is very strongly predisposed to having the turnpike interchange in place; otherwise the local traffic problem will be difficult," Mr. Grant said. "The commission anticipates that there will be a requirement to have a letter of agreement from the Turnpike Authority for an interchange."
The Turnpike Authority, however, has no immediate plans to build such an interchange. Gordon Hector, a spokesman for the authority, said that while an interchange proposal was in the turnpike's capital budget for the 1990's, the money that has been allocated was only to study the proposal.
"No construction funds have been made available as yet," Mr. Hector said. "And there wouldn't be any construction on such a project until at least after 1995."
 
More Accommodation Urged
 Some supporters of the Allied Junction project say the Turnpike Authority should be more accommodating to the developer. "This is as bold a risk as a developer can take," said Richard Fritzky, president of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce, alluding to Allied's willingness to start construction on a major development in the midst of a recession. "The bottom line is that you have a private developer working to make something happen that is in the public interest of the state of New Jersey."
"We need that transfer station, but the transfer station won't work unless there's development on top of it," he said. "Allied Junction needs the government to cooperate with them big time on this."
Richard T. Roberts, chief of transportation policy and planning for the interstate transportation department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, agreed that work on the rail component of the Secaucus transfer should be accompanied by development at the site.
"It makes every bit of sense when you have a major transit hub like this to put economic development around it," Mr. Roberts said. "People will take transit to places where transit is."
"It's always been my belief that to build a transfer station out there without putting in other development is not a wise move because you'd end up with a station out in the middle of no man's land," he said. "And that is no man's land."

HEADLINE: Labor Raises Its Voice On L.I. Sound

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE environmentalists inside the Stouffer Westchester Hotel last weekend called their gathering a citizens summit to clean up Long Island Sound. The construction workers marching outside called it a conference to ban all building projects along the Sound.
Carrying signs like "Labor Votes. Crabs Don't," about 1,500 steamfitters, carpenters, plumbers and electricians demonstrated for two hours in cold winds. A balloon floating 40 feet overhead capsulized their message: "A Sound Economy Needs Jobs, Not Sewer Bans." 
 The building industry in Westchester, where the unemployment rate is estimated to be as high as 50 percent, is fearful that efforts being considered for protecting the Sound's water quality will destroy what little opportunity still exists for construction work in the shore communities. But there are also suggestions that the need to build new and upgraded sewage plants could form the basis of an alliance between labor and environmentalists.
Earlier this month the State Department of Environmental Conservation banned expansion of the four sewer districts in Westchester that empty into the Sound and also stopped plans by the county to expand a sewer district in North Castle. But that moratorium halting new development was lifted on Jan. 17 when county officials submitted an alternative plan to limit pollution in the Sound. The county's plan will limit fertilizers used on golf courses, construct new wetlands and curtail boat discharges. It comes in response to a call by Federal and state agencies sponsoring the Long Island Sound Study, a six-year partnership of Federal, state and local agencies to identify the most pressing environmental threats to the Sound and to produce a Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan to guide solutions.
Excess amounts of nitrogen, one of the elements released in the treatment of human waste, in agricultural and lawn-fertilizer runoff and by natural causes, including plant decay and acid rain, is believed to be responsible for reduced oxygen levels in the Sound. That, in turn, has caused large numbers of fish and shellfish to suffocate.
 
Back to 1990 Levels
 Last fall, sponsors of the Long Island Sound Study, whose final report is to be released this November, became so concerned about pollution that they ordered a no-net nitrogen-increase as an interim solution. Officials in Connecticut and New York are developing legal mechanisms to enforce that order to limit the flow to 1990 levels.
"No one wants a building moratorium, including us," said Cesare J. Manfredi, the water-pollution control engineer for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation and the official who had imposed the temporary ban. "We do want to insure there is no net increase in nitrogen flow."
To accomplish this goal, tradeoffs are necessary, he said.
"It's fine to allow new construction, which will increase sewage," he said, "but you have to decide where the reductions will come from."
Although in December Westchester County had authorized the expansion of the Blind Brook Sewer District to North Castle, Mr. Manfredi said, "You can't just build a new district or expand old ones without a plan to reduce nitrogen flows elsewhere."
It was because of pressure from his department, he said, that the county's interim plan was quickly put into place. A committee of municipal officials has been looking into ideas for controlling pollution in the Sound.
 
A Meeting This Week
 On Wednesday, Mr. Manfredi said, his agency will meet with representatives of the county's Department of Environmental Facilities to discuss an impending $150,000 to $250,000 Federal grant that will enable the monitoring of major tributaries that feed into Long Island Sound from the county. Data from this survey will help the state agency conduct periodic followup surveys of nitrogen levels.
Although restricting nitrogen flows to the Sound through tradeoffs could allow development to continue, the relationships are complex. At least one county sewer district, the one centered in Blind Brook, is seeking Federal aid to help it modernize and reduce the amount of nitrogen the plant releases into the Sound. Reduced volumes from this plant could provide a "bank" of permitted nitrogen flow and allow new construction in areas served by plants discharging into the Sound from Mamaroneck, New Rochelle and Port Chester.
Rye city officials who supervise the use of the Blind Brook plant are reluctant to discuss sharing the benefits of reduced nitrogen flow with their neighbors until the financial implications are cleared up. "We have no assurances that we will get Federal money to upgrade the plant," said Warren R. Ross, the Mayor of Rye. "Without that money, our sewer district taxpayers must pay the cost, and if so, they should be the ones to benefit."
There are critics who charge that the environmentalists' support of nitrogen restrictions is a smokescreen to prevent development on lands bordering the waterway.
 
'There's a Conflict Here'
 "There's a conflict here," said Gerald Lloyd, one of a handful of construction-industry supporters who attended the Jan. 18 environmental conference here, which was sponsored by the Long Island Sound Watershed Alliance, a 150-member coalition of environmental and civic groups.
"That's why those guys are out there," Mr. Lloyd, who represented the Westchester Chamber of Commerce, told the 150 conference participants. "They don't trust you any more."
Calling the Sound "an economic as well as an environmental resource," Robert Bendick, deputy commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and a conference speaker, defended his department's limit on nitrogen increases "as a way to get everybody to the table."
Resolving the issue, he said, will require a partnership with the Federal Government. Helping sewage-treatment plants upgrade their operations and reduce nitrogen flow into the Sound will require as much as $6 billion for the region, including Long Island and Connecticut, Commissioner Bendick said.
"That's lots of money and lots of construction work," he said, explaining why he believes "a very strong coalition between environmentalists and industry can be developed here."
David J. Miller, chairman of the Watershed Alliance, agreed. "Labor and environmentalists are not on opposite sides of the spectrum of Long Island Sound issues," he said, adding that the workers' demonstration provided "a great window of opportunity" for the two groups to begin working together.
 
A Link to Labor Perceived
 The alliance was formed a year ago after the National Audubon Society's Listen to the Sound Citizens Hearings Campaign, a series of 15 public forums that offered people living in the Sound area an opportunity to discuss their concerns and make recommendations for the future of the Sound.
Pointing to "the link between labor's call for jobs and development and our call for sewage-treatment plant upgrading and growth management," Mr. Miller, who is also regional vice president of the National Audubon Society, said both groups support Federal financing to upgrade sewage-treatment plants.
Without Federal aid "both jobs and the Sound will be losers," Mr. Miller said.
He will meet with construction industry leaders for the first time on Wednesday to discuss mutual goals. "There has been a barrier of communication that has to be crossed," Mr. Miller said. "Now, if we both go to Washington seeking Federal money to upgrade sewage-treatment plants, we'd both be winners. This is the beginning of a marriage of ideas."
While the leaders of both groups planned discussions, those talks appeared to be a long way from the men on the line last weekend.
 
Running a Gantlet
 Nick Colombo, agent for Local 38 of the Sheet Metal Workers union, was among those making up the thick gantlet of workers on West Red Oak Lane, through which Harrison police officers guided cars carrying conference guests up to the hotel. Mr. Colombo said he had had no trouble getting many of his 480 members to attend the rally.
"Half of them are out of work, many so long they have run out of unemployment," he said. "We have a food bank and a work-sharing program to help these guys, but it's not enough." Union members, he said, are being evicted from their apartments in increasing numbers, losing their homes and finding that they can no longer meet their car payments.
Another knot of men representing Carpenters' Local 149 stood nearby. Several identified themselves as "the lucky ones," the ones still working. Almost half the members in their 450-member local do not have jobs.
Steve Sullivan, for example, was recently notified by the Department of Labor that his unemployment benefits had expired.
"So many in the media view us as a bunch of labor goons," said Mr. Sullivan, who has four children. "What you see here is a group of fathers, Scout leaders and Little League coaches. We care about the environment. The only difference is that when we run out of work, we panic."

HEADLINE: As Zaleski Settles In, the Mayoral Profile Changes in Yonkers

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
TERENCE M. ZALESKI stood in the original mayor's office in City Hall, his words echoing off the unadorned walls of the empty room. "This was where the Mayor sat decades ago," he said. "We're restoring it, hopefully permanently."
Mr. Zaleski, who became the first executive mayor of Yonkers in 50 years by winning a closely contested three-way race last November, pointed out the architectural details of the room and the magnificent view it afforded. Then he strode briskly into a cluttered adjacent room, where the work of his first month in office was piled high on chairs, desks and even the floor. 
 The 39-year-old former State Assemblyman, a Democrat, has moved quickly to establish an administrative staff, mostly former aides who served in his election campaign, his Albany office or in the two constituent offices he operated in Yonkers. A few positions remain unfilled.
Mr. Zaleski, deliberate and methodical by nature, has provided a dramatic contrast to the more flamboyant makeup of his predecessor, Henry J. Spallone, who came to be recognized chiefly for his role as the voice of opposition to a court-mandated housing desegregation plan for Yonkers.
Under Mr. Zaleski, the city's official opposition to the plan appears to have evaporated. It represents not only his own policy but apparently also that of the City Council, where a Republican, John D. Spencer, has "bolted," as Mr. Zaleski put it, to join three Democrats for a working majority.
In his first few weeks, Mayor Zaleski has helped to negotiate new bus routes to serve the 148 new low-income housing units on five sites -- eventually there will be 200 units on seven sites under the court order -- by persuading Westchester transportation officials to include the miniroutes in the county system, thus saving money at two levels.
"I knew from working in Albany," said Mayor Zaleski, who for six years was a member of the Yonkers delegation, "that to be eligible for operating subsidies it is necessary to be part of the county bus system. The city could have provided the service, but there would have been no reimbursement."
He is working with parties to the desegregation lawsuit on the so-called long-term housing plan, which the Federal Court has said should provide an additional 800 units of affordable housing to help remedy the racial discrimination it found that Yonkers had caused in the city's housing and schools for four decades.
 
Making Use of Existing Housing
 Mayor Zaleski said he planned to form a leadership council, "a sort of board of directors of prominent individuals and experts, who can help us develop and market a plan that will take advantage of existing housing as much as possible."
He referred to a detailed study of the subject drawn up in mid-December by Oscar Newman, the housing expert who serves as an adviser to Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has handled the desegregation case since it was initiated by the Justice Department in 1980.
Mr. Newman, in his seven-page memorandum, began with the observation that "with the conclusion of one administration and the beginning of another of a decidedly different structure, I thought it might be helpful to explore the use of existing apartment stock in Yonkers" rather than limit the possibilities to the construction of new units.
Mr. Newman said last week that Mr. Zaleski's administration represents "a whole new ball game." Calling the new Mayor "intelligent, cooperative, rational, even daring," Mr. Newman added: "He knows the issues, and he knows the risks to the city and to himself. But he's aboveboard, genuinely refreshing and comes up with creative ideas."
If the mayor's new tenure has enabled him to reverse the city's approach to the divisive subsidized housing, it has also provided the opportunity for him to identify with a three-year effort to revive a private condominium venture, Pierpointe-on-the-Hudson, which had been a victim of the city's dispute with the court.
The developers of Pierpointe, a project of 1,850 condominium units planned along the Hudson River in southwest Yonkers, completed the first building, Scrimshaw House, a few years ago but sold only 25 of its 138 units. Problems included an increasingly soft real estate market and an order by Judge Sand halting all construction in Yonkers while the city refused to build the subsidized housing.
A week and a half ago, the developers, Yonkers Waterfront Associates, and officials of the American Savings Bank, announced an agreement they said would lead to the completion of sales in Scrimshaw House and the start of construction on a second phase, 115 condominium units over a 525-car garage.
 
Lottery Planned Next Month
 The revitalization hinges on a lottery next month in which 52 Scrimshaw apartments will be sold at prices ranging from $62,000 to $100,000, and city workers earning $30,000 to $50,000 will get first priority. The remaining apartments will be sold at market levels, from $90,000 to $150,000.
Mayor Zaleski said that the negotiations, which included the participation of city officials, had been under way for two years, long before he took office. He was on hand for the announcement, nevertheless, to stand behind the city's contribution of $1.6 million to help reduce sales prices and enable the lottery to proceed. The city expects to recover the $1.6 million eventually, beginning with a rebate from the developers of $1,000 for each apartment.
Mr. Zaleski said he hoped the lottery would "jump start the rejuvenation and move it into the next stages," which could include four more residential towers, a 200-slip marina, a renovated pier and a movie theater, a restaurant and a health club.
But housing has not taken up all of the new mayor's time. In a lengthy interview about his first month in office, he said he had also been seeking to retain the city's bond rating after the state's was downgraded by rating agencies earlier this month. "School districts are especially vulnerable," he said, adding that their bond ratings are tied to the state's.
 
Two New Deputy Mayors
 The mayor's new team includes two new deputy mayors, one for finance and economic development and the other for operations. Selected for the financial post was Andrew Maniglia, 34, "who worked for Marine Midland Bank as their regulatory officer in New York City," Mr. Zaleski said. "I knew him through his coming to Albany to talk about regulatory changes." Mr. Maniglia has been a Yonkers resident since 1984 and was finance chairman of the Zaleski mayoral campaign.
The operations post has not been filled yet. "It will deal with day-to-day operations of the different departments and agencies, the daily operational flow," Mr. Zaleski said. "It will make sure the different pieces of government machinery are operating efficiently, allowing me to devote my attention to the prime policy issues.
"We've been talking to candidates who are very cognizant of the need to provide a high level of services while cutting back on personnel," Mr. Zaleski added. "We're going to rearrange departments to provide services with a reduced work force. We're looking at layers of middle management that have been added on by past administrations, with an eye to seeing if some folks in higher levels might pick up more responsibility for what the line people are doing."
James Surdoval, 35, is the mayor's chief of staff. He served in that role for former Mayor Nicholas C. Wasicsko, a Democrat who lost to Mr. Spallone in 1990 and who is now a member of the City Council. Mr. Surdoval and the deputy mayors earn $90,946 a year.
 
The Rest of the New Team
 Other members of the Zaleski team earn from $35,000 to $55,456. They include:
*Nicholas Biondi, 25, a former Zaleski campaign aide responsible for fund raising, who is serving as executive assistant to the mayor. In this post he is the Mayor's link to boards, commissions and other government agencies, including the City Council.
*Andrea Stewart Cousins, 41, the mayor's liaison to community and civic groups. She is a member of the Black Women's Political Caucus.
*Barbara Flatley, 41, Mr. Zaleski's administrative assistant during his three terms in the Assembly, who is handling constituent matters.
*Betty Pettiford, 55, a former administrative aide to the Assemblyman, who is supervising the Action Center, which deals with constituent problems.
*Richard Slingerland, 25, a legislative assistant to the mayor, who serves as his link with the City Council.
Mr. Zaleski has hired Lucille LaBarbara, his former administrative assistant, to be his "liaison to the whole state government network," as Mr. Surdoval put it. Critics have called her a high-priced lobbyist, citing her salary of $41,699.
"Lobbyists have up to two dozen clients," the Mayor responded. "She will work fulltime for us. She will give us a leg up on other municipalities, reaching out not only to the Legislature but interacting with state agencies, talking with them on a daily basis on issues related to Yonkers. All we need to justify her involvement is one opportunity that would have been missed."

HEADLINE: TICKET PRICES;
Inflation Is One Thing . . .

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Accompanying Frank Rich's article "Previews, That Broadway Malady" [Dec. 22] there was a photograph of an ad for "Cabaret" in 1966. Nearly buried in the small type at the bottom of that ad was one major reason for the collapse of Broadway: ticket prices. 
 The ad announced that regular ticket prices for that show, Monday through Saturday evening, would range from a top of $12 in the orchestra to $2 at the back of the balcony. That $12 compares to the $60 collected for top tickets to the recent "Nick and Nora."
Simply on the basis of inflation, the $60 top tickets for "Nick and Nora" was very much out of line. In the 25 years between 1966 and 1991, the average cost of commodities in the United States rose 246 percent. So, on an inflationary basis, a $12 top ticket in 1966 should have grown to a $41.50 top ticket in 1991. Charging $60, "Nick and Nora" was raising prices 400 percent over 1966: overcharging by $18.50, or 45 percent.
People are simply not going to go to the Broadway theater if its prices continue to be so out of line. Something must change.

To the Editor:
As the president of the Air Transport Association, I would like to respond to your review of "Supertrains: Solutions to America's Transportation Gridlock." It failed to mention that the author, Joseph Vranich, is a consultant to the High Speed Rail Association. That's an important omission, because the review strongly implies that Mr. Vranich is on to an exciting new idea. What he's on to is something he has a vested interest in seeing succeed, and which most people believe will succeed only with government subsidy. That's what bothers the airlines about this growing bandwagon touting high-speed rail. Its advocates want the use of public money to build these expensive new systems -- so they can compete with unsubsidized airlines. High-speed rail, while potentially attractive, should pay its own way. It should rise on its own merits. If the concept makes sense economically, the private sector will build it.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Hot Times for a Hybrid

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Convertible subordinated debentures. No other phrase seems to capture quite so perfectly the essence of Wall Street jargon. Indeed, comedians poking fun at the financial world have long known that they could simply pronounce that term, in slowly rounded tones, and rest their case.
Well, it looks as if Wall Street will get the last laugh. With yields at rock-bottom levels and with stocks soaring into regions that only an astronaut could love, some savvy investors are taking a fresh look at these obscure securities. The reason lies in the neat parlor trick they perform: in a soaring stock market, they act like a stock, but when stocks slump, they act like a bond. 
 "Institutional interest is definitely increasing," said John P. Calamos, president of Calamos Asset Management in Oak Brook, Ill., which specializes in convertible securities. "We're seeing a lot more activity."
Prices of these hybrid investments have increased, too, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year. But while stock market prices are making cautious equity investors nervous, Mr. Calamos said, most convertibles are still bargains. Moreover, convertibles tend to be issued by small and mid-sized companies, the darlings of the 1991 market, and thus they offer latecomers a safer and more affordable way to participate in that booming sector.
"We're still fully invested," Mr. Calamos said in an interview last week. "Looking at the risk-reward balance in convertibles, we still think it looks very good."
A convertible bond, like any other bond, pays a stated rate of interest -- nearly 8 percent, on average, as of last week -- for a fixed period of time. But unlike a classic bond, a convertible can be redeemed at any time at the investor's option for a fixed number of shares of the issuing company's common stock. In the creditor pecking order, the owners of convertible bonds typically stand behind the holders of non-convertible bonds -- hence, the "subordinated" modifier.
A close relative is the convertible preferred stock, which can also be converted into common stock. Preferreds pay a stated dividend but have no fixed maturity date.
Convertible securities are not new to Wall Street. They have been around since the late 19th century, when they were a favorite financing method for the nation's burgeoning railroads. With a record boom in new issues last year, there are roughly $250 billion worth of convertibles outstanding. But despite their long history and the size of the market, convertibles still tend to be viewed by many investors as an annoyingly complicated instrument -- difficult to price, difficult to understand and difficult to trade.
Much of the market's distaste stems from the 1987 crash, said Mr. Calamos. With the crash, investors who had been willing to give up a bit of yield in exchange for the right to convert their bonds into stock suddenly lost all interest in the so-called "equity kicker.' As a result, convertible issues began to trade as if they were merely bonds. "That has been the story for years," Mr. Calamos said.
In fact, there were periods in 1990 when convertible yields almost exactly matched straight bond rates -- when, in effect, a convertible bondholder was getting the equity kicker for free.
Last year, that started to change, as investors began to show a slightly greater appetite for the equity aspects of convertibles. But Mr. Calamos said that the spread between convertible bond yields and the yield on straight debt securities remains very narrow. As a result, investors are still giving up very little yield on their bonds for the right to convert them into stock.
There have been structural changes in the market, as well. Several large Wall Street firms have set up separate trading desks to make markets in convertible issues, analysts are devoting more attention to them, and several leading firms -- Merrill Lynch; Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, and First Boston -- have created indices to track convertible performance.
The nature of the investors is changing too. According to the Investment Company Institute, more than two dozen mutual funds have been set up in the past few years to invest exclusively in convertible securities. And, more recently, insurance companies are beginning to add convertibles to their portfolios.
The entry of insurance investors is especially important, in the view of Mr. Calamos, because "they tend to buy and hold." He added, "So that will soak up some supply and improving pricing."
Another change has been the wider acceptance of stock options pricing theory -- once considered highly arcane -- as a sensible way to price convertible securities. Mr. Calamos pioneered the application of options theory to convertibles, but now, he said, "Almost everybody uses some version of it. That has helped keep the issuers honest."
The market is not yet ideal, however. Credit quality, while stronger than in 1990, is still a risk. The trading in lower-grade "junk convertibles" is still thin and is dominated by professional bankruptcy investors who are trying to take a controlling stake in a beleaguered company. As a result, spreads between the bid price and the asking price tend to be so wide that even experienced traders steer clear. In addition, Mr. Calamos said he is beginning to see "less capital committed to making markets," a development that is affecting liquidity.
For these reasons, most of the new interest in the convertible market is still "on the institutional side," he said. And that is just as it should be, he added.
"You can't just buy new issues -- letting the investment bankers be your portfolio manager is not smart -- but buying seasoned issues required very good research," he said. "So even large institutions typically allocate their funds to professional managers."
In these convertibles, he added, "It's best not to drive yourself."

Prudential Puts a Stop to Laurence Tisch's Miracle on 34th Street 

Earlier this month, R. H. Macy & Company sent a shudder through Seventh Avenue when it announced it would be late paying its suppliers. The big cash-strapped retailer, with sales hurt by the recession and a dismal Christmas, was struggling with debts from a $3.7 billion leveraged buyout in 1986 and its $1.1 billion acquisition of the I. Magnin and Bullocks department store chains in 1988. Macy's seemed near the brink. Then last week -- briefly -- the Avenue sighed with relief. Lawrence A. Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation and CBS, was close to putting together a $1 billion deal to buy Macy's outstanding junk-bond debt and take over its stock. But the deal fell through when one of Macy's creditors, Prudential Insurance Company, just said no. The Pru, which holds more than $800 million of Macy's mortgages, did not want to drop its interest rates, as Mr. Tisch demanded. So far there are no plans to resume the talks.
 
Happy as No. 2?
 
Robert C. Wright, president of NBC, told a group of investors last week he did not really mind NBC's losing out to CBS as the nation's top-rated network. NBC dominated the ratings for six years, but this season CBS elbowed its way past NBC by spending big to acquire the rights to air major league baseball, the Super Bowl and the winter Olympics. Though the strategy is working, it has been costly. CBS may lose $400 million for 1991, analysts said, though it expects to make money from its new viewers when the economy recovers. Mr. Wright told investors he'd rather make money than be No. 1. That may sound good, but, in fact, NBC will lose $50 million to $60 million for the year, analysts said.

Exporting TV to Russia
 
The descendants of Lenin's "New Soviet Man" will soon get to savor the life of the American couch potato. For a week, they will be able to veg out on American prime-time TV. Michael Jay Solomon, president of Warner Brothers International Television Distribution, put together a deal that includes "Murphy Brown," "Perfect Strangers," TV movies and Bugs Bunny cartoons. But Russians will only get half a look at the decadence to which they aspire; they won't see commercials. Sponsors backed down because they felt "it would create a bad impression to advertise now with the lack of money there and the suffering," Mr. Solomon said.

Japan Eyes the American League
 
The timing could not have been worse. Days after Yoshio Sakurauchi, speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament, called Americans lazy, an investor group headed by Japan's Nintendo -- the world's largest electronic game manufacturer -- made a bid to buy the Seattle Mariners baseball team. The group, which includes some Seattle businesses, said it would pay $100 million in cash. The Japanese may have scooped up some of America's most important cultural icons -- two Hollywood studios, for example -- but a baseball team? In this xenophobic climate? Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has given the deal the brush-off. It won't get "the requisite baseball approvals," he said in a statement.

Discounts, and Hold the Decor
 
At 47th Street Photo Inc., deep discounts on consumer electronics, cameras and assorted gizmos made up for its lack of decor. "It looked like a hole in the wall, but it did incredible volume," said Martin Brochstein, senior editor of Television Digest. But last year sales of $225 million -- a drop of 21 percent from 1990 -- were not incredible enough for the store to stay current on the $57 million it owes. Last week, after defaulting on a $500,000 payment to the Transamerica Corporation, 47th Street Photo filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. It will reorganize but leave its decor unchanged.

A G.M. Unit That Performs
 
At least one General Motors unit is doing well. Last week Electronic Data Systems said it will provide computer services to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts in a 10-year contract valued at $800 million. Its biggest customer is G.M., which pays it $3 billion a year to crunch its numbers.
 
Cray Gives Up Its Independence
 
Nothing is more important to the nation's computer makers than choosing the right chip. Microprocessors, more than anything else, determine which machines can work together. So when Cray Research Inc., the supercomputer maker, said last week it would develop a line of $1 million-to-$3 million machines based on the Spark chip made by Sun Microsystems Inc., it conveyed a lot about its strategy for the future. Cray was saying it believes in network computing, rather than in going it alone. It was also saying it wants to link its machines to the thousands of Sun workstations already in place.
 
Drug Makers Work on Image
 
Now that their backs are against the wall -- pushed there by irate consumer groups and an angry Congress -- some of the nation's largest drug companies are reconsidering their pricing policies. Last week, following an earlier announcement, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company said it would give 17 heart, blood-pressure and cholesterol-lowering drugs to patients whose doctors certify they are unable to pay. The Syntex Corporation said last week it would give 12.5 percent rebates to Federal programs for the poor. "The companies are being politically astute," said Ronald Nordmann, an analyst with Paine Webber Securities.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Waiting for Recovery
 
Last week, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, told Congress not to do anything about the recession. The reason is the deficit: Mr. Reischauer projects a record this year of $352 billion.

Connecticut's Unlucky Streak
 
Connecticut's economy is more dependent on military contracts than any others state's. That point was made particularly clear last week when the United Technologies Corporation said it would would eliminate 13,900 jobs. Half are in Connecticut. This comes just after the Electric Boat division of the General Dynamics Corporation said it would cut 10,000 jobs in Groton, Conn.

An American Car by Definition
 
President Bush did not bring back much from Japan that will help Detroit. So a number of American companies are taking out their wallets. The Monsanto Chemical Company and the Tosco Corporation are offering employees $1,000 if they buy American. But what's an American car? Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans are assembled here. At Tosco, American cars are those with 90 percent American content. The problem is that leaves out dozens of models the Big Three sell.

More Time to Spend
 
When Albert V. Casey, chief executive of the Resolution Trust Corporation, went to Congress last week, he asked for more money (a cool $55 billion) and more time to spend what the agency already has. The R.T.C. has until April to spend or forfeit the $25 billion Congress gave it last fall. That sum is in addition to $77.7 billion it received previously. Mr. Casey wants until October to spend the money. The extension is needed, he said, because with the sluggish real estate market, it is taking longer to sell the R.T.C.'s real estate portfolio, which is worth about $136.9 billion.
 
Follow the Housing Starts
 
Housing starts are the economy's bird dog. They lead the country into and out of recession. So it was good news last week when the Commerce Department said that housing starts in December were at their highest level in more than a year. Housing starts ran at an annual rate of 1,103,00 last month, 2.6 percent above the November rate. Building permits were up even more -- 5.8 percent, to 1,051,000. "Last month's rise in housing starts shows that low interest rates clearly are stimulating demand," said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors.
So how long until the economy follows?

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Aid, in Many Guises
 
Last week delegates from 47 nations gathered in Washington to discuss ways to aid the former Soviet Union. At the meeting, the Bush Administration came up with some novel, if somewhat inexpensive, proposals. Beginning Feb. 10, America will send the new Commonwealth of Independent States the 16 million prepackaged meals left from the Persian Gulf war. In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said 2,000 American farm volunteers would be sent to work with farmers in the commonwealth for periods of up to 90 days over the next three years. (Since there are more than a million farms, those volunteers will be busy.) But an even more novel approach came from bankrupt Argentina. It will not give money, its delegates said, but will accept 100,000 Russian immigrants. Presumably, they will have to pay their own way.

To lure investors, the former Soviet Government and a private investor group published "Business in the USSR," a slick English-language magazine printed 11 times a year in France. Last week, when the latest issue appeared, it had a new name: "Business in the Ex USSR."

A Pledge -- Make That Target
 
When President Bush and the heads of America's Big Three auto companies visited Tokyo earlier in the month, they though they had a deal -- although not a very good one. Japan, they thought, had made a pledge to buy an additional 20,000 American cars, a number Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, said was far too few. But last week Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa explained that 20,000 was really a "target," not a promise. So how many cars will Japan buy? Well, last week Japan's Parliament placed an order for two Buick Park Avenues, made by the General Motors Corporation. Detroit hopes there will be more.

Los Angeles County canceled a $122 million contract with the Sumitomo Corporation of America to build 41 automated rail cars last week. The contract will go to Morrison-Knudsen of Boise, Idaho, which put in a lower bid but has less experience. The cars are part of a $150 billion, 30-year plan to remake the city's transportation system.

An Economy-Model Porsche
 
Porsche AG, the German sports car manufacturer, startled its classy clientele last week with two announcements. The company said it would put 4,000 of its workers on part-time schedules due to slim order books. It also said it would shelve plans for developing a pricey four-seater in favor of bringing out an inexpensive new sports car.

Minneapolis Looks for a Super Payoff

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
The winners of the 1992 Super Bowl are: Minneapolis and Minnesota -- hosts to the game. The Washington Redskins and the Buffalo Bills must still settle the small matter of football supremacy. But the event should generate about $120 million worth of fresh economic activity and $7 million in new state and local taxes, according to a University of Minnesota study.
Most of the new revenues will go to the state, courtesy of its 6.5 percent sales tax. Moreover, the city must bear the cost of policing and cleaning up after the event. But Michael Forrester and Robert Durante, municipal bond analysts at Standard & Poor's, note that many Super Bowl fans are also executives who can steer new convention business to a host city. Tampa saw such a gain after hosting the 1991 classic, they said. 
 And unlike a home-team sports championship -- the baseball World Series, for example -- the Super Bowl attracts fresh money to the region. Minneapolis has a Triple-A rating from S.& P.; the state's rating is one notch lower.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Echo of Gould: The Treasury Intervenes

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The politicians are again trying to fix the nation's economic problems. And Wall Street is a bit nervous about the prospect.
Last week share prices gyrated and bond prices fell as investor attention began to focus on just what President Bush will propose Tuesday night in his annual State of the Union Address. 
 The last time Washington did something about the economy was in the fall of 1990, when Congress and Mr. Bush agreed to raise taxes. In retrospect, that seems dumb from almost any perspective. The budget deficit did not decline -- unemployed workers and bankrupt companies tend to pay less in taxes no matter what the rate -- but the economy did go into what Mr. Bush now describes, in surprising overstatement, as a "free fall."
Now it seems possible that Mr. Bush will reverse course and call for tax cuts. Or maybe he won't. Mr. Bush has never been known as a model of ideological consistency, and now he risks being portrayed by opponents as a President whose only principle is winning elections. With his aides split, the result may be a compromise proposal that will be dead as soon as it is made.
That might be viewed as good news on Wall Street, where fear runs high that the Government will only make things worse. The consensus view, widely but not deeply held, is that the economy is finally starting to recover anyway, as shown by rising housing starts.
The economy is not the only thing that Mr. Bush is supposed to fix. The rising cost of health care, which has acted as a tax on the economy and may help to explain the economic malaise, is the other. Unfortunately, Washington seems unclear regarding which of two problems it is supposed to correct: the fact that many people can't afford health care or the fact that health care siphons off an ever-rising share of national income. Most solutions to fix one would hurt the other.
What may emerge from the debate is a new effort to control medical costs with price controls on suppliers, a proposal that might put a halt to the bull market in health stocks.
That kind of proposal could do better now because the climate seems more open to some kinds of government intervention in the economy, as was shown by the general approval given to the Government's proposal to intervene to prevent squeezes in the Treasury bond market. If prices are too high for a particular bond, the Treasury will just print a few more bonds. Richard Sylla, an economic historian, compares the idea to Ulysses Grant's decision, after much hesitation, to sell Treasury gold in 1869, breaking Jay Gould's attempt to corner that market.
Bond market intervention may work, but it could also create problems. Valuable information on Government plans could leak, enriching some traders. To this day, no one knows how Gould learned of Grant's plan to sell gold, but he evidently did. Just before the market crashed, Gould sold most of his gold at high prices.

100 Cents on the Dollar

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Last spring, upon learning that he would be in charge of rehabilitating the troubled Executive Life Insurance Company of New York, Kevin E. Foley was immediately apprehensive. For one thing, the office Mr. Foley runs, the New York State Insurance Department's Liquidation Bureau, had never attempted to rehabilitate a life company, only property-and-casualty insurers. Moreover, when compared with other insurers that had failed, Executive Life was huge; its 118,000 customers reside in 23 states.
"We all felt a tremendous sense of responsibility," Mr. Foley said in a telephone interview.
Last week, however, the 41-year-old Mr. Foley announced the details of a plan that should pay every one of Executive Life's customers 100 cents on the dollar. Holders of deferred annuities and life insurance would turn in their policies in exchange for new policies from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
 For Mr. Foley, who became head of the Liquidation Bureau in 1987 after working in the insurance department's public affairs office, the challenge now is to defend the exchange offer from critics who will attempt to persuade a New York State judge to reject it. Some policyholders, for example, will argue that the plan is unfair because Met Life will be paying a somewhat lower interest rate on some account balances than did Executive Life. And Executive Life's numerous agents, who as creditors of the company stand virtually last in line, are fuming.
"We are still servicing our clients' accounts; we should be paid," said Gerald Lind, a big Executive Life agent in New York.
Mr. Foley is taking it in stride. Despite having received numerous calls from concerned -- in some cases, irate -- Executive Life customers, he is convinced that most of them will support the plan, largely because it should keep them all whole.
"What people have to appreciate is that their company got into trouble," said Mr. Foley. "There is no getting around that."

Plenty of Pain for the Gain

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Robert F. Daniell tried to put an upbeat spin on the announcement last week. The United Technologies Corporation, he said, was embarking on nothing less than a "sea change" that would produce a "leaner, tougher-minded company" capable of enduring the current recession and seizing opportunities as they arise in the future.
Then came the bad news. United Technologies plans to eliminate almost 14,000 jobs over the next few years, with the heaviest cuts falling on its Pratt & Whitney jet engine subsidiary -- and its home state of Connecticut. To pay for the cutbacks and for environmental problems, the Hartford-based company took special charges of $1.53 billion, producing a loss of $1.22 billion in the fourth quarter and $1.02 billion for the year. 
 Mr. Daniell, who has been chief executive of United Technologies since 1986, insisted that the job cuts were necessary, although he conceded they will do nothing to improve consumer confidence and end the recession. "We recognize that we are contributing to the overall problem," said Mr. Daniell (pronounced as if it had just one "l").
But the harsh reality, he said, is that a shrinking military budget means fewer orders for the company's military jet engines and sophisticated electronics; the slump in construction means less business for its Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners; and the steep decline in domestic car sales means less business for its auto parts business.
"I'm very comfortable with this action, because if we did not do it at this time we would end up in a situation where we would have to take even more devastating action," he said.
If there was a bright spot in the otherwise gloomy picture, it was the company's Sikorsky helicopter subsidiary, where sales are expected to hold steady over the next few years.
Mr. Daniell, who is 58 years old, knows a lot about the helicopter business. He started as a design engineer at Sikorsky in 1956 after graduating from Boston University's College of Industrial Technology. He rose to project engineer and then shifted into marketing, becoming vice president for commercial marketing in 1974. By 1980 he was chief executive of Sikorsky, a post he held until being named a corporate senior vice president for defense systems in 1983.
Looking ahead, Mr. Daniell said he hopes to forge more international alliances, like the one established between Pratt & Whitney and the jet engine subsidiary of Daimler-Benz.
"We have to recognize that there has been a leveling of technology in the developed world," he said. "So we have to ask if we can afford the duplication of effort in the design and manufacture of new products."

HEADLINE: In Options Trading, Volatility Is a Virtue

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Richard Witten, who is in charge of foreign exchange sales at Goldman Sachs, is sitting at the computer terminal in his office. He taps some keys and the screen blossoms with a colored display that reveals the details of a "plain vanilla" option -- in this instance an option to buy American dollars with Canadian dollars next June.
Because Mr. Witten, or a customer, needs to know more, the computer displays the welter of currency options arcania: the strike price, the premium, the delta and the volatility. 
 Is a plain vanilla option too tame?
Mr. Witten changes his program, clicks the the computer mouse and new products appear, a bevy of exotic Canadian-American dollars options that are even more complicated than the original and best purchased only by the very knowledgable. There are "lookbacks" and "knockouts" and "range forwards."
"Our business has increased to the point that if you do ten transactions, at least three are options and maybe as many as five," Mr. Witten said.
In other words, the options business is good, very good.
And business is booming, too, at the other leaders in the business: Citibank, Banker's Trust, First Chicago, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Societe Generale and Swiss Bank.
Options, of course, are nothing new to Wall Street. But their use has grown rapidly in recent years and now, with the sharp run-up in the stock market and the dollar's recent volatility, they are enjoying an upsurge.
The darlings of the moment are stock options and currency options, and investors have been placing big new bets.
Some investors think the current bull market will continue, and they are buying stock options that in a few weeks or months will allow purchase of shares at a set price, known as the strike price.
The hope is that the market will have risen enough by then that the price for the shares will be higher than the price that must be paid through the option, resulting in a handsome profit, either by selling the stock or just selling the option.
Wide swings in prices makes such bonanza winnings possible. Thus, aggressive traders welcome volatility, or what they call implied volatility, the expectation that sudden price changes are likely in the near future.
"Volatility is out of sight," said David Puth, a managing director of the foreign exchange group at Chemical Bank in New York. "We have been seeing levels for current volatility we have not seen for a long time."
Other investors are betting on a fall in the stock market and they are using options to protect themselves against it. This use of options as a hedge, or insurance, against movement in financial markets can become artful in the hands of the experts.
The availability of ever more exotic (read "complicated" and "potentially costly") species of options is growing rapidly as investors seek new ways to hedge risk, enhance investments or just speculate. Mr. Witten's specialty is currencies, but with a few taps at the keyboard or clicks of the mouse other Goldman specialists can bring to their screens options available on everything from stock indexes to crude oil.
And because options generate fees for the institutions that market them, armies of salespeople are pushing the new products, particularly to corporate customers.
"Where you have a product that is customized and complex and difficult for the buyer to figure out what it is worth, you have an enormous opportunity for profit," said John Finnerty, a professor of finance at Fordham University in New York.
There is no better example of the potential profits in options for the securities industry than at Banker's Trust. Revenues from options and other derivative products averaged $50 million a year at Banker's from 1981 to 1985. But by 1989 they had jumped to $313 million, rose to $601 million in 1990 and hit $800 million in the first three quarters of last year, suggesting the possibility they might top $1 billion when the final tally for the year is in.
"Our growth in revenue and profits is driven by having a critical mass of clients, highly advanced technology, continuous innovation and a preference for acting ourselves as counter parties -- using our own capital -- so that a transaction can be completed and then hedged," said Brian Walsh, who runs the bank's worldwide business in options and other "derivative" investment products from London.
He expects the market to continue to grow. "The potential for derivatives to manage risk is just beginning to be understood in the markets."
Indeed, it is in this idea of controlling the risk of other investments by purchasing options that banks and brokerages are pushing the hardest. Firms are developing glittering new options packages, hiring consultants to educate corporate executives about the benefits of options as a hedge and arming sales staff with computerized systems like the one Mr. Witten at Goldman Sachs uses.
Investment industry analysts think this line of business offers a great potential for growth -- and profits -- for the banking, investment banking and securities industry, both in serving customers and in trading for a firm's own account.
But options can carry enormous risk -- particularly for firms selling them, if they get caught short by sudden market moves.
"Options are a wonderful way to get free money if things do not go against you," said Philip M. Johnson, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Reagan Administration. "If you are the writer of options, you collect fees. And if the market behaves, it's fine. But if the market goes south in a big way, you can get killed."
One of the most famous examples of this in recent years occurred at First Boston. Though the firm never publicly disclosed the details, people familiar with its trading of options on Treasury securities said the firm lost $100 million in April 1987, which contributed to a second-quarter loss that year of $13.2 million. There have been other options disasters at Wall Street firms, though few of such magnitude.
The rapid growth in the variety of complex options also is highlighting the jumbled Federal regulatory bureaucracy that oversees options, which will be the subject of debate in Washington again this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission has some jurisdiction, but so does the C.F.T.C. And a large part of the business, over-the-counter options, is subject to far less regulation than the options traded on exchanges.
"I don't think it is the lack of regulation that is the issue," said Thomsas A. Russo, a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a New York law firm, and a C.F.T.C. official during the Reagan Administration. "It is the confused state of the regulation that is the issue. Economically many of the products are similar, but they have different regulatory people to look over them."
In its basic form, an option allows a company to protect some of its revenue. For example, an American company selling auto parts in France might sign a long-term contract with a customer and want to protect it's revenue, which would be in francs, against fluctuations in the value of the franc that could cut into profits when it came time to convert francs to dollars. Purchasing an option to buy francs at a set price in the future protects the company from a fall in the franc and still allows it to profit from a rally.
The new products go well beyond something as basic as this. Creative Wall Street firms are designing products that provide tailor-made hedges against specific market risks. They are lowering the costs of some options, which can be quite high, by getting the customer either to take on more risk or limit their gain in return for lower fees.
And firms are focusing increasing attention on convincing companies that hedging risk with options should be a regular part of corporate strategy.
Charles Smithson, a managing director at Chase Manhattan Bank in Princeton, N.J., devotes all his time to educating businesses on the concept of buying options to offset risk. "I spend most of my time talking at conferences," he said. "I ask what kind of problem you have and say what are the range of solutions out there for you."
Options experts credit two men, Fisher Black and Myron Scholes, for opening the door to a booming options industry. As university professors in 1973, the two pioneered the methodology that allowed computers to figure out how to create and price options profitably. Mr. Black is now at Goldman Sachs and Mr. Scholes is at Salomon Brothers.
The key was designing a computer model that could manage the complex risk a firm takes on when it sells an option, since a turn in the market that makes an investor rich must come at the expense of the firm that sold the option. Many firms have spent heavily on powerful computer systems that can weigh all the variables and tell the firm how to manage its own portfolio of investments so it will not lose vast sums when options are exercised.
But the increasing expertise with which Wall Street firms are concocting ever newer and more complex options packages and pricing them so the firm can make a profit has begun to raise some questions about whether so many financial products are really needed -- and whether they are priced fairly.
"I have seen people who have overpaid," said Mr. Finnerty. "You have to be very careful. You have to call around and be sure you're paying a fair price. You can jazz a product up so it looks more sophisticated than it is. What happens is that companies get enamored with a particular product and the acronym that a bank uses to identify it."
Mr. Johnson said he thinks that too many users of complex options products do not really know what they are buying. "They do not understand the risk of the deal they are getting into or they think they have found the magic potion that will allow them to do what they want for less cost," he said. "In most of the situations that I have heard about, it is almost invariably true that they're trying to get something cheaper than it really costs."
Merton H. Miller, an economist at the University of Chicago who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1990, contends that the options and related products are very useful. But he has a caveat about the options sales process.
"They are like salesmen in any other business," he said. "They sell the sizzle as well as the steak, and there is a certain amount of sizzle in this."

HEADLINE: At Work;
As Seen From a Wheelchair

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Like a lot of people, George Biechler takes his physical confidence pretty much for granted. So when the vice president of the Meridien Bank sat down in a wheelchair recently to get a sense of how it would feel to maneuver through the world from a sitting position, he looked a little tight around the mouth. Mr. Biechler pushed clumsily through a swinging door and made it past one orange traffic cone before banking off a wall and onto the rim of a second cone. Freeing himself, he wheeled with furious inefficiency for the swinging door.
"I haven't felt that uncomfortable since I got my learner's permit when I was 16," he said later, watching another Meridien employee carom between wall and traffic cone. 
 Like hundreds of other commercial enterprises across the country, Meridien, the Reading, Pa.-based unit of the Meridien Bancorp, is preparing for the Americans With Disabilities Act, legislation passed by Congress in July 1990 that guarantees accessibility and employment rights to the 43 million Americans with physical and mental impairments. The first phase, requiring businesses to provide services and access to people with disabilities goes into effect today. Starting in July, the employment and workplace rights sections of the law will be phased in. Depending on who is speaking, A.D.A. has either plopped the unfair burden of retrofitting American society on the back of business or started a revolution in consciousness.
"We have been terribly concerned from the day we saw this bill," said Wendy Lechner, manager for research and policy development at the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group in Washington that represents half a million small businesses. "A lot of legislation is carrot and stick. This is all stick. Everything in the bill means trouble for business owners." She added: "I'm getting a lot of panic-stricken calls asking, 'What do I do?' "
Ms. Lechner said small businesses do not object to the law's admirable goals but to the potential cost and vagueness of its guidelines.
"People all over the country have some high expectations that they now have a right to be full consumers and participants," said Elaine Ostroff, a co-founder of the National Center for Access Unlimited, a disability issues consulting group with offices in Chicago, Boston and Washington. "The big change is attitudinal. It means people have to pay attention and look at issues." A.D.A. will be enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Justice Department and by private lawsuit.
For many larger businesses, the legislative and regulatory controversies are moot. When the enthusiasm in Washington for the measure became apparent two years ago -- "It was politically unpopular to oppose this bill," Ms. Lechner said wryly -- many companies bit the bullet. A report by Blank, Rome, Comiskey & McCauley, a labor and employment law firm in Philadelphia, said 75 percent of the businesses surveyed have taken some action to comply with A.D.A. Many followed a popular managerial approach and formed A.D.A. task forces.
Which is why one morning last week, the normal sedate decor of Meridien's Independence Mall branch in Philadelphia, just down the block from Independence Hall, yielded to the artifacts of sensitivity. At the first of a series of workshops for 2,200 employees in Meridien's 215 branches, trainers took employees through exercises intended to build an empathic bridge between people with and people without -- "temporarily without" as disability activists like to say -- disabilities.
"This focuses on things that are less obvious than wheelchairs," said Linda Sopko, a Meridien trainer, as she handed two earplugs to Gary Reinert, a banker who was about to experience briefly the aggravation of being hearing-impaired. Ms. Sopko looked down and, while shuffling some deposit slips, asked him to write the date. He leaned forward, tilted his head and looked alarmed. She asked again, looking at him this time, and he complied. He had, he said, read her lips.
Ms. Sopko advises tellers to look for cues in body language, then to project their voices and look busy until the transaction is over, so the customer does not feel rushed.
As Meridien's Mr. Biechler surveyed the sensitivity free-for-all before him, he dispelled the notion that his bank, or any business, regards its efforts merely as a chance to flaunt its altruism: "Forty-three million people is a major market segment."
 
 
SOLVING PROBLEMS OUT OF COURT

 Rarely has writing on a wall been clearer than in the months before July 1990, when Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act. Despite lobbying that made the wars of Gog and Magog look like a fortnight of cricket, support from a Bush Administration making good on campaign promises and a network of determined activists made A.D.A. all but inevitable.
The month the law was passed, Safeway Inc., the supermarket chain, formed a task force. "We had meeting after meeting," said Brian Dowling, a company spokesman. Store managers were asked to assess their stores and to help remove barriers. New stores are being built to A.D.A. specifications.
The Norwest Bank Corporation in Minneapolis has assigned a person in each region to coordinate compliance. James A. Gossen, a bank vice president, said Norwest is retrofitting ATM's that are not accessible now and looking into machines that will incorporate Braille and voice synthesizers.
Rights advocates say the fear of litigation among some small-business owners isn't irrational but has been overplayed. "You need a problem-solving attitude," said Elaine Ostroff, of the National Center for Access Unlimited. "No one wants to be the bad guy in this economy. Good faith goes a long way."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Those Giving the Word Also Suffer in Layoffs

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
Don't call them executioners. They feel bad enough already.
Nothing, of course, can match the shock of losing one's job. The body blow to self-esteem, as well as financial well-being, that comes with being laid off is nearly always traumatic. But handing out the pink slips can take a toll, too. 
 Just ask three executives involved in the process at Nynex, the telephone company in White Plains, N.Y., that is in the throes of layoffs that will affect nearly 3,400 people over the next two years. Donald J. Sacco, the executive whose name goes out on every Nynex layoff notice, felt a stabbing pain when he saw friends' names on the "at risk" list. Daniel C. Petri, who has had to personally deliver bad news to his staff, can't help recalling the outrage he felt when he was almost laid off at another company years ago. And Christine A. Killorin, whose husband was recently laid off, has spent sleepless nights worrying about having to inform some of her staffers that they must go.
Winnie Downes, an executive vice president at Lee Hecht Harrison, the New York consultants advising Nynex on the layoff process, warned the company's executives that they would feel this way. Despite elaborate business plans and personnel evaluations that take place before an execution, executives still feel wrenching pain, said Ms. Downes. "We told them, 'Don't bottle up your emotions,' " she said. "This is going to be tough for you, too."
People being told they are losing their jobs are likely to be angry or numb and may even try to bargain with their boss or appeal to a more senior supervisor. To ease the tension for both managers and employees, Ms. Downes told executives, it is important not to be drawn into such behavior.
Don't say, "I know how you feel," because you really don't and the remark could sound patronizing, according to Ms. Downes. Don't say, "They're making me do it;" that's shirking responsibility. Above all, she advises, don't say, "It's a blessing in disguise," because it is belittling.
What to do? Empathize, but underscore that the layoff is an irreversible fact of life that would be best dealt with by planning or getting some career counseling.
That this is untraveled territory for the phone company only makes matters worse. Unlike General Motors and other companies accustomed to huge cyclical hirings and firings, a job at the telephone company was supposed to be good for life.
All that changed, of course, with the 1984 breakup of the Bell system. Nynex, the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone, had special problems. In the early 1970's, it hired a bumper crop of young employees to cope with economic expansion in New York State and, particularly, the explosion in demand for telephones by Wall Street and the booming banking business.
Twenty years later, Nynex finds itself with thousands of employees in their mid-40's -- too young to retire but too expensive to keep. In recent years, Nynex has asked four times for volunteers to retire early and four times not enough people did so. "We looked at the numbers and asked ourselves was there any other way of doing it, and there just wasn't," said Mr. Sacco, Nynex's vice president for human resources.
In November, Nynex took a $550 million charge against earnings, 70 percent of it for work force reduction costs like severance packages. It was by far the largest such charge for the Baby Bells.
The month before, Nynex executives had worked out a "position analysis," laying out how much work needed to be done and, later, a "people analysis," laying out who was qualified to do it. The employees most at risk for layoff were told on Jan. 7, the first such date in a vast shrinkage that is likely to last into the mid-1990's, analysts say.
"You wind up seeing the names of your friends as the ones going to leave the business," said Mr. Sacco, whose 350-member staff was reduced by more than 100 positions. "It's anguishing for the people let go and for the people who let them go, no matter where you are in the organization chart." As one of the most senior Nynex officers, the 50-year-old Mr. Sacco did not have to inform anyone personally.
By contrast, Mr. Petri, New York Telephone's general manager for Midtown Manhattan, had to tell his people personally, a dozen so far in his 220-member staff. "I never had to lay off anybody," said Mr. Petri, who is 43.
When he was a young aerospace engineer on Long Island, he was threatened with layoff. "I remember that surge of energy, that feeling you want to fight the system," said Mr. Petri. "If I tell you that you are at risk of losing your job, you don't sit there and doze off. I remember that and I feel that." After his near-brush with job loss, Mr. Petri left for New York Telephone -- attracted by its job security.
Reflecting on his recent interviews with employees likely to be laid off, Mr. Petri said, "I don't have nightmares or bad dreams, but I do take that stuff home with me."
Ms. Killorin, New York Telephone's general manager for operator services, has had restless nights. She had to reduce her staff of 330 managers by 17 positions. Her husband, who was laid off last summer, tried to convince her that layoffs were the price paid for a free-market economy.
Still, she could not sleep. "That's kind of my way of dealing with problems," said Ms. Killorin, who is 40.
"I've fired people before for cause," such as incompetence, she said. "That wasn't hard because you at least had the conviction that somebody didn't belong in that job. But these were all good people and it was tough dealing with how hard it was."

If You Need a Reason, Now's the Time for Meatloaf

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
RECESSION, nostalgia and winter invariably add up to meatloaf on the menu. The traditional meatloaf is made with ground beef or a combination of beef, veal and pork. But today, it might even mean turkey loaf or chicken loaf as the anti-cholesterol squad keeps careful watch over the diet.
Regardless of the basic material, meatloaves are appealing because they are easy to prepare and to eat. They can be made in advance and reheated or sliced and used in sandwiches. What is pate but a sophisticated meatloaf? Like pates, meatloaf mixtures can be wrapped in pastry or used to stuff vegetables. Meatloaf mixtures can even be formed into small, individual portions. 
 When making meatloaf, it is important to season the mixture well. Spices, fresh and dried herbs plus ample onion and garlic give meatloaves character. The texture should also not be too dense, lightened by the addition of bread or bread crumbs or some other grain. Rice, oatmeal, bulgur and bran are some possibilities.
The texture of a good pate is achieved by blending in fat, which is why these savory loaves are enjoyed in small slices as a first course, not as a main dish.
In the past the vegetables for a meatloaf might have been sauteed in butter or bacon fat and the loaf itself baked with slices of bacon draped over it. Eggs are typically used as a binder and hard-cooked eggs might even have been tucked into the center of the loaf to create attractive slices.
Today these high-cholesterol embellishments can be reduced or eliminated. The onions and garlic are sauteed in olive oil and the extra fat is avoided. Instead of using whole eggs to bind the mixture, egg whites can be substituted.
With meatloaf, of course, mashed potatoes must be served. But even these can be made with the amount of butter reduced or with olive oil instead of butter.
 
Crusty Meatloaf
 
Total time: 2 1/2 hours
 
3 pounds lean ground beef
 3 egg whites, well beaten
 1 cup rolled oats (not instant)
 1/4 cup dry white wine
 3 cloves garlic, minced
 1 medium onion, grated
 1/2 cup milk
 2 tablespoons tomato paste
 2 tablespoons minced parsley
 1 teaspoon dried thyme
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix the beef with half of the egg whites. Soften the oats in the wine and add them to the meat along with the garlic, onion, milk, tomato paste, parsley and thyme. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
3. Shape the mixture into two loaves. Place them on a rack in a shallow baking pan that will hold them without crowding.
4. Mix the bread crumbs with the remaining egg whites and frost the loaves all over with this mixture. Bake about 1 1/2 hours, until the loaves are crusty and brown. Serve at once or allow to cool, then refrigerate. The loaves can be reheated -- whole or sliced -- in a conventional oven or a microwave oven or sliced and used for sandwiches.
Yield: 10 to 12 servings.
 
Turkey Patties With Mustard Sauce
 
Total time: 35 minutes
 
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 1/4 cup finely minced shallots
 1 1/2 pounds ground turkey
 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs
 1 tablespoon brandy
 1/4 cup chicken stock
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
1. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a heavy skillet. Saute the shallots over medium heat until they begin to turn golden. Remove the pan from the heat, scrape half the shallots into a mixing bowl and reserve the rest in a small dish.
2. Add the turkey, one tablespoon parsley, one tablespoon mustard and the bread crumbs to the bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well blended. Shape the mixture into eight patties of equal size, each about three-fourths of an inch thick.
3. Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. Add the patties and saute over medium heat about 10 minutes, turning them once, until they are cooked through. Remove the patties to a warm platter and cover with foil.
4. Return the reserved shallots to the pan and stir in the remaining mustard along with the brandy and stock. Cook, stirring, a minute or two until the sauce thickens slightly. Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in the remaining parsley.
5. Pour the mixture over the patties and serve.
Yield: 4 servings.
 
Garlicky Mashed Potatoes
 
Total time: 40 minutes
 
3 pounds Idaho potatoes, peeled
 6 cloves garlic, peeled
 3/4 cup hot milk
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper
 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, or 2 tablespoons olive oil.
1. Cut the potatoes into uniform two-inch chunks and place in a heavy saucepan along with the garlic. Cover with water, bring to a boil, lower heat to medium and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes.
2. Drain the potatoes and garlic and mash the potatoes and garlic together. Stir in the hot milk, season to taste with salt and pepper and add the butter -- less if desired -- or oil. Serve at once.
Yield: 6 servings.

HEADLINE: Mount Vernon Law Should Be Changed

 BODY:
As a tax-paying homeowner in the city of Mount Vernon, I go along with the city officials quoted in your article of Jan. 5, "Mount Vernon Challenges Definition of a Family," when they express their eagerness to protect their cities against increased density and other housing evils.
However, as a member of the board of directors of Genesis Housing Corporation, the not-for-profit organization that was denied a building permit for a two-family shared-dwelling unit for seniors, I disagree strongly with their method of attaining their stated goals. A little history is in order. 
 About three years ago, Genesis attained title to a piece of land on Union Avenue, a low-income area in Mount Vernon. The debris-strewn lot was located between a two-family house and a vacant six-story apartment house. After discussions with City Hall, Genesis decided to build a facility for senior citizens. Further discussion with social service agencies led to a decision to make the building into a shared (or congregate) housing facility similar to the ones in operation in Mount Kisco and Bedford for physically able low-income seniors.
Architectural plans were drawn up and successful application was made to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. With funds from that and other sources secure, Genesis applied to the Mount Vernon Building Department for a building permit and to the Mount Vernon Zoning Board of Appeals for some necessary minor variances. Both applications were turned down, essentially on the ground that the proposed occupants did not constitute a family and that the facility would amount to no more than a boarding house. (Boarding houses are illegal in Mount Vernon.)
Genesis went to court. The court decided that Mount Vernon's definition of what constituted a family was faulty; that the proposed house as outlined could fit into legally accepted definitions of family and that Genesis should be allowed to proceed with its project. The City of Mount Vernon has appealed the decision and, according to the article, is being supported by counsel from White Plains, New Rochelle and Peekskill.
I am no lawyer and am not capable of making a plea to a court of law, but I can and do make this plea to the court of public opinion and to the legal lights in the various city offices. What Genesis is saying is the following: If the Mount Vernon law on family is so constituted that it can't tell the difference between a commercially run boarding house and a home that is affordable to people who need and want it, a home run by a not-for-profit group, then something is wrong with the Mount Vernon law and it needs changing.
No one is asking the City of Mount Vernon or the other cities to give up their right to make appropriate zoning regulations. No one is asking it or the other cities to give up their right to protect the density and livability of their cities. What we want is for these officials to stop being petty, to stop seeing grave constitutional issues in any innovative plan that helps to meet a present, pressing need.
 
ROBERT M. PHILLIPS
Mount Vernon
 
On Jan. 13, the Appellate Court in Brooklyn upheld the State Supreme Court decision that allowed Genesis to proceed. Mount Vernon has not announced whether it plans to appeal the latest ruling.

HEADLINE: FIGHTING WORDS;
As Ugly Feelings Grow, It's Hard To Separate Fact and Friction

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan

 BODY:
IN asserting last weekend that America can't compete because its workers are "lazy" and a third of them "cannot even read," a Japanese legislative leader violated Japan's first rule of engagement with the United States: Never criticize America in any harsher terms than America criticizes itself.
In normal times, such indiscretions by Yoshio Sakurauchi, even with their edge of racial superiority, probably would have been written off as the ramblings of an aging and largely powerless legislator. But given the level of American anger now directed at Japan, these times are hardly ordinary. Last week a legion of spin-controllers led by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe raced to assure the American public that the comments by Mr. Sakurauchi, the speaker of Japan's lower house of Parliament, do not "reflect the way of thinking of the Japanese people in general." 
 The problem is, they do. In December, a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted with the Tokyo Broadcasting System asked, "If you had to describe most Americans, would you say they were hard-working or lazy?" Only 13 percent of the Japanese chose the first option; 66 percent agreed with Mr. Sakurauchi. Not long ago, when a college lecturer asked her freshmen to come up with adjectives describing America's national character, lazy was the overwhelming first choice -- although their descriptions were tinged with envy over relaxed American lifestyles.
If Mr. Sakurauchi's comments, which he said later he "regretted," seemed a veiled version of Nikita Khrushchev's "we will bury you" speech, it was only the latest measure of the rising emotions in the Japanese-American dialogue since President Bush's disastrous trade mission pulled out of town. The Japanese, with some justification, feel that they are being made the scapegoat for decades of American inattention to domestic problems, all of which, in their view, flow together on General Motors' beleaguered factory floors. That is the message underlying Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's recent spate of condescending-sounding speeches saying Japan must now show "compassion" for a "great country" struggling to solve AIDS, street crime, homelessness and a moribund education system. Mr. Sakurauchi simply took the next leap, effectively declaring that the Japanese culture of discipline, education and productivity is already emerging as the real winner of the post-cold war era.
As Mr. Sakurauchi's comments and the sharp American reaction resounded across the Pacific, protectionists in Congress introduced a bill to restrict the sale of Japanese autos, even those made in American "transplants," if the trade deficit is not reduced 20 percent a year -- as if the responsibility for closing the trade gap is only Japan's problem, not America's. And Los Angeles canceled a $122 million contract with Sumitomo Corporation to build a commuter rail line.
Mr. Sakarauchi's exquisitely bad timing was matched only by that of the Nintendo Corporation, whose owners should know better than to drive their spaceship into a galaxy of angry aliens. At the request of Seattle's government leaders, the Yamauchi family of Kyoto, which controls the game-maker, offered to buy the Mariners and keep the team under local management, rather than let the current owner move it to Florida. But the prospect of a piece of the ultimate in Americana going the way of Rockefeller Center and Hollywood studios seems bound to incense Congress. In the end, it probably won't happen: Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, quickly said the major leagues were not ready to sell their level playing fields to overseas owners.
Amid the epithets and the deals, governments on both sides turned to their cure-all: symbolism. President Bush, desperately trying to show that he returned from Tokyo with something more than the flu, held an unusual White House signing for an otherwise run-of-the-mill trade agreement on computers. Here in Japan the parliament ordered two Buick Park Avenues.
The problem is that few Japanese could be persuaded to do the same. Japanese will buy anything that sniffs of American culture: blue jeans, movies, California cuisine. But they also receive a barrage of little daily signals that when it comes to industrial goods -- especially cars and electronics -- Japan's success hinges on a culture whose innate discipline and uniformity encourage attention to detail and quality. Nothing attracts headlines here like the failure of an American component or a bug in American software; seven years after the crash of a Japan Air Lines jumbo jet, Boeing is still fighting off Japanese accusations that a shoddy repair triggered the accident.
But it is easy to lose track of the main point that Mr. Sakurauchi crudely touched upon: Are the Japanese more productive, and what does that mean for American competitiveness? Like most economic issues involving Japan, the answer depends on where you look.
 
The Productivity Phantom
 By the extremely imprecise measure of productivity -- gross domestic product produced per person -- America remains significantly more productive than Japan. So does Britain, a country whose competitive prowess rarely makes grown industrialists quake. But productivity is a deceptive thing -- countries that pump and refine a lot of oil have artificially high productivity rates that mean virtually nothing. In the area Mr. Sakarauchi was referring to, automobile factories, every study suggests that the worst Japanese plant is as good as the best American one.
Far more important, America's productivity lead is narrowing, and may be gone by 1995. Though Japan's economy is only two-thirds the size of America's, it spends more on new plants and equipment every year, automating new factories and replacing old ones. The results are startling: Since 1975, Japanese productivity in manufacturing has roughly doubled, while American productivity has increased a little more than 50 percent. Over the same period, Japan's working hours have decreased by about three hours a week, while America's have held steady. More important, the differences between Japanese and American work places still exist, and Japanese wonder what further economic humbling America will have to suffer before it gets the message.
Motoo Suzuki, the director of passenger car development and engineering at Mitsubishi Motors, notes that his 3,000 engineers "produce three times as many new car designs" as their 8,000 counterparts at Chrysler. "There is no secret to it," he says. "We bring in our suppliers and marketing people from the start, and do it together. They bring in the budget-cutters."
Such cultural explanations of Japanese efficiency, however, fall apart whenever you leave the easily measured world of the factory. Anyone who has spent time waiting in a jammed, paper-laden Japanese office is overwhelmed by the inefficiency: huge amounts of paper to be shuffled and stamped at each level of bureaucracy, endless meetings to reach the ever-elusive "consensus," long nights at the bar to build relationships -- at considerable cost to productivity the next morning.
The service sector is padded with unnecessary employees: scores of perfectly dressed young women greeting shoppers at department stores, train stations full of ticket-takers and ticket-checkers performing monotonous jobs that could easily be done by machine. It is marvelous for consumers, as long as you are willing to pay the very high price. The distribution system to get goods to hundreds of thousands of small shops is not only unnecessarily complex, but frightfully expensive and a major obstacle to newcomers who are not already part of the system -- a major complaint of American retailers. Rice farms are notoriously small and inefficient. But most of these are recognized inefficiencies, part of a seemingly deliberate full-employment plan that ensures that virtually everyone in Japan, down to grandmothers who make a few yen as weekend rice-farmers, gets a well-protected slice of the action. Older Japanese complain that the system is breaking down, partly because of a crushing labor shortage, partly because a younger generation of workers will not tolerate so much scut work. If this country ever really got efficient -- for example, making full use of a formidably talented work force of women -- America might really be in trouble.
Instead, America has been demanding at trade talks that Japan undercut its own efficiency, giving workers more leisure time, encouraging them to spend more and save less. Many here think that is a ridiculous invitation to plunge the Japanese economy into the kind of troubles that they think are crippling America. But a few prominent Japanese are beginning to argue that there is more to life than competitiveness. Japan "is in desperate need of a new philosophy of management, a new paradigm for competitiveness; a new sense of self," Akio Morita, the peripatetic chairman of Sony Corporation, who often seems to have more clout in America than in his own country, wrote recently. Japanese companies, he said, sounding a lot like Carla Hills, have a "preoccupation with market share" that leads them to accept razor-thin profit margins and offer paltry dividends to shareholders that no Western company would tolerate. "It is precisely this philosophy of competitiveness which also leads to multilateral trade friction," he said.
It sounds nice, but asking Japan Inc. to stop playing to win is like asking Ty Cobb, the baseball great of early this century, to stop sliding into home with his spikes high. Not very likely, no matter who owns the Mariners.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Where 'Buy American' Is More Than a Slogan

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
MOTOWN'S emotions have been rubbed raw by disparagements of American cars and the workers who build them.
But the latest crack by a Japanese politician may have pushed Detroit to a new level of irritation. A Chevrolet dealer invited shoppers to pound a Japanese-made truck with sledgehammers. Flag-waving members of the United Automobile Workers picketed Toyota dealerships. The exhortation to "buy American," increasingly chorused around the nation in recent weeks, has always been part of Detroit's credo and is being sounded here more insistently than ever. 
For Detroiters, the American car has always been a symbol of pride, the embodiment of their accomplishments. As the Big Three auto makers struggle to pull out of their tailspin people here are worried that their schools, churches, unions, clubs -- their whole way of life -- may vanish. Last week, the industry reported that mid-January sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell 1.9 percent this year from last year's levels.
Increasingly, that worry is expressed as anger. Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, delivered a bellicose broadside before the Detroit Economic Club on Jan. 10, calling for America to confront Japan: "I for one am fed up hearing from the Japanese, and I might say from some Americans, too, that all our problems are our own damn fault."
 
Protecting the Big Three
 Mr. Iacocca's words were dismissed by many outside the Rust Belt as parochial and myopic. A poll last week by The Detroit Free Press showed that 67 percent of car owners think Japan gets too much blame for American problems. The Michigan Congressional delegation has sponsored legislation that would protect the Big Three from imports, though it is questionable how popular the proposal will be outside the Middle West.
In auto country, the Iacocca speech and proposals in Washington were heard as a call to action. Read Patton, president of the Franklin Bank in Southfield, Mich., was so inspired that his bank is offering $100 to employees of commercial customers who buy a car made by General Motors, Ford or Chrysler. Mr. Patton concedes that his promotion is meant to drum up business for his bank, as well as the Big Three. "The fate of southeast Michigan is tied to the auto industry," he said.
The Monsanto Company of St. Louis, which has a subsidiary supplying the auto industry based in Auburn Hills, Mich., promised $1,000 to any of its 12,000 workers who buys a car assembled in North America before July 31. (Monsanto's offer also applies to Japanese models built on United States soil. Franklin, on the other hand, excludes all Japanese-brand cars from its offer.)
It is the consensus that Detroit's products have improved vastly in recent years, but the Japanese cars have also improved so much that gaps remain. Big Three auto executives go one step further, insisting that their products are now comparable to Japan's. But American auto makers also claimed parity in the 1980's when, as Mr. Iacocca now admits, domestic vehicles were demonstrably inferior. The resulting gap in Detroit's credibility has left some buyers of Japanese cars wondering what reason there is to switch back, except perhaps for one: the nation's economic vitality may depend on the Big Three.
Most economists say it is debatable whether "buying American" is a strategy tha ultimately can fortify the economy, which is better driven by competition than by sentiment.
However, if the Big Three can convince shoppers that buying a Taurus instead of a Toyota carries some cachet, then buying an American brand may represent added value in the same way that buyers pay extra for the prestige of owning a Cadillac or Mercedes, said Clifford Winston, a senior research associate for the Brookings Institution.
It can also make sense for a buyer to support the local economy. "If these consumers are at the same time workers in the auto industry, then they're certainly helping themselves by buying American," said Edward Gramlich, who teaches economics at the University of Michigan.
 
What Foreign Car?
 Many doctors, lawyers and merchants living in or near auto-manufacturing centers wouldn't dream of owning a foreign car, for fear of displeasing clients who work for the auto makers. More and more, they see buying American as good for their own business. And such feelings can transcend the issue of quality.
"My personal opinion is that we should stick with the Americans, whether they are bad cars or good cars," said Michael J. Chetcuti, manager of Quality Metalcraft in the Detroit suburb of Livonia. "It's our economic survival. I wouldn't care if the cars have cement tires on them."
Longer term, nationalistic enthusiasm for American vehicles won't help Detroit nearly as much as would matching Japanese competition. When Japanese politicians offered only grudging support for the Persian Gulf war, some surveys suggested that Americans, in a burst of patriotism, would be turning to Chevys and Fords. Yet during 1991 the Big Three lost market share and the Japanese gained.

HEADLINE: Bush Digs In;
Abortion Case Adds an Edge To the Election

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
POLITICIANS are instinctively drawn to compromise, which helps explain their discomfort with the issue of abortion.
Even a master strategist like the late Lee Atwater had a hard time managing the abortion issue, when he tried to recast the Republican Party for the 1990 elections as a "big tent" where both sides could feel at home. Last week, the Supreme Court might have guaranteed that the issue will be even hotter in 1992. The court set the stage for an election-year ruling that could further weaken or even overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case recognizing a constitutional right to abortion. 
 While protesters clashed in the streets of Washington, underscoring the passions roused by the issue, the Supreme Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania law that restricts access to abortion through a variety of regulations. The Supreme Court's action means that a decision is highly likely before the November election -- probably by late June or early July.
President Bush, a staunch opponent of legalized abortion, was already in a political vise on the issue, and the court's action tightened it. He is clearly unwilling to further antagonize his right, particularly when Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, is pressing a troublesome challenge in New Hampshire. Phyllis Schlafly, who is heading a drive to preserve the Republican Party's anti-abortion platform, said coolly: "I think people generally understand what happened when the President reneged on his no new taxes pledge. They can't afford another one."
At the same time, Mr. Bush is under mounting pressure from supporters of legalized abortion, who have been galvanized particularly by the 1989 case, Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. The National Abortion Rights Action League has begun airing ads in New Hampshire declaring, "The Bush Supreme Court is getting ready to make abortion illegal again." Kate Michelman, the head of the league, said, "It will be more important in this Presidential year than it has ever been in any Presidential election."
 
A Clear Partisan Line
 "Will it be enough to defeat George Bush?" she asked. "I don't know in and of itself if it will be enough, but it could certainly provide the margin of victory in states where it's close." There will be a clear partisan line on the issue: the five Democratic Presidential contenders all support abortion rights.
Republican backers of abortion rights are increasingly vocal, warning that the party platform is out of step with the American public. A fight over the platform, which now calls for a "human life amendment" overturning Roe and the appointment of judges who "respect the sanctity of innocent human life," is widely expected when Republicans gather in Houston this summer.
In the midst of all this, Mr. Bush seems to be digging in. On the anniversary of Roe, when anti-abortion forces traditionally rally in Washington, Mr. Bush delivered a statement of support for their "righteous cause." The same day, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, an adamant opponent of abortion, was named to head the committee to draft the platform.
In an interview, Mr. Nickles sought to play down the prospects of a divisive fight on the issue. "The Republican platform four years ago had 104 pages and abortion dealt with maybe half a page," he said. "I'm sure abortion will come up, but it's not going to be the sole source of discussion." Without being specific, he said he expected the platform language on the issue to remain "pro-life." Mrs. Schlafly said she had "every sense that the President is going to hold absolutely firm."
The electoral consequences of that are a subject of considerable debate. Many analysts say that the Republican Party's anti-abortion stance can hurt among moderate suburban voters. Mervin Field, a veteran polltaker in California, said the abortion rights position has a sizeable majority in that critical Presidential state.
But organizers for abortion rights acknowledge that it is often difficult to get their supporters to become single-issue voters. In contrast, the anti-abortion forces say they can consistently turn out their voters.
Moreover, one strategist close to the Bush campaign argued on Friday that voters dislike overt politicking on the issue, perhaps especially in a Presidential election. "We've never seen this issue injected in a Presidential campaign in a high voltage way," the strategist said.
The 1990 elections showed how the issues of war and the economy can overwhelm almost anything. Eddie Mahe, a veteran Republican consultant, asserts that even if Roe were overturned before the election, Mr. Bush would survive. "Will it make the campaign noisier? Yes," he said. Will it cause George Bush to lose if he might have otherwise won? No."
Moreover, even if Mr. Bush wanted to shift his position, it could be politically dangerous. He changed once before, during the Reagan era, abandoning a flexible stance for a harder anti-abortion line. Changing again could turn into a "character" issue, many Republicans say; Democrats like former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts already use his previous shift to attack Mr. Bush as a man "without a core."
At the end of the week, the Bush forces seemed far more preoccupied with Tuesday night's State of the Union Message, and how its economic recovery program will be received. On abortion, Mr. Bush remained unmoving, perhaps recognizing that no compromise could satisfy either camp.

HEADLINE: Helping Hand, Heavy Foot: Both Are the Real China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
THERE is a country in East Asia that imprisons and tortures dissidents, that sells missiles and nuclear technology to unstable third-world regimes, that exports prison-made products, that fires on Buddhist monks who demonstrate to demand freedom for Tibet.
There is also a country in East Asia that has revolutionized its economy along market lines, that provides free prenatal checkups for expectant mothers, that is rapidly extending the web of roads and electricity lines to remote villages, that provides wheelchairs and other help to the disabled, that offers Tibetans and other ethnic minorities preferential university admission -- that, in short, is raising standards of living of most inhabitants about as fast as any society in the world. 
 The gulf between these two faces of China is vast, and the question seems to be: Which is the real China?
The problem, though, is that both descriptions capture part of the Chinese reality in the 1990's. Some academics and business executives warn that the West risks misleading itself by focusing on the negative side today -- just as the West misled itself by focusing on the successes of economic and political liberalization before the crackdown two years ago in Tiananmen Square.
Ma Musha, a 37-year-old Muslim farmer in Qinghai Province, is enthusiastic about the Government policies. "Everybody," he told a visitor, "is getting much wealthier, and building better houses." Mr. Ma was giving a tour of the new house he is building, the third brick home in a village where most of the 20 houses are made of mud. Beaming, he pointed out the tile floor, electric radiator and elegant woodwork on the door. He shrugged without interest when asked about politics, but volunteered that the Communist Party was doing a good job in allowing people to get rich and build nice houses.
Then he spotted a couple of plainclothes policemen -- acquaintances of his, as is everyone in the area -- skulking outside. He excitedly called them over to meet a genuine American journalist who had hiked alone across the fields to talk to various villagers. Embarrassed, the policemen dawdled over, but they acknowledged that introductions were unnecessary. They had tailed the journalist to monitor whom he talked to and to punish anyone who spoke critically of the Government.
So which counts more? The Government policies that enabled Mr. Ma to get rich? Or those that authorized imprisoning him if he criticized the leadership?
China challenges foreign critics because it does not easily fit into a mold. In recent decades, the other Communist countries simultaneously repressed and impoverished their citizens. But China is presiding over rapidly rising living standards for the society as a whole, even as it suppresses the minority of intellectuals and workers who take a stand for democracy.
Of course, China is not unique in this respect; the Soviet Union under Stalin and Iraq under Saddam Hussein both saw economic progress under political repression. But in the 1990's, perhaps no country more than China combines such staggering economic growth with such ruthless repression.
Like Mr. Ma, most Chinese workers and peasants seem to care far more about personal prosperity than about issues like human rights or torture of political prisoners. Rather, the most common criticisms that ordinary Chinese seem to have involve such issues as corruption and extravagance among officials.
 
What's the Major Trend?
 "At least in southern China, I don't think the issues on local people's minds have anything to do with the issues the U.S. is bringing up," said Roderick W. Macneil, an American who runs a Hong Kong consulting firm that is active in southern China. "The people are simply worrying mostly just about how to get ahead in life." He argues that the preeminent historical trend in southern China is not repression but the emergence of an enormous export-oriented economy linked to Hong Kong's.
In response, many Chinese intellectuals argue that the regime ultimately will crumble because it brutalizes demonstrators and refuses to listen to criticism, and in this sense human rights issues are central. It is high time, they say, that the West gave the same support for freedom in China that was long standard in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Comparisons between China and India illuminate the ways in which the regime here resists easy stereotyping. For four decades, much of the world has been studying the performance of India's democracy and China's totalitarian system as competing models of how to seek modernization. And while India's voters have never chosen to place themselves under the kind of controls that prevail in China, it is also difficult to find Chinese who would trade places with Indians of equivalent social standing.
After all, China enjoyed an economic growth rate over the last decade that was 83 percent higher than India's, China's life expectancy of 70 years of age is 11 years longer than India's, and illiteracy rates are only about half as high in China as in India. For an infant born in China today, the chance of dying in its first year of life is only one-third as high as it would be in India -- and that may mean more to the parents than issues of voting or freedom of speech.
A young university graduate expressed the ambivalence that many Chinese intellectuals feel when they are asked about India. She said China has done much better economically but gave credit to the Chinese people, not the Government. And she added that India may have better long-term prospects, because a democracy perhaps is more able to chart a stable course toward prosperity. "India is far freer than China," she said as she tried to sum up her mixed feelings. "We admire India a lot. But I don't know anybody who wants to live there."

HEADLINE: The Region;
Plenty of Gas Arrives, But at Shortage Prices

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

DATELINE: SOUTH COMMACK, N.Y.

 BODY:
ON Tuesday, a new natural gas pipeline from Canada will come to life as an economic anomaly, a megaproject that was planned when energy shortages were still a fresh memory but completed in an era of energy surplus, declining prices and recession.
The pipeline, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System, is by far the largest single new source of energy for the New York region since the 1950's. It is capable of pumping enough gas yearly to replace 30 million barrels of oil, and nearly double that amount if additional pumping stations are added in upstate New York. 
 Over the next decade, government and utility industry officials say, the Iroquois system will redress an imbalance that has hobbled New York, New Jersey and Connecticut since before World War II. Few other states are as dependent on Middle East oil to heat their homes and fire their power plants.
"Energy shortages are not a hot topic these days, but one gunshot in the Middle East or a sudden cold snap would put them back on the agenda," said Richard M. Kessel, director of New York state's Consumer Protection Board.
Experts say that in addition to reducing the region's dependence on oil, abundant new supplies of natural gas will provide a cleaner and more environmentally acceptable fuel for manufacturers, power plants and homes.
Still, financial analysts say the project may be a drag on the New York regional economy instead of a boon as it struggles through the most protracted recession in decades.
The cost of the Canadian gas to be pumped through the Iroquois system is expensive compared with domestic supplies that are already available, according to analysts for Merrill Lynch & Company.
 
Cries of Outrage
 "We can already hear the cry of outraged commissions when they see soon-to-be filed purchase gas adjustments that contain Iroquois gas purchases," said Donald DuFresne, an energy analyst for Merrill Lynch, referring to possible fluctuations in the price consumers pay for the gas.
The criticism is the latest in the rancorous history of the Iroquois pipeline, which runs through shallow trenches for 370 miles from Iroquois, Ontario, southward through Upstate New York, where it connects with existing pipelines already carrying gas to Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Continuing southward, it crosses southwestern Connecticut and the Long Island Sound, ending in a muddy construction site here at South Commack. Other already established pipelines intersecting the system will carry its gas to Long Island, New York City and Central New Jersey.
A consortium of Northeastern utilities and gas distribution companies -- including the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation and the Long Island Lighting Company -- built the pipeline for $655 million. It was fiercely opposed by oil industry executives, who argued that increased imports from Canada would undermine United States exploration for gas, and by landowners along its route.
Just over half the pipeline's gas will be purchased by distributors in New England; the rest will be pumped into smaller, existing pipeline systems that thread their way across Long Island, New York City, central New Jersey and upstate New York.
Although construction has taken only 11 months, it came after years of surveying, land acquisition and regulatory approvals. Even before all the project's construction bills and legal fees have been paid, the consortium said last week the pipeline has exceeded its original budget by $70 million.
Yet as a business venture, the pipeline is almost assured of success. The utility group will operate its pipeline much the same way that United Parcel Service handles packages: it will collect a fee for each cubic foot it delivers. The pipeline's customers include more than 20 utilities in the New York region and the Northeast that signed contracts in 1987 to buy its gas for 15 years. After pumping pressure is phased in, Iroquois officials expect to collect $100 million in annual sales this year and $130 million in 1993.
The utilities say most of the natural gas, at least for now, will be sold to homeowners and landlords for residential heating. But other uses seem certain to include large-scale electrical power generation. On Long Island alone, the Long Island Lighting Company has already begun converting part of its Northport plant, the nation's largest electrical power plant fueled by oil, to natural gas. And this month New York state, which last year assumed control of the failed Shoreham nuclear power station, asked for bids by major engineering companies that might convert it to a gas plant.
Quietly, at the very time the project has moved from contentious public hearings to completion, the supply of natural gas from United States oil fields has risen, and its price declined. The major pipelines in the Northeast since the 1950's have embarked on expansion programs that, in addition to the Iroquois line, will greatly increase the capacity to provide gas to the region.
 
Expensive at First
 Energy experts say the result will stimulate competition, insulate the Northeast against shortages and stabilize or reduce oil prices. But because the price of gas delivered under the 15-year contracts signed by Iroquois customers is linked to a "market basket" of energy costs -- including prices of domestic gas and oil -- it will start at a higher level than gas sold elsewhere, and any reduction will be gradual at best.
"Gas from the Iroquois will be more expensive than the existing supply, but that is a short-term issue," said Anthony F. Earley Jr., the president of the Long Island Lighting Company, which helped build the pipeline and is one of its biggest customers.
Like other utility executives, Mr. Early said the costs and benefits of the Iroquois project can only be considered with a view to the future, when the added gas supplies will enable them to convert oil-fired power plants to gas and build much larger markets among residential customers.
While utility officials plan a future with greater supplies and wide selections of fuel sources, others say the main benefit may ultimately be the one foremost in the minds of the pipeline planners in the early 1980's.
"History provides ample reminders that you cannot count out the threat of oil shortages," said Robert Stobaugh, a professor of business and energy expert at the Harvard Business School. "Particularly in a region that is so reliant on oil, this project has to be regarded as a good thing."

HEADLINE: The Cold War of Cuba and the Miami Exiles Heats Up

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
THE cold war may be over in Washington and Moscow, but it rages on in Florida and Cuba. The execution in Havana by firing squad last week of a Miami man recently captured with two other exiles after landing on the Cuban coast in a dinghy quickly produced angry demonstrations in front of the Bay of Pigs Monument here and defiant rhetoric from Fidel Castro and his increasingly beleaguered Communist regime. On both sides of the Florida Straits, any relaxation of tensions now seems more remote than ever.
In the past, Mr. Castro might have dealt less harshly with an infiltration episode. But with the Soviet Union gone, and billions of dollars in subsidies vanishing with it, the Cuban leader is looking unusually vulnerable. So Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, a 38-year-old mechanic who confessed to joining a shadowy Miami paramilitary group called Commandos L after fleeing Cuba on a boat last April, was deemed to have betrayed "the fruits of the revolution." He was made an example and executed. 
 Cuban-Americans, a million of whom live in South Florida, sense fear and desperation in Mr. Castro. Events like the daring and spectacular helicopter escape of 34 Cubans earlier this month convinced them that his end is approaching. But the veterans of the Bay of Pigs and the firebrands who belong to Alpha 66 and other paramilitary groups are not content to watch the Castro regime stagger under the weight of its own repression, inefficiency and corruption; they want to be able to claim they brought the whole structure tumbling down.
Passions have been especially inflamed by the recent conference on the 1962 Cuban missile crisis held in Havana. For years, Cuban exiles here have chafed at what they assumed was an American pledge, made by John F. Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev in settling the crisis, not to invade Cuba. But correspondence between the two leaders, made public on the eve of the conference, revealed that despite verbal assurances, Mr. Kennedy refused to agree to any formal pact that would prohibit the United States from attacking Cuba.
As a result, leaders of the Cuban community here, whose votes and campaign contributions are essential to President Bush's hopes of winning Florida in this year's election, have now thrown their energies into a petition drive urging Mr. Bush to grant exile groups here the right to use force to overthrow Mr. Castro. The State Department on Friday strongly rejected that notion: a spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, warned that "any efforts to use the territory of the United States to prepare or promote violence in Cuba" are violations of the Neutrality Act that "will be vigorously pursued and duly prosecuted." Nevertheless, thousands of exiles have already signed the document, and Havana has expressed its alarm at the idea that American policy might change. "We think that, yes, it should remain valid forever," Jorge Risquet, a member of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, said of Mr. Kennedy's 30-year-old guarantee. "A committment is a committment."
 
The Divided Opposition
 At the same time, however, disagreements over how to hasten Mr. Castro's fall have opened divisions among his opponents here. On Wednesday, Mayor Xavier Suarez of Miami joined Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful of the exile lobby groups here, and other prominent Cuban-American business and civic leaders in founding the Cuban Anti-Defamation League. They said the new group would "defend the good name and influence of the community against those who would distort and defame" leaders of the drive to oust Mr. Castro. But other prominent Cuban Americans have criticized the infiltration episode, some even suggesting it was so inept that Mr. Diaz Betancourt must have been a double agent.
With the Cuban economy in a virtual state of collapse, Mr. Castro has indeed been quick to exploit the raid for maximum propaganda value. The trial of Mr. Diaz Betancourt and his compatriots, which was televised, featured frenzied accusations of their supposed links to the C.I.A. and to Cuba's own small but persistent human rights movement. Mr. Castro's brother Raul, who is Defense Minister, warned all exiles "seeking signatures asking George Bush for permission to wage war" that "those who live by the sword die by the sword."
Fidel Castro, however, does not appear to believe what his own Government is saying about an American threat. "I don't think the United States is contemplating an invasion," he said at the conference, according to several participants. He was also reported to have pledged that Cuba would "live by accepted norms of international behavior" from now on and end its adventurism abroad. "Times have changed," he was quoted as saying. "We have changed." Those remarks, all made behind closed doors, were enough to convince some Americans who attended the conference that it is time for some sort of rapprochement.
For militant Cuban exiles here, detente in any form would be the worst possible outcome. But neither do they like having the F.B.I. looking into their activities as violations of the Neutrality Act, which is one of the few concrete results of the failed raid. At the moment, it is both easier and safer for Cuban Americans to make their influence felt in Washington than in Havana. But for some, the temptation to continue "tweaking the beard of the tyrant," in the words of one radio commentator here, may also be too hard to resist.

HEADLINE: Corruption and Waste Clog Aid Pipeline to Russia

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 25

 BODY:
As the United States and other Western nations get ready to send large amounts of aid to the former Soviet Union, people here are struggling to overcome inexperience and disorganization at both ends of the pipeline, as well as a strong temptation to divert scarce food, clothing and medicine to a hungry black market.
Rushing to stitch together some kind of safety net for the needy and to keep up with the foreign response to their country's growing emergency, Russian Government officials have created a Ministry for Social Protection. 
 Together with a Commission for Humanitarian Aid, the new ministry has identified 31 regions and 65 million pensioners, single parents, Chernobyl victims and domestic refugees as the most deserving of foreign aid and other forms of government assistance.
 
Private Groups Spring Up
 Private organizations are also springing up faster than anyone can count. A conference for social service groups organized recently in St. Petersburg by the Russian Salvation Army drew representatives from 114 groups instead of an expected 21.
In Russia, which is the largest of the former Soviet republics and has received by far the biggest share of the 352,000 tons of foreign aid delivered since December 1990, officials in and out of government acknowledge their handicaps.
 
Wishing Donors Would Listen
 But as 47 nations met this week in Washington to outline their latest charity drive -- including a $450 million loan to buy Korean rice, a donation of 16 million prepackaged meals left over from the United States war effort in the Persian Gulf, and a pledge from Argentina to take 100,000 immigrants -- some Russians were quietly saying they wished that someone would ask them about their needs.
"Look, the West is afraid of a social explosion in Russia, and they say, 'We will tell you where it is likely to be,' " said Gennadi A. Zhukov, deputy chief of the working group of the Russian Commision for Humanitarian Aid.
"The European Community decided it is going to be in Moscow and St. Petersburg, so that is where they send 200 million ECU's of humanitarian aid," he said. "Of course, that way it is more convenient for them, and easier to show on television."
There have been other more bitter disappointments. Workers at a soup kitchen in Moscow run by a Western charity were recently dismayed to open a truckload of United States Government aid and find that half of it consisted of paper plates and cups, preserved bread, hashed brown potatoes, boxes of instant grits with an 1984 expiration date and fruit juices that had gone sour.
In a country lacking in almost everything except potatoes, bread and kasha, the Russian word for grits or porridge, the shipment was virtually useless, said one charity official who asked not to be identified. "You opened a box and anything could be in it," she said. "And the worst part is that we will have to throw most of it out."
Russian officials share Western nervousness about insuring that aid shipments reach their destinations. "Most of all, what worries us is that the help gets to those people who need it, " said Yevgeny P. Ivanov, head of the agency for international humanitarian aid in the Ministry of Social Protection. "When you have such huge amounts, not everything can be ideal, but we do what we can."
Since the aid began in earnest last winter, the press has carried occasional reports that food, clothing or medicines were disappearing onto the black market or into the kitchens of the old Communist Party nomenklatura.
 
Containers Sit in Train Yard
 But some of the misrouting of aid has as much to do with donors' eagerness to rush to Russia's assistance as with Russian inefficiency. For instance, a shipment of 28 containers of aid from Germany has been sitting in a Moscow train yard since Dec. 25 without any address label, the newspaper Izvestia reported today.
Last week the Salvation Army received, without any advance warning, 140 cartons of clothing and food from Nashua, N.H..
Russian officials are also concerned that Western donors are putting too many restrictions on the aid. The rules seem to be creating more difficulties for local governments, which are desperately trying to help the aged, the poor and big families, whose tight budgets have been strained or destroyed by the leap in consumer prices since cost controls were eased on Jan. 2.
With much of the aid marked for orphanages, homes for the aged and hospitals, the public often does not see the promised goods. Suspicions have arisen that it has all been whisked off by the ever-present "mafias," both criminal and bureaucratic.
 
Exaggerated Expectations
 Mr. Zhukov said that such suspicions were fueled, both here and in the West, by exaggerated notions of how much aid has been distributed. "Just last night, I heard the television anchorman talk about millions of tons of aid," he said. "It is not millions of tons, it is thousands."
Most disappointing, he said, has been the delay of the long-promised $165 million in food aid from the United States. It has yet to materialize.
Of the 1,144 aid flights that have arrived in the last 13 months in the Svoiet Union, he said, only 103 were from the United States, while 604 were from Germany.
"Although there are a lot of these announcements, it is just propaganda," Mr. Zhukov said. "As far as reports of active American involvement, at this point, we are not seeing it."
The question of foreign aid is double-edged here, particularly for an older generation that finds the idea of being dependent on food parcels from Germany particularly humiliating.
"I am a man who has not lost his worker's conscience and honor," said Ivan Shakhtyor-Semyonov, of the city of Cheboksary in the Urals, in a letter to Sovetskaya Rossiya.
"If some donors bring these gifts, I will throw them into the street, stomp on them with my feet," he wrote. "We are people. We are not donkeys, sheep, cattle to be calmed down and consoled by food. We have our own dignity."
 
Tracking Down Deliveries
 Most Western programs now insist on tracking deliveries of goods to the door of the hospital or orphanage, a practice that Russian officials for the most part encourage. "It is a constant battle," said Elizabeth Gardner of Project Hope, which has delivered four planeloads of medicine and medical equipment to Russia in the last two months. "Drugs are a valuable commodity here, and so there is a constant temptation for diversion."
Some shipments -- of chocolate, for instance, or dried army rations -- have deliberately been sold commercially for high prices, with the proceeds funneled back into aid projects. Russian aid officials saddled with the cost of redirecting some of the money to distant cities say they need it to cover transportation and other organizational costs.
Most of the aid to Russia remains in Moscow, a city of nine million where, foreigners and Russians agree, the food crisis is worse than anywhere else. Of the 350,000 tons of aid delivered to the old Soviet Union since December 1990, 162,000 tons went to Moscow, 83,000 went to St. Petersburg, 41,000 to other cities in Russia and 16,000 to Ukraine, according to Mr. Zhukov.
But even those figures -- which may not reflect aid shipments of which the Russian authorities are unaware -- are small compared with needs.
Sven-Erik Ljungholm, captain of the Russian Salvation Army, said that aid officials in St. Petersburg were reporting that despite a desperate solicitation effort by Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak, the city had received only 18 percent of the aid it had calculated it needed to get through the winter.
 
From Denial to Desperation
 Until last year, the old Soviet Government would barely admit to having social problems like hunger or homelessness, let alone organize any effort to alleviate them. Since then, the Soviet Union has collapsed, along with most of its institutions. Now, with their economies in a nosedive, Russia and other republics are trying to create something resembling a welfare system.
Those working with the new Russian bureaucracies are more encouraged by the efforts than they are discouraged by the confusion and frustration that typically accompany any endeavor here. "There is a system, even if it means standing in line, or waiting for a phone that doesn't work," said Mr. Ljungholm. "It may be chaotic, but it is a system."
Typically, any complaints about the way Western aid is distributed are coupled with expressions of gratitude that more prosperous nations are coming to the rescue.
But as they become more experienced at the business of being a charity case, Russians are beginning to realize that the most reliable aid may have to come from themselves.
"The hopes that 'foreigners will help us' pull ourselves out of our hole is naive to say the least," the newspaper Pravda said today in a commentary on the aid conference in Washington. "They have their own troubles. And they will help us only to the extent that it helps their own interests, not ours."

HEADLINE: 7 Nations Say Drag on Growth Is Dissipating

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Seeking to raise consumer and business confidence, the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations said today that the conditions slowing worldwide economic growth were dissipating and that the seven nations would step up their cooperation to stimulate expansion.
After a seven-hour meeting here, the ministers issued a statement saying that economic output should soon increase because inflationary pressures have eased and long-term interest rates have begun to fall. In an apparent response to American pressure to put more emphasis on growth, the ministers said they were convinced "that the forces that have been inhibiting economic activity in many countries are dissipating and that the conditions for improved global growth exist." 
 Eager to revive the United States economy before November elections, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady boasted that Washington had succeeded in getting all seven countries to make an "unequivocal commitment" to focusing more on increasing output.
But Mr. Brady's campaign to get Germany to cut its interest rates to spur investment and growth apparently bore less fruit. The communique cautiously suggested that Germany's current policies "could create room for lower interest rates."
German officials struggled today to ward off pressure from Washington, arguing that their country needed high interest rates to protect the mark and to subdue inflationary pressures.
"The stability of the German mark is important not just for Germany, but also for our partners," Helmut Schlesinger, president of Germany's central bank, said at a news briefing.
The finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan reiterated their goal of achieving "sustainable growth with price stability."
Reviewing the economic situation in each of the seven nations, the communique said that President Bush would announce measures in his State of the Union address on Tuesday to strengthen growth, including incentives for investment.
As for Germany, the ministers said that an easing in German wage pressures, the country's efforts to reduce its budget deficit and the slowdown in growth of the money supply could create room for lower interest rates. The Germans pledged today to discontinue a 7.5 percent income tax surcharge in mid-1992 and to introduce incentives to spur housing construction.
One senior Treasury official praised the move, saying it would stimulate German growth as well as the country's appetite for exports. The official said the decision would benefit American exports, which have been crucial to preventing the United States from falling deeper into recession.
Treasury officials said that pushing harder for growth in the industrialized world would make it easier for the nations of Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the developing world to cope with their severe economic problems.
The ministers noted that Japan has pledged to step up domestic consumption by increasing public investment. American officials said the policy should encourage Japan to import more, which would help reduce the country's soaring trade surplus.
The ministers also discussed foreign exchange markets, where the American and Japanese central banks intervened a week ago to push up the yen against the dollar. The ministers said they had "reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate closely in exchange markets, thus contributing to favorable conditions for stable exchange markets and economic recovery."
The seven called on the International Monetary Fund "to act expeditiously" to conclude arrangements by this spring that would allow Russia and other former Soviet republics to join the fund.
Saying they recognized the difficulties the republics face in adopting economic reforms, the ministers warned them not to default on their debt payments, which were lightened earlier this month. The ministers said the payments were a precondition for maintaining the republics' creditworthiness.

HEADLINE: Sudan Is Seen as Safe Base for Mideast Terror Groups

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The United States and other Western Governments are becoming increasingly alarmed by evidence that international terrorist organizations that once operated from Lebanon and Libya are now using the Sudan as a safe haven, foreign diplomats here say.
The Western nations also fear that the Islamic military Government formed here after a coup in 1989 is intent on exporting its brand of fundamentalism, threatening secular Governments in Egypt and other countries in the region, the diplomats say. The Sudan has been forging an increasingly close alliance with the Islamic Government of Iran. 
 The developments in the Sudan, which has cast its lot with the radical Arab states, come at a time of heightened concern over the growing power and appeal of Islamic fundamentalism across North Africa as Muslim populations become disillusioned with long-ruling, unresponsive and often corrupt Governments. That rise in influence was vividly illustrated last month in Algeria, where fundamentalists won resounding victories in free voting and were poised to take control of Parliament before the military cracked down and suspended the democratic process.
 
Visit by Iranian President
 The challenge posed by the Sudan was underlined after a visit to Khartoum last month by the Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, Western diplomats said. Iran agreed to grant military and economic assistance to the Sudan, thus extending to it the potential to not only consolidate its power at home but also to materially and morally promote Islamic groups elsewhere, the diplomats said.
In the last year, the Sudanese have accelerated the training of a paramilitary force of conscripted Government workers and university students, known as the Popular Defense Force. Officials acknowledge that it is modeled after and is receiving help from Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
As the Sudan hardens its Islamic rule at home, it is providing easy access, and apparently in some instances training installations, to international terrorist groups, the diplomats said.
They said the groups include the radical Palestinian organization of Abu Nidal, the Iranian-backed Party of God and Islamic Holy War. The Abu Nidal group has evidently been scaling back its operations in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, as Libya seeks to soften its image as a sponsor of terrorism. The other two groups, long linked with the kidnapping of Westerners in Lebanon, have seen their activities curtailed as the Syrian-allied Lebanese Government moves to extend control.
 
Warnings to Sudan Reported
 The United States and Britain have made "repeated" warnings to the Sudanese Government about the presence of the terrorists organizations here, the diplomats said.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Robert G. Houdek, who visited the Sudan days before the Iranian President arrived, told senior members of the Sudanese Government that their country faced "grave" consequences if an international terrorist act could be traced to the Sudan, American officials said.
"Houdek told Hassan al-Turabi that there are continued reports of Sudan being used as an R and R place," an American official said, "and he cautioned Turabi that if Sudan was a facilitator of these terrorist groups then the actions of the terrorist groups would be a responsibility of Sudan."
Mr. Turabi, regarded as a leading intellectual force in the Islamic world, is the Secretary General of the National Islamic Front and described by Sudanese and Western officials as the de-facto head of the Government.
Implicit in Mr. Houdek's warning, in a written statement to the Government, was the threat that the Sudan would be added to Washington's list of states that support international terrorism, the official said. Countries on the terrorist list, all of which are denied United States economic aid or favorable terms of trade, are Libya, Iraq, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and Iran.
Diplomats in Khartoum say Iran appears to be extending its influence here to compensate for having lost ground in Lebanon; in addition, last year's military defeat of Iraq, an ally of the Sudan, has left a power vacuum here that Teheran seems eager to fill.
The largest country in Africa in land mass, the Sudan, with a population of about 25 million, was an ally of the United States until a coup in 1989 threw out the democratically elected, progressive Government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi; fundamentalists have since come to the fore in the current military regime headed by Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Washington cut all economic and military aid to the Sudan after the coup but last year spent $170 million on famine relief.
The Sudan declared itself an Islamic state in 1990 when General Bashir visited Iran and said the two countries shared a common duty to propagate Islam. The Sudanese sided with Iraq last year in the Persian Gulf war.
 
Worries About Nearby Nations
 Now, as the surge of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa has been underscored in Algeria, American policy makers are worried about the Sudan's vow to spread fundamentalism to surrounding nations.
The Sudan is in a strategic position to export its Islamic revolution because of its borders with both Egypt and Libya and with six African countries, including Ethiopia, which has a large and impoverished Muslim population.
Egypt regards the Sudan as vital because the countries share then Nile River, and the High Dam of Aswan is only 150 miles north of the Sudanese border.
But the traditionally friendly Egyptian-Sudanese relationship has degenerated in the last year, with Cairo accusing the Sudan of supporting fundamentalism in Egypt. Just this month, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Amr Moussa, warned the Sudan to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Egypt. And Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates have withdrawn their Ambassadors from Khartoum, asserting that the Sudan was helping fundamentalists in their countries.
 
Denials From Official
 In an interview at his home here, Mr. Turabi denied that international terrorist groups were present in the Sudan. "We wouldn't know if an Abu Nidal element came into Sudan. But there is no office, official or unofficial," Mr. Turabi said. "There were a few Palestinians who were thrown out of the gulf who were not even engaged in political activities who came here." The Sudan was one of "two or three countries that allow Arabs to come in without a visa," he said.
An American official here said the terrorist presence had increased in the Sudan in the last six months as life had become more difficult for them in Lebanon and Libya.
"This is a safe haven of choice," the official said. "They can come and go as they please. They operate here with impunity. They are no longer welcome in Beirut, and there are signs Qaddafi is not happy to have them," he said, referring to the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
The official said he did not have much hard data of what the terrorist organizations were doing in the Sudan. He added that although there was enough evidence to suggest there were training camps, he could not specify their locations or the number of men involved. But the official said he believed that there might be about "100" people he could classify as members of terrorist groups in the Sudan and that the number was likely to rise as Sudanese links with Iran were cemented.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Sudan At a Glance"
 
Geography: The Sudan is the largest country in Africa, covering 966,757 square miles, or about one-fourth the land area of the United States. The north is mostly desert, while the south is tropical.
 
People: In 1990, the estimated population was more that 25 million. Blacks are the largest ethnic group, at 52 percent of the population, concentrated in the southern half of the country. Arabs are the second largest group, at 39 percent, and live primarily in the north.
 
About 70 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. The literacy rate is 20 percent.
 
Economy: Gross national product in 1988 was $8.5 billion. Consumer prices rose 66.3 percent in 1990.
 
Major industries are textiles and food processing. Major crops are gum arabic, cotton and sorghum. About 78 percent of the labor force works in agriculture.
 
History: The Sudan gained its independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956. Parliamentary democracy prevailed until 1969, when a civilian-led council took power and declared a socialist state. The socialist Government was overthrown in a 1985 military coup, and in 1986 elections were held for the first time in 18 years. The elected Govbernment was overthrown in another coup in 1989, when th current leader, Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, came to power.
 
The north and south have been engaged in civil war since 1988.

HEADLINE: Negotiators Expect Macy to File for Bankruptcy Protection Soon

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Participants in the negotiations to resuscitate R. H. Macy & Company said yesterday that the retailer was almost certain to file for bankruptcy protection soon, possibly as early as Monday.
One of them said Macy had told some important creditors to expect a bankruptcy filing early next week. 
 Five people who took part in the talks said no new proposal for providing Macy with much-needed cash has replaced the $1 billion offer from Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman and chief executive of the Loews Corporation, which fell through late Friday when the parties could not agree on easing the terms of Macy's huge debt.
"It's almost impossible to put together another deal like the Loews offer with anything like the speed required at this point," one participant said. "Bankruptcy is really the only choice." Even if an interested rescuer suddenly emerged, the negotiators said, time has run out.
 
Merchandise Is Withheld
 Macy's banks have cut off its access to money, no one is accepting its credit and suppliers have shipped few goods to its subsidiaries, which include the I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains, and several small specialty stores. Macy's New York-based flagship chain canceled a color advertising insert that was scheduled to appear in several big Sunday newspapers next weekend because it did not have the merchandise featured in the advertisements. Without a rescue, Macy must file for bankruptcy protection or risk be forced into involuntary bankruptcy because it cannot pay its suppliers or even meet its payroll.
"They're living literally hand to mouth," said one participant in the talks. "Cash that is coming in is barely enough to pay their daily operating expenses. They have no reserves."
A Macy spokesman declined yesterday to comment on the negotiations or the company's plans.
By voluntarily filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, Macy is almost certain to be able to borrow the cash it needs because debts incurred under court supervision would be first in line for repayment.
Suppliers, whose warehouses are holding back goods from the company until its financial condition becomes more certain, said yesterday that they wished the retailer would file for bankruptcy protection.
"Everyone has accepted there is going to be a bankruptcy, so let's just get on with it," said Bud Konheim, head of Nicole Miller Ltd., a mid-sized apparel manufacturer. "At this point they have zero other options because there are no more Tisches in the woods."
While the banks and insurance companies that lent Macy hundreds of millions of dollars generally hold valuable real estate as collateral, the many bondholders who helped finance the leveraged buyout of Macy in 1986 and later acquisitions are likely to suffer heavy losses. Those bonds are not backed by any collateral.
On Thursday, Mr. Tisch, whose family controls the Loews Corporation, proposed buying Macy for more than $1 billion and paying off its debt. But late Friday Loews abruptly announced that the talks broke off after it failed to reach an agreement with the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which holds an $811 million mortgage on about half of Macy's more than 140 department stores. Mr. Tisch wanted Prudential to agree to a lower interest rate than the mortgage calls for.
Some analysts said that the breakdown in the talks might be a sophisticated game of financial chicken between savvy companies and that Mr. Tisch might ultimately come back to the table.
As part of his plan, Mr. Tisch, through a Loews subsidiary, would have paid $740 million for Macy's publicly traded bonds and $80 million for virtually all of the equity. If the buyout deal had been completed, he would have then paid suppliers $200 million to $300 million.
With no deals to consider and none in sight, Macy lawyers and investment bankers were trying to put together a bankruptcy plan over the weekend. Remarkably, for a company of its size and sophistication, Macy is hurtling toward bankruptcy largely unprepared.
Lawyers and investment bankers are working feverishly to complete the necessary documents for a bankruptcy filing and as of yesterday Macy's representatives were still trying to put together a package of short-term financing for use after a bankruptcy filing -- to allow the retailer to continue to meet day-to-day expenses like utility bills, travel costs and payroll while a long-range reorganization is crafted.
Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman and chief executive, was apparently so certain that the company would be saved from filing that he did not have the company's lawyers finish the temporary financing and bankruptcy documents. The talks for the financing were begun less than 10 days ago, even though a bankruptcy filing had been looming for months.
Several people close to the negotiations said they believed that Macy was desperately low on the cash and could no longer draw on a credit line that it had been using.
In a few months, Macy's situation has grown appreciably worse, as the nation's economic slump slowed consumer spending and the retailer's losses mounted. With its $3.6 billion in debt, Macy faces a regular series of multimillion-dollar interest payments, and it also is obligated to maintain certain levels of cash in the bank to qualify for its bank credit lines.
The Christmas shopping season, the most important season for retailers, was clearly a disappointment and left Macy short of its sales projections.
"Generally in these situations, the prudent course is to anticipate all possibilities and prepare for all eventualities, as unlikely as they may initially seem," said Harrison J. Goldin, a principal of Goldin Associates Inc., a financial consulting firm, and a former New York City Comptroller.
 
Some Talks to Continue
 With a bankruptcy filing almost certain, a host of large financial institutions that have been quietly negotiating to overhaul Macy's financial obligations will continue the discussions in bankruptcy court. They hope to get back much of the hundreds of millions that they invested in Macy.
The main bank group, led by Bankers Trust and Manufacturers Hanover, would be exposed to $700 million in debt after a bankruptcy filing, including a $420 million letter of credit that has not yet been drawn upon. Another bank group, led by the Swiss Bank Corporation, is owed about $560 million, has secured debt.
Prudential, the focus of Friday's negotiations with Mr. Tisch, is likely to try and get some interest on the $811 million mortgage it holds on Macy's stores. Although Prudential has fairly good collateral for its loans -- the stores -- like other creditors it will be hurt in a bankruptcy filing. At the very least, Prudential will not get the 12 percent interest that its mortgage calls for. In fact, it is not likely to get any interest on the note for several years.
In addition, the hundreds of individuals and institutions that bought Macy's high-yield bonds to finance the management-led buyout of the company in 1986 will become leading creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.
Until now the bondholders have not organized, and have largely sat on the sidelines and watched as Macy renegotiated its bank credit lines 23 times and still failed to meet all its obligations. If the company does seek protection, analysts and those involved have said the bondholders will suffer the greatest losses because their debt is not backed by any collateral.
Altogether the bondholders hold roughly $1.3 billion of debt in three different classes of bonds that pay as much as 16.5 percent. The bonds, which sank to low levels before news of Mr. Tisch's offer, rebounded sharply once news of the deal was public. Some bonds that will come due in 1998 traded as high as 74 cents on the dollar after languishing at about 55 cents for many days before.
Prudential was one of the largest holders of Macy bonds along with many other life insurance companies and junk bond funds. It is unclear whether Prudential still holds any of the bonds.
Mr. Tisch was prepared to offer about 80 cents on the dollar for those bonds, people involved in the talks said. Now it is likely that those who hold the bonds will get substantially less after a settlement in bankruptcy court.
 
Expensive Pact With Insurer
 The rescue plan stumbled on Friday over Mr. Tisch's demand that Prudential grant better terms to Macy's on the $811 million mortgage. The Prudential debt is the largest of Macy's real estate-related debt and was very costly because of various provisions in the mortgage.
One person familiar with the terms of the mortgage said that even if the retailer had been able to find a lender to refinance the entire mortgage on better terms, the cost of buying Prudential out would have been close to $1 billion because of various agreements.
Prudential, whose loan is secured by the stores themselves, said it was not willing to cut the interest on the mortgage to a flat 9 percent from the present 12 percent, as Mr. Tisch wanted because it would have lost tens of millions of dollars in interest income. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the insurance giant could get even 9 percent interest on its loan if Macy's file for bankruptcy protection, although the principal is probably secure. In fact, it is not likely to get any interest on the notes while Macy's in bankruptcy. It is possible that the interest will be accrued and paid back after the company emerges from bankruptcy.
"We had many discussions with the Tisch organization and we were willing to bend and compromise to a certain point and beyond that it would not have been prudent for us," Frank McDougal, the president of the Prudential Mortgage Capital Company, said on Friday. Mr. McDougal said the company felt its principal was secure.
In addition, the bankruptcy court may allow Macy's to sell some stores to raise cash that could be used to reduce its debt, as the company had already planned to do. Although the stores that the company wants to sell are not the ones Prudential has as collateral for its loans, the overall effect could be to reduce the company's assets and its potential to fully repay all its debts.

HEADLINE: BUSH BUDGET SEEKS AID FOR CHILDREN AND END OF A TAX

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Sprinkling largess among diverse constituencies at the start of an election year, President Bush wants to repeal the luxury tax on yachts and will propose a substantial increase in the Federal budget for feeding and vaccinating poor children.
Confidential galley proofs of the budget, to be sent to Congress on Wednesday, show that Mr. Bush will also propose a doubling of Federal spending to control tuberculosis, as well as a public housing initiative to let tenants oust bad managers. 
 Administration officials describe repeal of the boat tax as a way to restore jobs lost in the maritime industry, and many Democrats support the proposal. Administration officials said they did not know if Mr. Bush would seek changes in the luxury taxes on other items like jewelry, furs, private aircraft and automobiles. Cadillac dealers are clamoring for repeal of the luxury tax on all items.
 
Criticism Overlooked
 The documents show Mr. Bush boasting that he would spend "$100 billion for children's programs, up 66 percent since 1989," the year he became President.
Though Mr. Bush now takes credit for the increase, he criticized appropriations for many of the same programs as excessive when they were approved by Congress. In this election year, Congress is likely to repeal the boat tax and to approve the extra money for children sought by Mr. Bush.
The coming week will be pivotal in Mr. Bush's Presidency. He has led people to expect that in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday and in his budget the next day he will unveil a coherent vision of the nation's future, a bold new health policy and an economic recovery plan to save millions of jobs, including his own.
With deadly outbreaks of tuberculosis reported in many states, Mr. Bush seeks $66 million for control of the disease in 1993, up from $32 million this year, the documents show.
 
For Once, Mitchell Agrees
 The boat tax proposal will be presented as part of Mr. Bush's campaign to promote economic growth and create jobs. The tax, enacted in 1990, was originally seen by Democrats as a way for the Government to extract revenue from people wealthy enough to buy boats costing more than $100,000.
But it adversely affected many craftsmen and artisans who lost jobs when boat sales slumped and boat builders went out of business. The 1990 law requires anyone who buys a new or imported boat with a retail price exceeding $100,000 to pay a 10 percent tax, formally known as a luxury tax, on the amount over $100,000. For a $300,000 boat, for example, the tax is $20,000.
The desirability of repealing the tax is one of the few economic questions on which President Bush agrees with Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader from Maine, a big boat-building state with a long coastline.
The boat tax could be seen as a parable of trickle-down economics. It "was slapped on there because people felt this is a way to get the rich guys," Mr. Bush said in August while on vacation in Maine. "What they forgot is, there's a lot of not-so-rich guys that build these boats."
 
Jobs, Jobs, Jobs
 Mr. Bush said then he feared that he might be criticized if he came out "in favor of relief for boats." But he insisted: "I'm talking jobs. I'm thinking of the people who are thrown out of work in these shipyards."
Likewise, Mr. Mitchell said on the Senate floor: "The welfare of luxury boat buyers is not our concern. Rather, our concern is the well-being of the many thousands of Americans who work in the boat manufacturing and sales industry."
At a Senate hearing in June, Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, said, "We do not support repeal of the luxury boat excise tax at this time." But since then, members of Congress and Administration officials say evidence of the tax's adverse effect on the boat industry has become clearer.
 
Where Doctors Are Scarce
 Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, which builds more yacht hulls than any other state, said the tax was supposed to raise $148 million over five years. But he said the cost far exceeds the benefits because the Government is losing income and payroll taxes and must pay unemployment compensation to workers laid off by boat builders. Many Democrats and some labor unions now support repeal of the boat tax.
Stung by Democratic charges that he neglected the home front while focusing on foreign affairs over the last three years, Mr. Bush will propose substantial increases in public health and child welfare programs.
These include childhood immunization (up 18 percent from last year, to $349 million); efforts to combat infant mortality (up 18 percent, to $9.4 billion); the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC (up 9 percent, to $2.8 billion), and community health centers (up 15 percent, to $684 million).
The $100 billion for children, as calculated by Mr. Bush, includes Social Security, Medicaid, public assistance and education programs.
Mr. Bush will seek a total of $120 million for the National Health Service Corps, which places doctors in rural areas and inner-city neighborhoods where physicians are in short supply. That represents an increase of 19 percent for the corps.
The corps' budget was slashed by the Reagan Administration, which predicted in 1981 that the problems of access to basic health care would be "virtually eliminated within the next few years due to growth in the nation's supply of physicians."
 
'Perestroika in Public Housing'
 Daniel R. Hawkins Jr., policy director for the National Association of Community Health Centers, said events over the last decade disproved that prediction. Mr. Hawkins said the $90 million increase for health centers sought by Mr. Bush would be the biggest rise in 15 years. The 550 health centers that receive money from the Federal Government serve six million people a year. Mr. Hawkins said that one million additional people could be served with the extra money.
Mr. Bush says his budget contains "the largest one-year increase ever proposed" for the WIC program, a rise of $240 million, and he says this would allow "full participation by eligible pregnant women and infants."
Edward M. Cooney, deputy director of the Food Research and Action Center, a research and advocacy group, said today that $100 million was needed just to cover the increase in prices for items in the food package for pregnant women and young children. He said the increase sought by Mr. Bush was "a step in the right direction, but terribly inadequate" to feed all those eligible. The program now serves 5.3 million of the 8.7 million people eligible, he said.
Mr. Bush's budget also proposes a "perestroika in public housing initiative." The name alludes to Soviet efforts at political and economic restructuring. Under the proposal, tenants of public housing could vote to transfer control of particularly shabby projects to new managers.
 
30 Percent of Units
 Alfred A. DelliBovi, Deputy Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said this proposal would let tenants replace managers who do not fix the elevators and do not provide adequate heat and security for the residents.
Robert Y. Nelson Jr., executive director of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, denounced the proposal, saying the decay of public housing results not from mismanagement, but from "a lack of Federal money and a lack of Federal attention."
Mr. DelliBovi said the proposal would apply to any local agency that was on a Federal list of "troubled public housing authorities" for more than three years. The list now contains 23 local agencies with about 30 percent of all public housing units. It includes housing authorities in Atlanta, Boston, Bridgeport, Conn., Camden, N.J., Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark, New Haven, New Orleans, Philadelphia and San Francisco.
Mr. DelliBovi said the New York City Housing Authority was not on the list because it was very well managed. "If you can do it in a difficult urban environment like New York, you can do it anywhere," he said.

HEADLINE: The 1992 Campaign: Republicans;
Bush Camp's Primary Fear: A Buchanan Moral Victory

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Jan. 25

 BODY:
Ron Christian, the tax collector in the town of Peterborough, southwest of here, is a George Bush man. He voted for Mr. Bush in the Republican Presidential primary four years ago and thinks he has "done a good job in the White House," especially in the Persian Gulf war.
"But I'd be interested in hearing what George is going to do for the economy in general and for jobs in New England in particular," he said on Friday as he waited for Barbara Bush to arrive for a campaign appearance. "He let the economy get away from him. It's important for him to come to New Hampshire to talk to us." 
 Voters like Mr. Christian trouble former Gov. Hugh Gregg, the Bush campaign's 74-year-old eminence grise, who is the father of the current Governor, Judd Gregg, the President's state campaign manager.
"There are a lot of people out there who are Bush people, who will be Bush people again in the fall, but who won't vote for him in the primary," the elder Mr. Gregg said. "They're fed up with professional politicians. Or they blame him for the economic troubles. Or they think he spends too much time on other countries' problems."
 
Buchanan as a Protest
 The candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and broadcaster, provides an ideal vehicle for a protest vote, and Mr. Gregg said that Mr. Buchanan "will do extremely well, not because of what he says but because of all the discontent and because they all know Pat from TV."
Judd Gregg is willing to concede Mr. Buchanan 30 percent of the vote, simply on the basis of the exuberant support of The Manchester Union Leader, the state's biggest and most idiosyncratic newspaper. Former President Richard M. Nixon says Mr. Buchanan, who worked for him as a White House speech writer, ought to get 40 percent. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a conservative Republican who was here the other day to campaign for Mr. Bush, put Mr. Buchanan's probable vote even higher, at 45 percent.
All of those figures are part of the expectations game, as it has come to be known. The Bush forces do not want the impression to take hold that a strong but unsuccessful Buchanan showing constitutes a moral victory over the arrayed power of the White House and the state's Republican leaders. But there is no doubt that Mr. Buchanan has made striking progress here.
Tom Rath, a former State Attorney General who ran Senator Bob Dole's losing campaign against Mr. Bush in 1988, says the President needs to turn the challenger's argument on its head. Mr. Buchanan urges New Hampshire voters to "send a message" of discontent; Mr. Rath wants Mr. Bush to ask them to send a message of support in his battles with the Democrats in Congress on economic issues.
 
Bush Spurns Debate
 " 'I need your vote as a political mandate' -- that's the approach," Mr. Rath said, "because Congress is much less popular than he is."
Mr. Bush has been in New Hampshire once, apologizing for the state of the economy and promising to do better. He has ignored invitations to debate Mr. Buchanan, and he will return to the state, where pavement-pounding politics is a tradition, only twice more, on Feb. 12 and 15. Mr. Buchanan will be in New Hampshire six days out of seven between now and the primary, on Feb. 18.
For the most part, the job for Mr. Bush will have to be done by surrogates like Mrs. Bush, Mr. Gingrich, Vice President Dan Quayle and Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and by radio and television commercials. The first television advertisements went on the air this weekend, 30-second messages featuring the President declaring earnestly: "We've known each other for a long time. This state has gone through hell. I've seen the pain in people's eyes, and I'm determined to turn this state around."
 
Mrs. Bush's Comforting Words
 Mr. Bush and his aides are trying to reconnect. They are trying to attack the notion that he has forgotten New Hampshire in its hour of need after it propelled him toward the White House by giving him a much-needed victory in the 1988 primary.
Describing her husband as "a spectacular President" and admonishing those who have lost their jobs to "hang in there, do the right thing and don't panic," Mrs. Bush said in Peterborough: "I was and I am in awe of the way that he handled the gulf crisis and himself. The same man is handling the economic crisis -- with the same steady nerves. I assure you that you will get the same results."
But hard-hit people here want specifics, not just warm fuzzies.
Several voters interviewed in thelast few days said they would wait to see what Mr. Bush had to say in his much-ballyhooed State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, exactly three weeks before the primary. One of them, a Milford antique dealer, expressed the conviction that "unless he does something really surprising, really bold, people will let him have it."
Mr. Buchanan is trying to encourage that reaction. He predicted last week that the President's proposals would be "anemic and pathetic."
Governor Gregg said "it was a mistake" for Mr. Bush to accept higher taxes in a budget deal with Congress, and he conceded that the deal made the President's road here rockier.
"But that's history," he said. "What we have to do now is convince Republicans and independents -- the people who can vote in our primary -- that there is only one real Republican candidate for President. You may be unhappy about how things are going, probably are, but only one guy on the ballot can straighten it out."
 
Pushing a Wasted Vote
 Such comments are part of an effort to make New Hampshire Republicans believe that a vote for Mr. Buchanan is a wasted vote. For the moment, the message is implicit. But before the campaign is over, a member of the President's brain trust said, "You're going to see commercials that say, 'New Hampshire picks Presidents.Don't throw away your vote on someone who has no chance of being elected.' "
There are already radio commercials in which former Senator Gordon J. Humphrey and Senator Bob Smith extol Mr. Bush's conservative credentials, which Mr. Buchanan derides. "I fought side by side with this conservative President," Mr. Humphrey says.
In the end, Mr. Bush's greatest asset may be the organization that he and the Greggs, his longtime supporters, have been putting together and nurturing here since 1978. Despite a late start this time, the Bush forces have signed up coordinators in every one of the state's 300-odd towns and wards, and they have the support of most members of the Legislature, too.
Mr. Buchanan's supporters will turn out come snow or high water, politicians here say; the danger to Mr. Bush is that his less highly motivated backers will stay home, thus magnifying the impact of his challenger's vote. The Gregg organization should help to overcome that problem, as it did four years ago against the challenge of Mr. Dole.
Just to make sure that everything is working as expected, the campaign has planned what it calls a "Bush blitz" next weekend. Mr. Quayle will speak to hundreds of volunteers from all over the state, and they will then go door to door, trying to recruit undecided voters -- a major logistical exercise that demonstrates how seriously political professionals like the Greggs take Mr. Buchanan's challenge to Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: While Bridge Is Fixed, Businesses Waste Away

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Arkady Osnis stood in his small shoe-repair shop in Kew Gardens, Queens, and rued the ruinous impact of the big project outside his door. "Business is 30 to 40 percent lower," he said, fretting about how much longer he could survive.
Across the street on the torn-up block of Lefferts Boulevard, Ruth and Aleta Vahlsing said that plunging patronage had already driven them to shut their gift and candy shop. The mother and daughter dolefully de-nuded their shelves and packed up picture frames, ceramics and other gift items. 
 The project so baneful to Mr. Osnis and the Vahlsings -- and to the two dozen other merchants on their block in a solid, middle-class Kew Gardens neighborhood -- is the city's rehabilitation of a deteriorated old bridge that carries Lefferts Boulevard over tracks of the Long Island Rail Road.
The top of the 180-foot-long bridge forms most of the block of Lefferts Boulevard from Austin Street to 83d Avenue. At street level, the block's unusual foundation is not readily apparent. One- and two-story buildings line both sides, with shops that sell food, clothing, newspapers and cosmetics and that launder clothes, cut hair and rent videos.
It is the kind of mercantile melange that adds texture as well as trade to many neighborhoods in the city.
"This block is like a little village," Arthur J. Cooperman, an area resident, said. "People who live here consider it a focal point of the community."
But the 83-year-old bridge is in dire need of overhaul, the New York City Transportation Department says. Since last June, when the agency began what it said would be a $2.9 million, 15-month job to replace the bridge's steel girders and deck beams and rebuild the concrete surface, the block has been transformed into a snarl of traffic barriers and chain-link fences.
Sidewalks have been scrunched to four-foot widths. Parking has been abolished. Cars and trucks squeeze through two temporary narrow lanes; the briefest pause knots traffic and prompts a symphony of honks.
In short, it is a stretch bothersome to negotiate and best to avoid, which is precisely what many people are doing. The result, the block's merchants say, is thattheir businesses are in peril, with four already closed.
Such straits are not unheard of in a city where renewal and regeneration is a theme. But lack of uniqueness does not lighten the bleakness for the Lefferts Boulevard business people.
Especially galling, some recently said, is that for nearly three months, from late October until mid-January, all major work on the project halted because of what the city says was a design error.
The mistake caused the new girders to be an inch too high and they had to be returned to the shop for adjustment, said Joseph DePlasco, a Transportation Department spokesman. The result, he said, is that the coveted return to normality will take three months longer than originally contemplated. It is now expected next December -- assuming no further snafus. This the shopkeepers are not assuming.
"How could they make the wrong measurement?" Mr. Osnis demanded, eyes wide with disbelief.
By relying on the bridge's original drawings, Mr. DePlasco said.
In Frank's Gourmet Deli, Frank Delenda, the owner, was skeptical of the entire project.
"This is a scam," he insisted. "Guys working on the job say they didn't have to do all this, that they only had to repair the concrete."
Not so, Mr. DePlasco replied. "The bridge was in a severe state of deterioration," he said.
Mr. Delenda ticked off the fatalities among merchants so far -- a florist, a women's clothing store, a manicurist and the Vahlsings' candy and gift shop -- and said, "I might be going too."
"Yesterday I took in $385 all day from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.," he said. Before the bridge work, he said, he would gross $800 on a "very bad" day.
Merchants said the recession had hurt them slightly, but was not the reason for their plight. And although the Long Island Rail Road, the landlord on most of the block, has temporarily cut rents in half, the shopkeepers said this was not enough to matter.
The merchants are not the only ones pained by the prospect that as the bridge is restored, its street is de-stored.
Mr. Cooperman, the local resident, recalled his reaction when he recently passed the Vahlsings' place. "When I saw it was closed," he said of the longtime local fixture, "It was so sad."

HEADLINE: Year Later, Hellfighters Feel Forgotten

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Like many other Harlem Hellfighters, Sgt. Joe Bradford has found that, one year later, his service in the Persian Gulf war with the famous New York Army National Guard unit holds little cachet with the public.
Mr. Bradford was a truck driver in New York before he was mobilized. His company relocated while he was away, so now he is now unemployed. Eight months ago he passed the postal exam to become a mail handler, but so far he has not heard a word. 
 "Angry is not the word to describe how I feel," said Mr. Bradford, 41 years old, a divorced father of four. "We weren't sitting on our thumbs over there. We did a damn good job. I'd think they would have given us a little more recognition than we've gotten."
There is a lot of talk like this these days at the 369th Regiment Armory, the base of the Harlem Hellfighters, a noted unit that dates to 1913. The Hellfighters helped to make history in the sands of Saudi Arabia, but many of its members now believe they have become forgotten casualties at home.
The scorecard of what happened to the Hellfighters after they returned home from eight months of service is familiar to others who served in n Desert Storm. Battalion officials said several of the 350 veterans lost their jobs, seven others lost out on job promotions, and two soldiers learned that their spouses had left them.
The armory -- an aging structure with high ceilings and shiny floors at Fifth Avenue and 142d Street, lined with photographs of the battalion's heroes -- is now a place where about 15 unemployed veterans have been given busy work. They are changing tires, fixing parts and painting military trucks.
Most of the members of the transportation unit based here are middle-aged bus drivers, police officers and Civil Service workers. Roughly one fourth are women. None suffered serious war-related injuries during war service.
One of the three companies that make up the Harlem Hellfighters, the 719th Transportation Company, had complained on the eve of the war that they were stripped of their vehicles and men and posted near the Iraqi border without adequate training. A Pentagon investigation found no irregularities.
Since the war, as veterans have tried to move on with their lives, that issue too has receded. "It was a concern but they've gotten over it," said Capt. Renwick Payne. "They did the jobs they had to do and returned."
In honor of their performance, the "forgotten soldiers"-- as they became known -- were presented with an award by the 101st Corps support group, to which they were assigned.
Many of the veterans marched in New York's homecoming parade last June and later in an African-American Day parade in Harlem. They were honored at City Hall. They were showered with awards, headlines and congratulatory speeches.
"Folks are still very much aware and proud that a piece of Harlem was in the war, and as the expression goes, 'Done Good,' " said the battalion commander, Lieut. Col. Francis W. Kairson Jr.
But for many veterans, the glow from the war has been replaced with the reality of everyday life and the knowledge that America has a short memory for their wartime efforts.
Dennis Holder, 21, remembers the blank looks of prospective employers as he went from one unemployment office to the next upon his return.
Only recently did he find employment. He works two part-time jobs, one counting and repairing ammunition in the armory and one preparing supermarket orders in a food warehouse.
"I figured since I was over there, I'd been making sacrifices for my country and I'd at least get a job," Mr. Holder said recently in the armory, as he helped move furniture. "It's been harder to find a job than ever. It upsets me sometimes but that's life."
Specialist Patricia Carden, 40, a truck driver at the armory, wishes the war's luster would shine on forever. Sergeant Carden, the mother of two grown children, said that some men thought she would be too fragile to do the work when she was mobilized for war, but she soon proved them wrong.
She said she was jubilant at the homecoming parade and flattered by the attention from friends and strangers. She was sent a silk scarf by a French woman who had heard her on a radio talk show.
Sergeant Bradford said he wanted to try to resurrect those good feelings. Last night he oversaw a Desert Storm disco at the armory, which he hopes will be an annual event. He sent out fliers for the disco and, yesterday, as he supervised arrangements for the party, he said he had sold about 175 tickets.
"It's something to look forward to, something to do," he said. "I don't want to sit around and bite my nails."

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
MacPhail Isn't Fazed by the Championship Hype

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The last time a championship game was played at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Andy MacPhail was sitting in the stands with a vested interest. He became especially ecstatic when Dan Gladden stepped on the plate with the only run in the 10-inning Game 7 of the World Series.
MacPhail, general manager of the Minnesota Twins, plans to be at the Metrodome today, but only as a curious observer. 
 "My wife wants to go," he said. "I've been to one Super Bowl, but she hasn't. It's like going to Times Square on New Year's Eve. You ought to do it once."
The Twins have won the World Series twice in the last five years, which gives MacPhail a different perspective on championship games than most people have. He doesn't need that special insight, though, to compare the World Series and the Super Bowl.
"It's a very, very different type of event," MacPhail said of the Super Bowl. "I have images of the World Series: tomahawk-chopping fans in Atlanta, hanky-waving fans in Minneapolis. When you have a game at a neutral site, the focus shifts from community and home team to corporate parties and hoopla. It's just a whole different culture. No doubt about it, baseball has it all over football in the post-season. With this, there's more action surrounding the game than the game itself. I can see that just looking out my window."
MacPhail did not spend all of his time looking out the window last week. He has a championship to defend, and he was busy trying to shore up the Twins' corps of starting pitchers. "A front office in baseball can get a lot more accomplished when attention is focused elsewhere," he said. "We've been trying to accomplish some things behind the scenes, but we haven't done it."
MacPhail said he had some interest in Scott Bankhead, but the injury-plagued pitcher, who became a free agent when the Seattle Mariners did not tender him a contract, signed with Cincinnati. MacPhail was also considering Eric King, who had a similar experience with Cleveland, "but we terminated that because the interest didn't seem to be there on his part."
The Twins lost out on Bankhead, MacPhail said, because they were reluctant to give him a major league contract, and the Reds did. "That was a risk we really didn't think was worth taking at this point, even though there is some potential on the upside," the general manager said. "We were surprised that the team that signed him did because they had enough pitching."
MacPhail said he also thought about Jim Deshaies and Doug Jones, but Jones signed with Houston and Deshaies was close to signing elsewhere. That leaves Bill Krueger and Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd, he said.
"I would like to bring one of them in," he added.
Krueger poses an interesting question for the Twins. A free agent whom the Mariners have let go because of the uncertainty of their ownership, the left-hander had a disastrous performance against the Twins last season, allowing 15 runs and 21 hits in 10 innings for a 0-2 record and a 13.50 earned run average.
"Your staff sees him get hammered, and it's hard for them to generate enthuiasm for him," MacPhail said. But, he noted, subtract those numbers from his overall record, and he had an 11-6 mark with a 3.00 e.r.a.
MacPhail wants to add a veteran pitcher because Jack Morris (35 starts) has defected to Toronto and the Twins have let Allen Anderson (22) depart as a free agent. Kevin Tapani and Scott Erickson return from last year's rotation, Mark Guthrie will return to the rotation and a fourth starter will be selected from a group of younger or less established pitchers: David West, Willie Banks, Denny Neagle, Mike Trombley, Paul Abbott and Pat Mahomes.
The Twins would rather not take two from Column B, which leaves MacPhail rolling out and trying to sack a veteran.
 
The Northwest Mariners?
 The Japanese want to buy the Seattle Mariners, but major league officials don't want to sell to them. Jeff Smulyan, the Mariners' overwhelmed owner, wants to move the team to Florida, but major league officials want to keep the team in Seattle. Will Glasgow has a third option, but major league officials don't like that one either.
Glasgow, a Portland, Ore., lawyer whose thinking seems to be more solid than fanciful, has proposed turning the Mariners into a Northwest regional team. Under Glasgow's plan, the Cascadia Mariners, one possible name, would play 15 games each in Portland and Vancouver and the other 51 home games in Seattle.
"The impact would be to turn the Mariners into the fourth largest regional market," Glasgow said, noting that Seattle alone is No. 14 on the market list. "Regionalization could add $10 million to $20 million to the Mariners' revenue base and could make them one of the stronger franchises in baseball."
One of the Mariners' major economic problems is their almost-negligible local television revenue. By playing games in Portland and Vancouver, Glasgow said, that income would grow significantly because fans in those two cities and surrounding areas in Oregon and British Columbia would identify with the team and want to watch it.
Not only could Mariner road games be televised to those areas, but games played in Seattle could also be shown. Conversely, games played in Portland and Vancouver could be shown in Seattle without affecting attendance.
As another means of increasing revenue, Glasgow projected, the 15 games at Portland's 25,000-seat stadium would be sellouts, and because a limited number of games would be played, the ticket prices could be higher, perhaps double the range in Seattle. Vancouver has a 50,000-seat domed stadium.
Whatever drawbacks officials might see, the lawyer said, "none of the issues seem to be inherently insurmountable."
"You'd think they would have interest in strengthening the franchise and expanding the Mariners' revenue," he said.
 
Call 1-900-CONTRACT
 When four of the best pitchers in salary arbitration submitted figures between $4 million and $5 million, Al Harazin, the Mets' general manager, suggested their action had been part of an orchestrated deal. But if the players' agents and the Players Association conferred among themselves, it was an idea they learned from the Player Relations Committee and the general managers.
During the time the second free-agent collusion case was before the arbitrator, the players' lawyers learned that during arbitration time, management had been having weekly 26-club conference calls on which they discussed eligible players, offers, numbers to submit and settlements.
The union questioned the practice, but the clubs' lawyers noted that unlike its position on concerted action against free agents, the collective-bargaining agreement had no such provision about arbitration-eligible players.
Until then, some agents recalled, the union had not given them information on numbers other agents had submitted or were considering submitting. But in 1990, the union began sharing numbers. The clubs, meanwhile, have apparently stopped the weekly telephone sessions.
"In years past they had these 26-club conference calls, but we have not done it," said Charles O'Connor, general counsel for the Player Relations Committee. "This year, we have had smaller calls. What really takes place, both on the union and our side, is there are discussions regarding submission numbers. On both sides, the number requested is the number the player wants and the club wants, but there are attempts to get people to look at comparable players in terms of years and performance to maximize the opportunity to win."
 
The Olympic Connection
 Peter Ueberroth became baseball commissioner after heading the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. George Steinbrenner chose a lifetime ban on his role as Yankees' managing partner rather than take a two-year suspension because he was concerned that a "suspension" would affect his position on the United States Olympic Committee. Now, somewhere in between those two extremes, Marty Appel becomes the latest official to travel between baseball and the Olympics.
Nearly 20 years ago, Appel was the second of nine men who have served as the Yankees' media-relations director during the Steinbrenner regime. More recently, he has been executive producer of local Yankees telecasts. Now, after 11 years with the local television station, he moves to the Olympics as public-relations director for the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
There, he will be reunited with an Atlanta businessman, Ron Blomberg, a name from the Yankees' past. And he may, once in a while, even run into Steinbrenner, a name from their past, present and undoubtedly future.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
When Mantle Had to Battle for a Raise

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
WHILE the nation's economy dwindles, baseball's economy still soars upward.
For hitting 18 homers, driving in 66 runs and batting .259 for the Chicago White Sox last season, Dan Pasqua, once a Yankee outfielder, recently signed a three-year, $6 million contract. And in the first season of his three-year, $6 million contract, Franklin Stubbs of the Milwaukee Brewers batted .213, hit 11 homers and drove in 38 runs. 
 So much for the ratio of salary to performance when the fourth-violinist theory doesn't exist.
At a Frank Sinatra concert, he gets the big money. He's the attraction. He sells the tickets. The fourth violinist is happy with union scale. But in baseball, the fourth violinist still gets millions.
"It's unbelievable," Mickey Mantle was saying.
Mickey Mantle wasn't begrudging today's players their millions; he was just wishing he was wearing a Yankee uniform now. Consider that his 1960 pinstriped Yankee shirt was auctioned for $111,000 at Leland's last week. Consider that his uniform shirt with a 7 on the back is now worth more without him in it than it ever was with him in it.
Mantle's highest salary was $100,000, a plateau he didn't attain until 1963, his 13th season.
"And after they put me up to $100,000," he recalled, "I never asked for another raise."
At age 60, Mickey Mantle's job is being Mickey Mantle. He's a baseball icon. He gets top dollar at autograph shows. He gets stares and smiles and standing ovations. Last Wednesday, he was in his West 59th Street restaurant, promoting a new watch. Thursday night he was honored with Willie Mays and Duke Snider at the Baseball Assistance Team dinner at the Marriott Marquis.
He remembered coming here in January in other years, stopping at the Yankee offices on Fifth Avenue, only a long home run from where his restaurant is now. On those visits, he had to battle for a raise from George Weiss, the Yankee general manager through much of the center fielder's career. His struggle typified what life was like before free agency.
In his Triple Crown season in 1956, the 25-year-old slugger led the American League with a .353 average, 52 homers and 130 runs batted in: a troika that today's players only dream about.
"I wanted to double my salary from the $32,500 I made in 1956," he recalled. "But when I asked Weiss for $65,000, he told me I was too young to make that kind of money. Then he threatened to show my wife reports from private detectives he had gumshoe me and Billy Martin. He threatened to trade me to Cleveland for Herb Score and Rocky Colavito."
Weiss wouldn't budge, but Del Webb, then a Yankee co-owner, agreed to meet Mantle's price.
"Weiss never forgot," Mantle said. "After the 1957 season, he tried to cut me $5,000."
Mantle had batted .365 with 34 homers while driving in 94 runs. He eventually signed for $75,000 for 1958, a $10,000 raise. But when he batted .304 with 42 homers and 97 runs batted in, Weiss opened their 1959 negotiations by offering only $65,000, a $10,000 cut. Mantle demanded $85,000 and eventually accepted a token $2,000 raise to $77,000.
Over his first eight seasons, the Yankees had been in seven World Series, winning five. When the Yankees slipped to third place in 1959, Weiss pounced. His first offer called for a $17,000 cut and Mantle accepted a $10,000 slice to $67,000.
But after the 1960 season, Weiss retired from the Yankees before organizing the expansion Mets. By 1963, the Mick finally had his $100,000 contract, only to break his left foot in a tangle with a chain-link fence in Baltimore early that season. On his return, he hit his longest Yankee Stadium homer, off the facade below the right-field roof.
Win or lose after that, he never earned less than $100,000, or more for that matter.
But if the Mick were playing today, if he were a free agent after a Triple Crown season, if he were available to the highest bidder, if Bobby Bonilla was worth $29 million to the Mets over five years and if Danny Tartabull was worth $25.5 million to the Yankees over five years, how much would the Mick be worth?
At least $50 million over five years. And at that price, he'd be a bargain.
But this is now and that was then. Mickey Mantle must be satisfied with being an icon in an era when baseball owners still haven't realized that while proven attractions are worth whatever they can command, fourth violinists should be getting union scale.
"When I played, the players were dumb," the Mick said. "Now the owners are."

HEADLINE: The High Costs of Xenophobia

 BODY:
Japan-bashing has suddenly become a frenzy, at a terrible toll to America's best interests. In one short week: A Japanese offer to help Seattle keep major league baseball was doused with cold water by Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent. Los Angeles County canceled its order for Japanese mass-transit rail cars. And the town council of Greece, N.Y., voted not to buy a used Japanese dirt mover.
Everyone benefits from free and open international commerce. But while Japan's cars and electronic gear have been a boon to American consumers, its barriers to foreign products and investment are an endless frustration to Americans who want to do business there. 
 Washington and Japan have dueled over trade and investment for most of a decade. Except for a few distinct groups like auto workers, however, the friction has not gripped intense public emotion. The recession and election-year politics have clearly changed that.
Prolonged sluggishness in the U.S. economy, the upward creep of unemployment and a run of huge layoffs have made America job-conscious. Every Japanese car sold here, even if it's made in Ohio, has come to symbolize fewer American jobs. Politicians in Washington, Los Angeles and upstate New York see public resentment rising and react accordingly. In election campaigns it is always easier to blame foreign foes for problems than to admit one's own shortcomings.
As the nation's leader, President Bush set the tone with his crude emphasis on promoting jobs when he traveled to Tokyo this month with a legion of top-dollar C.E.O.'s. While the Speaker of Japan's lower house, Yoshio Sakurauchi, didn't help matters with his unwarranted scorn for "lazy" American workers last weekend, he can hardly be blamed for all that's happened since.
First, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission reversed its decision to buy 87 mass-transit cars from the Sumitomo Corporation for $122 million, rather than from an American company for $5 million less. The wholly rational reason to pick Sumitomo was experience; it supplied the cars for the first phase of the county's new mass-transit system, on time and on budget.
Last week, faced with angry demands for more jobs in southern California, the commission scratched the Sumitomo deal and foolishly set out in a risky new direction; it's going to set up its own car plant and lease it to manufacturers. Does the county commission seriously believe it can succeed where American industry has long since been outpaced by Japan, Canada and Europe?
Meanwhile, in Seattle, local business interests -- led by Nintendo of America's president, a Seattle resident for 15 years -- offered to buy the Mariners baseball team for $100 million; Nintendo's Japanese owners would put up 60 percent. The Mariners' owner, who lives in Indianapolis, wants to sell and threatens to move the team out if he can't.
Business leaders and the state's leading politicians are behind the local offer, but the baseball commissioner clings to a xenophobic notion that major league owners should be exclusively North American, even though the Mariners' owner is a distant absentee, more than 2,000 miles away in the Midwest. If the team's next home is St. Petersburg, Fla., it will be Seattle's loss, not Nintendo's.
In Greece, N.Y., a suburb of Rochester, it's the same story with yet another twist. A used Komatsu excavator, made by the Komatsu Dresser Company, a U.S.-Japanese joint venture in Illinois, costs $15,000 less than the John Deere model. What's more, the Komatsu was made in America of mostly American parts, whereas the John Deere, with an American engine, was made in Japan. In upstate New York, labels apparently outweigh facts.
Los Angeles, Seattle and Greece -- three communities, each with its own concerns. But three rebuffs for Japan in a single week are no coincidence. It's an ominous sign that Americans, caught up in the misery of a short-term recession, are losing sight of the long-term benefits of foreign trade.

HEADLINE: How the Japanese Learned to Drink Bourbon;
Corporate Complacency

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The outcome of the recent United States trade mission to Japan and the forceful statements of the American auto industry executives who participated recalls my experiences in the early 1960's at Forbes Inc. 
 As a project supervisor for automobile market research studies, I handled accounts of the Japanese International Trade Association and of the Ford Motor Company. Our study findings exploded certain treasured myths regarding the predominance of American technology and the expropriation of that technology by foreign manufacturers.
Nearly 35 years ago the Japanese approached Forbes Marketing Research (a Forbes Inc. subsidiary) to conduct a comprehensive yearlong study on the feasibility of expanding exports of their two- and four-wheeled vehicles to the United States. The study examined consumer satisfaction with Japanese, European and American vehicles in the California market, where the Japanese had begun to have some limited success; it outlined the American marketing profiles and the technology advances of British, German and Italian auto exporters, and analyzed the tariff and protectionist implications.
The Japanese trade officials were concerned also about anti-Japanese sentiment among the American public as well as about the quality image of Japanese manufacturing among young Americans, at whom marketing efforts would be aimed.
The study results were widely published in Japanese business journals of the early 1960's, but were not picked up by the American press. Among the key findings were:
* California consumer satisfaction was so positive that serious consideration of a national marketing approach was recommended.
* Most of the United States patents for new automotive technology issued in the 1950's and early 1960's were for developments made by British, German and Italian manufacturers, not by American manufacturers.
This new automotive technology was being tested on European Grand Prix circuits during a long period of U.S. hibernation in the areas of automotive research and development.
As part of the study, I interviewed several outspoken American automotive executives, including a plant production manager of the Chrysler Corporation, who told me: "You don't understand automotive economics and the taste for large American cars. The more metal you sell, the more profit you make."
American automotive executives and engineers may indeed not be stupid, as Lee Iacocca said recently in their defense, but a pattern of complacency, limited vision and inflexibility over the last 40 years has certainly contributed to their current crisis.

HEADLINE: The 1992 Campaign: Democrats;
Candidates Court Jackson Supporters

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Six Democratic Presidential candidates met with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition today, hoping to tap the grass-roots support that fueled Mr. Jackson's own 1988 bid for the nomination.
But if any hoped to capture the whole rainbow, he was disappointed, as support was fragmented. All the candidates had a similar message but spent considerable time trying to demonstrate their differences, and that led to some prickly responses. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was booed when he spoke in support of right-to-work laws. Edmund G. Brown Jr., former Governor of California, swiped at Mr. Clinton by calling for a moment of silence for a man whom the Governor allowed to be executed in Arkansas on Friday night. And Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska got enthusiastic applause for his national health care plan.
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, outlined his tough-love economic message. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa captivated the audience with his unabashedly liberal oratory, and Eugene McCarthy, the former Senator from Wisconsin, told charming stories of his previous runs for President.
 
Thoughts on Candidates
 Among the roughly 500 delegates, there were those who said they liked the message of Mr. Brown but said they did not think he was electable. Others said they thought Mr. Clinton looked and sounded presidential but wondered if questions about his personal life could harm him in voters' eyes. Still others said they thought that Senator Kerrey, with his emphasis on health care and his personal attractiveness, looked like a winner.
But as Mr. Jackson pointed out, immediate support was not the reason for the forum. The coalition will not endorse any particular candidate, though Mr. Jackson said he would endorse a candidate at some point in the future.
"This is the broadest based forum the candidates can appear before," Mr. Jackson said. "Here you have mayors of big cities and small, women, Hispanics, gays, Native Americans asking the questions. These are the people who have to be energized and I think there has been a message gap in the debates. My sense is that people are looking for concrete plans."
 
Panel Questions Candidates
 Each of the candidates gave a short speech and was then questioned by a panel of labor, civic and education experts and officials.
The forum was held in an auditorium at the Omni Shoreham Hotel here.
Mr. Brown got a standing ovation for his support of statehood for the District of Columbia and his suggestion that Mr. Jackson would make a good running mate. But afterward several delegates who said they agreed with many of Mr. Brown's views expressed doubt that he could be elected.
"I like Brown's philosophy, but, really, who is going to vote for him?" said Mel Fallis, a vice president of marketing for American Visions magazine.
Mr. Clinton's presentation was upbeat and appeared to capture the audience's attention, until he ran into criticism for his positions on a middle-class tax cut, the death penalty and support for right-to-work laws.
Mr. Clinton defended his support for a tax cut for middle-class taxpayers, saying that only by expanding the middle class could the poor be helped. And he seemed to win the sympathy of the audience when he talked about his emotional turmoil when he decided to allow the execution of Rickey Ray Rector, a black mentally impaired murderer, to proceed.
Mr. Clinton, however, ran afoul of some members of the audience when he said he would not oppose right-to-work laws. He said that the issue was divisive and that it was one of the reasons that Democrats had not won recent Presidential elections. A handful of people stood up and booed and then walked out of the hall.
"He can forget about support from trade unionists," said Ron Richardson, vice president of the Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees International Union, who had asked the question.
Mr. Kerrey, who spoke about education, health care and his experience in the Vietnam War, appeared to win the most enthusiasm from the audience.
"His platform is more about my concerns," said Andre Thompson, from Glen Arden, Md., who said he was put off by Mr. Clinton's smooth delivery. "He's too plastic."
Mr. Tsongas gave his economic bootstrapping message, something that appealed to Christine Welch, a representative of the American Federation of Government Employees. "He's truthful," she said. "He's upfront."
Mr. Harkin lashed out at Republicans in general and President Bush in particular, promising that if he won the Democratic nomination he would not hold Mr. Bush's "feet to the fire" in the general election campaign.
"I'm going to put his feet in fire," he said, adding, "I'm going to make them accountable for the despair and the depression we have in the land."
Mr. Harkin also took Mr. Clinton to task on his record on issues like education, civil rights and employment. He said Mr. Kerrey was for health care, but "none of his employees have it."
By the end of his speech, some of the delegates were chanting the Senator's name.
Annette Rainwater of Detroit said she was leaning toward Senator Harkin but had not made up her mind.
"Something is missing, I don't know what," Ms. Rainwater said. "Maybe I'm looking for the excitement I had with Jesse. But when the dust settles, I think I'll be going with a winner."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Retail Space;
For Retailers, It's Space-Sale Season Hard-Put Landlords

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
FILA SPORTS, the high-priced Italian sports clothes company, just opened its first New York boutique, at 831 Madison Avenue near 69th Street, in the heart of designer row.
"We've always wanted to be associated with the likes of Ralph Lauren and Armani, but it took until now to find exactly the space we want," said Christine A. Massetani, advertising and promotions director at the company's American headquarters in Brisbane, Calif. 
 Morse Shoe, the Canton, Mass., company that owns Fayva shoe stores, just emerged from bankruptcy in December and already is looking to open some 25 stores in New York this year. "I'm mounting a full-court press to open new stores while landlords are still realistic about rents and terms," said Vincent Brown, Fayva's vice president of real estate.
For retailers, New York has become the ultimate space buyers' market. Rents are falling on every shopping thoroughfare. Landlords are wooing desirable tenants with longer rent-free periods in which to tailor the space to their needs before opening their doors. They are making available huge blocks of prime space, often vacated by banks, that make chains like the Gap or The Limited salivate. They are welcoming restaurants, cheese stores, discount houses -- all sorts of tenants that, in palmier days, were unwelcome for either hygienic or image reasons.
"There's no question landlords are taking tenants they wouldn't take before," said Ralph Friedman, vice president of Dakota Realty, a Manhattan brokerage.
One example is Cosmetics Plus, a discount cosmetics shop with a well-earned reputation for bargaining rents down. It recently moved into the prime space at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue opposite Carnegie Hall that formerly was occupied by a Barnes & Noble bookstore. Barnes & Noble also is a discounter but in the world of retail leasing, it ranks higher in prestige because it sells culture rather than lip gloss.
Eddie Bauer, known mainly as a mail-order clothing and sporting goods company, has opened stores on 58th Street and Madison Avenue and 45th Street and Third Avenue. Innovation Luggage is at 43d Street and Fifth Avenue, in space where Nynex once sold computers. The Gap, which declined to discuss its expansion strategies, is "bidding on every location around," said one broker.
All told, the commercial real estate depression has turned into the one bright spot in the glum retailing landscape. Solvent companies are getting into locations they could only dream about two or three years ago.
SHAKY retailers are scrounging for extra cash to take advantage of some of the best store availabilities and rent bargains in two decades. And money-losing retailers are playing out the corporate version of the beleaguered executive who comes home and kicks the dog: After mollifying their own bankers and shuddering at their anemic receipts, they are wringing concessions from their landlords.
According to Garrick-Aug Associates, the country's largest retail real estate broker, the retail vacancy rate in Manhattan is now about 10 percent. This means nearly 7 million square feet of space is available -- up 75 percent from the 4 million vacant square feet of just three years ago.
Not surprisingly, landlords, many of whom are deeply in debt, are growing increasingly desperate to keep old tenants and get new ones. Garrick-Aug says that by the middle of last year the gap between the average asking price for a square foot of retail space ($61) and actual rents ($41) -- the so-called negotiability factor -- had hit 32.7 percent. Even though those numbers include the lowest-rent side streets and East Village avenues, they indicate a pretty hefty dose of realistic pessimism in prime space, too.
"This is the best retail real estate market tenants have faced in 25 years," said Charles Aug, the firm's president. He should know: He just gave the 14+ Store in Union, N.J., which occupies space his firm owns, an 8 percent rent concession for the remaining two years of its lease. "They were a good tenant," he said. "I didn't want to lose them."
Industry insiders say such examples abound. The co-op at 25 West 13th Street owns two 5,000-square-foot stores fronting on 14th Street -- prime shopping territory for the two low-priced variety stores in occupancy. Three years ago the co-op planned to raise rents on the stores when their leases came due in September 1991. The stores were paying $18 a square foot and the co-op planned to raise this to more than $100. It settled for $50 -- and felt lucky at that.
"The days when a co-op could assume that retail rents will carry the entire operating cost of the building above are long gone," said James G. Samson, a partner in the Manhattan law firm Haas, Greenstein, Samson, Cohen & Gerstein and the co-op board's lawyer.
Like office buildings, residential co-ops and condominiums, once among the pickiest of landlords, are welcoming tenants that were once anathema. "Co-ops used to want stores that would attract buyers of apartments," said Neil Kreisel, president of the Kreisel Company, which manages co-ops and condominiums. "Now they want stores that generate revenues."
The 68-unit building at 300 West 108th Street is a prime example. It has a 2,500-square-foot restaurant as well as two small stores, about 400 square feet each, facing Broadway. About seven years ago the Indian Cafe signed a 15-year lease, complete with escalator clauses, for the big restaurant space. The small stores were occupied by a coffee shop and a newsstand-tobacco shop.
The cafe's rent was high enough to nearly make up the amount of revenues the co-op could take in from nonresidential sources and still qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Federal Tax Code's so-called 80/20 rule. The rule says that co-op shareholders can deduct mortgage interest payments and other expenses as if they were homeowners, provided the income the co-op gets from other sources, such as commercial rentals, remains less than 20 percent of total income. So the co-op, not happy about two restaurants, with their attendant smells and breeding grounds for vermin, did not renew the coffee shop's lease when it came due two years ago. The newsstand left on its own.
To avoid ongoing 80/20 problems, the co-op set out to sell the space to clean, prestigious tenants -- say, clothing boutiques.
ALL that has changed. The cafe, hurting along with the economy, has negotiated waivers of rent escalators, and the two small spaces are not attracting buyers.
"Even another restaurant is starting to look good," said Mr. Samson, the co-op's lawyer.
In a sense, the tug of war between landlords and retailers is a battle of invalids. Both industries are battling sales and profit figures that could depress even Pollyanna. And both sides are playing up their weaknesses as they jockey for position. Landlords point to their huge vacancy rates, their high property taxes, recalcitrant mortgage holders and other reasons that they would rather leave a store vacant -- or allow a good tenant to leave -- in hopes of getting a decent rent.
Retailers, however, point to their own numbers to persuade landlords that it's impossible to get blood from a stone. Holiday sales, traditionally as much as half of a retailer's annual profits, were poor for the third year in a row, falling 0.4 percent below 1990's Christmas season. Bankruptcies and closings have been widespread.
The industry is in deeper trouble than store numbers would indicate.
Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data show there were 39,000 stores in the five boroughs in 1979, 38,700 10 years later and 38,300 in the first quarter of 1991. A decline, to be sure, but not a huge one.
Employment figures, however, paint a more somber picture. With shopper traffic so sparse and per-store sales low, stores are hiring fewer people, offering fewer services and paying less overtime. The New York State Department of Labor says there were 362,000 people employed in the retail trade in New York in November 1991 -- the most recent figures available. That's down just shy of 6 percent from 384,700 in November 1990 and more than 13 percent from the 417,600 retail jobs that existed in November 1987, the year best remembered for the October stock market crash but also the one in which local retail employment peaked.
"In two years we've all but wiped out the employment gains from the entire boom decade of the 1980's," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, who heads the Middle Atlantic regional office of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Manhattan.
No one is predicting a big turnaround soon. The New York economy led the country in the economic downturn. According to Mr. Ehrenhalt, New York's fiscal woes began in October 1989, while the national recession usually is pegged to July 1990. The downturn has already cost New York 230,000 jobs.
Retailers, many of which were carrying huge debt loads, have been particularly hard hit. B. Altman's is gone, as is Gimbels; Macy's and Bloomingdales are in trouble.
A revived economy may not be the answer. Already, discount malls, shopper discount clubs and mail-order companies have siphoned buyers away from department stores and even from specialty stores. The department stores, meanwhile, are running sales on luxury goods, making deep inroads into sales at some of the luxury boutiques.
STILL, things are less bleak in the pricier sections of town -- Madison Avenue, say, or Fifth Avenue, where foreign labels are outnumbered only by foreign spenders. Japanese spend freely on Fifth Avenue, while Italian and German visitors tend to spread their wealth in Madison Avenue stores.
Faith Consuelo of Garrick-Aug says she just negotiated the highest per-square-foot rental ever on 55th Street just off Fifth Avenue. At a time when rents on the block, among the most prestigious in town, averaged $425 a square foot, she got close to $600 for a 2,000-square-foot storefront in the Coca-Cola building, across from the St. Regis hotel. The store houses Goldpfeil, the German luxury leather-goods store.
E. William Judson of Judson Realty, who negotiated Fila's Madison Avenue deal -- an aggregate $10 million lease over 10 years, for 2,400 square feet of selling space spread on two levels -- says there has been no let-up in calls from designers looking to open showcase stores on Madison Avenue.
"They'll still pay high rent on Madison, because they see a store there as good image advertising for their brands," he said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A Long Ride on Tokyo's Turmoil

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The dismal performance of the Tokyo stock market -- especially while the rest of the world has rallied -- has been a pesky irritant to those money managers who have been positive on Japan. It has not been fashionable to be, as it is often put in the industry, "constructive" on Japan, but there are those who are.
 "I think about it every day," said Richard H. King, the manager of the Counsellors International Equity mutual fund, which is managed by Warburg, Pincus Counsellors Inc. in New York. "I look every day and wonder if the policy is right. I read conflicting views and wonder if the policy is right." 
He has plenty of reason to scratch his head. Despite reductions in interest rates and signs of moderating inflation, which in the United States have helped push the Dow Jones industrial average to record highs, the Japanese market is in decline.
 Last Tuesday, the market's blue chip index, the Nikkei 225, closed at 20,858.30, just 636 points, or 3 percent, above its lowest level since the market crashed after reaching a record high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989.
 In two years this is a plunge of 46.4 percent. But, what is worse, the market seems unable to revive. It reached its post-1989 low, 20,221.86, on Oct. 1, 1990. Since then it has rallied rarely, only to falter. Its highest rebound, to 27,146.91, was in the afterglow of the allies' Persian Gulf victory in March. It last touched 25,000 on Nov. 1, 1991, and it has been downhill since.
 Another manager, who like Mr. King increased his exposure in Japan last year, is Michael Bullock, chief investment officer at Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in London. "I think we would all like to hit the timing right," he said. "But we know that is not possible."
 Has the Tokyo market's performance changed their minds? No, they are keeping their chins up. "The balance of the fundamentals show we at Counsellors are right to stay where we are," said Mr. King.
 Both are expecting that the decline in interest rates -- short-term rates dipped below 5 percent last week -- and further cuts by the Bank of Japan, will finally revive the market. Mr. Bullock also expects corporate earnings to begin to revive.
 "It has clearly taken longer for the market to respond than I had anticipated," he said. "But we are sticking with it and feel pretty confident the market will show a good return."
 But this does not mean that those who have bet on Japan are increasing their stakes. Mr. King said his purchases have stopped for now. The drop in the market, he said, has helped to reduce the Japanese share of his portfolio below last fall's level. At Morgan Grenfell, according to Ian Kelson, a director, "We are looking at the sell-off and asking whether we should buy more, or if it is too early to take advantage of it."
 All three said they had not been hounded by their clients, partially because their funds take a long-term view and the clients are aware of it. Another reason is that the performance of other stock markets in the portfolios has been good enough to bring home nice returns over all. In 1991, Counsellors had a gain of 20.6 percent in dollar terms.
 But riding out the turmoil is not pleasant. When Mr. King and Mr. Bullock were increasing their stakes in Tokyo last fall, the Nikkei 225 was at 23,000. At the end of October, it had moved up almost 9 percent to 25,000. But since November the market is off 16 percent, closing on Friday at 21,072.15.
 And both think that the months ahead could be rough because the technical factors that have prompted the recent decline are still hanging over the market. One is the huge supply of stock, as many corporations, which had invested billions of cash in so-called Tokkin stock funds that have been falling, sell out. Another worry is that a slide below 20,000, which would bring the market to its lowest levels since February 1987, would force many banks to sell stock to meet international capital adequacy standards, forcing the market even lower.
 "We could have a shock," cautioned Mr. King. "But if there is a shock, Japan has the capability for pump priming," he argued, to cushion the plunge. "Japan has room for both fiscal and monetary policy to be pretty aggressive if there is a downward spike."
 Deciding whether these managers are right about a recovery will take time. Yes, they may have bought in too soon. (Note, however, that Mr. King suggested in September that the market could fall another 10 percent, which is exactly what it has done.) But if the market does rebound, they will already have a good stake and the timing error could be easily forgotten.
 And there is the matter of the Tokyo bears. Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company in New York, is negative about Japan. In mid-September, he warned that the market could drop to 20,000 in four to six weeks. He even said a plunge to 18,500 was possible.
 He was right about the direction, but like the others his timing was off a bit.
 "My philosophy is you cannot be right unless you risk being wrong," he said, pointing out his own timing mistake. "You are no use to people if you do not take a stand."

HEADLINE: Candidates Playing to Mood of Protectionism

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM with KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
With New Hampshire's economy on the rocks and few points of disagreement on other emotional issues like crime, race and abortion, the Democratic Presidential candidates are vying over who can deliver the harshest words and strongest promises about giving America a leg up in world economic competition.
What the candidates are offering in their commercials and on the stump is more emotion than logic, more oratory than substance. But they are exploiting the sense that many voters have that Americans are being treated unfairly in international trade, especially by the Japanese. 
 In fact, American exports have almost doubled in the last six years, and this country is running neck and neck with Germany for the position of the world's top exporter. Moreover, the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll on the subject, taken in November, shows that 32 percent of Americans believe that the Japanese compete unfairly, a number significantly lower than the 47 percent who say that Americans tend to blame Japan improperly for the nation's own economic problems.
But economists and politicians alike agree that the protectionist movement has gained strength this election year because of the flagging economy and the loss of high-paying American manufacturing jobs in the automobile, steel and other industries to Japan and Europe, where markets are not as open as they are here.
Much of this may be no more than electioneering. After gaining office, every President since Herbert Hoover has taken basically a free-trade stance, although several have said they favored trade restrictions in their campaigns.
But now, of the main Democratic candidates, only Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, is vigorously opposed to new trade restrictions. But his language is as strident as that of the others. "Others just blame the Japanese," he declares in his latest commercial. "Paul Tsongas will beat them, the American way, by making quality come first again."
Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska make no bones about advocating stiffer trade barriers. "I'm proud to be accused of being a protectionist," Mr. Harkin often says.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas calibrates the problem in a way that lets him strike a middle course. About one-quarter of the problem, he says, is that the Japanese have unfair trade rules; the other three-quarters is that the United States does not work hard enough to "compete and win."
President Bush, who used sharp words of his own on his trip to Japan this month, purports to be a free-trader. His acid test will come in the spring, when restrictions against imported steel are due to expire just before the primary in Pennsylvania, where steel is a major industry. In 1988, when polls showed him trailing in the state just before the fall election, Mr. Bush advocated continuing those limits.
Among economists, the mainstream has supported free trade, but it may have wandered slightly. Some prominent experts are now arguing that the United States must change its policies to compete more aggressively with the Japanese and Europeans. One of these is Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., an economist and trade official in the Reagan Administration.
"They're playing football and we're playing baseball, and we're both playing by the rules," he said in an interview. "But football is a contact sport, a rougher game than baseball, and our guys are getting beat up."
To follow the issue, it is important to understand not only the politics but also the economic theory, the history of postwar international commerce and the way the United States and its allies now restrict trade.
 
Trade Issue Rouses
The Big Losers
 Over the years, no other issue has caused such dissonance between scholars and politicians as trade.
Since the time of Adam Smith more than two centuries ago, almost every Western economist has been trained that unfettered trade is the best policy. On paper, it is. If you tally all the economic benefits from free trade and all the benefits from protection, free trade generally comes out ahead.
But politics is fueled by votes, not theories, and it is a rare politician who has not at one time or another sought protection from international competition for constituents. That is because while many people may be helped a small amount by free trade, a few people can be hurt a great deal.
For example, if a country allows shoes to be imported from abroad, where they can be manufactured more cheaply than at home, almost all consumers will be better off because they will pay a few dollars less for their shoes. But the domestic shoe industry might fold. And the people who own or work for shoe companies could lose their livelihoods.
Not surprisingly, the big losers, not the small winners, are the people who base their votes on where the candidates stand on shoe imports. So politicians normally abide by what Charles L. Schultze, who was budget director for President Lyndon B. Johnson and chairman of President Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, calls the principle of "do no direct harm."
 
Barriers Came Down
After World War II
 Whatever the economic and political theory, the United States became an industrial power in the late 19th and early 20th century by using tariffs and Government subsidies to shield its industries from foreign competition. But the bubble burst in the 1930's after the enactment of the infamous Smoot-Hawley law. High American tariffs precipitated retaliatory barriers from Europe. Trade and industry were crippled, the roar was wiped out of the 20's and the world tumbled into Depression.
Learning from mistakes, the United States and most of its industrial allies, including to some degree Japan, lowered trade barriers bit by bit from the end of World War II until the early 1970's. Then, in the 1970's, after the cartel of petroleum exporting countries caused oil prices to skyrocket, nation after nation began to erect trade walls as their economies contracted.
Early in the 1980's, largely because of the extraordinarily high value of the dollar, the United States began to run a serious trade deficit for the first time in more than a century. Trade restrictions here exploded. When the dollar is strong, imports are less costly and American exports are more expensive, which meant that important domestic industries like copper, steel and autos found themselves unable to compete.
The trade deficit peaked in 1987, at $152 billion. Then, the value of the dollar fell. The deficit was only $65 billion last year.
Exports led the comeback. The politicians rarely mention it, but the market in Japan for American manufactured goods grew faster than any other big market except Mexico, nearly doubling to $31 billion last year from $16 billion in 1987.
But imports from Japan also expanded, so the United States trade deficit with Japan shrank slowly. It was about $40 billion last year, down from $56 billion in 1987.
By contrast, the United States has turned around its trade deficit with Europe. Last year, the United States sold about $17 billion more in goods and services to the 12 nations of the European Community than it imported from those countries.
And American trade barriers have also been relaxed slightly. The share of United States imports subject to some kind of protection rose to 21 percent in 1984 from 8 percent in 1975, according to Gary C. Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economists. Now, he said, the figure is only 16 percent to 18 percent.
The World Bank calculates that the European Community restricts a slightly larger proportion of imports than the United States, while Japan protects about one-quarter of its imports.
 
Trading Countries Use
Many Types of Protection
 The United States has been the international leader in promoting free trade for more than 50 years. The Reagan and Bush Administrations struck free trade agreements with Canada and Israel, began negotiating a pact with Mexico and led the push for a reduction in trade barriers worldwide.
But the United States protects some of its own industries, especially agriculture. Ice cream imports, for example, are limited to less than one teaspoon per person each year. Sugar imports are capped at about a quarter of the nation's annual consumption, and grain and tobacco farmers are subsidized. The result is not only to keep out foreign agricultural products but to increase markedly what consumers pay for food.
Pressure to "Buy American" also seems to be growing. This week, responding to protests, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission canceled a $122 million rail transit contract with Sumitomo, a Japanese company.
The United States also restricts foreign investment in its shipping, airline, radio, television and long-distance communications industries.
In Europe, through a system of import quotas, lavish export subsidies and purchases of extra production, farmers are protected to a much greater extent. This has caused considerable friction in international trade talks. The Europeans view their rules as much as a social policy as an economic one.
"I've been in your cities," a European agriculture official told an American reporter, "and I don't want our cities to get like that, crowded with all the people who have moved off the farms. We don't have plains and prairies and deserts like you. Our farms are our countryside."
European governments also often impose rules against buying from foreign suppliers and actively support direct subsidies to favored businesses, a practice generally avoided in the United States. Airbus Industrie was set up with billions of dollars in taxpayer money from Germany, France, Britain and Spain to compete with American aircraft manufacturers.
In Japan, rice imports are completely banned. Japan agreed in 1988 to cancel rigid limits on imported beef and oranges but replaced them with tariffs of more than 50 percent. "The price of sirloin steak in downtown Tokyo's $26 a pound," Senator Harkin complained in last Sunday's debate of Democratic Presidential candidates. "We could sell it for $4 or $5 a pound over there, but they won't let it in."
Japan's keiretsu -- loosely knit industrial and banking groups with sprawling interests -- buy mainly from within their group and keep out imports.
The Japanese Government bureaucracy and professional groups have other ways of blocking foreigners from offering services. Americans complain, for instance, that the dates when contract bids in Japan are due are not announced.
But some Japanese trade barriers are being lowered slowly. After three years of arm-twisting, Toys "R" Us was permitted last month to open its first store in Japan. The Japanese Government agreed during President Bush's recent visit to buy more large American computers and parts for automobiles.
 
Disagreements
On What to Do
 The Japanese argue that their trade advantage over the United States is based on their superior education, training and production, and most American politicians agree that improvement here is needed in those areas. Still, although the American economy is roughly twice as productive as the Japanese, politicians here from both parties find political mileage in harping on what they see as unfair advantages in the Japanese system.
"The two economies are simply incompatible," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, reflecting a pervasive view in Congress. "They are a society that is intensely focused on production and export, and we are focused on consumption and import."
But there are significant differences on how best to respond, and no single position is dominant.
The White House stance is that the United States should use its diplomacy to persuade Japan to change its ways. Mr. Bush's trip to Japan this month was basically a trade mission.
Many Democrats favor a form of industrial policy in which specific American industries are singled out for Government subsidies so they can become more competitive.
Beyond the florid oratory in New Hampshire, a consensus may be developing, at least in theory, about what American trade policy should be in the years ahead. Almost everyone agrees that the United States should make better use of what Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, calls "the juicy allure of American markets" to pry open markets elsewhere.
In addition, many economists as well as politicians are arguing that the Government should compensate communities, companies and workers damaged by imports, withhold subsidies to unproductive industries and offer some assistance to those that show the promise of being able to win a healthy share of world commerce. But who would decide, and how?
"I'm very skeptical," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard, "that this could ever work in the American system."

Chart: "Ways That Nations Restrict Trade: A Glossary"
 
TARIFFS: Customs fees on imported products. For example, the U.S. imposes a tariff of $1.21 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cut or ground tobacco stems. Economists, who generally don't like import controls, tolerate tariffs because their cost is apparent to consumers and because they affect all sources of an import equally.
 
QUOTAS, BANS, AND VOLUNTARY RESTRAINT: Limits or prohibitions can be placed on imports. Particularly prevalant in trade in textile and apparel. Kurtas, knee-length tunics worn by many immigrants from north India, are allowed into the U. S. quota-free if they do not have collars; with collars, they are counted as shirts, and few can be imported. Also frequent in agriculture and in culture:
 
But the treaty that governs most world trade prohibits quotas or high tariffs on many products. Developed countries have increasingly turned to insisting that their trading partners "voluntarily" hold back. The U.S. just last month renewed such a voluntary restraint agreement on factory tool imports from Taiwan and Japan.
 
"BUY AMERICAN" (OR FRENCH OR ITALIAN): Governments exhort their citizens to buy fewer foreign products, or lean on foreign industries to import more.
 
Goverments tend to buy from domestic producers even when foreign companies produce a better or cheaper product. German public hospitals, for example, have trouble getting permission to buy American X-ray equipment.
 
SUBSIDIES: Nations often help domestic industries sell overseas by reimbursing producers part of their costs. The European Community pays $12 billion to farmers who agree to export food.
 
RULES AND REGULATIONS: While needed to protect workers and consumers, safety and quality standards are often used to close a country's markets, or to restrict the financial and legal services that foreign companies can offer.
 
The European Community is about to ban pine wood imports that have not been heated in a kiln until very dry. The E.C. says the purpose is to kill pine tree worms; the U.S., which has more forests than Europe, contends that there is no scientific basis for requiring the expensive process.
 
PRICE FIXING: The treaty governing most world trade allows countries to use to use tariffs to raise the prices of imported goods produced by subsidized industries.
 
A growing number of countries also impose tariffs if they feel that imported goods are being sold below cost, or "dumped." The United States imposed late last summer a dumping duty of 62.67 percent on imports of sophisticated screens for laptop and notebook computers from Japan.
 
LIMITING FOREIGN INVESTMENT: By restricting how much of a local business a foreign company can buy, or forbidding a foreign corporation to open a business, countries make it hard to distribute imports.
 
PIRACY: By allowing domestic industries to copy foreign books, computer programs, pharmaceuticals and videocassettes without asking permission or paying any royalties, countries can discourage costly imports.
 
Developing countries, led by India, China, Thailand, Nigeria and the former Soviet republics, engage in piracy more than developed countries because most of their citizens are very poor and their industries weak. (pg. 20)

HEADLINE: All About/Dealer Auto Repairs;
Turning a Source of Headaches Into a Source of Profits

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
For most car owners, there are few events that provoke greater anxiety than a trip to the dealer or local garage for service or repairs. A phone call from the service manager often means news of unforeseen and costly problems. Because drivers rely so much on their cars, a less-than-perfect repair can be a significant irritation.
Many service visits are less than perfect. Almost a third of all trips to the dealer for repairs require a repeat visit, according to J. D. Power & Associates, the automotive consulting firm. And some auto repairs are never done right. The Better Business Bureau says poor service for cars consistently rates as one of the top five consumer complaints. 
 Automobile dealers can no longer afford the reputation of having troubled service departments. As profit margins on new cars have dwindled and sales have dropped to their lowest levels in nearly a decade, dealers are relying on their parts and service departments for a growing share of profits -- 86 percent last year, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, up from 11 percent in 1983.
This growing reliance on parts and service as major profit centers has forced dealers to focus more attention on these operations. They are also working hard to increase their 21 percent share of the $100 billion spent each year on parts and service by drivers of the nation's 187 million registered vehicles. In 1985, dealers had just 18 percent of the market, according to the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.
Dealerships have made numerous changes in the way they do business to woo consumers who demand convenience and to accommodate the complexity of modern cars and trucks. "Service and parts are their survival," said W. C. Smith, who heads an automotive consulting firm in Laurel, Md.
The innovation and investment appear to be paying off. As dealers gain market share, largely at the expense of service stations, the quality of their operations is also improving. A J. D. Power survey states that repeat visits for repairs to dealers of all foreign and domestic makes dropped to 28 percent in 1991 from 46 percent in 1986. In a separate J. D. Power survey that asks whether dealers are doing a better job satisfying customers' service needs, 56 percent of consumers responded yes in 1991, up from 39 percent in 1986.
 
Impressing Customers
Free Cab Rides And Playgrounds
 Many dealerships have devised elaborate ways to build customer loyalty through added convenience. Given the competition from the growing ranks of specialty repair shops -- such as outlets that specialize in tune-ups and oil changes -- the industry has been forced to raise its standards, consultants say. "Dealers have to learn to impress, not just satisfy customers," said Mr. Smith.
To minimize the hassle of getting to work without their cars, customers at the eight Zimbrick dealerships in Madison, Wisc., are offered free cab rides to work after they drop off their cars in the morning. Although the monthly cab bill comes to $10,000, David S. Nathanson, Zimbrick's president, said the money is better spent than on other costs such as marketing. Regular dinners with the staff of the cab company provide feedback on customers' comments about the dealerships, Mr. Nathanson said..
Last year, Zimbrick's Honda dealership set up a stand-alone service center for basic repairs and maintenance work away from the showroom in a suburban area with a high concentration of Honda owners. At this satellite center, the dealership constructed an indoor playground for children and work cubicles for adults with telephones and free local calls. "We just want to make it as uninterruptive to the flow of daily activities as possible," said Mr. Nathanson. "We're in a very service-oriented economy."
Zimbrick and many other dealers offer car buyers regular service seminars in which customers learn about the service operation and their warranty coverage. And dealers have expanded their service hours to an average of 49 hours a week in 1991 from 42 hours a week in 1989, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Some dealers and auto makers also try to impress with more subtle details. Infiniti and Lexus, the two top-rated brands in J. D. Power's most recent customer satisfaction survey, store their customers' service histories in a computer network that can be quickly accessed at any Lexus or Infiniti dealership nationwide.
At Sewell Village Cadillac in Dallas, the drain screens in the floor in the service area are chrome plated. At Sewell's Lexus dealership, the service manager has installed old-fashioned ceiling fans and hung prints on the wall.
 
 
The Mechanic of Yore
Now It's Computers And Technicians
 Fixing a car is no longer a job for mechanics; they are now referred to as technicians. The reason for the change is that many technicians require as much training in electronics and computers as they do in mechanics. "A technician now has to have the expertise of a radio or television repairman," said Fred Pirochta, repair facility division director of Michigan's automotive regulation bureau.
To help technicians with the increasingly difficult task of trouble-shooting, many auto makers have devised expensive computerized diagnostic tools for their dealers. Chrysler's diagnostic system, developed with the help of the International Business Machines Corporation, diagnoses problems, but also serves up repair procedures and contains technical libraries, diagrams and an electronic parts catalogue. Using a portable computer, data can be recorded during a test drive by a Chrysler technician, then fed into the main system back at the service bay for analysis. Some diagnostic systems enable technicians at the factory to hook into the dealer's computers to help diagnose a problem.
The cost of such advanced systems is one reason why dealership labor rates are higher than service stations' rates. Last year, labor rates at dealerships averaged $41.50 an hour across the United States, up from $25 an hour in 1984, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Service station rates averaged about $38 an hour last year.
To reduce the number of repeat visits for repairs on seven of its increasingly complex engines, the General Motors Corporation launched a program in October that calls for dealers to replace the engines rather than fix them on several models of 1992 cars and small trucks. G.M. pays for the replacement engines; the old engines are shipped to the factory, where they are either discarded or rebuilt and resold as used engines.
 
Stocking Up
The Cost of Keeping Parts on Hand
 Not only is the repair business labor intensive, it is capital intensive. In 1990, car dealers stocked an average of $200,000 worth of parts, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. But dealerships employ different strategies for stocking parts.
At one extreme is Sewell Village Cadillac. It keeps more than $1 million worth of parts on hand. Carl Sewell, who owns six dealerships, said his goal is to fill more than 90 percent of parts orders from on-site inventory. Mr. Sewell said interrupting work for a part to be delivered costs the dealership $25 to $40. "Every time you're out of a part, it's very, very expensive," he said.
By contrast, Lexus dealers generally keep just $30,000 worth of parts in stock. One reason is that Lexus is a relatively new brand with fewer models. But it also needed a way to minimize the space required to store parts, so dealers could build in prime locations.
To minimize waiting times for customers, Lexus dealers stock a broad but shallow array of parts. When one is used, it is replaced by next-day delivery. Richard L. Chitty, corporate manager for parts, service and customer satisfaction for Lexus, said the delivery cost is a necessary expense to enable dealers to build compact dealerships.
 
 
 
SHOWS ON PEOPLE SKILLS OR TRANSAXLES
 For many years, the Chrysler Corporation kept its dealers current on technical information and other issues through electronic mail, phone calls and mailings. But the auto maker wanted a more efficient way to communicate the same message to everyone at the same time. The answer: its own television shows, on the Chrysler Dealer Network, or CDN.
For more than a year, Chrysler has been broadcasting roughly 90 minutes of new programming a week on topics that include service, like "Throttle cable adjustment on ZF transaxle."
It also broadcasts shows on sales, like "Hot Button: Brush up on your people skills. Learn how to find a customer's hot button and when to push it." Other shows are designed for dealership management.
Nearly all of the company's 5,000 U.S. dealers are equipped with monitors. A survey found that more than 90 percent of the targeted employees at the dealerships see the programs. James R. Abbott, service and parts director at Doug Griffith Chrysler-Plymouth in Baltimore, Md., said he tapes the programs for his service staff. "It immediately updates us with all the information," he said. "Before it was just hit or miss."
A number of dealers' suppliers advertise on the network, including computer companies and van conversion firms. A Chrysler spokesman said the goal of the network is to break even, a point it has not yet reached.

HEADLINE: Well-Dressed Animals Keeping Sales High

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
SALES of clothing for men and women at the tonier stores may have fizzled this last holiday season, but at the K-Marts, Woolworths and Jamesway stores, sales of sporty sweaters and nappy raincoats for four-legged customers did especially well.
"Even when times are bad, people somehow keep buying for their children and their pets," said Robert Kastner, a manufacturer of dog sweaters, dog T-shirts and dog and cat beds. "People with pets, especially, find it emotionally satisfying to buy them something for the holidays." 
 Mr. Kastner, 62, the owner of Rotanis Pet Products in Ossining, said: "Ours is a volume business. We don't make canine mink coats or studded leather pet biker jackets, but we do make moderately priced, fashionable running clothes, sweaters, raincoats, jackets and beds."
Even in the smallest towns across the country today, he said, "People are very fashion conscious."
"What's fashionable in the human world is fashionable for pets," explained Mr. Kastner, who does his market research by walking through places like Bloomingdale's and Lord & Taylor, observing what people select for themselves.
 
A Huge Potential Market
 "Earth tones are in for sweaters," he reported. "Small floral patterns and paisley prints are big in home furnishings. The Victorian look is important for beds. We incorporate all the fashionable styles into our own line. I explore every department including housewares, for instance, where I examine kitchenware, and when I see a lot of pastels used, we use the same pastels for our dog beds."
Mr. Kastner's potential market is huge. The dog population in the United States stands at 50 million. Cats number 70 million. In a perfect world, every one of them would have a bed, Mr. Kastner said.
"Every creature needs a place to rest or nest, something to crawl into," he said. "A protected place to peer out from."
His business, in fact, began with beds.
"My dad, Albert Kastner, started a company in 1938 from his office in the Flatiron Building in Manhattan," Mr. Kastner said. "At the time, he was working as a manufacturer's rep for importers of bamboo and rattan products from Indonesia. In those days, bamboo and rattan were inexpensive materials, used a lot for tables and chairs. My dad thought, 'Why not make a bamboo basket to be used as a dog's bed?'
"He sold the W. T. Grant Company on the idea, and when he had its order he made arrangements with a supplier in Indonesia to have dog beds made in three sizes. The largest one, big enough for a good-sized Labrador. With a retail price starting at $1.98 to $2.98, they sold very well in the years from 1938 to 1941, when the war cut off all trade with Indonesia."
But by then, Mr. Kastner recalled, his father was convinced that a business catering to pets had a future.
"He rented a loft, and in those days Manhattan was full of jobbers and suppliers who were capable of making anything a manufacturer wanted," he said. "My dad designed a cushion with a back similar in shape to a dog's basket, had it made up and took it around to the department stores. Buyers liked it. Carson Pirie & Scott in Chicago gave him his first big order."
 
Starting Out on the Road
 Mr. Kastner said he worked for his father during summer vacations from high school and college. He recalled that he always assumed that he would go into the family business.
His father started him on the road, calling on customers. "I realized there was an opportunity to do some cross selling, so we expanded our line to include other pet products such as sweaters, coats and raincoats for dogs," he said. "We even tried some canine footwear -- rain boots -- I recall, but we discarded those quickly when we found that they made the dogs uncomfortable."
When asked why dogs need coats, sweaters and raincoats, Mr. Kastner said: "Because domesticity has changed their ability to adapt to the elements. Animals who live in heated homes get used to an even temperature. When it's below 40 degrees outside, they need the same protection from the cold that humans do."
Sweaters, designed and manufactured in the Ossining plant, outsell coats and raincoats by 5 to 1, he said.
"People tend to buy more than one sweater -- a whole wardrobe of sweaters for their pets," he said. "T-shirts, with such inscriptions as 'Fire Hydrant Inspector' are strictly for fun, but they sell surprisingly well."
T-shirts sell for $4.98. Sweaters retail at $5.98 to $7.98. Running suits are $6.98. The most expensive item made by the company is a brass dog's bed, which sells for $39.95.
 
<SC0>A Highly Competitive Field
 "Our operation is typical of most of the companies in the pet products industry," Mr. Kastner said. "Most of us are small manufacturers. Many of us represent the second generation of owners. It's a highly competitive industry but a fairly stable one for old-time companies."
In 1988 Mr. Kastner bought a building formerly occupied by the Cambridge Instruments Company in Ossining.
"We were pressed for space," he said. "Our volume has increased about four and a half times since the 1970's, and our sales are projected at over $4 million this year. We looked for space in New York City, but the building in Ossining with 55,000 square feet of space was enough for both our manufacturing facility and our office."
An additional draw is the labor supply, he said: "These Hudson River towns are such good sources for semiskilled local seamstresses. We employ about 30 of them in our plant."
Rotanis also has two resident models: Freddie, a black Labrador, and Chuckie, a mixed breed.
"Freddie was a stray who literally knocked on the door shortly after we got here looking for a handout," Mr. Kastner said. "Chuckie appeared on the scene a little bit later. They both live here and earn their keep modeling."
 
A Mail-Order Approach
 A large dog doll, a Dalmatian, made for Mr. Kastner by a sculptor friend of his, is used as a backup model.
Mr. Kastner, who lives in Manhattan, makes the reverse commute by train every day. "It's a very pleasant trip," he said, "never crowded. I like working in Westchester, but I can't see myself living here. I'd miss the noise and excitement of the city."
Jay Spear, a former commuter and now the owner of Quincy's Choice, a mail-order house in Dobbs Ferry, which sells quality products for the discerning dog, said he doesn't miss anything about Manhattan.
"My office is close to home so instead of a two-hour commute, I have a short walk."
Mr. Spear, who has always been fond of dogs, named his company for the family dog, Quincy, a golden retriever that appears frequently in the catalogue as a model.
 
'An Upbeat Business'
 "Our customers often send us pictures of their dogs, which we run in the catalogue. Not only is this an up-beat business, but it seems to be one that is recession proof," Mr. Spear said. "During the two years we've been in business, our volume has steadily increased."
Calling this past Christmas season a very good one, he added: "When it comes to pets, people make multiple purchases. They'll order goodies, four or five toys plus other accessories at one clip."
According to Mr. Spear, his catalogue offers items that can't be found elsewhere. "We only carry those products we consider safe, fun or functional," he said. "And that means no choke chains, no cages and no electronic collars. So we ferret out sources who will make us new and different items such as special toys."
All the products under consideration for the catalogue are first tried out on Quincy.
"He was especially fond of the ragg bones this year, and they proved to be excellent sellers," Mr. Spear said.

Loft-Living Southern Style, Catching On

BYLINE: By FORD RISLEY

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Thanks to an abundance of old warehouses and the arrival of new residents who have experience with loft living, Georgia has become home to a growing number of loft conversions.
"This is sort of a Southern-fried SoHo," said Bruce Gallman, one of the original developers of this city's Castleberry Hill, which has the state's largest concentration of loft apartments. 
 Georgia developments like Castleberry Hill differ perceptibly from New York's SoHo and other well-known loft districts. While they share the usual high ceilings, brick walls and abundance of windows, most lack the stores, restaurants and other amenities that help give a neighborhood a sense of community.
Conversions of scattered buildings around Atlanta have been going on since the late 60's, but Castleberry Hill did not emerge as a loft community until about three years ago.
Next to one of the main railroad lines, Castleberry Hill is a 10-block area of small warehouses interspersed with an occasional storefront. Within walking distance of downtown, it is bordered on the north by the Omni arena and on the south by Morehouse College. Most of the buildings still standing in the area, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, were built between 1885 and 1925.
In 1983, Mr. Gallman and other local investors acquired a vacant 80-year-old warehouse and converted it into 16 loft apartments. Since then, small investors have been buying other buildings in the neighborhood and converting them to lofts either for their own use or to rent.
Castleberry Hill now has about 120 loft apartments that are home to more than 150 people. And the numbers are growing. Late in 1990 a nine-unit building that had been a mattress warehouse opened, and construction on 40 more units will begin this year.
Rick Skelton, president of SMP Properties, one of the developers behind the projects, said loft owners in Castleberry Hill have little trouble finding tenants. He estimates the vacancy rate at less than 5 percent.
"People are starting to move back downtown," he said. "Every strong city needs downtown living."
Mr. Skelton's former mattress factory was fully leased before the six-month conversion was completed. Units have 14-foot ceilings and pine flooring and average 1,750 square feet. Rents are $650 to $1,100 a month.
The growing interest in Castleberry Hill is reflected in rising prices. Five years ago, unrenovated property cost $5 to $6 a square foot, Mr. Skelton said; today it brings $12 to $15, while renovated buildings go for $40 to $45 a square foot.
Of about one million square feet of warehouse space in the area, less than half is now used for lofts, said Jim Schneider, a real estate broker who has sold several buildings in the area. Most tenants have an appreciation of history, he said. Castleberry Hill, he said, appeals to people who want to live close to downtown and need or want a lot of space.
Mr. Skelton and his group of investors paid $135,000 for their 24,000-square-foot building and spent $350,000 to renovate it.
Most Castleberry Hill loft space was taken at first by artists and craftsmen, who worked as well as lived in their apartments. Although many remain, the area has recently become home to an increasing number of professionals. Mr. Skelton's tenants include an architect, a physician, a public relations executive and several salesmen. Many had lived in lofts in other cities and wanted a similar life style in Atlanta, he said.
Established in the mid-1800's, Castleberry Hill was Atlanta's original industrial district. Warehouses used for cotton and other commodities were built alongside the railroad line that now divides the area from downtown's high-rise towers. After the Civil War, banks, saloons and grocers began moving into the area, according to local historians.
After the turn of the century, Castleberry Hill fell on hard times and became home to brothels and a gang known as the Snake Nation. Mangum Drive, one of the streets in Castleberry Hill, is named for the sheriff who helped run the gang out of the area.
Though Atlanta is the principal venue for loft-living, there are lofts in other cities, too. Savannah has loft apartments scattered throughout its historic district and riverfront area. Although the total number of lofts is still fairly small -- only a few more than two dozen -- it is growing steadily, said Dick Mopper, a real estate broker in the city.
"Interest certainly is growing," he said. "I think we're going to see more and more. There are a number of buildings that lend themselves to lofts."
Much of the interest comes from newcomers to the city who had lived in loft apartments elsewhere, Mr. Mopper said. Some are students at the Savannah College of Art and Design, a small school that attracts students from throughout the country.
Several smaller cities, Savannah among them, , have a bigger inventory than Atlanta of warehouses appropriate for use as lofts, said Pat Connell, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech who specializes in historic preservation.
Augusta, Macon and Columbus, which now have only a few scattered loft projects, were centers for cotton manufacturing and their many large warehouses are easily converted into lofts. Atlanta, by contrast, had more of a service-based economy, .
"These places have an excellent inventory of buildings," Mr. Connell said. "There's a lot of potential for loft development."
Despite frequent comparisons to SoHo, loft projects in Atlanta and elsewhere in the state lack many of the characteristics of New York's famous residential district.
Except for Castleberry Hill, most of the loft developments in the state lack a sense of neighborhood identity. Castleberry Hill has a neighborhood association and an annual holiday arts festival. Pick-up basketball games are popular and there is a common area where residents gather for small parties.
But leaders in the community recognize that more is needed. Mr. Skelton said he and several others are trying to buy an abandoned railroad spur that runs behind several buildings to turn it into a park where community activities could be held.
The neighborhood also lacks the amenities and street activity found in loft areas in many communities, Mr. Gallman said.
A rapid transit station and a few sandwich shops and small restaurants are nearby, but most establishments close at dark. Finding any real nighttime activity means a trip downtown, residents say. And because there is very little downtown living, there are precious few stores -- such as groceries -- that cater to residents. The nearest such retail shopping is several miles away.
There are obstacles in the way of further loft conversions. Some lenders, for example, are wary of projects they still consider "pioneering," Mr. Skelton said, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act also eliminated some of the tax advantages for renovating historic buildings.
Probably the biggest stumbling block is the perception that Castleberry Hill has a serious crime problem. Although streets in the neighborhood often are dirty and the area attracts many homeless people, residents say crime is no worse than in many other parts of the city.
And Capt. W. F. Derrick of the Atlanta police said that crime had actually decreased in the area in the last year -- he did not provide numbers -- which he attributed to having a round-the-clock population.

Most tenants have an appreciation of history, he said. Castleberry Hill, he said, appeals to people who want to live close to downtown and need or want a lot of space.
Mr. Skelton and his group of investors paid $135,000 for their 24,000-square-foot building and spent $350,000 to renovate it.
Most Castleberry Hill loft space was taken at first by artists and craftsmen, who worked as well as lived in their apartments. Although many remain, the area has recently become home to an increasing number of professionals. Mr. Skelton's tenants include an architect, a physician, a public relations executive and several salesmen. Many had lived in lofts in other cities and wanted a similar life style in Atlanta, he said.
Established in the mid-1800's, Castleberry Hill was Atlanta's original industrial district. Warehouses used for cotton and other commodities were built alongside the railroad line that now divides the area from downtown's high-rise towers. After the Civil War, banks, saloons and grocers began moving into the area, according to local historians.
After the turn of the century, Castleberry Hill fell on hard times and became home to brothels and a gang known as the Snake Nation. Mangum Drive, one of the streets in Castleberry Hill, is named for the sheriff who helped run the gang out of the area.
Though Atlanta is the principal venue for loft-living, there are lofts in other cities, too. Savannah has loft apartments scattered throughout its historic district and riverfront area. Although the total number of lofts is still fairly small -- only a few more than two dozen -- it is growing steadily, said Dick Mopper, a real estate broker in the city.
"Interest certainly is growing," he said. "I think we're going to see more and more. There are a number of buildings that lend themselves to lofts."
Much of the interest comes from newcomers to the city who had lived in loft apartments elsewhere, Mr. Mopper said. Some are students at the Savannah College of Art and Design, a small school that attracts students from throughout the country.
Several smaller cities, Savannah among them, , have a bigger inventory than Atlanta of warehouses appropriate for use as lofts, said Pat Connell, a professor of architecture at Georgia Tech who specializes in historic preservation.
Augusta, Macon and Columbus, which now have only a few scattered loft projects, were centers for cotton manufacturing and their many large warehouses are easily converted into lofts. Atlanta, by contrast, had more of a service-based economy, .
"THESE places have an excellent inventory of buildings," Mr. Connell said. "There's a lot of potential for loft development."
Despite frequent comparisons to SoHo, loft projects in Atlanta and elsewhere in the state lack many of the characteristics of New York's famous residential district.
Except for Castleberry Hill, most of the loft developments in the state lack a sense of neighborhood identity. Castleberry Hill has a neighborhood association and an annual holiday arts festival. Pick-up basketball games are popular and there is a common area where residents gather for small parties.
But leaders in the community recognize that more is needed. Mr. Skelton said he and several others are trying to buy an abandoned railroad spur that runs behind several buildings to turn it into a park where community activities could be held.
The neighborhood also lacks the amenities and street activity found in loft areas in many communities, Mr. Gallman said.
A rapid transit station and a few sandwich shops and small restaurants are nearby, but most establishments close at dark. Finding any real nighttime activity means a trip downtown, residents say. And because there is very little downtown living, there are precious few stores -- such as groceries -- that cater to residents. The nearest such retail shopping is several miles away.
There are obstacles in the way of further loft conversions. Some lenders, for example, are wary of projects they still consider "pioneering," Mr. Skelton said, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act also eliminated some of the tax advantages for renovating historic buildings.
Probably the biggest stumbling block is the perception that Castleberry Hill has a serious crime problem. Although streets in the neighborhood often are dirty and the area attracts many homeless people, residents say crime is no worse than in many other parts of the city.
And Capt. W. F. Derrick of the Atlanta police said that crime had actually decreased in the area in the last year -- he did not provide numbers -- which he attributed to having a round-the-clock population.

HEADLINE: UConn Marks 100 Years of Women

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago the president of Storrs Agricultural School, Benjamin Koons, felt so strongly about enrolling a student named I. Lee that he skirted the law and kept the admission secret from the school's trustees. The student's first name was Ida, but state law prohibited women students at the school. Mr. Koons did not accept fees from Miss Lee and could not give her academic credit, but she got her education.
Ida Lee Hale's obituary cited her as the first woman enrolled at the school that grew into the University of Connecticut. Researchers have found five other women who were also enrolled surreptitiously at the school during the 1891-92 academic year. The law was changed to allow women to enroll in 1892-93, and Ida Lee was officially accepted as a second-year student. 
 "The social values of that time were that women didn't need an education," said Dr. Cynthia H. Adams, a professor of allied health at the university. "They would just get married and have babies, and why did you need an education for that?"
 
Degrees in All Areas
 Dr. Adams, chairwoman of the 100 Years of Women At UConn celebration, said sexism permeated even the scientific community of the 19th century. Medical textbooks of the time said too much education would damage the uterus, she noted.
"As recently as the 1950's and 60's, when I was growing up, it was still not totally accepted that women should go to college," Dr. Adams said. "Now there's almost no area left where women haven't gotten a degree."
Dr. Regina Barreca, an associate professor of English at UConn and a member of the planning committee for the centennial celebration, said she hoped to see considerable progress in the next 100 years. But women have to proceed cautiously, she said.
"Women are really caught in a crossfire" between those who note how far they have come and others who point to the gaps that remain between women's progress and men's, Dr. Barreca said. "But I will say this, it's been real easy to find women who have made a difference at UConn."
She said that the university's administration had been enthusiastic in its support for the celebration, and that UConn's president, Dr. Harry J. Hartley, created something of a stir when he appointed her the institution's first woman convocation speaker when this academic year opened.
"There were men who were much taller and much older who had a lot more stuff hanging off their academic gowns who were really listening to what I had to say," Dr. Barreca said.
 
Encouraging Engineers
 Erling Murtha-Smith, a professor of civil engineering and a member of the committee, said women are still underrepresented in his discipline. There was one woman among 120 students in his graduating class in 1969 at the University of Leeds in England, he said, while at UConn today the proportion is up to 5 or 10 percent.
"We need to brief high school teachers and counselors, and even below that level, at junior high, to encourage the better math and science students to consider engineering," Dr. Murtha-Smith said. UConn has started such a program, he said.
The director of recreation and intramural sports at UConn, Patti A. Bostic, said that in athletics as well as academics women have been making gains, which she attributed not only to interest in women's sports but also to equal treatment of women's sports in the hierarchy of the university's athletic department.
She went to one women's basketball game recently that had 3,100 spectators, she said, and more than 1,700 season tickets for the women's games have been sold.
"That's outstanding for the first year they're selling season tickets, particularly considering that last year they didn't even charge to get into women's basketball games," said Ms. Bostic, who is also helping plan the centennial celebration.
Dr. Adams said that despite the strides that women have made in the academic world, only 2 of UConn's 12 trustees are women, the university has never had a woman president, few women hold administrative posts, and salaries are remain higher for men. She said, however, that Mr. Hartley's selection as president bodes well for women.
 
Finding Qualified Women
 "The attitude of President Hartley and his administration has been one of action rather than lip service," Dr. Adams said. "We bring things to his attention, and he fixes them.
"I've been at UConn 20 years, and there have been times I was the only woman on a committee. Or I have noticed there were no women on certain committees, and the explanation has always been there were no qualified women. President Hartley's solution has been to find the qualified women."
Men do not seem to have suffered any discrimination during the planning of the celebration. Dr. Murtha-Smith is the only man on the committee, aside from Dr. Hartley, who is an ex-officio member. But Dr. Murtha-Smith said he felt no awkwardness at the meetings.
"I don't feel like I've been treated, as the token male," he said. "I give my opinions, and they are accepted or rejected on merit alone."
Dr. Adams said one part of the celebration will be to honor the families of the six women pioneers at UConn, including Ida Lee Hale. Mrs. Hale owned the Hale House restaurant with her husband, Spencer Hale, the first man to grow peaches in Connecticut. She used her studies of nutrition to develop recipes using only peaches.
 
Largely Self-Supporting
 UConn has promised some financial assistance for the celebration, but Dr. Adams said much of it will be self-supporting, through sales of tickets to the main banquet in March and T-shirts with the UConn logo on the front and the 1905 and 1991 national champion women's basketball teams on the back.
These are some of the events planned for the spring term:
*An exhibit of portraits of 50 women important to UConn, taken by Pat Leavens, a graduate student in photography, will open at the Benton Museum on campus on Feb. 13 and run through March.
*A half-time show at the women's basketball game against the University of Pittsburgh at the Gampel Pavilion on Feb. 26 will honor some of the university's first women students and their families.
*An exhibit of archival UConn photos will open on March 4 in the walkway between the Legislative Office Building and the Capitol in Hartford. That evening, during the men's basketball game against Syracuse University at the Hartford Civic Center, a half-time show will honor the children of the original women students.
*At an awards banquet in Southington on March 26, 11 women who have made important contributions to UConn will be given medallions. Among them will be Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat of Hartford, and former state Representative Dorothy Goodwin of Mansfield, the first person to earn a Ph.D. in agricultural economics at UConn, in 1953.

BYLINE: By Geoffrey Norman; Geoffrey Norman is author of "Sweetwater Ranch," a novel.

DATELINE: DORSET, Vt.

 BODY:
For fans who aren't trying to figure the spread and who don't live in the cities that claim the teams, the Super Bowl can be a problem: Three hours of not-so-good football (usually) preceded (always) by endless hype. Deciding which team to support has never been easy.
This year, it will be absurdly simple. For everyone living outside the Beltway, it is us versus them, baby. Them being the Redskins, the team from the nation's capital, which, if you didn't already know, is inside the Beltway. And full of insiders. 
 As TV commentators like to tell us, the Redskins are the only thing everyone in Washington can agree on. Everyone there loves them, knows all the words to their fight song and has had at least one drink with Billy Kilmer, a former Redskins quarterback.
Well, among those of us who don't live in Washington, there is one thing we can all agree on. We hate that city and all its works: B.C.C.I., the Keating Five, the Thomas hearings, the Gates hearings, a faltering economy.
Since we can't do anything to punish or even inconvenience our tormentors in Washington, we can take out our anger on the Redskins and pull for the Buffalo Bills. Maybe they can do to the Redskins on the gridiron what we want to do with term limitations but can't.
It's going to be hard. The Redskins have talent, some of it with the kind of seniority a Congressman would envy. They also have a coach, Joe Gibbs, with the discipline and intelligence of Richard Darman -- though Gibbs's record is much better than the President's budget director's.
The Redskins owner is Jack Kent Cooke, who always has a trophy politician or two in his box. As the Redskins savaged Detroit two weeks ago, Secretary of State James Baker looked on. Cooke has invited Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington and her husband to sit with him at the Super Bowl. Coincidentally, Cooke is negotiating with the city to build a new stadium for his team. There is discussion as to whether this constitutes a conflict of interest, or merely the appearance of a conflict of interest, a distinction that might be lost on most people outside the Beltway.
The late Edward Bennett Williams, Washington's archetypal power lawyer, was once part owner of the team. His clients included such Washington luminaries as Abe Fortas, Bobby Baker and Joe McCarthy. All of whom would have been Redskins fans.
The Redskins were the last team in the National Football League to integrate, even as Congress is the only Fortune 500-sized enterprise not covered by the Civil Rights Act or the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. Until recently, representatives were not even obliged to have money in the bank when they wrote a check.
Now all of this may seem like pure ad hominem and graceless ranting, but, what the hell, that's how just about all the powerful people in Washington got there in the first place. The city, remember, is also the home of the 30-second attack-video industry.
It has been a good, fat year for the Redskins. But then Washington is completely recession proof. Every year the Beltway insiders grow sleeker and more comfortable. Meanwhile, out in the beyond, in places like Detroit and Buffalo, people are hurting.
It will only feel good for a day but wouldn't it be fine to watch Jim Kelly, the Bills quarterback, cut up a defense with more specialists than the Pentagon has consultants? To see Cornelius Bennett, a linebacker, crush a Redskins back running the counter-trey, which is about as predictable as Congressional junkets and even harder to stop?
The smart money says it won't happen. A conspicuous exception is John Gotti, who said that he would bet on the Bills. But, then, he has his own reasons for holding a grudge against Washington. Anybody else who still has enough money to make a bet should probably go with the Redskins. The rest of us will be pulling for the Bills and vicarious vengeance.

HEADLINE: U.N.'S FUND CRISIS WORSENS AS ROLE IN SECURITY RISES

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 26

 BODY:
At a meeting here on Friday, President Bush and the leaders of the 14 other members of the Security Council are expected to call on the United Nations to play a growing role in preserving peace in trouble spots around the globe. But the organization finds itself facing a deepening financial crisis because many of these same member nations are not paying their share for the operations.
The United Nations has been called upon to mount 8 new peacekeeping operations since 1988. In its previous 43 years of existence, since its founding in 1945, there were 13 such operations. This year it is planning ambitious new operations in Cambodia and Yugoslavia involving a total of some 15,000 troops and police personnel. Those operations could double the organization's peacekeeping budget to more than $1 billion. 
 As a result the United States, which pays 30.38 percent of these bills under a formula assessing members according to their wealth, could see its assessment for peacekeeping rise from around $197 million last year to at least $300 million this year.
 
$377 Million Debt
 But no one here knows whether the members will pay the new assessments. The United States and other leading members already owe the United Nations hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid peacekeeping fees. At the end of last year, member nations collectively owed $377 million in overdue peacekeeping assessments. While this debt was less than the record $444.1 million they owed at the end of 1989, the figure still represents the second-highest total on record.
The declaration that Mr. Bush and the others plan to issue this week is full of appeals to expand the organization's peacemaking role, but at present it offers no pledge to pay these unpaid bills. "The world's leaders are coming here to tell us to work harder," said a senior United Nations official who asked not to be identified. "But will they remember their checkbooks?"
 
China Is Paid Up
 The United States remains the biggest single delinquent on peacekeeping, owing $140.9 million at the end of last year.
Of the other four members with permanent Security Council seats, only China, which has the smallest share of the five, had paid its peacekeeping bills in full. Russia, which has taken over the debts and the Security Council seat of the former Soviet Union, owed $126.7 million for peacekeeping at the end of last year, while France owed $10.4 million and Britain $4 million.
Of other leading contributors to the United Nations peacekeeping budget, Germany has an unpaid assessment totaling $17 million, Ukraine owes $12.4 million, Poland $10 million and Italy $5 million.
In addition to unpaid peacekeeping charges, members owed $439.3 million to the organization's regular budget, again the second-highest figure on record, though slightly lower than their cumulative debts at the end of 1989.
These unpaid regular budget contributions worsen the budget crisis, officials say, by tightening the overall financial situation and making it harder to juggle funds between accounts.
 
U.S. Debt $739 Million
 Counting unpaid assessments for the regular budget, including the debt for this year, the United States' total debt now stands at $739.4 million. Not counting this year's assessment, the United States owed $407.3 million as of the end of last year.
These mounting debts have surprised and angered many top United Nations officials because the organization's peacekeeping role has been widely praised by governments and parliaments in recent years. In 1988 the United Nations was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its peacekeeping efforts.
"It is a great irony," Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said before stepping down last month, "that the United Nations is on the brink of insolvency at the very time the world community has entrusted the organization with new and unprecedented responsibilities. It is the member states who must collectively bear the responsibility for this most unfortunate situation."
Sir Brian Urquhart, the former Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping, complained that peacekeeping operations have always been "run on a shoestring" and argued that governments must be prepared "to put adequate resources behind global and regional security systems."
 
Formula for Peacekeeping
 While countries are assessed contributions to the United Nations regular budget according to their wealth, peacekeeping contributions are divided differently, with the five permanent Security Council members paying relatively more because of their special responsibility under the Charter for preserving international security.
So, while the United States pays 25 percent of the regular budget, it pays 30.38 percent of the peacekeeping bills. Similarly, Russia pays 9.41 percent of the budget but 11.44 percent of the peacekeeping costs. The comparable shares for Britain are 5.02 and 6.10 percent; for France 6.oo and 7.29 percent; and for China 0.77 and 0.94 percent.
Calculating the cost of peacekeeping operations year by year is difficult, budget officials say, because the Security Council frequently mandates a force for a portion of a year or for a period bridging parts of two years. Start-up costs also usually increase expenses at the beginning of an operation.
 
Outlay for Cambodia
 But the cost of the new Cambodian peacekeeping operation is informally estimated at $750 million to $1 billion for the first full year. In that case, the United Nations must virtually take over the administration of the country as it organizes elections, in addition to sending troops and police forces.
Start-up costs will be particularly heavy because of the lack of basic infrastructure, like roads, bridges, airstrips and communications destroyed by years of civil war.
As a result, officials believe the United Nations could find itself spending $600 million to $700 million during the remainder of this year in Cambodia alone, assuming the operation gets fully under way by the start of the rainy season in May.
In addition the Security Council is considering sending a 10,000-member force into Yugoslavia to oversee the present fragile cease-fire at a cost estimated at $350 million to $400 million in a full year, bringing the total cost of both operations to about $1 billion. This would be double the roughly $500 million the United Nations spent last year on peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, Kuwait, Western Sahara, Angola, Central America and El Salvador.
 
2 Operations to End
 This year the cost of these seven operations will fall slightly with the Central American observer group's activity scheduled to end in April and the Angola operation scheduled to end in October.
But United Nations peacekeeping costs in El Salvador will rise sharply as its forces start overseeing the new truce and disarmament agreements there.
The United Nations also runs three peacekeeping operations which are not financed through the United Nations peacekeeping accounts.
One of them, the force deployed in Cyprus, costs about $ 31 million a year and is paid for by voluntary contributions from member states. But the United Nations truce observer mission based in Jerusalem and the observer mission on the India-Pakistan border, which together cost another $35 million a year, are paid from funds in the regular budget.

HEADLINE: 'Buy American': Remedy or Tunnel Vision?

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Intended or not, President Bush's trade mission to Japan has now stirred an emotional wave of "buy American" fervor across the recession-pocked land. But economists and trade experts say the movement is a dubious remedy for the underlying ills of the American economy.
Sentiments reached a peak last Wednesday, when the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, after withering public attack, rescinded the $122 million contract it had issued to a Japanese company for new rail cars for a mass transit system. 
 The feelings are being echoed all across the country.
Like a number of companies that are giving their workers inducements to buy American cars, Dr. William Lippy, an ear surgeon in Warren, Ohio, has begun his own campaign, as he put it, to "jump-start America" by offering his 35 employees bonuses to buy used or new American cars by July 4.
In Edwardsville, Ill., Bill Chartrand is offering a 2-cent-a-gallon discount to drivers of American cars at his Fina gas station. "I didn't do it to punish foreign-car owners," said Mr. Chartrand, who drives a 1990 Chevrolet pickup. "I did it to reward the American car owner."
Here in Los Angeles, the City Council is considering a bill that would give American companies preferences in bidding for municipal contracts. The legislation would alter the City Charter, which currently requires Los Angeles to award its contracts to the lowest bidder.
But not everyone is angry at Japan.
John Bragg, a Tennessee state lawmaker who served on the negotiating team that lured Nissan to his state, does not think much of the buy-American movement. It's little more than "Japan bashing," he said, adding: "What it all is is politics and perception. The fact is, the British and Germans don't buy any American cars. We don't fuss with them."
And whether "buy American" gestures will do much good, even in the short run, is at the very least questionable, commerce experts say.
 
Would Tactic Backfire?
 Some fear a protectionist trade war that would depress American exports to Japan, including motion pictures, music recordings and apparel, three products that find a particularly lucrative market among the Japanese.
"We have to be careful, because whether people realize it or not we are joined at the hip with Japan here in Los Angeles," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation, a private group trying to stimulate a Southern California economy depressed by the slowdown in the nation's military spending.
Further, experts say, American consumers will be unwilling or unable to sustain any buy-American fervor for long, in part because many continue to believe in Japanese manufacturing superiority, but also because it is becoming increasingly difficult to say with certainty that one product is American, another Japanese. "A General Motors car can have more Japanese components than a Japanese car," said David B. Friedman, an expert on Japanese-American trade relations at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif.
 
The Lines Are Blurred
 Never was this kind of confusion better illustrated than last week in Greece, N.Y., a Rochester suburb, where the Town Board voted against buying a used Komatsu dirt excavator, the cheapest available alternative, in favor of an American-made excavator. Then the board learned that the Komatsu excavator had been made in the United States, and that a John Deere model under consideration had been made in Japan. Both were the products of American-Japanese joint ventures.
Indeed, numerous experts doubt that consumers can tell the difference anymore between American and foreign products. For example, Mitsubishi big-screen televisions sold in American showrooms are assembled in a factory in Santa Ana, Calif., from parts that are partly domestic, partly foreign, but with a crew of 687 American workers.
About 40 percent of the cars sold under Honda, Toyota,Nissan and other Japanese names are actually made in the United States. Workers at such plants in Smyrna, Tenn.; Marysville, Ohio, and Fremont, Calif., are concerned that the buy-American campaign will cost them jobs.
The confusion was apparent Friday afternoon outside Adray's, a discount appliance store in Los Angeles. Albert Williams, 66 years old, was loading two new Pioneer stereo speakers into his Oldsmobile Cutlass. "I can't say much about it, because I don't know where they're made," he said. "Pioneer's American, isn't it?" When told it was a Japanese product, he said, "It sounds American."
A few moments later, Basil W. Barnes emerged with a big Zenith television set, saying he had bought it rather than a Japanese-made Sony "to wave the flag a little." The Zenith Electronics Corporation of Glenview, Ill., is the only American-owned television maker. Zenith sets are assembled in Springfield, Mo., and Reynosa, Mexico. But by year's end, all operations will be transferred to Mexico, with a loss of 1,000 jobs in Springfield.
And Fernando C. Coto bought a Sony stereo system at Adray's without compunction. "I just think it's up to the Americans to make it better," he said. "Why should I buy something that's not as good?"
Consumer experts said this is the hard reality that the buy-American campaign will face. David Cross, an economist with the Futures Group, a consulting firm in Washington that specializes in consumer trends, said 25 to 30 percent of the typical consumer's budget went to imported products, directly or indirectly.
And reducing imports, he said, would have the effect of raising prices. "Price resistance in this recession has been extraordinary," he said. "So interest in buying American will collide with the fact that we do not have the money to do that. It's not like we can quickly retool and start producing everything we need domestically."
 
'Errors and Poor Judgment'
 There is paradox in the fact that the most recent buy-American campaign flared in California, a state whose economy is deeply entwined with that of Japan. Mr. Kyser said 600 Japanese companies maintained operations in Southern California, employing 58,000 workers, mostly Americans. He added that Japanese airlines were major purchaser of Boeing jets, whose bodies are made at a Northrop Corporation plant in suburban Hawthorne. And Japan is a big market for the two quintessential California products, motion pictures and recordings.
"There have been errors and poor judgment on both sides," Mr. Kyser said. "If this hysteria continues, it could be painful for Southern California."
But public officials have found themselves under enormous pressure to do something to save American jobs. This poses a predicament for officials of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in San Francisco, who are taking bids for at least 50 new cars for an extension of the 20-year-old line serving San Francisco and the East Bay. The original cars were made by Rohr Industries of Chula Vista, Calif., but Rohr has since quit that business.
An American company and two Japanese consortiums bid. The American company, Morrison Knudsen Corporation of Boise, Idaho, lost the Los Angeles rail bid to the Japanese Sumitomo Corporation of America.
 
Can't Buy Inferior Cars
 The president of the BART board of directors, Wilfred Ussery, said he wanted to favor American companies. But he added: "We cannot buy a product that will downgrade our current system. No one will remember who made the cars in five years if they start breaking down. They'll just blame BART."
At the State Capitol in Sacramento, the Democratic leadership is pushing a bill that would give preference to California companies bidding on $6 billion worth of public works projects. The bill would allow California concerns to bid up to 10 percent higher than the low bid and still get the contract; require a minimum domestic content of at least 51 percent in raw materials, parts and equipment used in each project, and require that on each project at least half the workers be California residents of at least a year. Twenty-six other states already have such in-state bid preferences.
Across the country, companies, labor unions and individual citizens are taking their own grass-roots measures:
*In Grand Rapids, Mich., the Autodie Corporation, a tool and die maker, said it would use American-made supplies whenever possible as retaliation against a Japanese legislator's comments last week that American workers were lazy.
*The 2,500-member Michigan Association of Police, a union that represents police officers and security guards, said that it would try to negotiate a special bonus of 3 percent of an employee's salary to anyone who bought or leased an American car.
*In Alexandria, Va., Jane Crawford reported that business was brisk at her store, America, which sells flags, patriotic memorabilia and other products made entirely in the United States.
But there are also fears that the movement could be self-destructive. In Sparta, Tenn., near Nashville, 4,850 workers produce cars and trucks at the $1.2 billion plant built by the Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation U.S.A. The cars have a Japanese brand name but are built by Americans, using 150 American suppliers. Workers and local officials there are nervous. Mr. Bragg, the lawmaker from nearby Murfreesboro, said Nissan was a good corporate citizen and had generated thousands of Tennessee jobs.
Indeed, some Japanese-Americans see racist overtones in the buy-American movement.
 
'People Are Scared'
 "People are scared and frustrated about the economy, and they want to blame someone," said Mas Fukai, who was interned with his family in Arizona during World War II and is now a top aide to Kenneth Hahn, a Los Angeles County Supervisor.
"Lockheed moved to Georgia, and we're losing 20,000 jobs there," Mr. Fukai said. "Northrop is moving. The General Motors plant in Van Nuys is closing. Why isn't anyone bashing them? We're becoming a target. I'm being asked, 'What are you?' When I say I'm an American, they say, 'You know what I mean.' That has not surfaced since the 40's."
Dennis W. Hayashi, national director of the Japanese American Citizens League in San Francisco, said: "There is an underlying racial animus creeping into the dialogue. Some people don't want to see that the recession has many causes."
Mr. Friedman, of the Rand Corporation, said that the move to bolster domestic products and labor could ultimately be fruitful if localities take the long-term steps needed to build the kind of local industrial networks and ties that exist in Japan. Otherwise, he said, buying American is just "misplaced nationalism" that serves only to reward inefficiency. "One can imagine the worst outcome of this is that Americans will rally to save General Motors from 50 years of past follies."

HEADLINE: Bias Crimes Hold Steady, but Leave Many Scars

SERIES: Hatred Up Close: The Tension in New York -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Their encounters with hatred came as a mellow May day dissolved into evening.
A young black man and his Hispanic girlfriend were talking amicably in a restaurant in the Baychester section of the Bronx. According to a police synopsis, two white men began staring malevolently at them. After a while, one snidely challenged the black man, "What did you say, nigger?" The white man then punched him in the head and shoved his pregnant girlfriend. Before fleeing, the white men warned the black man that the next time they saw him they would kill him. 
 A young Italian man found bigotry scribbled in longhand. One morning last June, he was opening his plant store in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, when he discovered an anonymous note. It read, "Wop bastard, you will burn like your store."
For two young gay men in Forest Hills, Queens, the ear-splitting noise was too much. It was late on a September afternoon, and their neighbor's stereo was shaking the walls. The men wandered downstairs, rapped on their neighbor's door and asked him to lower the volume. The neighbor grew incensed and heckled them using a fusillade of anti-gay epithets.
Three displays of hatred, these cases joined the list of 540 bias crimes recorded last year by the police. There was nothing pretty about any of them, and some were especially abhorrent. But despite this roll of misdeeds against difference -- and a troubling spate of hate incidents in recent weeks -- police statistics show that the number of bias cases in New York City has remained fairly steady over the last four years.
Since as many as 11 of the 540 incidents may be reclassified by a police review panel, the number of bias cases in 1991 was virtually the same as the 527 logged in 1990 and beneath the peak of 550 in 1988. Statistics have been kept only since 1981.
The commander of the Police Department's Bias Incident Investigating Unit, Inspector William T. Wallace, points out that viewed from a historical perspective, bias crimes may well be falling. "People say, 'I don't remember it this bad,' " Inspector Wallace said. "How could they remember? We didn't count these crimes years ago. Why were there all those civil rights marches if things were so hunky-dory in the good old days? In all probability, there were more bias crimes 30 or 40 years ago."
On the other hand, advocacy groups for ethnic, religious and other minorities complain that the police counts underplay the frictions in the city. "I don't believe the police numbers represent reality," said Matt Foreman, executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, who feels attacks on homosexuals are steadily rising. His group tallied more than six times as many offenses against gay people last year as the police listed.
 
Effects
Visible Results Appear Small
 Even small numbers of hate crimes reflect poorly on society. Still, an examination of the incidents reported last year indicates that many defy facile labels, mixed up as they often are in matters of turf and class and economic jealousy, and that most are less serious -- at least on the surface -- than the sprinkling that become encased in publicity.
All in all, last year's episodes varied enormously in severity, from the 140 incidents of phone calls and letters laced with slurs to the 11 swastikas painted on synagogues and homes of Jewish families to the 40 assaults on homosexuals to the three homicides, one of which seems certain to be reclassified.
Most of the 540 cases did not involve physical injury. The three murders and 146 assaults were 28 percent of the total. There are almost that many assaults every day in New York, and Inspector Wallace said that most of the bias-related ones resulted in minor cuts and bruises.
Nevertheless, victims say that bias crimes often wound the psyche more than the body and leave a residue of painful distrust and fitful dreams. And the sting is felt by whole groups of people of similar faith, race or sexual preference.
 
'My Son Had Nightmares'
 "You do not forget," said Yitzchak Bitton, who with his 12-year-old son was beaten by black teen-agers in Crown Heights last summer. "My son had nightmares about being attacked for months. When he's outside, he's always afraid, always scared. It's on his mind every minute when he walks the streets."
A gay man who spoke on the condition of anonymity said he carried a .38-caliber pistol while out alone at night ever since he and his companion were pummeled last October by four men in the West Village. "This has had such negative impacts on my life that I can't tell you," he said. "I'm really paranoid."
Every year seems to have one or two signature events that captivate the media, politicians and citizens and result in a flurry of retaliation and imitation. In 1991, two dramas in Brooklyn overshadowed the year.
In July, a real-estate office in Canarsie was firebombed for showing properties to blacks, touching off a wave of racial disturbances. In August in the Crown Heights section, Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old black child, was accidentally killed by a car driven by a Hasidic man who was part of a rabbi's motorcade. In a later melee involving bands of black youths, Yankel Rosenbaum, a 29-year-old Hasidic scholar, was stabbed to death.
 
Incidents Rose After Fire
 Before the firebombing, bias crimes tracked by the police in 1991 were running 23 percent below 1990. After the disturbances, incidents rose to more than 25 percent above the level for the same period in 1990. Twenty-one bias incidents plagued Crown Heights in just the three days after the deaths. The bias unit logged 79 bias cases in September -- the most in a single month since the unit was formed in December 1980 -- most of them anti-Semitic incidents. The previous high was 77, in October 1989 after the killing of a 16-year-old black youth, Yusuf K. Hawkins, in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
On the evening after the Crown Heights deaths, as the neighborhood's streets rocked with anger, Buruch Hoffinger was on the brink of safety. Hurrying home from his job at a book publisher, he was nearing his door when, he said, four black teen-agers spied him and shouted, "There's a Jew." Stones and a brick came flying at him. The brick opened a gash on his right temple. After he washed up, he called the police but, since he was unable to give a precise description, no arrests were made.
"I never felt comfortable for months after that," Mr. Hoffinger said. "I was boiling anger at the injustice and the stupidity of it all. I was attacked because I had a beard and wore a hat -- just that. I'll never be over it. I feel very sad. I feel bad that people don't know God. They don't know his unity. They don't know his love. They choose to live in a shanty rather than a mansion."
Immediately afterward, he gathered up a cache of stones and stashed them beneath his car seat. "If somebody threw rocks at me again," he said, "they would get a surprise."
The stones are still there. As they click against each other whenever he drives down the street, up wells the past.
 
Causes
War, TV Account Or New Neighbor
 Evildoing happens everywhere. Hate crimes, according to the bias unit, often spring up in neighborhoods in the throes of transformation and in poor areas, but, as Inspector Wallace said, "No neighborhood is exempt."
Last year, Brooklyn experienced 205 incidents, Manhattan had 132 (many of them attacks on homosexuals in Greenwich Village), Queens had 102, Staten Island had 61 and the Bronx, the borough with the highest murder rate, trailed with 40. The small number in the Bronx, Inspector Wallace says, may stem in part from a seeming reluctance by Hispanic immigrants and other residents to report crimes. Anti-bias groups say that many non-English-speaking residents in poor neighborhoods mistrust the police, feel that nothing will come of reporting crimes, and don't want to get involved.
The biggest percentage increase over 1990 -- a jump of more than 90 percent -- occurred on Staten Island. The reasons for the surge are cloudy, though Mr. Wallace said there were anti-Jewish and anti-Arab incidents during the Persian Gulf war.
Most of the Staten Island cases did not lead to physical injury, said Deputy Inspector William Calhoun, chief of detectives there. Many, he said, were insulting phone calls to Jews. "These are random calls where people want to say something clever for that night's fun," he said.
Most reported incidents appear to be crimes by the young against the young. The bias unit said that more than 60 percent of the criminals were under 20, as were an equal percentage of the victims. Hate crimes are often meant to be symbolic, and nearly 100 targets were edifices -- synagogues, churches, businesses and cemeteries.
Last July, for instance, four fires erupted at the Yeshiva Kerem Schlomo in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn. Three pentagrams and offensive scribblings like "Hail Satan" were discovered in the main service room and basement. The school had extensive damage. There have been no arrests.
Thus far, 183 arrests have been made in 1991's 540 cases, some of them multiple arrests in a single incident. Inspector Wallace said that arrests occurred in roughly 20 percent of the cases, and in another 5 percent or so victims changed their minds about pursuing a prosecution.
 
Underreporting Is Suspected
 Advocacy groups for minorities feel certain that as with rapes, only a small number of bias crimes are reported. Howard Ehrlich, director of research at the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, said that probably 80 percent of incidents are not reported, chiefly because victims feel nothing will be done. Asians, in particular, are said to be loath to report bias incidents, partly because of language and cultural barriers. The police logged only eight bias crimes against Chinese and Koreans last year. Many homosexuals, especially those more private about their lives, do not report incidents, nor do illegal immigrants.
The largest category of bias crimes last year involved race -- 247. Of those, 121 were aimed at blacks, 70 at whites, 38 at Hispanic people, 10 at East Indians, 6 at Chinese and 2 at Koreans. Far more often than not, they were unfair acts -- a group of four to several dozen against one or two victims.
Who knows what exactly set them off? Two Hispanic girls, one 17 and one 21, were standing at the corner of 208th Street and Hillside Avenue in Queens Village on an April afternoon when a group of nine black teen-agers -- eight women and one man -- came by. According to the police account, one of the blacks said, 'Oh, those white people. What are you looking at, white bitches?" The two girls were then roughed up and slightly injured.
Of the 178 crimes last year directed against religious conviction, all but six were against Jews. "It shows the scourge of anti-Semitism remains very much part of our society," said Michael Riff, associate director of the New York regional office of the Anti-Defamation League.
In May, a Holocaust survivor was featured in an article in The New York Post. Shortly afterward, the police said he said he got an anonymous letter in the mail laced with anti-Semitic remarks and threats.
There were 88 reported anti-gay crimes in 1991, down slightly from 1990, when a summerlong string of attacks caused reported cases to more than double to 101. Of the 88 last year, 40 were assaults, nearly a third of the total reported bias assaults.
 
Chances
Hate and Ill Luck Are Irrational Pair
 To a large extent, hate crimes do not follow a script, but are spontaneous attacks, touched off by the wrong person's running into the wrong people. Supporting this is the choice of weapons, often fists and feet or whatever might be lying on the street -- bottles, tree branches, fluorescent light bulbs. In May, a young gay man was walking down a Manhattan street when another man grabbed a placard and yelled at him, "I'm going to kill all you fags."
He missed. Others didn't.
Eric Torrez's date with hatred came just a short way from home. Toward midnight on an evening last March, the 30-year-old gay man was strolling home from a friend's place. As he neared his apartment in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, he spotted four youths between the ages of 15 and 20. He knew them from the neighborhood and from the disparaging remarks they had made to him before.
He said they went up to him and, after a brief exchange, began pummeling him with their fists. As they did, he said, they chanted, "Beat the homo, beat the homo."
Mr. Torrez said he had a chipped tooth, a black eye and other bruises. He flagged down a patrol car. Eventually, three of the suspects were arrested and two were tried on charges of assault. One was acquitted and one received a 45-day jail term.
"I don't go out as much as I used to now," he said. "If I have to walk down that block, I do it in the daytime. If I see a group of young boys, I cross the street. I won't go into the crowd."
Next: Experts say the surge in bias crimes in New York City this month is actually a predictable phenomenon that has happened several times in recent years.

HEADLINE: In New York, State Prisoners Work or Else

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
New York State's prison system has quietly imposed one of the nation's toughest mandatory work policies, locking inmates who refuse work in their cells for 23 hours a day and then blackballing them when they come up for parole.
The new work policy was put in place over the last year when 1,071 inmates were locked in their cells until they agreed to work and another 267 had their privileges restricted, state correction officials said. 
 The officials also said lesser penalties are imposed on inmates who refused to enroll in education and vocational programs.
The tough new approach has raised concerns among prisoners' rights groups. But New York correction officials say it reflects their intent to achieve three objectives: force inmates to help pay the $25,000-a-year costs of imprisoning them, prepare them more effectively to hold jobs after their release, and counter a growing feeling among some segments of the public that prisons have become much too easy for inmates.
"I've been troubled for years by the public perception that inmates sit around all day watching TV or pumping iron while the average guy is trying hard to make ends meet," said Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, Commissioner of the State Department of Correctional Services. "We fully intend to change the perception of inmates getting a free ride."
"We have a basic responsibility to teach inmates how to read and write," he said in a telephone interview. "Just as important, inmates have the responsibility to help support the cost of their incarceration."
Many states including New Jersey and Connecticut, and the Federal prison system, have adopted stronger work policies. But New York's new mandatory requirements are regarded by correction experts as among the toughest in the nation, because of the severity of the penalties if inmates refuse to work, said George Camp, co-president of the Criminal Justice Institute, a private group that studies penal institutions. Most states with any penalties at all for refusing to work curtail privileges or time off for good behavior.
In New York, when inmates are locked up for refusing to work, they eat in their cells and are allowed out one hour a day for exercise.
Of New York's 58,155 state inmates, 27,967 are enrolled in work programs that vary from cleaning and painting jobs to making license plates, building office furniture and producing cleaning supplies. Another 19,577 are in education, vocational, and various treatment programs. There are 3,146 unemployed. The rest are involved in various other programs, in hospitals, or are restricted for reasons like security.
Robert Gangi, head of the Correctional Association of New York, a private organization that studies prison and criminal justice issues, is highly critical of the penalties used to force inmates to work: "It's Draconian," he said. "We don't treat animals in a zoo that way."
Mr. Gangi also contended that the state's new policies were "nothing more than a public relations effort to show how tough the state is going to be with inmates."
Law-enforcement groups, however, generally support the new push. Thomas Reppetto, the head of the Citzens Crime Commission, which describes itself as a private watchdog over criminal justice issues, said he favored the new approach. "It's a good idea to require inmates to work and pay their own way," he said.
 
Bringing Back Work Gangs
 Mr. Coughlin said a natural progression for his department's new emphasis on work would be the reinstitution of old-fashioned inmate work gangs that fell into public disfavor in the past.
Inmates now perform a limited number of tightly supervised outside work tasks, mostly in upstate rural areas where the public has become accustomed to their presence.
But Mr. Coughlin said he is preparing to expand the concept widely, organizing even more tightly supervised work gangs to clean up littered railroad lines and highways, the state's parks and beaches and even sections of New York's inner cities.
"They would be doing work that is not being done and which will not be done without them," he said, anticipating the promised opposition of public unions who view any outside work by inmates as an economic threat.
 
Important Factor in Parole
 Under a law approved by the Legislature in 1987, inmates can acquire an Earned Eligibility Certificate in return for participating successfully in education, vocation and work programs. The certificate strongly counts in an inmate's favor when applying for parole, and strongly against him when he lacks it.
David Ernst, a spokesman for the State Division of Parole, said inmates who appear for a parole hearing with the certificate have an 80 percent chance of being released, while the chances of inmates who do not have a certificate are reduced to 33 percent.
"The certificate is a powerful work incentive," Mr. Ernst said.
"Proof positive," said Commissioner Coughlin, "is that 67 percent of inmates are now gaining parole at their first hearing, compared with 60 percent before the eligibility certificate was introduced."
The idea of putting inmates to work began in New York 160 years ago at the state prison in Auburn. But the practice fell in disfavor in the late 19th century amid scandals involving the exploitation of convicts and later with the widespread revulsion at the cruelty and deprivation of Southern chain gangs.
 
Reducing Prison Costs
 In recent years, factories and workshops that produce far more than state license plates have been established at 15 prisons. It is on this manufacturing base that the department wants to superimpose a better trained inmate work force to reduce the costs of imprisonment at a time when prison budgets are being cut.
For example, inmates produce a complete line of office furniture, metal cabinets and cleaning supplies for state and local government agencies. They are also providing more services to the agencies and to nonprofit groups, jobs that include reconstruction, painting and upkeep.
For this they are paid 60 cents a day at the start and ultimately 65 cents an hour for a normal 40-hour workweek. Prisoners are required to enter educational and vocational programs before joining work programs.
In his State of the State message this month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed a wide variety of inmate work initiatives, including the establishment of a Prison Industries Corporation.
 
'Giving Something Back'
 "The Governor strongly supports that idea of inmates giving something back to the community," said Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo.
The Federal Government is also encouraging inmates to work. Daniel Dunne, a spokesman for the United States Bureau of Prisons, said that if an inmate refuses to work he risks being confined to solitary, losing "good time" that otherwise would have been subtracted from his sentence, and any chance of entering an early work-release program.
James Stabile, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Corrections, which has 20,000 inmates, said inmates are not required to work. But if they refuse, he said they lose "good time" credit and any chance at early work-release.
William Flower, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Correction, which has about 9,500 inmates, said that if an inmate declines work, his refusal is referred unfavorably to parole officials. But he said that the department does not have enough jobs to put most inmates to work and that many prisoners consequently "lay up" all day without performing any tasks.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Kerrey Moves to Reinvigorate Campaign

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Senator Bob Kerrey has not been having as much fun running for President as he thought he would.
Asked why not, as he sat the other night drinking a draft beer and eating popcorn in an airport bar in Houston, the Democrat from Nebraska offered his whimsical smile and replied, "Cosmic forces." 
 Later, he elaborated. "I mean that there are many things I don't control," he said. "I'm just saying that I don't believe that there are people in the heavens who are doing anything other than laughing at times at my foolishness."
Welcome to the first Presidential campaign with an air of Pirandello, an absurdist adventure marked by ironic detachment, existential angst, black humor and, believe it or not, a vow of celibacy.
 
How to Catch Up
 "Cosmic Bob," as the Senator is known in political circles because of his offbeat style, has been trying to figure out a way to catch up with "Slick Willie," as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is known for his smooth patter.
With a more focused attitude and a new campaign team, Mr. Kerrey is hoping to make the most of the fresh attention that will come his way as Mr. Clinton struggles with questions about his personal life. Although Mr. Kerrey's strategists have been careful not to gloat for the record over the rival camp's stumble, they are clearly eager to profit from the fact that the Democratic race once again seems fluid.
Hailed early by the press as a 48-year-old combination of Sir Lancelot and James Dean, Mr. Kerrey faded through the fall with flat performances, a vague agenda, except for his health insurance plan, and an overreliance on his war record. Faced with a renewed opportunity, Mr. Kerrey's response so far is not to offer the missing details of how he would govern but to try to persuade Democrats that details are a trivial pursuit and that he is not their man unless they want to make a leap of faith.
 
'You've Got to Fight for It'
 "I am not a bookkeeper," he said, in an interview in Washington last week, referring to Mr. Clinton's promotion of himself as a seasoned manager with an economic plan. "I am not a person who has any desire to come forward and say, 'Here's a cabinet full of smooth-moving drawers.'
"I'm going to try to drive out the idea that this is just about nominating someone who's electable. You either are or you are not in politics because you want to change the world. I do not, in a very personal way, believe that good all by itself conquers evil. You've got to fight for it."
Mr. Kerrey is trying to make a virtue of vagueness, arguing that his status as a work in progress, an unfinished politician, could be a strength as President.
He said he carried with him a book by Albert Schweitzer that explained why it was good not to have all the answers. "Schweitzer says that real learning doesn't occur unless you are in an attitude of humility," Mr. Kerrey said. "And that's extremely difficult as a politician.
 
Shines in Small Settings
 By the standards of modern campaigning, Mr. Kerry can be amiable and witty in small settings. On a trip to Berlin in northern New Hampshire, he charmed hard-boiled reporters by talking excitedly about how his motel bed featured the "Magic Fingers" massage machine and asking an aide to come up and check out the shaking bed.
Mr. Kerrey was asked what he did for fun outside of politics with a warning that Michael S. Dukakis had answered the question, "Black mulch," speaking of fertilizing his tomato plants. Mr. Kerrey replied with a twinkle: "Black Mulch. I have some of their albums."
While he affects the sing-song Kennedy cadences in speeches, Mr. Kerrey has not shown the potent charisma of John F. Kennedy, which Democrats seek like the Holy Grail. At one of Mr. Kerrey's appearances a large number of Dartmouth students left a less-than-scintillating session early to go to a screening of "J. F. K."
Mr. Kerrey often seems more like wry observer than eager candidate. With large blue eyes and a lightbulb-shaped head that give him the look of a bemused extraterrestial, he continues to maintain an unusual Jamesian distance from his campaign.
Even on an unscheduled stop at an American Legion Post in Manchester last week, surrounded by admiring Vietnam veterans who greeted him as "a brother," Mr. Kerrey did not seem to fit into the scene easily. With a military cap perched on his head and a beer, Mr. Kerrey chatted rather awkwardly with some of the men around the bar.
 
Learning How to Shout
 He asked Bill Genesee, 38 years old, who was describing his job at the Raytheon Corporation making missiles, "When you walk past sheet metal, wouldn't you like to get out and bang it?"
Stung by criticism that he was too diffident, Mr. Kerrey has been trying to convey urgency by adding a life-and-death message to his speeches and speaking in a louder voice.
"People would come up and say, 'You just don't seem to want this badly enough, because you're not shouting at us,' " So now I'm given to shouting, and it's not my favorite voice," he said.
Mr. Kerrey's aides tend to watch him nervously, knowing that he sometimes says things that are more Brecht than boilerplate.
In response to a question about Sidney Blumenthal's New Republic cover articles on "The Politics of Self: Bob Kerrey's Shallow Campaign" and "The Anointed, Bill Clinton, Party Favorite," Mr. Kerrey laughingly suggested that he would like to "loosen one of his teeth," a move that he told others would wipe away Mr. Blumenthal's "preppy little smile."
 
'Close to the Edge'
 "He does skate close to the edge," a strategist for Mr. Kerrey, Michael McCurry, said. "But sometimes I think he says things that provoke reactions just to remind himself that he's not a conventional politician, to remind himself, 'If you're not careful, you're going to wind up like Bill Clinton.' "
Mr. Kerrey's strategists see his problem as how to convince people that he is different but reassure them that he is not too different. People may snicker at Vice President Dan Quayle's reading Paul Johnson's "Modern Times," a history of the 20th century, for three years, according to what he and his aides tell reporters. But it may also make voters nervous when Mr. Kerrey says one of his favorite books is Walker Percy's "Moviegoer," an anthem of alienation about a Korean War veteran out of touch with the rest of America.
Mr. Kerrey agrees that sometimes his aides are right when they warn him with the "time out" hand signal. "I can keep a little line on the reel," he said. "I don't need to put it all out there."
Mr. Kerrey presents his character, shaped by war and wounds, as the reason why voters should put faith in his leadership.
As a candidate, John F. Kennedy let Red Fay and other aides brag about his war record as a fighter, while he discreetly avoided the topic. But Mr. Kerrey still begins speeches with lines like this one to an A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting in Austin last week: "Let me start off by saying that in spite of the fact that I left a little of myself over in Vietnam, there's a hell of a lot left to be able to drive George Bush and Danforth Quayle out of that White House."
Mr. Kerrey suggested that some reporters who had criticized him for talking too much about his war record were "feeling this enormous guilt themselves, because they didn't do anything" in the war.
He said he did not mind that many men in his generation chose to avoid going to war. "It doesn't bother me deeply," he said. "But when there's dishonesty, it does. When Quayle first had his trouble in 1988, I defended him. But when he asserted that he got into the National Guard in order to go to Vietnam, he lost me completely. That was a lie. He didn't get into the Guard in order to get in Vietnam.
"But what I do object to is now when they come and give this golden reason for why they really wanted to go to Vietnam. Bill Clinton does that a little. I mean, come on, there were a lot of us who didn't want to go to Vietnam."
In speeches, Mr. Kerrey obliquely scores Mr. Clinton for making "personal responsibility" a campaign theme, implying that his own nine months in a Navy hospital in Philadelphia learning how to walk again imbued him with moral superiority. "I understand the nature of personal responsibility," he tells audiences. "I'm the one, since I was injured, that had to learn how to walk, learn how to run, how to do the things I wanted to do."
In conversations with friends, he denigrates Mr. Clinton as lacking conscience, complaining that the Governor of Arkansas had made too many political compromises trying to make everyone happy.
"I have learned the necessity of developing a conscience and of letting that conscience speak to you," Mr. Kerrey said. "The ground for my campaign isn't a position paper or a policy institute. The ground is my conscience."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey had a tiff after Mr. Clinton had made a commercial criticizing Mr. Kerrey for voting for the Congressional pay raise. Mr. Kerrey noted that Mr. Clinton had the perquisites of the Governor's office. Mr. Clinton shot back that Mr. Kerrey, too, had "lived in the Governor's mansion."
"There were a lot of stories written about it," Mr. Clinton.
Privately, Mr. Kerrey was furious at Mr. Clinton's apparent reference to his relationship with Debra Winger, the actress. He told people that he was single and free to do as he pleased and that Mr. Clinton had a nerve mentioning it.
 
Decision Not to Date
 Even before reports about an extramarital affair by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Kerrey said he had decided that he could not date during his campaign, even though he had been divorced from his wife, Beverly Defnall, for 14 years. They had been married for four years.
He said he believed that in a political season when voters quickly sketched in portraits he could not take the risk. "People do not know who Bob Kerrey is, and I don't want them to be reading stories about who it is that I'm dating and trying to figure out who I am," he said.
Although Mr. Kerrey would like to present himself as the candidate of conscience, the politician who embodies the idealism and skepticism of the 60's and who hates expediency and trade-offs, that message keeps running into sharp questions about own values, business practices and conflicting positions.
At the St. Paul's Academy in Concord, N.H., Mr. Kerrey received a bristling reception from students who wanted to know how he could emphasize national health insurance when the part-time workers in his restaurant chain did not have health insurance.
On "Meet the Press" on NBC News Mr. Kerrey delivered a stumbling response on abortion, as he tried to explain that his switch from opponent to proponent.
 
Questions on Death Penalty
 In 1982 Mr. Kerrey said in a letter to Nebraska State Senator Bernice Labedz that he believed "the unborn to be human life and entitled to all the protections the state can legally offer for the preservation of life."
He added that the "death and destruction of young men that I led in battle" in Vietnam had helped shape his decision.
But on Saturday, Mr. Kerrey was asked about the death penalty by former Manhattan Borough President Percy E. Sutton, now an executive in Harlem. Mr. Sutton, at a candidates' forum sponsored by the Rainbow Coalition in Washington, asked how Mr. Kerrey could support the death penalty, in light of the fact that he had talked about seeing young men die in Vietnam and that "so many people who are poor are not given the opportunity to have proper representation."
"Death is final, isn't it?" Mr. Sutton asked Mr. Kerrey in just the sort of question that the candidate of existential angst might have enjoyed in a different setting.

HEADLINE: In Pittsburgh, Laid-Off Workers to Cook Up Civic Pride Along With Bread

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Here in Steel Town, which lost 100,000 manufacturing jobs over the last decade, the start of a new bakery is being heralded with as much hoopla as a new sports team. Workers are preparing to brand the city's north side with the bakery's neon sign, 14 feet high, 136 feet long and visible from the moon. It will say, "City Pride Bakery: The Bakery With a Heart."
Experts say City Pride is the nation's first start-up of a major manufacturing company intended to be owned in full eventually by its employees, almost all of whom are being hired from welfare rolls and long-term unemployment lines. Many of its workers hadlost their old jobs when the city's last commercial bakery closed in 1989 and organized to obtain government loans and private investments to establish the $9 million company. 
 "What City Pride is doing is very, very unusual," said Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a nonprofit research organization in Oakland, Calif. Although there are about 10,000 employee-owned companies, he said he knew of no other case where laid-off workers built a major new factory after an old one had closed.
City Pride is also unusual in its intent to provide jobs to people who need them the most in Pittsburgh. And the bakery plans to offer high school courses, free child care and subsidized lunches to its unionized worker-owners. When a group of City Pride's investors and workers gathered to talk about the company's mission, the hotel meeting room overflowed with idealism, spiritual talk and visions of a humanitarian workplace.
 
'A Sense of Ownership'
 "We're going to take responsibility for teaching people to purge themselves of the lack of hope that they have had for so long," said Daniel R. Curtis, City Pride's president. "We're going to give them a sense of ownership."
The bakery, scheduled to open in March, may also create a model for other cities struggling to hold onto manufacturing jobs and factories.
"I would love to do this in Detroit, Atlanta or New York," said Mr. Curtis, 58 years old, who has spent 35 years in the bakery business. "How could any supermarket chain in the country turn down a quality product, competitively priced, that helps the community?"
At least one chain agrees. Even before the bakery had an oven, it had a customer in Giant Eagle Supermarkets. The chain, the largest in the Pittsburgh area with over 100 stores, sells nearly half of the $102 million worth of bread sold annually here, and nearly half that bread is sold under the store's own label.
Dissatisfied with its out-of-state bakeries, Giant Eagle has agreed to give its private-label business to City Pride, which promised to provide a wider range of breads at a lower cost. With that commitment, City Pride instantly obtained more than twice as much business as it needed to turn a profit.
"We had the opportunity to bring jobs and a commercial bakery back to Pittsburgh," said Joseph R. Faccenda, the senior vice president of Giant Eagle, a privately held company. "And it gives us the opportunity to expand the variety of bakery products we can offer at lower prices under our own Giant Eagle label."
The Penn Traffic Company, which has 90 convenience stores and supermarkets in the area, has also agreed to buy City Pride bread. And over the past year, a volunteer sales force led by the unemployed bakery workers obtained verbal bread orders from hundreds of neighborhood groceries, pizza shops, hospitals, university cafeterias and Pittsburgh's public schools.
City Pride also plans to distribute frozen bakery products nationally and internationally, and the company estimates that first-year sales of $37 million could eventually grow to more than $100 million a year.
City Pride's primary marketing strategy -- to provide local supermarkets with fresh bread in the store's own wrapper -- fits into two national trends in the food business. Supermarkets are trying to increase profits and build customer loyalty by stocking shelves with their own private-label brands. Sales of private-label products last year grew by 6 percent, nearly twice as fast as overall supermarket sales, according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago market research firm.
But while the demand for private-label bread is increasing, the wholesale bakery industry is consolidating. The number of commercial bakeries has shrunk from 3,000 in 1972 to fewer than 500 highly automated plants today. With fewer bakeries, serving stores from greater distances, supermarket owners say, the bakery industry is less able to meet the need for custom breads.
Pittsburgh got caught up in the industry consolidation when its sole commercial bakery, Braun Baking, was purchased by Continental Baking Company and later on, in 1984, Continental was bought by Ralston-Purina. Continental has since closed about 20 plants, including Braun.
City, county and state agencies tried to keep the bakery in town and its 110 workers employed by offering Continental a package of benefits, including a low-rent lease on a new factory, reduced utility charges and real estate taxes. The company rejected the offer and now ships bread to Pittsburgh from its bakeries in Columbus and Akron, Ohio.
"When the laid-off workers saw that Continental rejected that offer, they said, 'Why can't we get the same deal?' and, to some degree, they got it," said Tom Croft, executive director of the Steel Valley Authority, a local economic development organization that, along with the bakers' union and the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority, coordinated the City Pride project.
 
From Laid Off to Lobbyists
 The laid-off Braun workers became lobbyists, obtaining public commitments that now total $2.6 million. The largest ones include $500,000 in Federal grants for job training, $1.1 million in state loans and grants and $560,000 in loans from the city and the county.
"The reason we got this far is that 62 of us stuck together and kept pushing the project along," said Joseph P. Zajac, a former Braun employee who has lead the workers' effort to establish a new bakery.
The group of workers hired Mr. Curtis, who suggested that the new company make private-label bread. The workers also had to find a management team, develop a business plan and obtain lots of private investment. Church groups, from far and near, were among the earliest to invest, providing a total of $315,000, while more than a dozen business and individual investors, including Pittsburgh's major banks, have invested about $6.5 million.
The bakery will start off with about 100 employees -- including about 40 from the plant that closed -- who will own 10 percent of the business. The number of employees is expected to increase to 300 over the next five years, by which time the workers would be in a position to buy the remainder of the company from the private investors.
While construction workers are completing City Pride's new building and assembling its 120-foot-long ovens, the company's search for new business continues. "People in Pittsburgh are very loyal and you get the feeling that people want the bakery to do very well," said Ralph A. Angel, City Pride's marketing director.
Mr. Angel is an example of City Pride's desire to employ those who have had difficulty in finding jobs. Mr. Angel, who is 41 years old, was blinded in a car accident and, for two years before being hired by City Pride, had been unable to find full-time work. He makes his pitch to potential customers accompanied by a seeing-eye German shepherd named Otto.
"He is the best salesman any bakery could have," Mr. Angel said.

HEADLINE: Fast Data-Storage Systems Are EMC's Big Opportunity
BYL>By JOHN MARKOFF

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOPKINTON, Mass.

 BODY:
For more than a year the computer industry has been eagerly anticipating a ground-breaking new product code-named Iceberg from Storage Technology Inc., the disk-drive maker.
The new system will chain together dozens of small disk drives like a team of huskies pulling a sled, to give them greater speed and more reliability in storing data. But it is not due out until the second half of this year. Storage Technology will formally announce the system on Jan. 28. 
 In the meantime, customers hungering for greater speed and reliability in their computer storage systems are increasingly turning to the EMC Corporation. The upstart high-technology company, based here, began offering a similar product 15 months ago. And customers are giving it enthusiastic reviews.
"It's a big money saver," said Philip Balcom, manager of information services planning and technology at J. I. Case, the Racine, Wis., maker of tractors and industrial equipment.
Purchases by Case and others have helped push EMC's revenues to $232 million in 1991, from $171 million in 1990. The company has said it expects to report fourth-quarter 1991 earnings of about $4.5 million, up from $3.3 million a year earlier. Several analysts have named the company's shares their 1992 stock pick of the year. The share price has jumped from $6 in September to a close of $13.75 on Friday. Last week, EMC announced a $44 million agreement with the Unisys Corporation to permit the mainframe computer maker to market EMC's disk drives.
"We have to pinch ourselves sometimes," said Michael L. Schoonover, who head's EMC's manufacturing operations. "Many of us have neighbors who have lost their homes." A notable exception to most of the battered New England economy, EMC employs more than 1,100 workers and has openings for 60 more jobs.
EMC provides a striking example of how a small American company, with careful strategic planning and attention to manufacturing detail, can succeed by finding profitable high-technology niches with huge growth potential.
 
Making Its Mark in Memory
 EMC found its spot in the market by adding a huge number of computer memory chips to an array of disk drives for storing data. Modern computers typically have several different kinds of memory or storage. Chip memory is generally high speed, but data vanishes when power is switched off. Magnetic disk memory is slower, but stores data permanently.
EMC combines both kinds of memory to get higher performance with greater reliability. The memory contained on chips in its system acts as a special high-speed buffer between the computer and the disk. During operation, software stores information in the buffer and can retrieve it much more quickly than if it must come directly from the slower magnetic disks. Furthermore, because the system uses groups of disks, the failure of one disk is not fatal because other disks fill in for the damaged one, increasing overall reliability.
"There is no doubt that disk arrays will be a very attractive market in the coming years," said Van Brady, a stock market analyst at Presidio Management in San Francisco.
 
Users Include Banks and Airlines
 Customers requiring such performance include businesses that must maintain and continually draw upon vast data bases of information, like banks and airlines. Indeed, the companies to which EMC shipped 325 of its Symettrix arrays so far include Security Pacific and Delta Air Lines.
Still, within the computer industry, EMC remains all but invisible in an environment still governed almost entirely by an older technology of disk drives pioneered by I.B.M.
"We sometimes call the Symettrix our Stealth disk drive," said Michael Ruettgers, EMC's chief executive. Mr. Ruettgers was a manager at the Raytheon Company and worked on the Patriot missile project before entering the computer industry. He worked at several computer companies and two years ago joined EMC, which was founded in the early 1980's as a maker of memory boards and later expanded into disk drives.
The disk drive business is growing at more than 25 percent a year as large corporations rely increasingly on huge corporate data centers in running their businesses. Moreover, I.B.M. still controls more than 60 percent of the business. But its large expensive drives are coming under attack from the arrays of inexpensive personal-computer-sized drives sold by EMC, among others.
In making only a few big drives for each mainframe, the International Business Machines Corporation has found that its costs of producing disks have remained relatively high. EMC, on the other hand, is buying small disks off the shelf from manufacturers that produce them for personal computers and work stations; combined into arrays, the drives can work with a mainframe.
Currently, disk array technology -- known as Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks, or RAID -- is being offered principally by I.B.M.'s competitors as a higher-performance alternative to I.B.M.'s larger drives. But that is certain to change. Already the Compaq Computer Corporation has sold thousands of simple arrays for its server systems that act as data libraries on business networks of desktop computers.
I.B.M. is not expected to introduce its own disk arrays for the commercial market until 1994, and its Japanese competitors Hitachi and Fujitsu appear to be waiting for I.B.M. before offering their own compatible versions. But I.B.M. has already introduced its first array product for the scientific computing market, and Ray AbuZayyad, who heads the computer maker's disk drive businesssaid last year that his division was looking closely at array technology.
For the moment, EMC customers express satisfaction.
Mr. Balcom said that J. I. Case had originally considered EMC as something of a gamble, but the company put some of its applications on the system and saw a significant speedup.
"A lot of people have apprehension about not going with I.B.M.," he said. "We went out there and talked for a whole day before we decided to go with EMC."
Not only has the EMC system made faster work of such tasks as tracking inventory and sending electronic mail, Mr. Balcom said, but the added capabilities have enabled Case to delay buying an I.B.M. 3090 mainframe -- a potential $10 million to $20 million outlay -- by at least six months.

Who (and What) Decides How City Budget Rates

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
WHEN Mayor David N. Dinkins delivered his State of the City address earlier this month, one sentence in the 18th paragraph finally inspired his audience to spontaneous applause: "Bond ratings are important," Mr. Dinkins declared, "but we are judged against a higher standard."
Surprisingly, perhaps, some bond raters agree. 
 "The need for public safety, adequate sanitation, maintenance of the municipal infrastructure, education of our children and safety nets to assist those truly in need are clearly priorities that put a bond rating in its proper perspective," Richard P. Larkin, a managing director of Standard & Poor's, acknowledged after the Mayor's speech. "There may be situations and needs so great that a city or state's bond rating may suffer as a result of the fiscal actions or increased debt issuance necessary to respond. For investors, this may seem heretical."
Before Mr. Dinkins makes public his four-year financial plan for New York City this week, his ritual pilgrimage to brief rating analysts demonstrates just how important he believes bond ratings are -- regardless of whether other standards against which his budget will be judged are higher.
State and local jurisdictions sell bonds to raise money for public works and other long-term projects. How much interest the market demands is determined, in part, by the risk judgments expressed publicly by private agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service.
Credit is derived from the Latin, to believe. A rating represents the degree of faith in a borrower's ability to pay its debts. A rating may lag behind prices imposed by market forces, which better reflect investor confidence. A minor rating change may be largely irrelevant when interest rates are as low as today's. A rating may reflect economic conditions beyond any official's control. A plunge to junk-bond levels, though, could legally preclude some institutions from investing -- curtailing or even cutting off a government's access to credit.
But a credit rating is just one variable in the political equation that defines spending priorities. Getting the highest credit rating is not necessarily a desirable goal in itself.
"Most bond raters don't live in the city," Stanley Hill, who heads the largest municipal employee union, complained the other day. "They just see numbers. But I look at kids not getting educated, a crumbling infrastructure."
The government's balancing is akin to a consumer's decision to postpone paying a credit-card bill after making the judgment that the bill for rent or electricity or medicine or tuition or a well-deserved vacation is more pressing -- even if it means being slapped with an interest penalty the next month. The choice is clearer when the consumer is warned to stop charging or when the card is about to be revoked.
"Maybe comptrollers shouldn't say it," said Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller, "but if you got down to a choice of shutting down all emergency rooms and closing the parks or letting an AA rating fall, then obviously you would let the rating fall." He said the city and the state still had plenty of latitude to impose less painful economies. He also said higher interest costs that result from a rating decline can mean less money left for hospitals and parks.
"When the Mayor says there's more to life than bond ratings, I sympathize with him," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created in 1975 to borrow on behalf of a city shunned by the credit markets. "It's a perfectly acceptable public policy to say, 'I can do more for the people of the city and state and instead of a AA rating I'll have an A-minus, as long as I'm sure I can stabilize it there.' The terrible thing is that nobody knows where the brink is until after they've gone over it."
New York State may be perilously close. Its general-obligation bonds were downgraded by Standard & Poor's this month to the second lowest of any state except Massachusetts.
New York City's rating may depend on whether Mr. Dinkins's financial plan credibly answers the raters' inevitable questions: Does the budget depend too much on deficit financing? (A proposal to pay off Municipal Assistance Corporation debt with city borrowing might cost more in interest since the city's credit rating is lower than the M.A.C.'s). Are proposed services affordable for the duration of outstanding bonds? Does the budget represent a cohesive vision?
Without investor confidence, "all the rhetoric in the world will not accomplish the goals and priorities of elected officials," Mr. Larkin of Standard & Poor's warned. Yet, while the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, predicted that any downgrade would be devastating, the taxpayers who get the bill for government borrowing and even many investors do not live by the agencies' ratings alone.
"If you don't make the cuts they want, they have trouble with your budget," Mr. Michael said. "If you do, they may have trouble with your city."

HEADLINE: Democrats See Support for Capital Gains Tax Cut

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said today that Democrats in Congress could support a cut in the capital gains tax if it was part of a generally "fair and progressive tax package."
Mr. Mitchell's comment, on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," was the second signal this weekend that Democrats might not go all-out in attacking such a proposal as proof of Republican commitment to helping the rich, the traditional Democratic accusation. 
 On Saturday, the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said on the Cable News Network, "We have never objected to a consideration of a reduction in capital gains taxes if it was part of a balanced and fair tax package."
President Bush made a reduction in the capital gains tax rate a centerpiece of his economic plans in 1989 and 1990, but that proposal hampered negotiations with Congress over the budget. On the insistence of Congressional Republicans, Mr. Bush abandoned his push at the end of the 1990 discussions; some Democrats had favored a cut, but Mr. Mitchell and others were agreeable only if it was accompanied by an income tax increase in the upper brackets.
Under the 1986 tax law, earnings from capital gains, which are profits from sales of assets like stocks or houses, are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, with higher rates for people with higher incomes. Before 1986, capital gains had traditionally been taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.
Just how much of a reduction below those rates Mr. Bush will propose in his State of the Union Message and his budget is uncertain, but Republican conservatives in Congress have been demanding that he ask for a big cut. Mr. Foley said it was possible that Congress might vote for "some moderate reduction."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, said that the real success of Mr. Bush's proposals would depend not only on what he asked for but also on the President's determination to press Congress for action after the speech on Tuesday night. In previous years, most of the proposals made in the State of the Union Messages and Presidential budgets have been largely ignored in Congress -- and by the Administration, too -- in subsequent months.
"He's going to have to follow up," Mr. Dole said on the CBS News program. "He's going to have to put the heat on Congress. I don't say he ought to be confrontational Tuesday night, but he ought to tell Congress, tell the American people, 'This is what we need to do.' "
 
Repeal of Plane Tax Is Seen
 Mr. Dole also predicted a tax cut even closer to his heart, or to that of his constituents in Kansas, than reduction in the capital gains tax rate. After a newspaper report today that Mr. Bush would seek repeal of the luxury tax on pleasure boats costing more than $100,000, Mr. Dole said the President would also seek repeal of the tax on private airplanes.
Two of the nation's largest manufacturers of private aircraft, Beech and Cessna, are in Kansas. Mr. Dole, 68 years old, announced Saturday that he would run for re-election this fall, ending months of speculation that he might retire next January after 32 years in Congress.
The tax on private planes applies to 10 percent of their cost over $250,000. Like the tax on boats, which applies to 10 percent of the price over $100,000, it was imposed as part of the 1990 budget agreement largely to show that higher-income taxpayers would be affected by that pact.
 
Repeal on Cars, Too?
 Mr. Dole also predicted that Congress "may go even further than that before it's over."
"Congress may decide to take it off of automobiles, furs and jewelry," he said. For automobiles, the 10 percent tax affects that part of their purchase price that exceeds $30,000; for furs and jewelry, the floor is $10,000.

HEADLINE: In the Aisles, Shoppers Voice Dismay

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Evie Wollman, 76 years old, was in the furniture department on the ninth floor of Macy's Herald Square store yesterday. "I would like to buy a couple of chairs," she said, adding, in a note of potential impulse that is sweet music to retailers everywhere, "and maybe some sheets."
As newspapers and radio and television stations reported that bankruptcy proceedings to protect R. H. Macy & Company from its creditors were imminent, Mrs. Wollman -- "nee Bender," she said -- had come from the Bronx to go shopping with her friend, Ida Rubinstein. And though their trip to 34th Street could not be described as a pilgrimage exactly, both women had memories of the store that recalled better days. 
 Mrs. Wollman said she bought her bedroom set in Macy's more than 40 years ago. Mrs. Rubinstein said she was still using the original Waring blender that she bought at Macy's, "it must be 50 years ago."
Bankruptcy probably will not close the place; indeed, the only difference customers are likely to see is that there will be more merchandise on the shelves because suppliers, assured of being paid, will return to regular deliveries of goods. But there is no question that the tremors emanating from the company's shaky foundation were felt on 34th Street, one more reminder of the vulnerability brought on by tough economic times.
Recalling the many other department stores that have failed, Mrs. Wollman said that if Macy's went under, it would be "one of the worst things that could possibly happen," adding: "They took away Gimbel's. They took away B. Altman's. And there's nothing replacing these landmarks."
She followed this with a general lament about the economy, concluding, "These are sad days we're living through."
A trip through the store yesterday brought out considerable anecdotal evidence that to many of its customers and employees, Macy's is not just any store. People spoke of its troubles with expressions of loyalty, anger, disappointment, resignation, nostalgia -- in much the same way that they speak about New York these days.
In the fifth-floor electronics department, George Simmonds and his 10-year-old son, Jason, were watching a Paul Simon performance on a 46-inch television screen. The Simmondses, who live in Manhattan, were merely sightseeing in the store -- electronics is Jason's favorite department -- after picking up some ribs in one of the food emporiums in Macy's Cellar.
"I'm always in Macy's," Mr. Simmonds said. "We can't afford to lose it. They ought to make a big pitch to the public to send in what they owe. If they made such an appeal to their customers, I'd certainly be one of them."
Mr. Simmonds also expressed fear that the collapse of the bid by Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of the Lowes Corporation as well as CBS, to take over the company would lead to Japanese investors' stepping into the breach. And he said he was angry with the Prudential Insurance Company of America for not going along with Mr. Tisch's request to reduce the interest on the mortgages it holds on Macy's stores.
"If Prudential were my insurance company, I'd pull out," Mr. Simmonds said. "That's how strongly I feel about showing support for this store."
At The Patio, a lunch counter on the eighth floor, Joe and Laura Patrina stopped to eat. They had just returned from London and Vienna, they said, where CNN had been reporting Macy's troubles. "The Europeans are really upset," Mr. Patrina said. "To them, Macy's is an institution, as strong an image as Mickey Mouse."
The Patrinas, who live in Manhattan, are furnishing a new apartment, and they came to Macy's, Mr. Patrina said, "to show support for the store." He added: "We had X amount of things to buy. We thought we might as well buy them here."
Not surprisingly, on the other side of the sales counters, where livelihoods are at stake, reactions were infused with pragmatism. Al Behmoiras, 20, who works in gift wrap on the eighth floor, said he was more worried for his father, who had worked for the store for 45 years, than for himself. "They're saying if they cut back, they're going to fire a lot of managers," Mr. Behmoiras said. "He's 62 years old. Where's he gonna go?"
In men's furnishings on the ground floor, one salesmen said business had never been better. "We had a great year," said the salesman, who insisted on anonymity. "We made a lot of money on commission."
Another salesman walked over. "One lady came in," he said, 'She was really upset. 'Is it true? Is Macy's going to close?' I told her no and she said, 'Thank God.' "
The first salesman said he had been working at Macy's 30 years. "We love it here," he said. "We make good money. We've been able to buy homes. We do well. We're a family. We'll survive."
He was then joined by two co-workers in a chorus of the Patti LaBelle song, "We Will Survive," their hands placed over their hearts. They were not pledging allegiance to Macy, however; they were just hiding their name tags.

HEADLINE: President's Message Expected to Lay Out Plans for a 'New Domestic Order'

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
In his State of the Union Message, President Bush is expected to challenge Congress to action on the economy without criticizing or directly confronting the Democrats, as well as to seek to define a "new domestic order" to go with his "new world order," Administration officials said today.
As Mr. Bush worked today on a draft of the address, which he will deliver on Tuesday, the officials and Republican strategists said the White House was still debating philosophy and tactics. 
 It was not clear, they said, how far Mr. Bush is prepared to go in offering a distinctly new course for the second term he will seek in November or whether he would stick to his months-old argument that he has offered a solid set of proposals for economic growth and that if Congress would simply enact them, with some modest changes, the recession would end.
"Everyone agrees that Bush has to lay out a sense of what the next five years will be like," an Administration official said today. "The big debate remains how much he is going to acknowledge, implicitly or explicitly, that the program needs to be different from what it's been in the previous three years."
On "This Week" on ABC News this morning, the new White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, acknowledged that the Administration's domestic policy making had to be reorganized and strengthened. But he signaled that the Administration still viewed its problems primarily as a matter of public relations and that Mr. Bush saw nothing wrong with his economic policies.
The thematic framework of Mr. Bush's speech emerged as the President worked through the weekend on his address. Officials cautioned that the President, who was working with Mr. Skinner and his campaign chairman, Robert M. Teeter, could still make important changes.
 
'Forum to Begin an Effort'
 Clearly concerned that public expectations for the speech were too high after weeks of being presented by the White House and the campaign as the defining moment of Mr. Bush's Presidency, Mr. Skinner sought today to lower those hopes.
"What the State of the Union allows us to do," he said, "is to articulate to the American people George Bush's 1992 domestic programs for this country, and it will be a forum to begin an effort, to put some good programs in place, to work with Congress, to get these good programs into law."
Administration officials said today that the White House recognized that the speech had to be more than that.
The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation" that the speech might "be the political Super Bowl for Bush."
An official said the speech "tries to lay out not just a program for this year, but also some sense of the next five years."
"One of the themes," he said, "at least at this point, is that we've had a great victory in foreign policy with the end of the cold war and that it's a new world in foreign policy. Now we need to move toward a new world in domestic policy."
Another official said there was still a debate between Mr. Bush's advisers about how strongly Mr. Bush's speech should strike that theme. Some advisers, primarily on the right flank, believe that there should be a clear change of direction, he said.
"Then," the official said, "there are those who say we need better communications, better procedures, but that basically we have to explain why we've done a good job and, perhaps, some retooling."
Although Mr. Skinner did not comment on the contents of the speech, he seemed to suggest that radical changes in policy were not needed, attributing the economic problems in part to reductions in military spending and referring to "a normal transition and a normal cycle."
A Republican strategist said, "The danger is you could end up with the worst of both worlds, which is a lot of apologizing about the current situation, which implies that we're to blame for it, but no strong message of new policies or changes in policy."
Administration officials said Mr. Bush appeared to have ended the debate that broke out last week over whether he should aggressively confront the Democrats in Congress, as many Republicans have suggested, or try to take a more statesmanlike approach in hopes of winning Democratic cooperation in enacting growth measures.
"Basically the speech is a split-the-difference exercise," one official said today. "The President will try to be challenging to Congress, urging them to pass his programs, and then lay the groundwork for criticizing them later on if they don't come through."
On television this morning, Mr. Skinner said that Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, would take the additional responsibility of coordinating all aspects of White House communications. Officials said Mr. Fitzwater could conduct daily meetings and counsel Mr. Bush on short-term press tactics and long-term communications strategy.
But the officials added that Mr. Fitzwater would not formally assume the post of director of communications, made famous under President Ronald Reagan by Michael K. Deaver. Soon after he took office Mr. Skinner asked Mr. Fitzwater to take on those functions, but Mr. Fitzwater suggested that the Administration look outside for a full-time "image czar," officials said.
The job was offered to Thomas C. Griscom, communications director at the end of the Reagan years, and James H. Lake, a campaign aide for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush. When they declined, Mr. Skinner turned back to Mr. Fitzwater, officials said.
Mr. Skinner has also been looking for a "heavyweight" figure to supervise domestic policy, a move widely seen as an attempt to reduce the powers of Richard G. Darman, the budget director.
Officials said that Mr. Skinner had approached Clayton Yeutter, the former Agriculture Secretary who is chairman of the Republican National Committee, but that it seemed unlikely he would take the job. The officials said Mr. Yeutter wanted full control of the Domestic Policy Council and the Economic Policy Council and to have real policy-making authority given to those panels, which Mr. Darman has relegated to largely consultative roles.

HEADLINE: Lift Taxes? Economists Vote Yes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
As President Bush and Congressional Democrats seek to outdo each other in proposing tax cuts to stimulate the economy, many economists say that what the nation needs in the long run is exactly the opposite.
Higher taxes, these economists say, are needed to prevent America's competitiveness from slipping further by providing money for improving schools, beefing up research and development and modernizing highways, railroads and airports. 
 A tax increase is also needed, they say, to reduce a runaway Federal budget deficit that has caused the United States to focus far more on spending for current purposes than on long-term investment to strengthen the nation's productivity. By reducing the deficit, higher taxes would push up the nation's paltry savings rate, an action that economists say is crucial because savings provide the money to finance further investments to increase competitiveness.
 
2 Views on Tax Cuts
 "In the long term, the country needs tax increases, not tax cuts," said Charles L. Schultze, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Jimmy Carter. "When I look at all these proposals, I am adamantly convinced that whatever they do should not involve any kind of permanent tax cut."
Of the 24 industrial nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States is tied for last place with Greece in how much taxes it raises as a percentage of its annual economic output.
Mr. Bush and the Democrats say tax cuts are not just politically sound but are also good economics. And indeed their economic advisers tell them that fiscal stimulus is just what the ailing economy needs right now.
 
President's Proposals
 So in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, President Bush is expected to announce various tax proposals, including a tax credit for first-time home buyers, lower capital gains taxes, an increase in the personal exemption for families with children, a tax credit to help low-income families afford health insurance and an end to the "luxury tax" on expensive boats.
But some economists have doubts about this approach. "In terms of policy, what is needed to make the next 6 to 12 months better is not what you need to do to make the next 6 to 12 years better," said Robert Solow, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.
He and others agree that Americans will need to provide more tax dollars if the country wants to shore up its competitive position against Japan and other countries.
"I don't think any tax increase is indicated at this time, but I don't have any hesitation to increase taxes longer term for public investment," said Robert Eisner, an economics professor at Northwestern University.
 
Agreement on Savings Rate
 If the often-fractious community of economists has reached a consensus about anything, it is that the nation's low savings rate is a principal reason for the decline in America's competitiveness.
The United States savings rate -- the combination of household savings, such business savings as increased retained earnings, and local, state and Federal budget surpluses -- is less than half of Japan's savings rate.
Economists are constantly telling Washington's politicians that cutting the nation's yawning $352 billion budget deficit would be an important way to improve America's savings rate -- and ultimately increase investment. And many economists say this deficit cutting also points to raising taxes over the long term.
"The long-run need of the country is for investment in the broadest possible sense," Mr. Solow said. "That means investment in plant and equipment, investment in technology, and investment in human capital such as training and education."
He said he supported some temporary tax cuts to power the stalled economy, but he added that he unequivocally backed tax increases over the longer term.
 
Conservatives' Position
 Many conservative economists say no tax increases will be needed to pare the budget deficit; they say cutting spending will do the trick. And many supply-side economists support permanent tax cuts, saying this will fuel investment.
"We want to have permanent tax- rate relief, which would lower the cost of capital and lower the cost of labor for employers," said Lawrence Kudlow, a Reagan Administration economist who works with the investment firm Bear, Stearns & Company. "This will have a very positive long-run effect and will improve the economy's long-run potential to grow."
But as the Reagan era recedes, leaving behind a mountain of debt, more and more economists say the supply-side tax cuts of the 1980's have hurt investment by unduly fueling consumption and causing a plunge in savings.
According to the O.E.C.D., the taxes raised at the Federal, state and local levels in the United States, including Social Security taxes, represented 31.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1989, the most recent year for which comparative figures are available. That compares with 46.5 percent in France in 1989, 44.6 percent in Germany, 39.7 percent in Britain and 33.3 percent in Japan.
One reason that American taxes are lower is that health care is financed with tax revenues in many other industrial nations, although that is offset in part by the United States' spending a proportionally higher amount on the military.
"Americans are hardly overtaxed by the standards of Europe," said Benjamin Friedman, an economics professor at Harvard University. He suggested that the nation's peace dividend, resulting from the end of the cold war, might be large enough to furnish enough money for deficit reduction and public investment so that taxes would not have to be raised.
"If that's not true, then we would need to pay more in taxes," Professor Friedman said.
Economists point to a mountain of statistics they say give clues why America's competitiveness has stumbled. According to one study, America's net investment in infrastructure like roads and airports represented just three-tenths of 1 percent of its gross domestic product in the 1980's. In comparison, Japan's net investment was 5.7 percent of G.D.P. during that period and Germany's was 3.7 percent.
 
Research and Development
 And a study by the National Science Foundation found that America's nonmilitary research and development spending, although higher in absolute terms, represented 2 percent of G.D.P. compared with 2.9 percent for Japan and 2.6 percent for Germany. America was also behind in government spending on nonmilitary research and development.
Considering how the income of the average American worker has stagnated over the last two decades, it is understandable why so many Americans cry for tax cuts. In addition, in recent decades Americans have manifested a strong antipathy to big, activist government.
Besides, many Americans hate taxes because they feel little direct benefit from them, since so much of their money goes to the military, the poor or to interest payments on the nation's debt. Perhaps one reason Europeans complain far less than Americans do about their higher tax rates is that Europeans feel more concrete benefits from their taxes: the state usually covers the cost of health care and higher education.
'There is another aspect to this," Professor Solow said. "A lot of people feel that as soon as the U.S. Congress raises taxes, it spends and it spends wastefully. President Reagan once spoke of tax reduction as taking the Congress's allowance away, as if Congress were children spending the money at a candy store."
 
$300 Billion Proposal
 Professor Solow suggests that if America wants to increase its competitiveness and living standards, it should spend about $300 billion more of the gross domestic product each year to finance education, new plants and equipment, and other investments in the future.
Economists like Mr. Solow are saying that if Americans are seeking to insure that their children live better than they do, they must learn to consume less, meaning live less well, and to save and invest more.
If Mr. Solow were running for Congress, such a "live worse now in order to live better in 10 years" platform would probably leave him on the wrong end of an electoral landslide. Indeed, politicians certainly remember what happened to Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate, after he said in his 1984 campaign that he would raise taxes.
It is easy for professors to pontificate about the importance of raising taxes. Perhaps their biggest frustration is that they cannot find some magical economic formula to make politicians in Washington worry as much about the state of the union in November 2002 as in November 1992.

HEADLINE: Travel Industry Is Experiencing A Sudden Surge

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
After two years of reduced travel, Americans are on the move again, producing an unexpected spurt in bookings for cruise ships, hotels and airlines in recent weeks.
Trans-Atlantic flights are on the rise, travel industry executives say, and tour operators, who just a month ago were bemoaning a slowdown in bookings for Hawaii, now report an upsurge of fresh business. Airlines that until recently were unsure whether to add flights to Florida and other warm-weather destinations now say they will, and so far this month almost 1,400 flight attendants have been recalled -- the largest number since May 1990. 
 "Our phones are ringing off the hooks," said Ron Letterman, the president of the Carlson Travel Network's 1,000 travel agencies, which are in all 50 states. "International travel is up 15 percent this year over the same time last year, and business travel is up an average of 6 to 7 percent. Travel to the Caribbean and Hawaii has been very strong lately."
Resorts at some national parks and ski resorts also say business is looking better.
At the Mammoth Springs Hotel in Yellowstone National Park, for example, occupancy reached 75 percent from mid-December to mid-January, compared with 61 percent in the corresponding period last year, said Steve Tedder, a vice president of TW Recreational Services Inc., which is in charge of lodging at the park.
At Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico, "bookings are up 25 percent since Jan. 1," from the same period last year, said Chris Stagg, vice president of marketing. Most visitors are from Southern California, he said, but many are from New York, Chicago, Texas and New Mexico.
At Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, a record number of visitors came in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, and attendance remains strong.
"We were up more than 15 percent over our previous record week last July," said Randy Garfield, the executive vice president of marketing. Attendance this month, he said "is running about 30 percent ahead of our projections."
In 1990, travel was a $328 billion industry in the United States and its territories, according to a recent study by the United States Travel Data Center, a nonprofit center for travel and tourism research. That figure equaled 6.5 percent of the gross national product. But the last two years have been difficult, with the Persian Gulf war and the nation's economic slump keeping many people at home.
While most predictions were that 1992 would be only lackluster, the recent spurt in bookings has many travel industry executives holding their breath, hoping the elusive recovery in business and leisure travel may finally be under way.
Even hotels and airlines, which were devastated by the recession and the gulf war, are showing improvement -- modest improvement, but few officials in either industry expected much of any improvement.
 
Demand Plus Discounts
 Industry executives say much of the recent increase in business reflects pent-up demand, fueled by generous industrywide discounts. The surge in bookings is unlikely to continue, they say, unless the overall economy turns around.
Nowhere is the travel business better than at the cruise lines.
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is based in Miami, received a record 115,000 calls from travel agents in the first week of the year, a company spokesman said, nearly twice the level of the first week of last year. Last January was especially bleak for the travel industry, because of the outbreak of the gulf war.
The 115,000 recent calls resulted in 95,000 bookings, another record.
"We added 17 percent capacity this year but this month we gained 40 percent in call volumes," the spokesman said. "So that means the demand isn't just because we have more berths available."
 
Cruise Line Breaks Record
 Carnival Cruises Lines, which is the industry leader and is also based in Miami, booked 65,000 passengers between Jan. 6 and 12, most for winter and spring cruises, said Tim Gallagher, Carnival's director of public relations. "By Jan. 9 we broke our previous record of 46,200, and our bookings have continued very strong since," he said.
Carnival's bookings are particularly striking because it markets its cruises to the masses, not the wealthy, and its potential customers are among those most vulnerable to a weakened economy.
At the Holland America Line, which is owned by Carnival, Juli Chase, a spokeswoman, said, "Our bookings for Alaska are running 12 percent higher than any previous month in our history."
 
People Didn't Travel in '91
 Two weeks ago, the American Hotel and Motel Association said in a report that for the fourth consecutive month the hotel industry "continued to show growth in several key indicators, making it clear that a slow but steady rebound from the effects of the recession is indeed under way." The occupancy rate grew 1.4 percentage points in November (the last month for which nationwide figures are available) to 56.2 percent, from November 1990, and some hoteliers say the situation appears to be improving.
"We don't have the December or January figures yet," said Mark Lomanno, research manager of Smith Travel Research, which compiles the figures for the American Hotel and Motel Association, "but I think the results will be very positive. There seems to be pent-up demand from people who didn't travel last year."
This apparent improvement follows on the heels of estimates by Coopers & Lybrand that the occupancy rate will rise only 3.3 percentage points this year. Most of the increase in occupancy is expected from spring through fall.
Airline passenger traffic increased 3.6 percent in December, the last month for which statistics are available, according to the Air Transport Association of America. The increase was largely unexpected, and except for a minuscule six-tenths of 1 percent increase in October, it was the only monthly gain in passenger traffic in 1991.
While American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines -- the strongest United States carriers -- had traffic increases, so did several smaller, weaker airlines.
 
Gains by Weaker Airlines
 America West Airlines, for example, posted a 15 percent increase in miles flown by paying passengers last month, compared with December 1990, while Northwest Airlines gained 11.6 percent over that period.
Trans World Airlines flew 9.1 percent more revenue passenger miles in December than in December 1990. And, in part because of an array of discounts this winter, "we're projecting an 11 percent increase in revenue passenger miles in January, compared with January of last year," said Don Fleming, the carrier's director of public relations.
Continental Airlines flew 11.2 percent more revenue passenger miles last month than in December 1990, and its load factor -- percentage of seats that are filled -- this month is running well above that of the corresponding period last year (60 percent compared with 55 percent).

Are Lyrics and the Economy in Tune?

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Harold Zullow can flash the kind of I-told-you-so grin that Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board or Louis Rukeyser of "Wall Street Week" can only dream of. Mr. Zullow forecast the recession in May 1990, months before the Government says it began. All he did was to listen to the songs on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart.
"I was sorry to see that in fact we had a recession," said Mr. Zullow, a research fellow in social psychiatry at Columbia University's School of Public Health. "I don't really think of myself as a prophet of doom." 
 Nor is he a pie-chart-in-the-sky optimist, nor the kind of person who graphs the correlation between every eighth-of-an-inch rise (or fall) in hemlines and every eighth-of-a-point rise (or fall) in the stock market. There is, he says, nothing frivolous about what he does.
In contrast to researchers who extrapolate trendy tidbits from the Consumer Price Index, Mr. Zullow studied 40 years' worth of popular songs, from "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" in 1955 to the 1963 hit "Puff the Magic Dragon," to "Killing Me Softly With His Song" in 1973, to the 1990 blockbuster "Nothing Compares 2 U."
Mr. Zullow has not been around for 40 years -- he is only 30 -- but he and his research team studied hundreds of all-but-forgotten lyrics from libraries. They also evaluated 1,820 Time magazine cover stories as another yardstick of consumer confidence. He concluded that just when the economy seemed to be, pardon the expression, humming along nicely, song lyrics turned pessimistic. This is the tipoff that it's time to sell off the stock portfolio and lock in the certificate-of-deposit interest rates.
"Then, while the economy's doing very badly, popular culture turns more optimistic," Mr. Zullow said. "Songs are more optimistic during a recession than they are just before the recession."
 
Seven Choruses of Doom
 This has held true, he said, for the seven major recessions since World War II: 1958, 1960-61, 1970, 1974-75, 1980, 1981-82 and the one that began in July 1990. His research indicates that the pessimistic songs were issued a year before the economy turned sour and the optimistic ones a year before things started to get better.
"The outlook in songs and other popular culture may be contagious, reinforcing cheer or gloom in people," he said. "I am not suggesting that the songs make people more pessimistic and therefore less likely to spend. But they may tap into our collective fears, which color how we act in the world. The songs may reinforce and spread pessimism."
But since reinforcement takes time, Mr. Zullow not only kept score on musical scores in 1989 and 1990, he also kept news clippings.
"I was collecting articles on polls of economists who said the economy would continue to expand into 1993, knowing that down the road if my prediction came true, people would say things were already getting bad and people knew it," he said. "But really, people didn't know it at the time, or they weren't saying it if they knew it."
It is almost enough to make one wonder what would happen if economists spent more time on lyrics and less time on tiresome statistics. Economics could lose its reputation as the dismal science.
 
Bad Tunes Rising
 Mr. Zullow, whose findings have been published in scholarly journals like American Psychologist and The Journal of Economic Psychology, developed his own methodology, using seven-point rating scales. He analyzed 1,344 songs and rated them for "rumination about bad events" and "pessimistic explanatory style." This led him to conclude that "pessimistic rumination in popular songs predicts decreased economic growth, with a one- to two-year lead."
In 1989, he found, 89 percent of the Fine Young Cannibals' song "Good Thing" was rumination about something bad, starting with the opening line, "The one good thing in my life has gone away."
George Michael's "Praying for Time," issued in 1990, also got an 89 percent rumination rating with lines like "These are the days of the beggars and the choosers" and "It's hard to love, there's so much to hate, hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of."
Turning the clock back to 1969 and Creedance Clearwater Revival's "Bad Moon Rising." Mr. Zullow found that 19 of the 24 lines in the song, or 79.2 percent, were negative rumination ("I fear rivers overflowing. I hear the voice of rage and ruin.")
That was only one of several dark songs in the prerecession year of 1969. Among the others: the Marvin Gaye hit "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" (the line "not much longer would you be mine" rated high on the pessimism scale) and "In the Year 2525," about the end of the world.
What a difference a few years makes. "In 1988," he said, "I noticed there had been some pessimism preceding the stock market crash of '87 and in the months following, which turned much more optimistic in the summer of '88. All of a sudden, we had songs like 'Don't Worry, Be Happy,' which George Bush made his campaign theme."
What is he predicting now? The lyrics from the first half of 1991 were cheerier, like Gloria Estefan's record of "Coming Out of the Dark." But he said he could not tell whether that was a sign the country was coming out of the recession.
"The optimism still isn't very strong," he said. "The rumination component about how much these song lyrics are focusing on bad events shows a striking change. You saw a lot of songs in '91 like Paula Abdul's 'Promise of a New Day' and I forget who did this one, 'I Adore Me Amor.' On that basis, you'd expect to see an improvement in consumer spirits. The unusual thing is Wall Street's spirits have picked up before consumers' spirits."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Clients Demand Flexibility For Their Media Purchases

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
NOT too many years ago, anyone who suggested that an advertiser would be able to buy a commercial during a Super Bowl as late as two days before the game would have been dismissed as someone who played too much football without a helmet. Yet for Super Bowl XXVI, which CBS broadcast yesterday, no one was surprised that it took the network until Friday to sell the last of the 56 available 30-second spots.
The difference between then and now is a fundamental change in the ability of advertisers to plan ahead. As a result of two years of economic uncertainties, no company wants to make commitments as extravagant as a Super Bowl buy -- at $800,000 to $850,000 for each commercial -- as far as several months in advance. Across a broad range of product categories, like beer, cars, soft drinks, air travel and credit cards, rapidly changing market conditions make flexibility far more highly prized than having an annual media plan locked in by Jan. 1. 
 "It would be easily solved if you could just plan conservatively," said Dan Fox, executive vice president of Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago. "Instead, we constantly revise and update and adjust."
"There has been a real increase in how close this agency's management stays to the numbers," he added. For instance, late last year, when "one large client announced it was making all of its 1992 budget cuts now," he continued, "our response was, 'No, you're not; you're just making the first of your 1992 cuts now.' "
The creativity that agencies are expected to bring to the production of ads now must also be demonstrated in the planning process, said Ron Burns, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson North America in New York. Three-year and one-year strategic plans, he said, are being supplemented by what are termed "rolling plans," which offer clients alternatives for whatever vagaries they might encounter over shorter periods of time.
All that is greatly changing how media companies operate, too, particularly in making their annual estimates of revenues and costs based on forthcoming business volume.
"In forecasting 1992, a crystal ball could come in real handy," said Elizabeth P. Valk, publisher of Time magazine in New York. "It's so hard to know, in this economy, what the base line is."
The main difficulty, she added, is that the information her sales executives are able to obtain from advertisers and their agencies is "a less and less accurate reflection of what's to come." For example, "if orders are down 5 percent, we keep asking ourselves, 'Will that make up for itself?' " If not, more aggressive ad sales efforts must be undertaken to sell the number of pages anticipated for that issue.
"Getting the whole year's schedule in one fell swoop -- you don't see much of that anymore," she continued, almost sighing.
Yet rather than pine for Time's times past, the news magazine is reconfiguring itself for today's realities. Since "the marketplace is telling us it's unable to give us a commitment," said Brian O'Leary, Time's production director, the magazine in August reduced the close for four-color ad pages -- the deadline for them to be on hand before publication -- to four weeks from seven.
The words "planning ahead" are likely to remain an unrealistic term until the economic recovery begins.
"All of this comes down to how good are you at knowing what's going on at your client," said Mr. Fox at Foote, Cone, "not what they're telling the press."

HEADLINE: Grapefruit Month in Congress

 BODY:
Forget the economy, health care and other weighty issues. Representatives Andy Ireland and Tom Lewis of Florida are busily buttonholing colleagues to have February declared "National Grapefruit Month." That might please the state's citrus growers, but why does Congress waste its time on empty commemorations?
A new compilation in the Congressional Record shows that nearly one-third of the new laws passed by Congress last year named a day, week, month or decade to celebrate. Whether the cause is National Mushroom Month or National Country Music Month, each bill requires lining up the co-sponsorship and signatures of a majority of members of both chambers. That eats up a hefty portion of staff time. And for what? A clutter of forgettable occasions, many pandering to special interests. 
 Representative Dave McCurdy, Democrat of Oklahoma, and Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York, propose turning over the designating chore to a commemorative commission, modeled on the one that decides on commemorative stamps. The day Congress took such a step would be Congressional Common Sense Day.

HEADLINE: If Frogs Had Wings

 BODY:
President Bush went to New Hampshire the other day to tell voters that he cares about their economic distress. But when asked whether he would agree to further extend last year's extension of unemployment insurance benefits, he dismissed the question curtly: "If a frog had wings, he wouldn't hit his tail on the ground -- too hypothetical."
There's nothing hypothetical about the determination of Congressional Democrats to add still more weeks to the 13 to 20 extra weeks of insurance payments that were added last fall. The House Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to vote on a 13-week extension Tuesday, just hours before Mr. Bush's State of the Union Address. The Senate Finance Committee plans hearings for Wednesday. 
 For workers who have been unemployed since last spring, payments will start running out next month, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. And Mr. Bush, who twice vetoed last year's extension, is suddenly of different mind than when he talked about frogs 11 days ago. According to Administration insiders, he's ready to consider a further extension after all.
Whether his change of heart means he cares about New Hampshire's distress, or just its votes, is unclear. What's clear is that a flip response shows no care at all.

HEADLINE: Kazakhs Seek a Level Capitalist Road

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Quietly, while the other republics of the fallen Soviet empire are raging with the politics of recrimination, this critical new nation linking Russia and the newly independent Asian states is employing a different drummer in its attempted march to the free market.
He is Dr. Chan Young Bang, a 55-year-old American economist from the University of San Francisco, who has already achieved notable progress in the privatization of 40 percent of this capital's housing stock while the parliaments of other republics are still mostly agonizing over the alien notion of private ownership. 
 This week, Dr. Bang, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, took over the despairing precincts of the Communist Party Higher School to turn it into an academy to train free-market bankers, economists, managers and lawyers he finds so lacking in all the post-Communist reforms.
 
A 74-Year-Old Failure
 "I share your indignation," he told a gray-haired Marxist professor who was flabbergasted at his pink slip and demanded to know why capitalism is not working yet. "But to change the ideological attitude you have is very difficult; it hampers economic reform," he told the complaining professor in very simple, determined tones that pointed out that the Marxists had 74 years to fail, while the capitalists are in their first month.
Such are the bracingly authoritarian ways of Kazakhstan, the second largest of the old empire's new nations in territory and richness of mineral resources. It is the overlooked giant in the post-Communist equation, a nation where a pragmatic counterpoise of the Muslim-rooted Kazakh majority and the large Russian minority has thus far prevented wasteful tangents of nationalism, with more time to study the new arts of making money.
 
Hints of Nostalgia
 These are not coming easy, with problems far outweighing progress. Some business executives even speak in mock fondness for the old Communist business monolith now that they must brave the brushfire commerce wars smoldering among the foundling nations that survived the Soviet Union.
As it is across the former union, the old Communist economy is grinding down here to 60 percent production levels and worse, and unemployment has become starkly obvious as useless state factories lay off workers by the hundreds. Prices are expected to rise more than sevenfold this year, and the accelerating inflation has produced little more than fresh shock and cynicism.
While Kazakhstan seems ahead of other republics in privatization, it still has ended state ties at fewer than 5 percent of the enterprises -- about 50 businesses in this city, employing 15,000 workers who have realized up to 18,000 rubles each in share holdings at their converted workplaces. As in Russia and elsewhere, the Parliament, caught in old Soviet incantations about the Motherland, still balks at the truly private farm ownership that is so critically needed.
"Now, most workers are hesitating to allow auctions of their factories for privatization, because they know new private managers will demand harder work and efficiency and they could lose their jobs," said Hykyenov Sapapgaly, the chairman of the Kazakhstan property conversion committee, an ambitious factory welder who has learned to wend his way through the local party jungle.
But deep change is occurring quietly all about this capital's tree-lined snowscape. The magnificent city steam baths, once crowded and no longer low priced, are now a plutocrat's enclave of lavish hot marble and idle attendants grateful to deliver, for the equivalent of $1.50, a world-class massage and the Russian equivalent of have-a-nice-day.
Airliners, once ludicrously priced as low as mass transit and always packed, now take off half empty against the snowcapped mountain backdrop of the Chinese border. A seat to Moscow, 1,500 miles to the northwest, costs an average month's factory pay.
"Russia has just announced an end to all trade restrictions with us, and that's the first good news in a long time," said Nurzha Alimukhamedov, a partner in one of the new free-enterprise companies that are by far the best touch of optimism to be found here.
 
'There's No Stopping Us'
 "Don't worry, we are making progress and there is no stopping us," said the 32-year-old businessman, a nouveau millionaire in rubles, grinning in his ramshackle office that is the heart of a burgeoning furniture making and retail chain.
"Oh no, the remnants of Communism are still pretty suffocating," said his 33-year-old partner, Vladimir Zdorovizov. He described how long entrenched bureaucrats are cravenly behaving the old way in fighting the plans of Dr. Bang to privatize their empire. Business executives say most state administrators are working to get a personal leg up on the first entrepreneurial profits to be made, particularly in monopolizing state real estate.
As master planner, Dr. Bang is well aware of this, having been visiting this and other Soviet republics for 15 years; he still jumped at the job of resident reformer a year ago when it was offered. Currently he is worried about the effects of the price-liberalization policy that Kazakhstan had to follow (prematurely, he stresses) after giant Russia introduced it on Jan. 2.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia deserves credit for pressing for the free market in such a harrowing time, Dr. Bang says, but deserves criticism as well for not having gotten a handle yet on the companion need of liberalized prices: privatizing the old state production monopoly and seeding competitive manufacturing of more goods.
 
Russia Is the Engine
 The key to all the other republics' reform hopes, radical or not, Dr. Bang stresses, is that the overshadowing Russian republic "has to put its house in order." Russia must very quickly push state enterprises into private conversion, he said, and end the government deficits and open-ended ruble printing.
"Yeltsin sometimes can be an unreliable, unguided missile," Dr. Bang complained. "As you see, 98 percent of the enterprises in Russia are still owned by the state. With this, price increases of themselves will not induce a positive response from state enterprises," because state managers have no personal incentive to change.
To get something of value quickly into the hands of ordinary people, Dr. Bang conceived the housing privatization scheme now under way: an equity system in which tenants are accorded retroactive "down payments" based on their years of residency, work and family size. Two of five apartments have been converted in this city of 1.2 million residents, he said.
Significantly, Dr. Bang did this by winning the support of Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the republic's former Communist leader who is attracting increasing Western attention as a skilled transition politician trying to push independence forward by braiding some free-market democracy to this vast land's autocratic traditions.
With Kazahhstan having only 17 million people in comparison with Russia's 149 million and Ukraine's 53 million, Mr. Nazarbayev has skillfully used the republic's quarter interest in the Soviet nuclear weapons club for political prestige. He has pledged disarmament but declined to ship Kazakh missiles for storage in President Yeltsin's Russia. At the same time, he keeps cross-border ties strong between the two nations, with six million Russians here and 850,000 Kazakhs there.
Mr. Nazarbayev suffered little for having hesitated a day in denouncing last August's Kremlin coup. Rather, he rushed into the post-Communist era by getting popularly elected with a minimum of opposition and pushing ahead with a huge new capitalist deal to have the Chevron Corporation develop lucrative oil fields.
Thus far, Kazakhstan's social stability stands out in comparison with the growing unease and political infighting of Russia and Ukraine, the restless giants of the shaky new Commonwealth of Independent States. A nationalist movement is just now noticeable here, but Mr. Nazarbayev appears trusted by the majorities of both Kazakhs and Russians, at least until the economy withers further.
"We do not have a lot of time," he said, hurrying through a dim corridor of Marxism's defunct academia. "Within two years, there'll be fresh stagnation, and then big social unrest, unless positive and very radical change can happen."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Firms Relatively Quiet on Treasury Proposals

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
After decades of doing business pretty much on their own, executives and traders at firms that buy and sell Treasury securities seem to have relatively few quarrels with the sweeping market changes proposed last week by the Government.
In part, the subdued reaction stems from a realization that further changes, beyond those announced in the immediate aftermath of the Salomon Brothers bidding scandal, were bound to come. But many traders say there is also widespread recognition that many of the proposed changes are sound ones. 
 "Ninety-five percent of this is great," said one government securities trader, who insisted on not being identified. "I'm just concerned that the remaining 5 percent could be detrimental."
 
Participants' Main Concern
 Market participants said their main concern about the Government proposals involved the new uniform-price, open-auction system that the Treasury is considering to replace the multiple-price, sealed-bid auction that has been in place since the mid-1970's.
Among the legislative recommendations is one that would require the time-sequenced reporting of trades to regulators -- otherwise known as an audit trail. At the moment the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board oppose this proposal, while the Securities and Exchange Commission favors it. If those differences are ironed out, market participants would undoubtedly contest it.
For the moment, the notion of tinkering with the auction system, one that the Treasury acknowleges has worked well despite the recent abuses, was the one that provoked the most discussion among traders and dealers.
"The auction proposal is an interesting idea that needs additional study," said Richard M. Kelly, chairman and chief executive of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer in government securities.
 
Worries About Liquidity
 Mr. Kelly and others are concerned that by giving investors an incentive to participate directly in the auction process rather than through primary dealers, liquidity in the market for new Treasury issues prior to their sale -- the so-called when-issued market -- could dry up, making efficient price discovery of the securities more difficult and potentially raising the Treasury's borrowing costs.
"Under the new system, customers may decide it is to their advantage to buy at the auction rather than deal in the when-issued market," Mr. Kelly said. "I am skeptical that will lead to lower borrowing costs."
A less liquid when-issued market might be detrimental to the Treasury because it might not accurately reflect the real prices of the securities. Moreover, the Treasury has said it plans to use the when-issued price as an initial benchmark at the auction. It will be months before it can be determined whether that method of setting the initial bid is workable.
 
Current System to Continue
 Until sometime late this year or early in 1993, when the auction process is fully automated, the current bidding system will remain in place. And sealed-bid auctions will continue for a time after that, market participants said, as the proposed new system is tested and debated.
Indeed, there are signs that changes announced last fall to open up bidding under current rules are having an impact.
At a Congressional hearing following release of the report detailing the changes, Jerome H. Powell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Domestic Finance, said that since the changes were announced in October, an additional 40 firms had bid for clients at auctions, and that "10 or fewer" had bid directly.
Other aspects of the report were of less concern. Dealers voiced little or no objection, for example, to the Treasury's headline-grabbing commitment to provide additional amounts of a security to the market in order to minimize the chances that any firm could "squeeze" an issue, as Salomon Brothers did last spring.
 
Little Real Change Seen
 In large part, market participants were fairly indifferent to the pledge because they realize that for a variety of reasons the Treasury is unlikely to take such a step often, perhaps never.
Indeed, in the report detailing the actual and proposed changes, only three instances of such acute, protracted shortages were identified. Two occurred last spring, the product of Salomon's illegal bidding tactics. The third took place in February 1986.
Similarly, primary dealers were reluctant to criticize the decision to democratize what had been a tightly knit group of authorized securities dealers. Even with greater competition, the changes stand to benefit large firms.
As part of opening up the system, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is charged with designating primary dealers, is eliminating the requirement that each primary dealer make at least 1 percent of all customer trades in the secondary market.
 
Maybe Less Democratic
 "To firms who make markets in government securities as a major business this is a positive, because it will eliminate an artificial requirement that forced marginal players who wanted to be primary dealers to underprice their services," said Louis v. B. Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. "By eliminating the minimum-share requirement, the New York Fed is allowing dealers to set bid/ask spreads at levels where they can make money."
Moreover, the recognition of more and more primary dealers -- beyond the 38 that now carry that designation -- may over time force the New York Fed, which conducts its open-market operations through primary dealers, to telescope those activities through a small group of firms it knows well.
"It will be some time before the number of primary dealers expands much, but as the numbers grow the Fed is likely to return to a much smaller, more informal group of market contacts," Mr. Crandall added. "Ironically, what is being described as a more democratic system may effectively work in the opposite direction."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
The Credit Markets column in Business Day on Monday referred incorrectly to bidding activity by Salomon Brothers at Treasury note auctions last April and May where "squeezes" occurred. Salomon's bidding at the April auction has not been questioned by regulators. In a report last week, the Government said the squeeze in May appeared to have been caused by large awards of the securities to Salomon and some of its customers, but it has not been established whether that squeeze resulted from wrongdoing by Salomon.

But unlike the speculators who face perhaps 50-50 odds, President Bush in his State of the Union Address tomorrow is expected to make a wager that arguably has a 100 percent chance of being wrong.
Recession year "borrow and stimulate" packages have a habit of missing the present and haunting the future. And in the present circumstances, the case against the grab bag of stimulants for housing, investment and the middle-class consumer that the President is expected to announce is especially compelling. 
 Unfortunately, if Mr. Bush had not been so reluctant to raise taxes early in his term when the economy was healthy, his current risky prescription would not be necessary. But when he finally moved his lips in November 1990, he wound up imposing a major tax increase just as the bottom was dropping out of the economy. Ironically, the right-wingers who thwarted him then now compound their felony by loudly pressing for unadulterated pump priming.
If Wall Street is correct, however, and we are at the turning point of an ordinary business cycle, the Federal Reserve's 4 percent money market rates will spark business activity long before the House Ways and Means Committee even takes roll call.
Arousing Congress from its usual stupor in order to ignite the fiscal afterburners would thus be doubly tragic. By eliciting a Capitol Hill bidding war to include a stimulant for every constituency with a name, the Administration will not only expand the short-term deficit but also risk squandering the prospective post-cold war fiscal windfall.
After all, financing national security during the cold war took more than 6 percent of the gross national product. Surely in this new era of ruble rubble, defense can eventually be financed on just 3 percent of G.N.P.
Thus, a normal recovery could mean a strong revenue rebound, a reversal of the $100 billion-a-year savings and loan bailout and a decent chance to harvest the peace dividend. What could ruin this golden opportunity to rid the nation of the curse of mega-deficits, however, is the fiscal stampede the Administration is about to launch.
There remains the more likely prospect that instead of a downturn in the ordinary business cycle, we are in the middle of national balance sheet shock. In the 1980's we raised the collective debt of the economy from $4 billion to $11 billion -- and its percentage of G.N.P. rose to an unprecedented 200 percent.
Could the drop in nominal growth indicators like housing prices, lending, spending and wages to anemic 2 to 4 percent rates -- levels not seen since the 1950's -- mean that a genuine debt deflation is under way? If so, hitting the fiscal accelerator after the Federal Reserve has launched its high-octane money policy could prove highly hazardous.
Why? Because economic recovery may turn on restoring financial confidence, not consumer spending.
Our balance sheet problem involves not just an excess of debt, but, more important, a surfeit of assets. The debt side of the balance sheet, however ugly and distended, is backward-looking -- a measure of recklessness during the 1980's. Likewise, the mushrooming defaults weigh more heavily on current wealth than on future production.
It is the abundance of household and business fixed assets that really threaten recovery. Cars, VCR's, wardrobes, office buildings, hotel rooms, airplanes and retail floor space, overbought in yesterday's debt spree, must now inevitably become oversold and underproduced. The former brings a markdown in value and confidence, the latter an extended hiatus in business activity and employment.
Perhaps the public's flaccid shopping behavior represents as much an exhaustion of need as it does anxiety about the value of its principal collateral and the flow of income needed to service its debts.
On the business side, banks, brokerage houses, insurance and real estate companies acquired personal computers, modular furniture and square footage like there was no tomorrow. This sector, with a base of only 17 percent of real G.N.P. in 1980, accounted for an astounding $450 billion or 50 percent of the real growth in the nation's capital stock through 1989. Could the lack of orders at I.B.M., Compaq and the office furniture makers signal an overabundance of fixed assets and a long, flat spell ahead?
If we are in balance sheet shock that holds down business expansion until the fixed-asset surplus can be marked down and slowly absorbed, the financial markets will likely soon go into cardiac arrest. Confidence will ebb to the vanishing point. In this case, a renewed exercise in fiscal pump priming that would send the Federal deficit soaring toward half a trillion dollars will have many effects. Stimulating an economic recovery will not be among them.

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN: Players;
Onetime Insider Adapts To Low-Key Campaign

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RAYMOND, N.H., Jan. 22

 BODY:
Peggy Connolly, once a consummate Washington insider as spokeswoman for the Democratic National Campaign Committee, left the capital in 1988 right after George Bush's election. She said she believed that a Democrat would not be elected President until the year 2000.
But today, Ms. Connolly, 36 years old, is press secretary to Paul E. Tsongas, former Senator from Massachusetts, who is seeking the Democratic nomination. Mr. Tsongas was the first Democrat to challenge President Bush. 
 "I had been frustrated with Washington and with the Democrats who were afraid to take risks and refused to be critical of Reagan," said Ms. Connolly, who had returned to her hometown, Westford, Mass., to care for her father. "They were fearful of the polls, which said that he was enjoying this tremendous popularity. But the polls said people liked Reagan, but they didn't like his policies. And it was frustrating to me that the Democrats wouldn't tie those two things together."
Ms. Connolly said Mr. Tsongas's announcement in April did just that. "I picked up The Boston Globe one day, and it said this guy was really gutsy to say that George Bush has to be challenged," she recalled.
She joined the campaign on April 7, 1991, but said she was unprepared for Mr. Tsongas's low-key strategy, which incorporated none of the smooth packaging and image making that she had been used to. The Potomac point of view did not dissipate easily, she said, particularly in the summer, when Mr. Tsongas received little press attention and Ms. Connolly felt responsible.
"I would come in and tell Paul that he was losing ground in the eyes of the national media, and he would reassure me that everything was going to be fine," Ms. Connolly recalled. "He would offer me the perspective of his past political campaigns, saying this was nothing compared to his Senate race. He's never demanded headlines or national columns. It's a whole new experience."
She is respected by journalists for her candid responses, conceding that her candidate lacks dazzle even while pushing his positive points.
Ms. Connolly said she "fell into politics" when she went to Washington shortly after graduating from Northeastern University in Boston in 1982.
Occasionally, her Washington instincts get the upper hand. She has tried to lessen Mr. Tsongas's use of chalkboards and flip charts to explain his economic plan because they make him look more professorial then Presidential, but she conceded that she had not been entirely successful.
Ms. Connolly is the youngest of six children in the family of a machinist in Westford, 10 miles west of Mr. Tsongas's hometown, Lowell. She worked as a reporter at The Lowell Sun, but did not meet Mr. Tsongas until she became his press secretary.
Like any good press secretary, she said she was sure Mr. Tsongas would win. "I believe in following your political gut," she said. "After all, in the office pool in 1988, I was the only one who chose Dan Quayle as Vice President."

HEADLINE: Dow Edges Up 7.83 and Closes at 3,240.61

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices were mixed yesterday, with blue chips posting small gains while the broader market was weak. Many cautious investors moved to the sidelines in anticipation of the President's State of the Union Message tonight.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.83 points to finish at 3,240.61, but all the other leading indexes wound up with losses. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was noticeably down from previous sessions, with nearly 191 million shares traded, compared with 214.6 million on Friday. Gaining issues held a slim lead over losers, 890 to 831, as the Big Board composite slipped 0.23, to 228.94.
Anthony Ludovici, senior vice president and senior investment analyst with Tucker Anthony, described the trading as lackluster, with investors trekking to the sidelines before tonight's message.
Mr. Ludovici noted that automobiles were one of the strong spots in the market, with weakness still apparent in pharmaceuticals. This is "an indication that there is still rotation into cyclicals, a group geared to the economy," Mr. Ludovici said. "Even in a lackluster market, it explains why the Dow was up while the market was down. The key market indicator is made up of a number of cyclicals."
Noting past moves by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, which would translate into renewed economic strength, some analysts were high on auto stocks. Chrysler rose 1 1/2, to 15; Ford Motor, 1, to 32 3/4, and General Motors, 1 3/8, to 34 1/8.
Paper stocks like Scott Paper, up 2 3/8, to 40; Boise Cascade, up 1/4, to 23 1/8, and International Paper, up 1 5/8, to 74 3/8, also benefited from the move to cyclicals, Mr. Ludovici said.
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 0.49, to 414.99, while the American Stock Exchange composite was off 0.94, to 412.48. The Nasdaq composite was down 3.68, to 621.00, and the Russell 2,000 was off 0.36, to 205.06.
The moderate gains in early trading were aided by strong futures prices, a firm bond market and some carry-over from gains overseas.
Premark International, the manufacturer of Tupperware and food equipment products, jumped 5 1/4, to 46 7/8, after the company reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.48 a share, because of the surprisingly strong showing in its domestic food-equipment business and lower tax rates. Jay Freedman, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said Wall Street had expected Premark to report earnings of $1.05 a share.
As generous as investors have been to better-than-expected results, they have been equally unforgiving when earnings have not matched expectations, traders noted. Commodore International served as a reminder yesterday, falling 2 3/8, to 16 5/8, after second-quarter earnings did not exceed expectations.
Mentor Graphics , which produces and services electronic design automation systems, was up 5/8, to 18 1/4, as Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential Securities, raised her rating on the company to "buy" from "hold." She cited the completion of the company's 8.0 design automation software last year, which will allow Mentor to concentrate on the release of related software products than can be used on more work stations. This month, Mentor said it would make the 8.0 software, already compatible with Sun Microsystems work stations, compatible with certain I.B.M., NEC and Sony equipment.
Among the biggest percentage gainers on the Big Board was MGM-Pathe, which rose to 3 1/4, from 2 1/4. Credit Lyonnais, which last month gained control of the Hollywood studio, said it would welcome a good offer but was in no hurry to sell the studio.

HEADLINE: Health Costs Up 12.1% Last Year, a Study Says

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Employers' health-care costs rose by 12.1 percent nationwide, to $3,605 per employee last year, or about four times as fast as overall living costs, according to a survey released yesterday. What is more, analysts said the annual increase in 1992 would be higher.
Health costs in 1991 were the highest in the Middle Atlantic States, averaging $4,066 an employee, and were the second highest in New England, at $3,918, followed by $3,659 on the West Coast, $3,546 in the Midwest, $3,412 in the South Atlantic States, and $3,262 in the Mountain States. 
 Costs were the lowest in the South Central region, at $3,256. The coverage included medical and dental plans and health maintenance organizations.
 
Factors Affecting Some Rates
 John Erb, a principal in New York with the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm, said in commenting on the annual survey that some of the reasons for the higher costs in the Northeast were government-set hospital rates in New York and New Jersey that barred employers from negotiating discounts; the high prevalence of unions resisting efforts to make workers pay more of their medical bills; more state-required types of coverage, like podiatry, and higher regional living costs.
He also said the averages reflected the severe recession in the Northeast.
"Typically, younger, healthier people get laid off, leaving an older work force," Mr. Erb said. Older workers on average have higher medical expenses.
Kenneth Sperling, a health-care consultant in Rowayton, Conn., with Hewitt Associates, said hospitals and doctors in the Northeast had long been more resistant to health maintenance organizations and employer-discount networks than other regions.
The resistance is softening, he said, because many medical "providers are afraid that if they don't get control of health-care costs, the Federal Government will move in, and they will be worse off." He added, "Most likely, everybody would be paid according to a Medicare fee schedule in a price-regulated system."
 
'Fee for Service' Costs
 Nationwide, medical costs in traditional "fee for service" plans, which pay medical providers for each service performed, rose by 13 percent, to $3,573, down from 20 percent the year before, as more employers required workers to pay more of their own bills, the Foster Higgins survey showed.
Mr. Erb said the 13 percent level would probably not be repeated; trends show the rise will again be about 20 percent this year because the basic causes of medical-cost inflation have not been controlled.
H.M.O. and discount health plan rates have been rising at a slower pace, 12 percent to 14 percent, in the last few years.
Mr. Sperling of Hewitt said a survey of 12 large insurance companies had shown fee-for-service rates rising by 22 percent for 1992 and H.M.O. rates up by 13.6 percent.
 
10.7% Rise Expected
 Federal economists estimate that national spending for medical care will increase by 10.7 percent this year, to $817 billion, or 14 percent of the gross national product.
Foster Higgins said about two-thirds of the employers surveyed in its study were offering to pay for health maintenance organizations. A third of their employees had joined. H.M.O. participation was lowest in the Middle Atlantic States, at 24 percent, and in New England, at 31 percent. In the West, an H.M.O. stronghold, 41 percent were members.
Foster Higgins said 2,409 private and government employers responded to their survey. Half had 500 or more employees and half had fewer than that.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Plans New Taxes And Job Cuts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins will propose more big cuts in spending for long-term construction projects, new taxes on gasoline and automobiles, higher income taxes on commuters and a four-year freeze in property tax rates when he presents his preliminary budget for New York City on Thursday, city officials said yesterday.
The Mayor must present a plan for closing a $1.8 billion gap in the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. He must also show how he proposes to keep the budget balanced over the next four years, in hopes of winning support for a $1 billion bond deal with the Municipal Assistance Corporation to ease the pain of spending and service cuts. 
 Final details are still being ironed out, but city officials said last night that the plan would call for cutting a total of about 20,000 full-time jobs by mid-1996 from the 220,000 that were on the city payroll in June, mostly through attrition. That is about 4,000 more jobs than were to be eliminated in the city's most recent plans, which fiscal monitors faulted as inadequate.
 
New Revenues Sought
 The capital budget, which finances building projects through the sale of long-term bonds, would be cut $3.7 billion over four years, to $8.5 billion, to save money on bond repayments that were projected to swallow one-fifth of city tax revenues by 1996. Officials said the proposal would produce perhaps only $5 million in savings next year, growing to $250 million a year by 1996. They said that the Mayor would keep his pledge to speed up capital spending to boost the economy in the next 18 months, though construction industry representatives said the cuts would still be devastating.
But even as the administration proposes the capital cuts, it will seek new revenue sources, including a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax and a 1 percent tax on the value of automobiles, to finance a new bridge maintenance authority. Those taxes have been proposed unsuccessfully in the past, and will face an uphill battle in the State Legislature, which has toyed with raising gas taxes to help balance the state budget.
The Mayor will also face a fight with the Legislature over his proposal to increase the city income tax on commuters, an idea always hotly resisted by powerful suburban lawmakers. But in a twist that it hopes will gain support in Albany, City Hall proposes to relieve suburban New York counties of some of the taxes they now pay to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In other words, only commuters from New Jersey and Connecticut would ultimately bear the income tax increase.
 
Property-Tax Freeze
 The administration will propose raising the rate for commuters who are wage earners to .75 percent, from .45 percent, and for self-employed commuters to .95 percent, from .65 percent.
Mr. Dinkins had earlier pledged a two-year freeze in property-tax rates, but he will now extend that to four years, aides said, under continuing pressure from the City Council and the real-estate lobby. He will make up the difference by proposing to extend permanently a three-year surcharge on the city personal income tax that was imposed last year. That would keep the top income tax rate at 4.46 percent.
Some of the capital budget cuts would simply delay projects not scheduled to start for several years. But they come on top of $2.9 billion in capital cuts already made in the last year, and would postpone indefinitely some projects that had been scheduled to begin soon, including a 1,000 bed jail on Staten Island that local residents have vigorously opposed. The cuts would also delay for at least four years the building of a dozen schools and major school repairs.
The administration has proposed the cuts under pressure from bond-rating agencies, which have threatened to lower the city's bond rating because of concern about the burdens on the budget. City officials said they decided it was better to choose where to cut now, rather than risk losing ready access to the bond market and thus further reducing their options.
In a statement explaining the capital spending cuts, the Mayor said spending for bridge reconstruction, courts, libraries and cultural institutions would remain untouched, as would water and sewer projects, which are backed by separate bonds.
But Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, a trade group for the heavy construction industry, said the proposed cuts would cost the industry between 21,000 and 35,000 jobs in the next four years, depending on what projects are eliminated.
"I can't believe that this mayor is proposing to do this at a time when the City of New York has super-high unemployment in the construction industry and at a time when the city can get bargain basement prices for the work," he said. The association estimates that about half of all construction workers in the city are out of work.
 
Garbage Fees Considered
 First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said the administration was especially concerned about not damaging the economy further, and that was why it has proposed most of the cuts for the third and fourth years of the plan. He said the plan was not inflexible, and that the city would continue to explore other revenue sources -- including new fees for garbage collection that could finance sanitation projects -- and to lobby for more Federal construction money.
Mr. Steisel said the city had decided to delay jail construction because new efforts to speed court processing and send more inmates to state jails, together with a drop in felony arrests, had relieved presssure on city cells that had been bursting at the seams. If new needs develop, he said, the city could quickly erect inflatable units on the Staten Island site.
Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, a bitter opponent of the jail, praised the delay, but attacked a proposed 80 percent cut in capital spending for ferries that serve his borough.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Profits Fall For ARCO And Phillips

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 27

 BODY:
ARCO and the Phillips Petroleum Company reported sharply lower earnings today for the fourth quarter, steeper declines than oil companies with broader international operations like Exxon, Mobil and Texaco have reported.
The Unocal Corporation, which like ARCO and Phillips Petroleum operates primarily in the United States, reported a small loss for the quarter. 
 ARCO said net income fell 52.7 percent; Phillips Petroleum reported a decline of 66.7 percent for the quarter, and Unocal said it lost $16 million.
Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas, weak demand for refined products in the United States and one-time charges against earnings contributed to lower earnings at ARCO and Phillips Petroleum. Unocal said its loss resulted from special charges against earnings.
C. J. Silas, chairman and chief executive of Phillips Petroleum, said, "We haven't seen any upturn in the economy as far as our operations are concerned."
Following are details from the three companies' earnings reports:
 
ARCO
 ARCO, the nation's eighth-largest oil company, said its net income fell to $268 million, or $1.67 a share, from $566 million, or $3.45 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenues fell 15.9 percent, to $4.83 billion from $5.74 billion.
The company, based in Los Angeles, said earnings from drilling and production activities plunged to $197 million in the quarter, from $553 million in the period a year ago. But other business segments reported profits close to the totals a year ago.
Profits in refining and marketing slipped to $48 million, from $54 million, but rose from pipeline and other transportation activities to $65 million, from $58 million, and in chemicals to $67 million, from $63 million. A gasoline pricing war on the West Coast, ARCO's primary retailing area, eased in the recent quarter.
For the year, ARCO's earnings fell 64.7 percent, to $709 million, or $4.39 a share, from $2.01 billion, or $12.15 a share. ARCO took a $295 million charge against earnings in the third quarter when it announced layoffs and operating cutbacks because of anticipated low natural gas prices.
Without the charge, ARCO's 1991 profits would have been roughly $1 billion, or $6.21 a share. Revenues for 1991 fell 3.5 percent, to $18.16 billion from $18.81 billion. The company's average price for crude, which ARCO produces mainly from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay region, slipped to $12.93 a barrel in 1991 from $16.56 in 1990.
ARCO's share price rose 25 cents today, to $108, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Phillips Petroleum
 Phillips Petroleum, the nation's 10th-largest oil company, said its net income was $79 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $237 million, or 92 cents a share. Revenue for the company, based in Bartlesville, Okla., fell 24.1 percent, to $3.37 billion from $4.44 billion.
If several special items were excluded from the two reporting periods, like the gain of $256 million in the recent quarter from property insurance payments related to a fatal 1989 explosion at its Houston chemical complex, net income would have fallen further, to $48 million from $294 million.
Most of the one-time gains in the recent quarter were offset by a $244 million write-down of the company's stake in the Point Arguello field off the California coast, where production has been limited by local and state regulators.
For the year, net income fell 66.9 percent, to $258 million from $779 million. Revenues declined 5.2 percent, to $13.26 billion from $13.98 billion.
The company's share price fell 12.5 cents today, to $24.25, in trading on the Big Board.
 
Unocal
 The company's $16 million loss in the quarter compares with net income of $38 million, or 16 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue for the Los Angeles-based company fell 18 percent, to $2.77 billion from $3.38 billion.
Excluding special charges, net income would have been $31 million, or 13 cents a share, in the recent quarter, compared with $111 million, or 47 cents a share, in the period a year ago. The charges in the recent quarter included $62 million for canceled or scaled-back projects at the Los Angeles refinery and a chemical plant near Sacramento, Calif.
Earnings from exploration and production fell to $105 million, from $222 million in the period a year ago. But refining profits improved, to $50 million from $17 million. Average prices for total crude sales fell to $16.33 a barrel, from $26.26 a barrel in the final quarter of 1990.
For the year, earnings plunged 89.8 percent, to $73 million, or 31 cents a share, from $401 million, or $1.71 a share. Revenues slipped 7.7 percent, to $10.90 billion from $11.81 billion.
Unocal's share price fell 50 cents today, to $22.625, in trading on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Killing Casts a Rare Light On Gay Life in Suburbia

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH BELLMORE, L.I., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Nobody at Pal Joey's wanted to talk much about Henry Marquez, the dark-haired Texas dreamer who loved old cars, country music and Hamptons beaches. At the gay bar, where one would expect outrage at a gay-bashing episode that the police said led to Mr. Marquez's death, the silence instead ran cold, immutable and deep.
The attack on Mr. Marquez at a parking lot near Pal Joey's last month has thrown an unwelcome spotlight on gay life in the suburbs, a shadowy world between the pride, bravado and activism of Christopher Street in Manhattan and the exuberant summer retreats on Fire Island and the Hamptons. 
 Gay-rights advocates say gay life on Long Island is often muted by half truths meant to protect double lives. Many gay men and women here are married and have children, and, like many suburbanites, moved to Long Island to escape the anxieties of urban life.
While bias incidents have become a rallying cry for gay-rights groups in New York City, they remain largely a topic of hushed conversation here and have gone all but unreported to the police, gay-rights advocates say.
"A lot of people move to Long Island because they want to get away from things in general," said Ted Oneto, director of the Long Island Act Up, a group involved in AIDS issues. "To be confronted on a hard-core issue, a lot of them turn their backs."
 
Confronting Apathy
 To be sure, the death of Mr. Marquez, a 26-year-old customs agent, has roused many gay residents of Long Island. They are angered by the Nassau County District Attorney's decision to charge Mr. Esposito with manslaughter instead of murder.
But these attempts to organize say more about the community's weakness than its solidarity. A protest Thursday morning at the Nassau County Courthouse drew less than a dozen people, and a weekend vigil in North Bellmore began at the railroad station, in part to accommodate people coming from New York City.
"In terms of solidarity, it's the ostrich effect," said James Darragh, a philosophy professor and journalist in Old Westbury who is gay.
 
Few Reported Attacks
 The Nassau County police say there were four reported incidents of anti-gay bias in 1991, the same number in 1990, and five in 1989. The Suffolk County Police anti-bias unit counted nine gay-bashing incidents last year, up from four in each of the two previous years. But few people, including the chief of Suffolk County's anti-bias unit, Detective Sgt. Joseph Zito, believe the figures give an accurate measure of insults and attacks against gay people on Long Island.
One part of the problem is New York State law, which does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and leaves gay people open to losing jobs and housing, said Sandy Rapp, political director of the East End Gay Organization and author of "God's Country," a book on gay civil rights.
"When you have a group for whom civil rights protections are not in place," Ms. Rapp said, "they are unlikely to report an incident in which they are identified as being gay."
But the difficulty in reporting an attack usually extends beyond the legal and economic risks. If the details of the attack leak out, it can also lead to the victim being ostracized.
"The suburbs, and especially Long Island, like to perceive themselves as a homogeneous group," said a salesman who knew Mr. Marquez and asked that his name not be used. "Everyone wants to be with their own kind. And when somebody's different, they really hold it against you."
A friend of Mr. Darragh, who did not want to be identified, said he was attacked at a gay bar in Suffolk last year. Divorced and living with his parents, who still display his wedding picture in the living room, the man could not bring himself to tell them he had been lured out of a gay bar and assaulted. It was two days before he was able to return home.
In that time, he replayed the attack in his mind: the teen-ager who asked if he was gay, and then blocked the door back into the bar; the bar patrons hearing his cries and coming outside to help; friends of his attacker running over from the gas station next door, swinging golf clubs; the bar owner calling his customers inside and locking the door, and the horrifying realization that one man had mistakenly been locked out and was being beaten.
For hours, the man grappled with whether to press charges, fearful of word spreading that he had been in a gay bar. Others were equally ambivalent about pressing charges: The owner of the bar wanted to report it, the man who had been locked out and battered with golf clubs did not.
After the attack, the victim felt singled out, identifiable as gay. He found himself thinking: "They're after me. They hate me. I was a white male, I was accepted, and now I feel I'm the lowest-class person."
The fear of being unmasked apparently prevailed the night Mr. Marquez died. Then, two men taunted people and used a car to run them down in the parking lot near Pal Joey's, a popular cruising spot for gay men, an hour and half before they struck Mr. Marquez. One man jumped for cover behind a phone booth. And Mr. Marquez was escaping the men when he jumped in his car and they hunted him down, ramming his car into a tree.
But nobody called for help that night. When one witness, a gay man, called the police days later, he did so after much soul searching, and used a public telephone, a friend of his said.
"It was lucky for us two of the witnesses were not gay," said Sgt. William Cocks, of the Nassau County homicide unit. The police arrested a 29-year-old unemployed handyman, Angelo Esposito, in the killing.
In a strange way, Mr. Marquez might have understood the reticence of the witnesses. "If Henry had survived this," one of his friends said, "I don't think he would be thrilled to be the center of all this controversy. If he had survived, he probably wouldn't have reported it."

HEADLINE: Hammer-and-Sickle Falls Out of Fashion in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Drawing back from a 70-year effort to bring Marx to Brazil's masses, the Brazilian Communist Party has voted to drop the hammer and sickle as its symbol and to change its name to the Popular Socialist Party.
The party, which is stressing democracy and socialism, abandoned its name Sunday night in a raucous congress marked by egg-throwing and name-calling. Last fall, as a struggle over the party's future deepened, reform leaders took out a 10-year patent on the party's old name to prevent others from using it, and orthodox members retaliated by breaking into party offices and carrying to safety portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin. 
 As the insults of "Czarist" and "Stalinist" faded away from the weekend congress, the end of the Communist Party marked the end of Brazil's oldest political party. During most of this century, the party, the largest Communist organization in Latin America before it was eclipsed by Cuba's, exerted a powerful influence over Brazilian intellectual life but also became an obsession for American diplomats stationed here, beginning in the 1920's.
 
Impetus for a Coup
 Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, a visiting scholar at Columbia University who recently finished a history of the party, said that during the 1960's, diplomatic cables analyzing the party left here for Washington at the rate of once a week.
Legal only for nine years since it was organized in 1922, the Communist Party won attention in 1935 for attempting a left-wing military uprising. In an electoral high-water mark, the party won 10 percent of the national vote in Brazil's 1945 presidential election.
"Fear of the Communists' growing influence was one of the great rationales for the United States support of a 1964 military coup," said Thomas E. Skidmore, a Brown University historian who has written several books on Brazilian political history.
During the military government, which lasted until 1985, about 6,000 party members were arrested and many were tortured and killed, according to Francisco Almeida, a longtime militant who is leader of the new party.
But after legalization in 1985, the party suffered from competition from the Workers' Party, which is not Marxist, and from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Anatoly Smirnov, former head of the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party, disclosed this month that from 1973 to 1987, the Soviet party had paid the Brazilian party a yearly subsidy of $300,000.
Wielding influence beyond its numbers, party membership included members of Brazil's small intellectual elite -- journalists, architects, musicians, filmmakers and novelists.
Noting the party's influence in promoting economic nationalism, Mr. Skidmore said, "For many Brazilians in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's, their contact with the party defined their politics in later life."
Today, a Marxist-Leninist splinter group is led by Oscar Niemeyer, the 84-year-old architect of Brazil's interior capital, Brasilia.
 
Is Communism Dead? 'Baloney'
 "All this talk that Communism is dead is baloney," Mr. Niemeyer was quoted as saying today in O Globo newspaper. Last August, the architect hailed the coup attempt in the Soviet Union. Last week, he defended the execution of a saboteur in Cuba.
"Cuba is the last trenchline for democracy, and Fidel is loved by his people," said Mr. Niemeyer, referring to President Fidel Castro. Last month, after 46 years as a militant, Mr. Niemeyer reluctantly resigned from the Brazilian Communist Party and signed a membership card for the new group, called simply the Communist Party.
Foreseeing a split last fall, leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party formally filed for a 10-year patent on their name and on their symbols.
"It's like any other trademark," said Mr. Almeida, general secretary of what was registered today as the Popular Socialist Party. "When Esso started calling itself Exxon, it took preventive measures."

HEADLINE: Disney Earnings Up by 22%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that its profits improved 22 percent in the most recent quarter, as several lucrative movies compensated for weak attendance at the company's theme parks.
Disney said earnings for the quarter that ended on Dec. 31 rose to $208.1 million, or $1.56 a share, from $170.4 million, or $1.28 a share, a year earlier. 
 Revenues rose 30 percent to $1.94 billion, from $1.49 billion.
It was the first time in more than a year that the entertainment company posted higher earnings for a quarter, as Disney theme parks have suffered the effects of the recession.
Disney also said its board raised the company's quarterly dividend 20 percent, to 21 cents a share from 17.5 cents.
The company credited the results for the latest quarter to a strong performance from its film business, led by the hit animated movie "Beauty and the Beast" and the videocassette release of the classic "Fantasia." "Beauty and the Beast" has grossed $99.2 million at box offices in the United States.
Before the earnings were announced, Disney stock closed today at $132.50, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: In the Retail Desert, Fortunoff Is Planting a Mall on L.I.

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTBURY, L.I., Jan. 27

 BODY:
Macy's, 47th Street Photo and other big-name retailers are in various stages of bankruptcy, but Alan Fortunoff is undaunted. He is putting his family's housewares and jewelry business on the line with plans to build a $194 million shopping center here.
Standing in the middle of 69 acres of barren blacktop in the heart of Nassau County, Mr. Fortunoff envisioned a mall that will employ more than 3,000 people and, by his estimate, pump $352 million annually into the depressed local economy. 
 "When we moved out here from Brooklyn in 1964, people told us we shouldn't go out to the suburbs." Mr. Fortunoff said. "We'd been operating in Brooklyn for 42 years, and a lot of our advice from well-wishers and bankers was, 'Stay put, don't risk it.' "
And now, 28 years later, he's doing it again. "And this time, financing is not so easy to find," he said. "Things have changed. But it's time again for renewal."
 
A Basement Headquarters
 Since the Fortunoffs opened their business in a small shop on Livonia Avenue in the East New York section of Brooklyn in 1922, it has grown into a chain with estimated 1991 sales of $360 million and stores in Wayne, Woodbridge and Paramus, N.J., one on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and one here on the building site, where Mr. Fortunoff has his headquarters in a basement office filled with pictures of his family, including his six children and two grandchildren.
"As a private, family-owned business, we personally guarantee our debt," Mr. Fortunoff said. "And unlike some public corporations, we are not free to walk away from our debt." Mr. Fortunoff declined to say how much the family was borrowing for the project, but said he was dealing with a consortium of banks, including National Westminster, Citibank and First Fidelity.
Mr. Fortunoff said he was "well aware of the risks" he was taking with the expansion of his store here and construction of the mall, to be called the Long Island Galleria. The plan includes a 971,500-square-foot mall featuring a renovated Fortunoff, two other major retailers and approximately 100 specialty shops. In addition, there will be a 401,600-square-foot warehouse store for the Price Club, one of the fastest-growing retail chains in the nation. No other stores are as yet committed to the mall.
Kim Walin, a retail analyst at Lehman Brothers, said that because Fortunoff as a private company is not required reveal its finances, there was no quick way to assess the risks of the mall venture. However, she said Fortunoff's situation was entirely different from that of Macy's, which filed for bankruptcy protection today because of debt problems.
"Macy's is a highly leveraged situation in which the critical problem was made worse by low cash flow," she said. "Fortunoff would not have the same kinds of problems."
Initially, Mr. Fortunoff planned an upscale mall with Neiman Marcus as an anchor. But the deal fell through in late 1990 after the recession took hold. "Here we were, disappointed, then Sol Price appeared in March of 1991," Mr. Fortunoff said. "And after I paid a visit to some of his Price Clubs and did some research, my mind opened up to a whole new range of possibilities."
Price Club limits its inventory to 3,000 items, all well-advertised national brands that are popular with consumers who buy in bulk at only a 10 percent markup after paying an annual $25 membership fee.
The change from upscale stores, like Neiman Marcus, to the Price Club, has pleased some area residents.
"If we're going to get more stores, we want to be sure they're ones we can use," said Shelley Lotenberg, who for the last 11 years has been an active leader of a civic association in Salisbury, a residential area east of Fortunoff. Until recently she was an opponent of the mall.
"We're now for it because Fortunoff has agreed to scale it down and implement many of our recommendations," she said.
More support for the project has come from a coalition of regional business and labor organizations, including 100 Black Men of Nassau-Suffolk, the Long Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Long Island Forum for Technology.
"It's the right project for the right time," said James D. Rice, president of 100 Black Men, who said the mall would provide badly needed jobs for the island's minority community.
Paul Amoruso, managing partner of Oxford and Simpson, a commercial real-estate adviser in Jericho, L.I., said, "The advent of the Price Club was a good match for Fortunoff." He said that the real risk for Mr. Fortunoff was to do nothing with his property.
Construction is to begin this spring, if the final zoning permits are granted by the Town of Hempstead, which is to hold a hearing on the project on Tuesday.
Mr. Fortunoff estimates the Galleria will employ 3,540 permanent, full-time employees with an annual payroll of $97 million. He expects the mall to directly generate $40.8 million in annual sales-tax revenue and at least $7 million in property-tax revenue. Nassau County alone would receive $25.5 million as its share of the sales-tax revenue.
It was a sharp decline in sales-tax revenues that forced the Nassau County government earlier this month to cut spending and schedule the layoff of more than 3,000 county employees.

HEADLINE: THE MACY'S BANKRUPTCY;
Reality Spoiled Merchant's Dream

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Edward S. Finkelstein tried everything to avoid bankruptcy -- catchy advertising, sales, cajoling suppliers, tapping his circle of wealthy friends to stump up more cash. But in the end, there was nothing the 66-year-old chairman of R. H. Macy & Company, who was once hailed as a marketing miracle worker, could do to keep his debt-laden empire afloat.
A man known as brilliant, thin-skinned and at home with hyperbole, Mr. Finkelstein (the last syllable is pronounced STEEN) repeatedly made optimistic predictions for Macy -- and repeatedly fell short of those goals. "Finkelstein really believed his own rhetoric," said one investment banker familiar with the company. 
 The recession and the slump in consumer spending clearly magnified the problems at Macy, but its cash squeeze was largely a creation of Mr. Finkelstein's vision and strategy.
 
A Burdensome Debt
 The $3.5 billion buyout that Mr. Finkelstein led in 1986 placed a considerable burden on the company. Yet, according to analysts, the real mistake was stretching to pay $1.1 billion to buy the I. Magnin and Bullock's department store chains in 1988. That deal increased the amount of cash Macy had to generate simply to make the interest payments on its debt, and it came just as the economy was softening.
"That was Macy's major strategic blunder," said Louis W. Stern, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's graduate school of management. "It just killed them."
The 1988 purchase was championed by Mr. Finkelstein against the initial objections of at least one influential board member, Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation and of CBS Inc., one person familiar with the board room debate said. A corporate conservative of the old school, chary of taking on debt and pessimistic about the economic outlook, Mr. Tisch apparently thought that Mr. Finkelstein's expansion plans were overly ambitious.
When Mr. Finkelstein prevailed, the deal went through, and Macy, saddled with debt and high interest costs, was irrevocably headed for financial trouble.
 
A Rescue Falters
 Last week, Mr. Tisch emerged as Macy's last hope against bankruptcy with a $1 billion bid to purchase the company. But his offer required significant concessions from creditors, and when the Prudential Insurance Company of America declined to go along, the offer foundered.
The first real warning sign of trouble at Macy was its disappointing Christmas season of 1989. Mr. Finkelstein and his staff had misjudged the consumer mood, ordering far more goods than were purchased, leaving the stores with a surplus of costly inventory. The cost of maintaining the inventory reduced Macy's cash flow, the lifeblood a leveraged-buyout company needs to pay its banks.
It became a familiar pattern, retail analysts say. Mr. Finkelstein would declare a recovery in store traffic to be imminent, goods were ordered based on that optimism, and the sales season would be a disappointment.
To be sure, Mr. Finkelstein was not alone in underestimating the depth of the consumer recession, especially in the Northeast. "Macy's made some mistakes, but the retail industry has generally been very weak," said Meredith Adler, an analyst for the First Boston Corporation. "And nobody really predicted that it was going to be this bad."
 
Well-Trodden Path
 Macy is merely the latest big retailer to seek refuge from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law, following a path forged by Federated, Allied, Ames and others. The financial rationale for the leveraged buyouts in retailing was that stores generate a great deal of cash to pay off loans. Besides, real estate values were racing ahead in the 1980's and retail chains owned valuable properties, which served as collateral for all the loans.
In addition, the payoff for the insiders looked handsome. For example, the lowest level of participation in the 1986 buyout for the 300-strong Macy management team was $75,000. The projected payback for a $75,000 investment, when Macy was expected to be sold to the public sometime in the 1990's, was $1.5 million -- a twentyfold return. Mr. Finkelstein, who invested $4.4 million, would have received $88 million if that calculation proved accurate.
Instead, analysts say, the initial investors are likely to get less than a dime for each dollar they put up.
Chapter 11 bankruptcy tends to favor existing management, giving them court protection from creditors while they try to reorganize the company. So Mr. Finkelstein, who was paid $1.1 million in salary and other cash compensation last year, should remain at the helm for the foreseeable future. One son, Daniel, runs Macy's California stores; another son, Mitchell, runs the company's Hong Kong buying office.
 
Praise From Analyst
 Mr. Finkelstein may have failed to sustain the debt-financed corporate giant he built, but he still remains highly respected as a retailer. "He's a great merchant," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant and former Macy's manager.
Since he joined Macy in 1948, after earning an M.B.A. from Harvard, Mr. Finkelstein has shown a flair for marketing. In the early 1970's, he overhauled the merchandising and image of Macy's California, to have the chain cater to a more affluent and stylish clientele. One innovation was establishing the basement of Macy's San Francisco store as a cheery mart filled with the latest in housewares and renamed the Cellar.
Later, he was promoted back to New York and engineered an even more impressive overhaul of Macy's once-drab flagship store on 34th Street.
"If he had stuck with what he knows best -- style-picking -- he would go down as one of the great retailers of our time instead of taking Macy's into bankruptcy court," said Alan Millstein, editor of Fashion Network Report, a retail newsletter.

HEADLINE: New York City Slips in Survey on Why Businesses Leave

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
On the two issues that most affect business decisions to relocate, New York City's performance is significantly worse than it was five years ago, a survey of city business leaders has found.
When asked to rate 15 considerations that might affect a company's location, 74.9 percent of those interviewed cited the overall cost of conducting business and 60.6 percent cited citywide security as extremely important. Of those choosing these two issues, more than 80 percent said they thought New York was worse off now than it was five years ago. 
 The survey, whose results were released on Sunday, was done by Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, for the New York City Partnership, a trade group that represents large companies.
The accounting firm interviewed 299 top executives drawn randomly and in equal proportions from Dun & Bradstreet's list of small, medium and large companies based in the city in six industries: financial services, manufacturing, business services, health care, tourism and media.
 
An Emerging Concern
 Ronald K. Shelp, president of the Partnership, said public security has only recently emerged as such a prime area of concern. In a more limited survey of his organization's members in 1987-1988, the issue did not rank as one of the top issues.
Only two other factors in the latest survey were considered extremely important -- proximity to markets and clients, and accessibility of land, air and water transportation -- and on those issues New York scored fairly well compared with five years ago. Despite all the criticisms of the city's fiscal problems by the business community, only 38 percent of those surveyed cited that issue as extremely important in making decisions about where to locate their operations.
The executives interviewed found many good things to say about a New York City location. Almost 70 percent, for instance, said they thought the quality of the upper-level work force was the same as or better than competing cities. About 60 percent said the same of midlevel employees, compared with 43 percent who felt that way about entry-level workers.
Of those who said telecommunications was extremely important to their companies, 93 percent said New York had either stayed the same or improved in the five years.
As for what the government could do to help keep corporate operations in the city, actions considered extremely important were reducing business taxes, improving citywide security, cutting red tape and improving public education.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Commercials Offer a Fairly Ho-hum Bowl

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Super Bowl XXVI may have turned out super for the Washington Redskins, but as for the commercials, it was a Satisfactory Bowl, maybe merely an Adequate Bowl, at best.
Compared with some Super Sundays of yore, the audacious, attention-at-any-cost creativity seemed noticeably absent from the 27 or so minutes of extravagantly expensive spots that cost a record $850,000 for each 30 seconds. 
 Instead of producing a blockbuster like Apple Computer's anti-Orwellian "1984," Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. delivered a disappointing series of spots for Reebok International Ltd. The five commercials teased viewers with the prospect of a duel between two American decathletes, only to disclose later that the contest must await the Summer Olympics.
Instead of creating a captivating catch phrase like "You got the right one baby, uh-huh," which BBDO Worldwide unveiled for Diet Pepsi during last year's Super Bowl, the agency brought forth the somewhat dated clunker "Gotta have it," for Pepsi-Cola, recalling the instant gratification of the 1980's.
Then there was the parade of advertisers like Advil, Gillette, Kellogg, Sudafed and U S Sprint which presented their everyday fare.
"It was like only a few people dressed up for the prom," said Nina DiSesa, executive vice president and executive creative director at J. Walter Thompson Chicago, "and the rest came in their casual clothes."
Ms. DiSesa was one of four advertising executives around the country who were asked to critique the commercials that almost two dozen advertisers bought during CBS's telecast of the game. In their comments yesterday, they singled out some commercials for harsh castigation or effusive praise. And some, they noted, like Pepsi's and McDonald's changing slogans, made marketing news. But their overall response echoed Peggy Lee: "Is that all there is?"
Relative to past Super Sundays, "it was kind of subdued," said Anita K. Hersh, president and chief operating officer of Lister Butler Inc., a corporate identity and image consulting company in New York. "Except for a few highlights, it was recession advertising -- no luxury, no glitz."
Asked about the Reebok spots, Jeff Atlas, chairman of Atlas Citron Haligman & Bedecarre in San Francisco, replied, "I guess I'll see them at the Olympics, but I don't want to."
The executives also disapproved of a spot from Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Pacific for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., celebrating the workers at the company's Georgetown, Ky., plant, who build the Toyota Camry.
While the spot was timely in the wake of strained American-Japanese relations, "it's already old news," said Joey Reiman, chairman and chief executive of Babbit & Reiman Advertising Inc. in Atlanta, because "people are going to buy quality," regardless of where a car is made. (As part of its continuing "Putting quality on the road" campaign, by McCann-Erickson, General Motors ran three spots telling consumers that G.M. had "heard your demands" for quality.)
The ad critics were also lukewarm about three commercials, from Leo Burnett U.S.A., for the Seven-Up Company, which paired the red Spot character in recent campaigns for 7Up and Diet 7Up with the brands' famous "uncola" slogan.
"Three un-commercials," Mr. Reiman said. "They talked about Diet Pepsi and Diet Coke more than about Diet 7Up, so they didn't sell the product."
Still, Ms. DiSesa put it, "The worst commercial was better than the halftime show." In fact, the halftime entertainment was such a bore -- a salute to snow -- that CBS pulled national ads from the show fearing, correctly as it turned out, that viewers were switching to a stunt on the Fox network.
Of the ad highlights, one was a 60-second Nike commercial by Wieden & Kennedy Inc., called "Hare Jordan/ Air Jordan," that teamed an animated Bugs Bunny with a live Michael Jordan in a wacky basketball game against four miscreants.
"I hate saying, 'They do it again,' but they did," Mr. Atlas said, referring to the Nike slogan, "Just do it." The spot finished first in USA Today's fourth annual Ad Meter survey, in which 60 residents of the Detroit area were asked to rate the ads they liked and disliked.
There was also the reappearance of an old favorite: the arty, yet hard-selling, Master Lock commercial. For the third consecutive year, Cramer-Krasselt ran a 30-second spot in which opera music was played over shots of thieves who tried, and failed, to destroy Master Lock locks.
And, blessedly, for the first time since Super Bowl XXIII in 1989, viewers were spared the Bud Bowl, a goofy scrimmage between tiny animated bottles of Budweiser and Bud Light beers.
Though a Bud Bowl IV score was announced -- for the record, Budweiser beat Bud Light, 27-24 -- two spots by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles ignored the action in favor of showing a mishap-plagued consumer searching for a Bud Bowl sweepstakes ticket.
The bottles might not be gone for good, though. Tom Sharbaugh, vice president of Budweiser brands at Anheuser-Busch Inc., said yesterday that, yes, Bud Bowl would make a comeback next January.
Make-believe football games seemed much on the mind of Anheuser's executives. In another spot for Budweiser, $1.8 million was spent on animating pieces of paper to a compelling illusion of football players of the past and present playing a lightning-fast game atop a bar.
The advertising executives enjoyed two commercials by Burnett for the McDonald's Corporation, which replaced the fast-food chain's two most recent slogans, "McDonald's today" and "Food, folks & fun," with a plain-talking theme: "What you want is what you get."
The McDonald's spots "focused on basic values and touched an emotional chord," Ms. Hersh said. Ms. DiSesa echoed her approval: "I know I was being manipulated, but sometimes, if you're manipulated well, you don't mind."
It appeared that CBS was wise to manipulate the ad lineup during halftime. Overnight ratings from A. C. Nielsen showed that the Fox stunt, a live episode of its "In Living Color" series, sponsored by Frito-Lay's Doritos tortilla chips, attracted a strong 18.3 rating and a 27 share, compared with a 33.2 rating and 49 share for the halftime show. (The game itself in the overnight ratings drew a 40.4 rating and a 60 share.)
Each rating point represented 431,151 households in 25 markets; the share is the percentage of homes with televisions tuned in to the program.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Steady in a Light Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in slow trading yesterday, as credit market participants marked time before a number of important events are played out over the next week to 10 days.
Specifically, traders pointed to this evening's State of the Union Message, the confirmation hearings for the Federal Reserve chairnan, Alan Greenspan, on Wednesday -- a day when preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter economic growth are also expected -- and next week's announcement from the Treasury about the size and confirguation of its quarterly refunding auctions. 
 "All of these topics are prompting lots of speculation," said a government securities trader, who insisted on anonymity. "But it is not the kind of speculation people are willing to act on. It is the kind that puts people on the sidelines."
 
Few Surprises Expected
 Analysts and traders said that despite the nervousness about the sort of fiscal policy package that ultimately might emerge from Washington, President Bush's speech, the official kickoff of budget negotiations, was not likely to include many surprises.
"I don't think Bush's speech should evoke dramatic reactions, because the important parts have already been leaked to the press," said Samuel D. Kahan, the chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. "If he comes across appearing to be strong, then one can characterize the address as being successful."
Estimates of how the economy performed in the fourth quarter vary widely, but most Wall Street analysts project that the gross domestic product probably expanded slightly in the last three months of the year.
"It will be interesting to see what happens with the fiscal policy debate after this number prints," said Michael J. Moran, the chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., "because I think most people in Congress expect the number to be negative."
Mr. Moran said he expected the report to show that the economy expanded by eight-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter.
 
8% Bonds at 7.72%
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late in the day at a price of 103 1/4, down by an eighth of a point, to yield 7.72 percent, compared with 7.70 percent late on Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 3/4 late yesterday, down by 3/32 , to yield 7.24 percent. The 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 977/32 , up by 1/32 , to yield 6.88 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9914/32 , down by 2/32 , to yield 5.17 percent.
Rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills rose slightly at the weekly auction.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.84 percent, up from an average rate of 3.78 percent a week ago.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 3.93 percent, compared with an average rate of 3.84 percent at last week's auction.
 
Pfizer Note Sale
 Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a $250 million offering of five-year notes from Pfizer Inc.
The 6.50 percent securities were priced at $99.37, to yield 6.65 percent, 25 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/8 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
Lazard Freres & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
A bid from an investor group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company won a $250 million offering of first and refunding mortgage bonds issued by the Philadelphia Electric Company.
The securities, which mature in 1999, were reoffered with a 7.50 percent coupon at a price of $99.50, to yield 7.593 percnet, or 70 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
 
Citicorp Pricing Due
 The corporate market was also talking about an offering of $150 million in 10-year securities from Citicorp, which is expected to be priced today.
Among commercial banks, Citicorp is the largest issuer of corporate debt. But given its recent problems, the company has been absent from the market for some time.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Kia, of Korea, Plans to Sell Vehicles in U.S

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Kia Motors Corporation of South Korea said today that it would develop a dealer network in the United States to start selling subcompact cars and small sport-utility vehicles in 1993.
Kia, which is South Korea's No. 2 auto maker, after Hyundai, makes the Festiva subcompact distributed by Ford in the United States. Kia also announced that W. Gregory Warner, a former Hyundai Motor America executive, would oversee the North American project as chief operating officer. Mr. Warner, who is 48 years old, has been a consultant to Kia since November.
 
Quality Called Imperative
 Kia faces many challenges in the American market as it takes aim at sedan buyers whose choices include the acclaimed Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla models. Hyundai entered the American market in the late 1980's with a very strong start, but sales suffered after quality problems arose. In contrast, the Festiva made by Kia received a high reliability rating in the Consumer Reports 1991 car guide. 
 Mr. Warner said Kia would succeed with value and contemporary styling. He declined to specify prices.
Thomas Dukes, an auto industry analyst with J. D. Power & Associates, said Kia could not afford any missteps on quality, given Hyundai's past problems. "They'll need some serious customer satisfaction right out of the chute," he said.
Kia displayed its two American-bound models at the Tokyo Auto Show last fall. The designs of the sedan and sport-utility vehicle are more rounded and distinctive than competing models, and the vehicles do not resemble the Festiva. The sport-utility's powerplant will be unusual for its class: a 2-liter, 16-valve engine with dual overhead camshafts.
Kia will offer the sedan in 1993 and the sport-utility in 1994, starting on the East and West Coasts. Kia is also considering a convertible version of the sedan. Mr. Warner declined to disclose Kia's sales projections, saying only that it planned to sell 10,000 cars in the final six months of 1993.
 
 
Production Will Double
 In South Korea, Kia will double its current production capacity to roughly a million vehicles by 1995, and some analysts have said the move into the United States is necessary to support that expansion.
Kia has eight staff members at its North American office in Irvine, Calif. By the end of the year, the staff will grow to 130, Mr. Warner said.
Mr. Warner started his auto industry career at Ford as a marketing analyst. He joined Toyota in 1971 as product planning manager and handled several assignments before he moved to Hyundai in 1985. At Hyundai, which he left in 1990, he was executive vice president and chief operating officer.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices of Soybeans in Skid; Energy Products Higher

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Soybean futures skidded today on news of much-needed rain over Brazil's soybean fields, while strong demand and possible OPEC production cuts lifted energy prices.
 Weekend rains in Brazil, a formidable competitor in soybean production, are expected to enhance the developing Brazilian crop and weighed on futures in the United States. 
 "Until we see that pattern change, it will be hard to get people excited about soybeans," a floor broker said.
 Brisk farmer-to-elevator selling through the Midwest late Friday and over the weekend further depressed soybean values.
 March soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade tumbled 4.75 cents, to $5.76 3/4 a bushel, by the closing bell.
 
Corn Sales Seen
 News early in the session that Russia and the other Commonwealth of Independent States could buy more United States corn this week on the heels of last week's purchase buoyed Chicago corn prices early. However, farmers brought an ample supply of corn to market Friday and over the weekend, which undermined futures prices today.
 March corn fell 1.75 cents, to $2.62 a bushel, by the close.
 Wheat futures rallied early on news of a sale to the commonwealth, but relinquished early gains to finish mixed.
 March, July, September and December reached contract highs in the early going when local short-covering lifted prices. The jump touched off buy orders, sending wheat for March delivery to its lifetime high of $4.42 3/4 a bushel before closing 2 cents higher at $4.39 1/4 a bushel.
 In New York, strong demand for heating oil and reduced production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quietly buoyed energy futures.
 Prices rose early on a Middle East Economic Survey report that said voluntary cuts by OPEC members may point to more serious action to balance supply and demand at the Feb. 12 meeting.
 "Strength in heating oil is picking up the market, which is otherwise pretty quiet," said a Refco broker, Victor Yu.
 March crude oil gained 36 cents, to $19.36 a barrel, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. February heating oil climbed 0.69 cent, to 55.39 cents a gallon, and February gasoline rose 1.16 cents, to 54.85 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Machine-Tool Orders at a 4-Year Low in '91

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools tumbled to a four-year low last year as depressed automobile sales battered the industry, a trade group said in a report released yesterday.
But the Association for Manufacturing Technology said machine-tool orders surged in December, and analysts predicted that the manufacturing sector would rebound in 1992. 
 In its report, the trade group, based in McLean, Va., said machine-tool orders for 1991 totaled $2.64 billion, down by 11 percent from 1990 and the lowest total since $2.12 billion in 1987.
 
December Orders Up 46%
 But in December, new orders for machine tools rose to $336.85 million, a 46 percent increase from the previous month and up by 13.9 percent from $295.8 million in December 1990.
"We're closing out 1991 on a positive note," said Albert Moore, the organization's president.
Machine tools are used to cut and form parts for automobiles, airplanes and other durable goods, products expected to last at least three years. Although a relatively small industry, its performance is watched by economists as a guide to the general health of manufacturing.
Tool companies rely on the auto industry for 30 percent to 40 percent of their business. The squeeze in the automobile market, which has led car makers to cut back on production, has taken its toll on tool orders.
After a dismal 1991, analysts expect machine-tool orders to rise 8 percent to 30 percent this year.
"I think they're going to be right because when you're down as low as $2.6 billion, there's not much room to go down further," an industry spokesman said yesterday.
Even a 30 percent increase in orders would still leave the industry below 1990 levels, he noted.
 
Shipments Down 19%
 Shipments of machine tools, reflecting the lower orders, fell by 19 percent, to $2.77 billion last year, the lowest since shipments of $2.40 billion in 1988.
But December shipments totaled $282.3 million, up by 22.6 percent from a month earlier, but off by 19.5 percent from $350.5 million in December 1990, the association said.
Orders for export rose by 19.8 percent, to $58.10 million in December, from $48.5 million in November and were up by 36.9 percent from $42.45 million in December 1990.
Export shipments grew by 33.3 percent, to $46.2 million in December from $34.6 million in November, but the figure still represented a decline of 27.1 percent from $63.3 million in December 1990.
The group said the December order backlog was $1.43 billion, up from November's $1.38 billion. The December 1990 backlog was $1.47 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Sharp Gains; Group of 7 Meeting Is Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply yesterday against other leading currencies after a meeting of the major industrial nations over the weekend failed to indicate a preference on exchange rates.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations met near New York City but failed to say in their closing communique what moves they would like exchange rates to take. 
 Some traders had expected the meeting would seek to promote a stronger yen to help reduce Japan's bulging trade surplus and to help the United States' economic recovery.
"There was zero output from the meeting" on exchange rates, Jerry Egan, chief currency dealer at Bank of Boston in Boston, said, "and that removed one bit of tarnish against the dollar."
He said it now appeared the market would try to test how high the dollar would be allowed to go against the yen.
"There will be some tentative testing for the top to see where the tolerance of the central banks will be," he said.
The dollar finished at 125.23 yen in New York, up from 123.53 yen late Friday. It had been quoted earlier in London at 125.35 yen. It finished in Tokyo at 124.57 yen, the same as late Friday.
Mr. Egan said there were also some sharp moves by the dollar against the German mark, which he attributed mainly to traders' jockeying to establish positions in advance of President Bush's delivery of his State of the Union Message tonight.
The dollar finished at 1.6105 German marks in New York, up from 1.5950 late Friday.
The dollar was also strong against the British pound. The pound fell to $1.7825 in New York, from $1.7955 late Friday. In London, the pound fell to $1.7770, from $1.8070 late Friday.
Dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.4300 Swiss francs, up from 1.4165; 5.4840 French francs, up from 5.4375; 1,2009.25 Italian lire, up from 1.200.50, and 1.17325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16965.
In the precious metals market, gold for current delivery rose 40 cents an ounce, to $354.80, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $354.80 an ounce, up 30 cents from Friday's late bid.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Schooling Engineers in Environment

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
TOMORROW'S engineers -- and today's as well -- must be grounded in environmental science, says Dr. George S. Ansell, president of the Colorado School of Mines, in Golden, Colo. Two reasons he cited were the growing contamination of the environment and the need for a broader education to assure jobs.
"Our graduates have been getting jobs and with little trouble," he said in an interview last week. He contrasted that to the situation at many universities whose engineering graduates have difficulty finding jobs in the current market. He thinks that a requirement since 1984 that every student at the School of Mines take at least one course in environmental science is a helpful start. 
 Some of the engineers, physicists, computer scientists or geologists who receive their bachelor of science degrees at the school do more than take one course in the field. About 20 percent take a minor in environmental science, which requires about 18 hours of credits. In fact, the environmental science minor has become the school's most popular elective minor, Dr. Ansell said.
The department of environmental science was decreed by the trustees of the school, many of them active in the mining and other industrial areas, in 1981. That was three years before Dr. Ansell, a former professor and dean of the engineering school at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute, became president.
By 1984, the department of environmental science, one of the first in the nation, had one or two professors. Today it has 10 full-time professors and a half-dozen adjunct professors. The adjunct professors are typically nonacademics who work in the environmental field or professors who specialize in other fields at the school, like hydrology.
The Colorado School of Mines, one of the oldest engineering schools in the country, has 2,700 students, of which a third are working for graduate degrees. Currently 168 students are enrolled in the master's program in the environmental science department. It has become the school's largest graduate program.
Dr. Ansell cited a recent study by the University of California at Los Angeles that found 83 percent of college freshmen nationwide wanted to make a positive contribution to the environment and 21 percent wanted to work on environmental issues.
Environmental science is such a complex area that the school has come up with the following definition to help students understand the field: "The study of how physical, chemical and biological processes cause the movement and transformation of substances in natural systems and how these processes can be controlled to achieve desired effects within a structure of economic, legal and political constraints."
The political aspects have become especially significant, Dr. Ansell noted, because of current issues like exploration for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and possible revision of the Mining Law of 1872.
One interesting dispute involves the so-called brown cloud over Denver, which Dr. Ansell described as the product of "winter thermal invasions trapping airborne particulates in the Denver Basin."
Some groups blamed the local utility's coal-fired power plants and demanded that coal be replaced with natural gas. But the utility, a coal company and coal miners appealed to the state to intervene, and a study determined that most of the problem was caused by internal combustion engines.
With problems like these facing engineers, the school, one of the few master's programs in environmental science, offers two specialties. Dr. Ansell described one as "an environmental master of business administration degree" with a strong technical base. Students who select this track tend to become project managers in environment management, working for corporations or in the public sector.
The second track produces what Dr. Ansell calls environmental technologists who might focus on and monitor the movement of contaminants or waste management.
All the graduate students take a core program of 18 hours in courses like the natural environment, environmental law, environmental pollution, treatment of water and wastes and experimental design and data analysis.

HEADLINE: Home-Resale Rate Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The rate of sales of existing homes rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in December, a real estate trade group said today. It was the third gain in a row, and analysts called it a further confirmation of a modest housing revival.
Still, sales of previously owned homes fell to a six-year low in 1991, and most economists expect this year's rebound to be restrained. 
 "There's certainly no expectation that there is going to be a real surge," said Daryl Delano of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass.
But any increase in sales would be welcome after the decline of three-tenths of 1 percent last year, when sales dropped to 3.287 million units, according to figures compiled by the National Association of Realtors. That was the smallest total since 3.214 million units were sold in 1985.
Regionally, sales were mixed in December and for the year. They were up in the Northeast and the West at the end of the year, but down in the South and the Midwest. The Northeast and the Midwest posted annual gains, while the South and the West recorded losses.
Existing-home sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34 million units in December, the association said. They had jumped 4.7 percent in November and 1.3 percent in October.
Sales jumped 10 percent in December in the Northeast, to 550,000 units at an annual rate, and 1.3 percent, to 529,000 units, for the year.
In the West, sales also rose, up 3.8 percent, to a 550,000-unit rate, but were five-tenths of 1 percent below the 554,000 units sold a year earlier.
Sales in the Midwest fell 2.2 percent in December to a rate of 920,000 units. For 1991, however, they rose 1.1 percent, to 902,000 units.

Moonlighting In Moscow

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
A CARDIOLOGIST sees private patients to supplement his salary from a full-time hospital job, which pays him only 2,000 rubles a month, or $10. An office worker, who could afford to buy a small car two years ago, now cruises the streets in it, picking up taxi fares -- a growing freelance activity. And a woman sells plastic bags for 3 rubles apiece to shoppers leaving a high-priced farmer's market with fresh food in their arms. She had purchased the bags for less than half that price by standing in line at a state store.
Everywhere in the commonwealth, people are hustling for extra income to survive. "Poverty is the normal state of living in our country today," said Lev Timoteyev, an economist and writer. But "poverty" has a different, broader meaning here than in the United States. The word in America suggests slum-living, joblessness, school dropouts and a high crime rate. Here, poverty is a result of prices that have tripled or more for everyone, while wages have only doubled at best. It is as if an American family earning $40,000 suddenly had that reduced to $30,000 -- or maybe $25,000. 
 While government statistics in the United States offer authoritative reports on the relationship of prices to income, here such data are lacking and the subject of much guesswork. The most informed estimates probably come from Goskomstat, the old Soviet statistics agency that is now in the hands of the Russian Federation but still collecting data from all the republics.
Ilena Fravola, a cost-of-living expert at Gaskomstat, says the average monthly outlay for food and other essentials has risen to roughly 1,300 rubles for an individual, with people in the countryside getting by on as little as 400 to 500 rubles and Moscovites averaging 1,800 rubles. Before price ceilings were lifted on Jan. 2, living costs across the commonwealth averaged 340 rubles.
On the income side, the average jobholder now earns 800 to 1,000 rubles a month for a 40-hour week, Gaskomstat estimates. Those sums include not only wages and bonuses but also transfer payments, such as free meals on the job and state subsidies for children and maternity leave. The total is up from 300 to 400 rubles last fall.
Clearly, the average family budget is way out of balance, even allowing for the extended family tradition in which the elderly live with their children and grandchildren, and the earnings of every working family member are pooled, including the pensioner's meager 342 rubles a month.
The shortfall in family incomes raises two questions. First, why has the public accepted this plunge into poverty without widespread protests? Russians themselves suggest that they have not yet felt the consequences of their sudden setback, in part because families stockpiled food and other goods in anticipation of the upsurge in prices, and these dwindling stores still cushion their lives.
The second question is, what people can do to increase their incomes and save themselves from prolonged poverty. Is everyone -- like the cardiologist, the freelance taxi driver, the woman selling shopping bags or the numerous hucksters in Moscow's subway stations -- becoming sidelines entrepreneurs? These off-the-book activities are on the rise, but they are not the major source of extra income. In a land of jobholders, taking a second job is more common than trying to strike out on one's own.
Some 2.5 million people moonlighted in 1990, averaging 180 rubles a month in additional earnings, mostly from second jobs in the expanding private sector, says Viktor Barbashov, deputy director of Gaskomstat's division of labor statistics. And he says these numbers probably increased significantly in 1991.
Another popular activity is dubbed small enterprise. "A large organization surrounds itself with small, private companies that give people a chance to make money," said Abel G. Aganbegyan, director of the Academy of the National Economy in Russia. Mr. Aganbegyan, for example, permitted an entrepreneurial colleague to convert the academy's printing operation last year into a private publishing company, one that now subcontracts its services to the academy.
With the department's 20 employees as partners, the new company leased the academy's offset press, computers and other machinery. The lease payments have counted toward purchase of the equipment. And the new publishing house's personnel, working more efficiently than in the past, receive higher salaries from their enterprise than the state-financed academy would have been allowed to pay them, Mr. Aganbegyan said.
Poverty apparently is forcing many people not into rebellion, but into trying to live by their wits and by extra work. Or, as Aleksei E. Titkov, chairman of the Center for Humanitarian Studies, put it: "We used to talk about politics and social issues. Now we talk all the time about how to do business and make money."

HEADLINE: Shamans and Scientists Seek Cures in Plants

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
FOR ages, traditional remedies derived from plants were the primary form of medical care for the world's people, and for three-quarters of the global population they still are.
But in the United States, medical researchers have generally been lukewarm at best about investigating the undeniable curative properties of plants. This is not just a prejudice in favor of modern medicine; isolating specific plant compounds can be a difficult technical task. 
 That attitude is now changing. The chemical interaction of plant and animal compounds is better understood, robots are now available that can screen plant samples around the clock, and researchers are turning increasingly to plants in their search for cures to the worst maladies of our time, including AIDS, cancer and heart disease. The problem now is that the plants are disappearing, victims of tropical deforestation, faster than they can be investigated for their medical value.
Alarmed at the prospect, an improbable alliance has come riding to the rescue. It is made up of conservationists, pharmaceutical companies, academic scientists, traditional healers and the governments and entrepreneurs of developing countries. Although often suspicious of each other in the past, they are joining forces in the belief that tropical forests are vital to all their long-term interests and are worth more if preserved as economic assets than cut down for farmland.
The spearhead of this crusade is a pair of ingenious efforts to exploit the forests on behalf of medicine. The plans were described at a symposium last week at Rockefeller University in Manhattan. The gathering was organized jointly by the Rain Forest Alliance, a nonprofit conservation organization, and the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Economic Botany.
In one project, a Costa Rican research institute is prospecting for promising plants, microorganisms and insects to be screened for medical use by Merck & Company, the world's largest drug company. Merck, in turn, is supporting the prospecting effort financially and will share any resulting profits with Costa Rica.
The Costa Rican Government, which has set aside 25 percent of its land as forest preserves, will use the royalties and some of the initial payments to support its conservation efforts.
In the second enterprise, a small California company called Shaman Pharmaceuticals is tapping the expertise of traditional healers -- shamans, or medicine men -- in various parts of the tropics. Shaman, less than two years old, says it already appears to have made its first big "hit."
The company has isolated a compound from a medicinal plant in South America that it says is active against the influenza and herpes viruses. Shaman has filed a patent, and the drug is well into clinical trials. If it or other drugs ultimately generate profits, the company intends to promote conservation of the forests by channeling some of its profits back to the localities whose medicine men provided the key plants.
The theory behind both ventures is that everybody wins: the world gets new drugs, the pharmaceutical companies earn profits, and people in the tropics are justly compensated for their "intellectual property" and their collection efforts. In this way, the local people are encouraged to protect the source of the compensation and the forests are preserved, and thus able to fulfill vital ecological and environmental functions like stabilizing the planet's climate.
"It's out of the realm of an academic exercise now," Dr. Michael Balick, director of the Institute of Economic Botany, said of the concept. "You've got people whose lives depend on using the rain forest, and whose cultural traditions depend on having it available, and people whose businesses depend on new chemicals all sitting down to discuss these issues."
Chemical prospecting and intellectual property rights "are terms I'd never heard of," Richard Deertrack, tribal administrator in the Office of the War Chief at Taos Pueblo, N.M., and an herbalist who collects medicinal plants, told conferees as last week's meeting was ending. But by then, although he expressed concern that the rights and sensitivities of indigenous peoples be respected, he had heard enough to commend Merck and Shaman Pharmaceuticals.
The discovery in the 1930's of the curare plant, which provides a muscle relaxant, stimulated drug researchers' interest in plants for a time, as did the discovery in the 1960's that the rosy periwinkle could be used to treat childhood leukemia and Hodgkin's disease.
But more recently, although the National Institutes of Health was screening plants for medical use, the prevailing attitude in commercial laboratories was that "plant research was old-fashioned or even flaky," Christina Findeisen, a management consultant to the pharmaceutical industry, said at the meeting.
With increasing knowledge about the chemical mechanisms through which plant compounds act on disease, and especially with the advent of rapid, high-capacity, automated screening equipment, interest has revived and many drug companies are gearing up for plant research. Some have contracted with academic botanical gardens to obtain plant samples.
 
Discovery in India
 Reports by researchers at the symposium emphasized the potential of drugs derived from plants. In India, researchers have derived a compound from the native guggal tree that shows great promise in lowering levels of cholesterol and other harmful blood fats without side effects. Early in their research, they drew on a 2,500-year-old Sanskrit medical text. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals has isolated a drug from a tree found in China and India that shows promise in attacking lung and ovarian cancers.
Rather than hoping to find a fully minted, fully effective and complete "blockbuster" drug as a result of plant studies, Ms. Findeisen said, researchers have scaled down their expectations and are instead hoping to find compounds that, while not necessarily fully effective by themselves, provide the basis for a more rapid synthesis of a workable drug. In search of these compounds to help counter major diseases of this age, "we look anywhere -- absolutely anywhere," said Dr. Lynn Caporale, Merck's director of scientific evaluation.
But half or more of the world's plant species are in the tropical forests, and those forests are being lost to deforestation at a rate of nearly 55,000 square miles a year, an area about the size of Florida, experts on biological diversity say. The forests are often cut and burned to create agricultural fields, which are abandoned as their soils are depleted. The deforestation is causing widespread extinction of plants and other organisms, most scientists who study the problem say.
Just the possibility of extinction can inhibit drug companies in prospecting for useful plants, since discovery can take years and disappearance of the resource cannot be risked. "The concept of rain-forest destruction actually reduces our incentive to go and screen plants," Dr. Steven Brewer, a chemist with the Monsanto Company, told the conference.
 
An Economic Incentive
 The solution, according to the emerging new concept of tropical forest conservation, is to emphasize the value of the forest as a long-term, sustainable economic resource, and to give local people an economic stake in its preservation.
Dr. Balick, working in Belize with "bush masters," or native professionals who collect the plants that shamans use in their ministrations, has studied the plants' economic value. The plants are sold in urban markets as part of the primary health-care system.
In a study to be published soon, he found that a bush master earns 2 to 10 times the income of a farmer, suggesting that plant-gathering is an attractive alternative to farming and to the deforestation that often goes along with it.
In Costa Rica, the National Institute of Biodiversity, a nonprofit research organization established by the Government, is engaging local people familiar with the forests and paying them to be "para-taxonomists." Their function is to learn the forests and the plants and provide information on which the institute will base its collection of plant samples for Merck researchers, said Dr. Ana Sittenfield, the institute's coordinator of research and development.
Under the institute's two-year agreement with Merck, which both parties expect to be renewed, the institute will supply a limited number of plant samples to be screened for medical use. In return, Merck will pay the institute $1 million to support the sampling, train workers and help Costa Rica support its forest conservation efforts. Merck will also pay royalties to the institute on any drug products discovered as a result of the collaboration.
"The real key is that the benefits are going to be returned to conservation," said Dr. Walter Reid of the World Resources Institute, an expert on forests and biological diversity. "That's what's unique."
Shaman Pharmaceuticals' venture is based on the proposition that working with traditional medicine men, rather than screening plants randomly for useful drugs, can speed the process of discovery.
"We are driven exclusively by ethnobotany," which is the study of how traditional people use plants, said Lisa Conte, the company's president.
 
Value of Concept
 She said the ethnobotany strategy enabled the company in only 18 months to isolate from a medicinal plant in South America the compound that it says is active against a number of viruses, including those of the flu and herpes.
Early clinical trials have been encouraging, she said, and second-stage trials are about to begin. Some of whatever profits the company eventually makes will be channeled back to the tropical regions in an attempt to foster conservation. The money is to flow through a nonprofit foundation, the Healing Forest Conservancy, set up by the company when it was organized.
Much depends on whether, in fact, any of this leads in a reasonable time to a real, live treatment for an important ailment.
"I can't tell you how I look forward to the first positive hit," said Dr. Caporale of Merck.
"Once we have that first successful compound," Dr. Balick said of the over-all conservation concept, "this whole thing will fall into place."

Chart: "Finding Drugs in the Rain Forest"
 Scientists with diverse roles might take these steps in seeking out plants used as medicines, analyzing medicinal components and finally manufacturing or synthesizing drugs based on them:

STAGE 1: ESTABLISHING FOLK HISTORY
 The ethnobotanist goes where the plants grow and interviews a shaman, or traditional healer, about their use. Specimens are collected and other shamans confirm the information.

STAGE 2: ESTABLISHING TENTATIVE IDENTIFICATION
 The ethnobotanist and the field botanist make a very careful collection of the plants, identifying collection site, presumed genus and species, date of collection, etc. The expertise of the field botanist is needed to distinguish species since closely related species can appear to be identical to the untrained eye.

STAGE 3: BLIND SCREENING FOR ACTIVITY
 Consulting with the field botanist, the pharmacologist dries the plant the same way the shaman does. The aim is to detect and define the effects produced by the plant and the toxic potential of the drug; a blind animal testing program is set up.

STAGE 4: ABSOLUTE PLANT IDENTIFICATION
 The taxonomist independently confirms the plant's identity so more authentic plant material can be collected by the field botanist.

STAGE 5: DISCOVERING THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT
 The chemist isolates and extracts the active ingredient, figures out the potency, molecular weight, etc., and consults with the pharmacologist so actions of the drug can be understood.

STAGE 6: CLASSIC PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION
 Chemists and pharmacologists find out if the drug has a unique activity.

STAGE 7: CLASSIC STRUCTURE DETERMINATION
 Chemists find out if the drug's molecule is unique and can be synthesized.

STAGE 8: THE ATTEMPT TO SECURE A PATENT
 Chemists and pharmacologists prepare a patent application. (Adapted from The Journal of Ethnopharmacology) (pg. C9)

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Drug-Resistant TB Makes U.S. Rethink Elimination Program

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
LESS than three years after Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, set 2010 as the target for eliminating tuberculosis in the United States, the resurgent disease is out of control in this country.
As Dr. Sullivan and his lieutenants confront the problem, far more is at stake than upsetting an arbitrary deadline. The goal itself is in jeopardy because the disease has to be controlled before it can be eliminated. 
 Several of the new outbreaks have been caused by deadly strains of bacteria that are resistant to most tuberculosis drugs. If further outbreaks occur, surely there will be more drug-resistant bacteria, and it will only be a matter of time before they supplant the susceptible strains as the most common form of tuberculosis.
Some needs to bring the disease under control are clear and urgent: new antibiotics to combat drug-resistant tuberculosis and stronger public health programs, especially efforts to treat all patients until they stop spreading the tuberculosis bacilli, which are dispersed through the air from coughing.
But some experts are wondering whether more extreme measures are needed, like recreating tuberculosis sanitariums, particularly for those who develop drug-resistant tuberculosis. Experts are also asking for a review of the legal measures to forcibly treat people who refuse to complete prescribed courses of therapy.
Because tuberculosis is largely linked to poverty, many middle-class or wealthy people dismiss it as a disease they do not have to worry about. But tuberculosis can strike the affluent. For example, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was made too late to save the life of Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady who died of tuberculosis in 1962.
Without effective measures, the dread scourge of earlier this century will return to eat away the lungs, kidneys and other tissues to kill large numbers of Americans, many of them in the prime of life.
The new threat from tuberculosis is the latest example of a classic problem in the control of infectious diseases. As such diseases come close to disappearing, apathy develops. Legislators slash public health budgets, an action that usually proves to be false economy.
It is now clear that in the 1970's, the public, government officials and even health professionals became overconfident about the drop in reported cases of tuberculosis that had been continuing since the 1950's.
After all, treatment for tuberculosis was completely effective, although the cure was not quick. But many patients did not complete the full course of drug treatment because the workers who supervised such therapy were laid off. Incomplete therapy fosters the development of drug-resistant strains, and when such patients returned to the community they spread drug-resistant tuberculosis to others. The resistant nature of such infections often went unrecognized because most laboratories did not test bacteria isolated from tuberculosis patients for susceptibility to drugs.
In recent decades nearly all the tuberculosis sanitariums in this country, which numbered more than 500 in the 1930's, closed. Now tuberculosis patients are treated in community hospitals and released after doctors decide they are no longer contagious.
But the spread of tuberculosis has occurred within hospitals. One reason is the delay in diagnosing cases. Another is that most hospitals did not spend the money to meet requirements to install adequate ventilation to stop tuberculosis bacteria from spreading through the air.
Health departments were slow to recognize that they had not dealt adequately with the old problems of tuberculosis and to recognize the new ones because control programs were cut or abandoned.
Instead of continuing to decline, the number of tuberculosis cases rose. About 28,000 cases occurred from 1984 to 1990, well beyond the total Federal health officials had expected. Nevertheless, the Federal goal still seemed attainable because the cases were thought to be caused by strains susceptible to standard antibiotics.
But since 1989, when Dr. Sullivan announced the target to eliminate tuberculosis, drug-resistant tuberculosis has spread in at least 17 states. Dr. William L. Roper, director of the national Centers for Disease Control here, said doctors "are surely less confident now than we were two or so years ago" that they will cure an individual patient of tuberculosis.
In some outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis, death rates have exceeded 80 percent. It is not clear whether the death rate was so high because of delay in recognizing and treating the resistant form of the disease, because the new strains were deadlier than previous ones or because the patients were debilitated by AIDS.
But even when patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis end up in the hands of the top experts like Dr. Michael D. Iseman of the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in Denver, the cure rate is only 50 percent.
The loss of confidence extends to preventing latent infections from progressing to active tuberculosis. There is a 10 percent chance of such progression in a lifetime.
When an individual's skin test turns from negative to positive, indicating that he has recently become infected, doctors usually prescribe a drug called isoniazid.
But now Federal health officials say they do not know whether any drug will prevent development of active tuberculosis in someone latently infected with drug-resistant strains.
Federal officials advise health workers caring for tuberculosis patients to wear air-tight masks known as particulate respirators to filter out tuberculosis bacilli. But most hospitals do not make the respirators available because of their cost and controversy over their effectiveness.
And some experts, like Dr. Iseman and Dr. Lee B. Reichman, the president-elect of the American Lung Association in New York, say they do not wear masks, largely because they believe masks impede communication with patients.
If a tuberculosis patient coughs in his presence, Dr. Reichman said, he turns his head away and holds his breath. Dr. Reichman, who is head of chest diseases at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, said he wears a mask only when putting a tube into the windpipe in a procedure known as a bronchoscopy. Because such a procedure makes a patient cough, anyone with active tuberculosis could breathe the bacilli directly into a doctor's face.
Most doctors who wear masks use the standard surgical type. But that type of mask allows air to circulate through the edges and it did not protect Dr. Kenneth R. Ong, Deputy Commissioner of Health in New York City. He said he became infected in late 1990 as an infectious-disease specialist caring for tuberculosis patients. Dr. Ong said he took isoniazid in the hope that he had caught the form of the disease that is susceptible to drugs. But he believes he almost surely is latently infected with a drug-resistant strain.
Another important concern is the threat of spreading tuberculosis to patients, health care workers and visitors in hospitals where ventilation is inadequate.
Experts are now debating whether all hospitals should care for tuberculosis patients and whether such patients should be cared for only in special wings in certain hospitals or sanitariums dedicated to care of the disease. Although it would be uneconomical for every city to have a tuberculosis sanitarium, sharing regional centers could be cost-effective.
One of the most lucrative areas of drug manufacturing is the development of new antibiotics to combat microbes that have become resistant to older drugs. But in a strange way, the drive to eliminate tuberculosis may have been counterproductive to developing new anti-tuberculosis drugs.
"What's the incentive to develop new drugs when manufacturers hear about the impending demise of a disease and think there will be no market in the United States?" asked Dr. Michael Osterholm, the Minnesota state epidemiologist.
Manufacturers do know that a need exists for new antibiotics elsewhere in the world where tuberculosis is a leading killer. But the drug companies also know that there is little potential profit because such countries are poor.
Spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis has made it far more difficult to eliminate the disease. "It adds complications at a time when we don't need any more problems but when we need some solutions," Dr. Roper said.
Dr. Roper is still confident that tuberculosis can be eliminated. But he said, "The jury is out as to how long it is going to take us to do what needs to be done."

HEADLINE: Experts Say Logging Of Vast Siberian Forest Could Foster Warming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
THE forests of the Amazon and other tropical regions have been getting attention for some time, and understandably so. They are home to a disproportionate share of the world's living species, they absorb huge amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide that would otherwise exert a big heating effect on the earth's climate and they are rapidly being destroyed.
Less well known is the vast stretch of fir, larch, spruce and pine that girdles the continents at far northern latitudes and is known as the taiga. The word is derived from the Russian, appropriately enough since the Siberian part of the taiga is the largest forest in the world, far larger than the Brazilian Amazon. At more than two million square miles, it would cover the entire continental United States excepting Alaska. Like the tropical forests, it is a major absorber of atmospheric carbon dioxide. 
 Now, with Russia economically devastated and hungry for hard currency as it converts to a market economy, environmentalists are raising fears that joint ventures between the Russians and American, Japanese or Korean timber companies could lead to extensive deforestation of the Siberian taiga. This, the environmentalists warn, could contribute significantly to global warming.
If carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases continue to build up in the atmosphere at the present rate, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit in the next century with possibly catastrophic results, many scientists predict. The rate of buildup would presumably increase if Siberia were deforested.
The possibility is raised in an article in the current issue of the British journal Nature by Dr. Armin Rosencranz and Antony Scott of the Pacific Energy and Resources Center in Sausalito, Calif., a nonprofit environmental research and education center that works with Russian environmentalists to defend the Siberian forests.
The forests "have a large role to play in mitigating global warming," they wrote, emphasizing that this "must be communicated to the negotiators of international agreements" aimed at limiting or reversing the buildup of carbon dioxide.
Negotiators from 130 countries are to meet in New York next month in the fourth of five sessions aimed at producing a binding international convention on the control of heat-trapping gases. Participants say the session is crucial, since there is not much time left before the scheduled signing of the pact in June in Rio de Janeiro, and the United States and other industrial nations differ over whether to set specific targets for limiting carbon dioxide emissions. Less attention has been given to the important role of deforestation in global warming, and particularly to the role of the taiga.
Some forestry experts question whether large-scale logging will ever catch on in Siberia, given its inaccessibility, generally high costs and a short growing season for the regeneration of trees.
But the pressures of economic survival in the former Soviet Union, and particularly in hard-pressed Siberia, are causing Russians to "look to natural resources for conversion into cash, and people in the United States, the West and Korea and Japan are waiting to use these natural resources," Dr. Rosencranz, the president of the Pacific Energy and Resources Center, said in an interview.
He and Mr. Scott noted in the Nature article that the recent completion of a new Siberian railway helps make expansion of the timber industry possible. Thousands of people sent to Siberia to work on the railway are now jobless, they wrote, adding to the pressure to speed up development of other industries, like timber.
The article asserted that the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, the Georgia-Pacific Corporation and the Weyerhaeuser Company, three American timber giants, have begun negotiations to cut Siberian forests. Any agreements, the authors wrote, "will almost certainly increase the rate of logging." Weyerhaeuser, said Dr. Rosencranz, has built a large loading dock near Khabarovsk, a major Siberian city.
The authors wrote also that Hyundai Inc., the South Korean conglomerate, "is said to have contracted to log roughly half a million acres" in eastern Siberia and that C. Itoh and Company, a Japanese concern, had already begun harvesting trees there.
S. S. Chae, senior executive vice president of Hyundai Resources Development Company Ltd. of Seoul, confirmed that his company had entered into a joint venture to log the half-million acres and that the company was considering expanding its Siberian operations.
C. Itoh imported 100,000 cubic meters of softwood logs from Siberia last year and has also invested in a "small-scale sawmill" in Siberia, said Yoshiharu Matsumoto, a spokesman for the company in Tokyo.
Georgia-Pacific representatives have been to Siberia to investigate the long-term potential of the timber resource, but the company has not begun any joint-venture negotiations, said Sheila Weidman, a company spokeswoman. With 50 percent of the world's inventory of softwood, she said, Siberia could in time be a major competitor on the world market.
But roads, railroads and other infrastructure necessary to develop Siberian forestry are insufficient, and the convertibility of the ruble is still a big question, she pointed out. For these reasons, she said, Georgia-Pacific sees the Siberian forests "as a possible opportunity well into the future but is not considering it in the short term at all."
Similarly, Louisiana-Pacific has looked at the Siberian forests but has no present plans to exploit them, said Barry Lacter, a spokesman at the company headquarters in Portland, Ore.
Weyerhaeuser has "explored the feasibility" of logging operations in territory of Khabarovsk, in eastern Siberia, and has considered how to ship wood out of the territory, said Scott Marshall, a spokesman in Tacoma, Wash. While "we're not doing anything yet," he said, it is possible the company will enter Siberia in the next 5 to 10 years. "Certainly," he said, "there is a likelihood that someone will.
Despite interest from timber companies, "it's hard to see much happening in the next decade" in Siberian timbering, said Dr. Roger Sedjo, an expert in world forests at Resources for the Future, an independent research organization in Washington.
Dr. Rosencranz and Mr. Scott acknowledge that short-term prospects for investment in Siberian timber might not be good because of economics, transporation difficulties, red tape, non-convertibility of the ruble and especially political instability and doubt about who will own and control the forests. But they insist that it is essential to insure that "the allure of hard currency and modern technology does not outweigh the long-term health of the forests."
 
Difference With Tropics
 While recognizing the possibility of both local and global environmental damage, Dr. Sedjo pointed out some important differences between the taiga and tropical forests. In the tropics, he said, deforestation proceeds mostly because forests are being converted to agriculture and other forms of development in a region where population pressures are acute.
By contrast, he said, unoccupied timberlands regenerate. In fact, he said, there has been a net gain in forest acreage in the heavily logged temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, he said, trees converted to wood products like houses and furniture do not release carbon dioxide to the atmosphere as tropical forests do when they are burned. It is even likely, he said, that regenerating forests would remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than the mature ones they replace, since young, growing trees absorb the gas at a higher rate.
Dr. Rosencranz and Mr. Scott argue that regeneration would be slow in Siberia because the growing season is so short, and that clear-cutting -- the most economical way to log -- would cause erosion. This, they fear, would further inhibit regeneration and destroy aquatic ecosystems on which native Siberian people depend for fish they eat.
While regeneration does take longer in the far north, said Mr. Marshall of Weyerhaeuser, it has been done successfully in the taiga of Canada and Scandinavia for decades. Moreover, he said, some parts of Siberia are warmer and more favorable for tree growth than others.
Dr. Sedjo said that Siberian logging operations would be among the costliest in the world, despite the new railway. Subsidies by the Russian or local governments, unlikely in the present economic climate, might overcome the timber companies' cost objections, he said. Successful efforts in the United States and elsewhere to prohibit logging on conservation grounds could also drive up the world price of wood, he said, making Siberian logging more attractive.
But, he said, large increases in Siberian timber production "may never occur."
To whatever degree the Siberian forests are exploited, Dr. Rosencranz and Mr. Scott wrote, they ought to be exploited in a sound way so that the resource itself, "an economic, climatic and wilderness resource of global significance," is preserved.

HEADLINE: President Puts Final Touches On State of Union Message

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
President Bush today began final preparations for his State of the Union Message to Congress on Tuesday night, reviewing final drafts of the speech and delivering the first of two dress-rehearsal readings to aides in a theater in the East Wing of the White House.
Mr. Bush's recitation signaled the end of a gantlet through which speechwriters and advisers have alternately dashed and staggered, nights and weekends, for almost a month. 
 State of the Union speeches are always pressure-packed, the aides said in interviews, but the one on Tuesday night, billed by Bush aides as a linchpin of his re-election strategy, is triply so.
"I think it's fair enough for people to look for a lot out of this speech in terms of him moving to the next stage" of his campaign, which is to present a program for economic recovery, Charles R. Black Jr., a top Bush campaign adviser, said last Thursday.
 
Final Flourishes
 Today Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, tried to minimize the hyperbole. He said the President's speech would "have a great deal of meat in it," but added, "I think if expectations tomorrow are reasonable, the President will meet them."
Several of the President's aides stayed at the White House this weekend to apply final flourishes to what is essentially a finished speech. The White House director of speechwriting, Tony Snow, said he expected the President's speech to run 45 minutes to an hour, including interruptions for applause.
That is longer than most State of the Union speeches. Mr. Bush's first two ran 35 minutes and 47 minutes, respectively, and both were artificially lengthened by outbreaks of patriotic fervor over successful wars in Panama and the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Snow said Tuesday's speech would "be carried by its substance," not by any high-flying oratory.
Mr. Bush's aides say he has put an unusual amount of personal effort into this speech. By this weekend, he had reviewed eight drafts of the address, cobbled in countless meetings and position papers since December.
 
Month of Planning
 Serious planning for the address began about a month ago, shortly after Mr. Bush named Samuel K. Skinner as his new chief of staff and appointed a 1992 campaign team headed by his chief pollster and political strategist, Robert M. Teeter. Those two, with Mr. Bush, the budget director, Richard G. Darman, and the White House communications director, David F. Demarest Jr., have regularly chewed over the tone and content of the speech since then in a series of informal meetings.
Mr. Bush also has solicited advice from fellow politicians, friends and what one adviser called "John Q. Public," but it was unclear what ordinary citizens he had spoken with.
Actual drafting of the address began about 10 days ago, and the first copy was delivered last Wednesday, aides said. Mr. Bush has since begun weighing in, sometimes "quite dramatically," with specific changes and suggestions, said one of several aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The President can and does rewrite lines and whole paragraphs of the speech to suit his tastes. "But he also will just sit back and say, 'Here are some thoughts and reflections,' and we'll just listen," one aide said. That aide said Mr. Bush "actually is a very good writer."
Mr. Bush enters the House of Representatives on Tuesday with a built-in handicap: State of the Union addresses, even ones ballyhooed like this one, are virtually dictated by their roles in politics to be forgettable.
The speech must trumpet a list of White House accomplishments, real and imagined, as well as an equally improbable list of proposals for the nation's future greatness.
"In a State of the Union, you're trying to put an enormous amount of substance together with a great amount of style," said Chriss Winston, who was White House director of speechwriting until last March, when she left to spend more time with her child. "So when you look back on it, there are very few States of the Union that anyone could quote from. It has not been an address that goes down in the annals of speechmaking."

HEADLINE: Court Shifts California's Political Lines

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a move that alters the political landscape of California, the State Supreme Court today imposed a new redistricting plan that is widely expected to accelerate Republican gains in the largest state. Political experts say Republicans could take control of the state's huge Congressional delegation this year and possibly both houses of the State Legislature within two to four years.
The plan ignored existing district lines, thereby putting many powerful incumbents in both Congress and the Legislature in the difficult position of either running against other incumbents or moving to less reliable districts. 
 With the new map, powerful Democrats in Congress like Vic Fazio of Sacramento and Anthony C. Beilenson of Los Angeles face tough re-election fights, as does the powerful President Pro Tempore of the State Senate, David A. Roberti of Los Angeles.
Together with a ballot measure passed in 1990 that limits the terms of members in the State Senate and Assembly, the plan promises the most confusing, competitive and costly election year in California memory. Politicians are scrambling ferociously for new seats.
 
'Dramatic Turnover' Expected
 "We'll see some dramatic turnover in the next two election cycles," said John B. Emerson, a Democratic political strategist who is Chief Deputy City Attorney of Los Angeles. "This will be an enormously expensive fund-raising year as previously safe incumbents will have to fight for their lives."
The current Congressional delegation consists of 26 Democrats and 19 Republicans. While the election is more than nine months off, the Republicans are generally expected to win four or five of the new seats and possibly three or four of the redrawn districts. That could give them 27 seats, a majority of the 52 in the new delegation.
The plan was drawn up by a special panel of three retired judges appointed by the State Supreme Court, six of whose seven members were appointed by Republican governors. The court took control of the contentious reapportionment process late last year after Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, vetoed a plan devised by the Democratic-controlled Legislature.
Ten years ago, districts were gerrymendered under a Democratic plan that largely protected incumbents of both parties.
This time the panel ignored incumbents, trying to keep districts compact and avoiding the grotesquely gerrymandered districts of the past. It tried to keep "communities of interest" together and follow county lines and geographical barriers like mountains in drawing lines, while also adhering to the Federal Voting Rights Act, which requires that minority-dominated districts be created where possible.
 
Plan Challenged in Court
 Democratic incumbents in Congress and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund are challenging the plan in Federal District Court in San Francisco, saying it fails to set up enough minority districts.
But the incumbents seemed resigned to running under the new districts. Two weeks ago, Mr. Beilenson, who has represented Beverly Hills, Westwood and other parts of the liberal West Side of Los Angeles for 16 years, announced that he was moving his residence over the mountains to the more politically conservative San Fernando Valley rather than run against his friend, Representative Henry A. Waxman, in a new 29th District that runs from near downtown to Santa Monica.
"It was very painful to me because either way I'd lose enormous number of constituents I care about personally," Mr. Beilenson said today in a telephone interview from Washington. Registration in his new district, the 24th, is 45 percent Democratic and 45 percent Republican, making it marginal for a Democrat since Republicans are generally more loyal to the party. He said the court plan was poorly drawn in terms of keeping communities of interest together.
The plan is a blow to the powerful Democratic political machine run by Mr. Waxman and Representative Howard L. Berman, who represent the affluent, heavily Jewish West Side.
 
'Level Playing Field'
 "This gives us a level playing field -- we've been running uphill for 10 years," said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Governor Wilson, of the new plan.
Both Democratic and Republican experts agreed that Republicans would take the lion's share of the seven new seats California won after the 1990 census. Over the decade the state's population grew by 26 percent, to nearly 30 million people, but the bulk of the growth was not in the liberal Los Angeles and San Francisco areas but in more conservative areas like the Central Valley and Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.
"For the first time in my history, we've got a good shot at it, if not this year in two more years," said David Knatcal, spokesman for the California Republican Party.
But Bob Mulholland, political director of the California Democratic Party, said that given the state's economic troubles and disaffection with Governor Wilson, the Democrats would maintain a majority, albeit a thinner one.
The court-approved plan is vulnerable mainly on the ground that it fails to establish enough minority districts. Currently California has three representatives in Congress who are Mexican-American and three blacks.
Jonathan H. Steinberg, a lawyer representing the Democratic incumbents in Congress, said that by keeping districts compact the panel had produced a gerrymander that favored whites. He said cohesive Hispanic populations on the East Side of Los Angeles and the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valleys were broken up unnecessarily. Hispanic people make up 26 percent of California's population but a much smaller percentage of the electorate.
In its 6-to-1 ruling, written by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas, the Supreme Court found that the plan conformed to Federal law.
But in his lone dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk, complained that the panel of retired judges had abolished four existing districts in Los Angeles County and placed four incumbents into one district, the new 29th. "That all four members were Democrats arouses understandable suspicion as to objectivity," he wrote, adding this amounted to "reverse gerrymandering."
Now that the ruling is out, Mr. Steinberg said he expected to push forward on the Federal challenge, which is based also on discrepancies in the size of districts.
But with a Feb. 18 deadline for candidates to file their notices of intent to run, many experts said they believed the court plan would likely stand at least for the 1992 election.

HEADLINE: The 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
For the Front-Runners, Crucial Days Are Here

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Jan. 27

 BODY:
Pace-setters often fade in the stretch. It happens to horses, and it happens to politicians. So this week, which should show something about the staying power of the presumed front-runners in the New Hampshire primary, could turn out to be highly significant.
Neither President Bush nor Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas is likely to find the going easy. Mr. Bush must somehow manage, in his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, to convince the intensely provincial people here that he has a concrete program to pull their state out of recession. Mr. Clinton must somehow recover his balance after being staggered by allegations of marital infidelity last week. 
 For the President, the task is making hard-hit voters believe that he, a man born to privilege, rich most of his life, understands their plight.
Bush supporters in the state are fretful, and they do not hide it. "I'm very, very nervous about him putting all his eggs in one basket," said Tom Rath, a former State Attorney General who has been active in the Bush campaign. "Suppose he gives the greatest speech of his life. The next day, the guy in Laconia or Nashua still doesn't have a job. He's still hurting."
Challenged here by Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, limited in what he can propose by lack of resources and obliged to take his stand weeks before the vote here, Mr. Bush has his work cut out.
On Wednesday, only a few hours after his speech, the President will announce his budget, which is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion, and the Government is expected to make public a new set of statistics showing that the economy, after starting to recover last spring and summer, stalled again last fall. The figures will give fresh ammunition to those who argue that Mr. Bush mishandled the economy.
And all week long, Mr. Buchanan will be on the streets of the state, while Mr. Bush is absent. The President will not be here again for two weeks, campaigning solely through radio and television advertisements and surrogate speakers.
For Mr. Clinton, the stakes are even higher. As he said in his interview on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" Sunday evening, this week should demonstrate whether he will be able to resume discussion of the economic and social issues from which he was diverted by accusations that he had carried on a 12-year affair with Gennifer Flowers, a former nightclub singer.
That will depend on the voters and on the reporters covering him, whom the Governor accused of playing "a game of gotcha" at his expense. When accusations of sexual impropriety surfaced four years ago during former Senator Gary Hart's Presidential campaign, reporters hounded Mr. Hart with questions on that subject alone, contributing to his decision to withdraw from the race because he could no longer get his message across.
Mr. Clinton forcefully denied he had an affair with Ms. Flowers, but refused to deny having an affair with anyone, saying he had had rocky passages in his marriage and allowing the public to draw its own conclusions.
A telephone survey last week, after the accusations had been publicized by Star, a supermarket tabloid, showed Mr. Clinton sagging badly in New Hampshire. It said he had fallen into a tie with former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who had been trailing by 25 percentage points.
Several polls have shown that about 15 percent of American voters say they would not back someone who had had an extramarital affair. The figure is even higher in the South, where the primaries on March 3 and 10, in which Mr. Clinton has been favored, are concentrated.
Much will depend on whether Mr. Clinton can avoid additional damage. Mr. Tsongas, dismissed until recently as a Bruce Babbitt -- straight-talking but not salable -- has been winning plaudits in the last few days and might then be a beneficiary, or Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
It is still possible, politicians here say, that people will believe Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary. Some may vote for him because they resent the role of news organizations in spreading the accusations, which have not yet been substantiated. If he wins -- and with five candidates in the Democratic primary, he might need only 35 percent or 40 percent of the vote -- he might be strengthened enough to put his drive back on course.

HEADLINE: In a Speech, President Returns to Religious Themes

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Reviving social and religious themes that are seldom heard in his oratory except in election years, President Bush today called for voluntary prayer in schools, pledged to curtail "the decline of the American family" and cited the teachings of Jesus Christ as the moral force behind the Persian Gulf war.
"Obviously no country can claim a special place in God's heart," Mr. Bush said in an address to the National Religious Broadcasters, a group of Christian radio and television station officials. "Yet we are better as a people because He has a special place in ours." 
 Mr. Bush's appearance before the broadcasters has been an annual event. But the timing of today's speech allowed the President to emphasize his commitment to conservative social issues on the day before his State of the Union Message, which is expected to be dominated by more pressing economic concerns.
 
Reviving Old Notions
 Some of the notions that Mr. Bush touched on today were mainstays of the more ideological Reagan years. But they have received scant attention from Mr. Bush since the 1988 campaign, when the economy was going strong and Mr. Bush was free to campaign on prayer in public schools and the Pledge of Allegiance, issues that he used to portray his opponent, Michael S. Dukakis, as cold in spirit and unpatriotic.
Mr. Bush even spoke today, although euphemistically, of abortion, an issue that he seldom raises except in remarks that are intended to reassure a conservative audience like today's enthusiastic crowd, which gave him two standing ovations.
Saying he wanted to speak about "values," and not give a partisan address, Mr. Bush said: "The first value is not simply American, but universal. And I refer to the sanctity of life. I will stand on the side of choosing life."
At moments like today's speech to the religious broadcasters, Mr. Bush's demeanor changes markedly from his usual campaign and Presidential appearances. He is far more emotional than is his normal style. In Atlanta last year, Mr. Bush cried as he spoke to the Southern Baptist Convention about praying before he ordered the ground attack on Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
 
Biblical Blandishments
 The President, who is an Episcopalian, seemed to tailor his syntax to the audience today, using words like "unto" and citing the Bible. He even used it at one point to convey the impression that he is committed to fair foreign-trade practices.
"The Bible reminds us, by thy works shall ye know them," Mr. Bush said. "What we must do is give working Americans that level playing field to keep us as rich in goods as we have been blessed in spirit."
The President commended the broadcasters for their support of the war to drive Iraq from Kuwait. "I want to thank you for helping America, as Christ ordained, to be a light unto the world," said Mr. Bush.
The President renewed his call for a Constitutional amendment allowing organized prayer in public schools, calling prayer "the ultimate value that sustains America."
"In Sunday school, children learn that God is everywhere, but in public school, they find that He's absent from class," said Mr. Bush.
The school-prayer amendment is one of six changes to the Constitution that Mr. Bush has gone on the record as supporting since the 1988 campaign. He also favors an anti-abortion amendment, a balanced-budget amendment, a line-item-veto amendment, an amendment requiring the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools and an amendment setting limits on terms in Federal elected office.
White House officials say Mr. Bush strongly backs each of these amendments. But he has done nothing to start the process that might lead to their enactment and they are not a staple of the President's oratorical diet.
In today's speech, Mr. Bush spoke at length about what he said was a threat to American family values from crime, drugs and racism.
"We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons," Mr. Bush said, "an America that rejects the incivility, the tide of incivility, and the tide of intolerance."

HEADLINE: Afraid and Hurt, Young Turn to Clinics

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan. 27

 BODY:
The girl had just turned 13 and complained of acne when she came to the adolescent medicine clinic at Oakland Children's Hospital last week.
But blemishes were the least of her problems. 
 Under the gentle but insistent questioning of doctors and social workers, she disclosed her secrets: She had been molested by a neighborhood drug dealer, was afraid she was pregnant or infected with venereal disease and even more frightened that her assailant would retaliate if she turned him in.
Her harrowing story, told as rap music played in the background, is unexceptional at this inner city clinic where adolescents come with sore throats, twisted ankles and asthma and then reveal that they have been raped, beaten or shot; that they are pregnant, suicidal or hungry.
The clinic director, Dr. Barbara Staggers, a 38-year-old pediatrician, is one of a growing number of adolescent medicine specialists. In many big cities, such doctors run clinics like this one, at a medical school, a childrens' hospital, or even affiliated with an inner city high school.
 
Searching for Love
 The young people at Dr. Staggers's clinic describe their situations in the matter-of-fact tones students use to discuss extra math homework and not a compendium of urban plagues. But they cling to the doctors and counselors, returning day after day to the storefront clinic, down the street from the shuttered Pussycat Theater and several blocks from the main hospital, saying that what they most wish for is more time with an adult who loves them.
"To just function takes everything they have," said Dr. Staggers, who dispenses condoms, medical advice and hugs in equal measure to 5,000 youngsters a year, most of them poor and only a few of them living with both their parents. "We need to say to them over and over, 'This shouldn't be happening to you.' "
Young people like these have been the subject of dozens of national studies, learned reports and civic jeremiads in recent months, all deploring the conditions of life for many of the 64 million children of America, particularly the 13 million who are poor.
Teen-age rape and pregancy, child abuse and juvenile crime are all on the rise, government officials, child welfare advocates and scholars agree. But most alarming of all is the threefold increase in homicide and suicide rates among teen-agers in the last 30 years, which experts say signals the depth of their despair about the future.
"What we're seeing is the complete destruction of the social environment for these kids," said Dr. Joyce Lashof, a professor of public health at the University of California at Berkeley and the new president of the American Public Health Association. "Economic opportunity, stable relationships, housing, safety at school, hope for the future: Everything that makes up living has kind of disappeared for them."
These teen-agers troop through Dr. Staggers's clinic at the rate of about 20 a day, and all but a very few have horrendous stories to tell. But they do not disclose their problems easily or quickly.
Instead, pediatricians, social workers and peer counselors, most of them raised in the inner city, spend hours alternating diverting patter and probing questions about what is going on in the youngsters' lives.
 
Coaxing the Answers
 "Since I last saw you, have you had sex with anyone?" Dr. Staggers asks one girl who recently had an abortion and now has a new boyfriend. "Did you guys use protection? Good for you! Can we clone you?"
"What did you eat yesterday?" she asks a frail 12-year-old in sour smelling clothes, whose mother recently returned home from a prison term. "Any green stuff? Any meat?"
"Do you remember how many places you've lived in the last year?" she asks a 13-year-old who nightly wets her bed at a group foster home. "Can you count them? Do you understand that this is happening because of all the stuff that's going on in your life and that there is nothing wrong inside of you?"
"Who you staying with?" she asks another youngster who has richochetted between relatives and foster homes because her mother is an addict. "With your granny now? Are you guys getting along? Is she pulling your leash too tight?"
"What's your neighborhood like these days -- pretty rowdy?" she asks a 13-year-old boy whose block is the scene of frequent shootings. "Anything awful happen to any of your friends? Anybody been shot or stabbed lately?"
 
The Truth Comes Out
 Once Dr. Staggers and her colleagues find a conversational wedge, the dam bursts and sorrows flood forth.
"The foundation these kids are standing on is like glass," said Michael James, a counselor at the clinic. "Real hard, real smooth. But if something hits it, it shatters."
As at most adolescent clinics, health care is not defined as medicine alone. A routine visit takes more than an hour, with three-quarters of the teen-agers, referred by doctors or word of mouth, also talking to social workers, psychologists or peer conselors. The care is overwhelmingly state-supported, either because the youngsters are poor or because they are covered under so-called sensitive-service laws, common across the country, which protect the confidentiality of children seeking advise about pregnancy, drugs and the like.
The girls, without exception, talk about sex, much of it abusive or dangerous. The boys talk about weapons, which are unavoidable on the streets where they live. All of them say they are afraid of random gunfire and AIDS, legitimate concerns in these neighborhoods. Many say they do not expect to live to adulthood.
To survive "you got to stay out of peoples' way," explained a 13-year-old boy with the build of a linebacker, who was recently at a birthday party where a friend was shot. "Somebody can walk up to you and put a gun to your head. It's kind of rowdy."
 
Teen-Ager Asks 'Why Us?'
 Only a few of these teen-agers know their fathers and some have lost their mothers, as well -- to drugs, alcohol or prison. One such teen-ager, now 17, was sent to her first foster home at the age of 2, tried prostitution at 14, has been frequently raped, robbed and beaten, and sometimes wonders "what can I do to make myself die?"
"Why us?" she wailed the other day, as Dr. Staggers cradled her in her arms and promised both moral support and medicine for her latest vaginal infection. "Why are the blacks losing their mommas?"
The girl, with meticulously braided hair and almond-shaped eyes, had turned to alcohol for forgetfulness and to abusive men for attention.
"The only reason I drink so much is I be so hurt," she said. "I used to go home with no pants all the time."
But too many unwanted pregnancies and venereal diseases had persuaded her to mend her ways. "I can't trust nobody, no more, no more," she cried. "In '92 that's my goal. Not to trust nobody else, not ever."
Dr. Staggers shushed her. "We care about you," she said. "We love you. You can always come here."
Even the children with parents are often on their own, or worse. One heavy-set blonde, with thick purple eyeshadow, confessed to Dr. Staggers that she had tried to overdose on decongestants because of persistent beatings from her mother. Once not too long ago, the girl struck back, and wound up locked up in juvenile hall, labeled an "out of control youth" because she tried to defend herself.
"I'm tired of dealing with it," she said last week, describing her suicide attempt. "I thought it was the easy way out."
Dr. Staggers asked her "to do me a favor next time: Call."
She went on: "We can't replace you. We can't help you if you're dead."
Lonely and unsupported, these children cast about for comfort, which for the girls often means perilous sex.
"It's a good feeling to be loved, talked to nice, held," said Jamata Gray, a 20-year-old counselor, who served time in juvenile hall for selling drugs and was a teen-aged mother. "If your boyfriend is the only one to give that to you, you'll get it from him."
Sometimes the sex is an unintended byproduct of the need for shelter, as it was for a homeless 15-year-old who was offered a bed one wintry night by a group of men who then raped her. "She went back the next night, so the cops said she had provoked them," said Glenester Irvin, a social worker. "But it was 32 degrees. You've got to understand that she didn't have anyplace else to go."
 
A Role for Gangs
 In addition to sex, gangs fill the unmet needs of her patients, Dr. Staggers said.
"They get money, food, shelter, support, lots of the things they need to survive," she said. "You can't just say 'Don't do it,' when you can offer them no substitute for this highly structured social organization."
A variation on this theme is the attraction of a psychiatric hospital for one teen-aged patient, who makes frequent, although half-hearted, suicide attempts. She is homeless, often hungry and so far behind in school that graduation seems impossible.
"She sees the hospital as as a place to be taken care of, have three meals a day and her own bed," said Cleo Rice-Hodge, a social worker. "That's a sad commentary."
Among children between the ages of 15 and 19, homicide is the No. 2 cause of death, behind motor vehicle accidents, and suicide is No. 3. Overwhelmingly, it is black males who get killed, usually with a firearm, and white youngsters, both male and female, who kill themselves.
Either way, Dr. Staggers said: "I don't like picking up bodies. But I do like the fact that it has gotten so dramatic, so out of hand, so embarrassing to this country, that it can no longer be ignored."
 
Mixed Messages
 In the world in which these children live, Dr. Staggers and her colleagues say, they are bombarded with mixed messages, told that certain behavior is bad at the same time that is glorified in film, fashion and music. "Everything they see is sex and guns, sex and guns," Dr. Staggers said.
These teen-agers also struggle with the undertow of peer pressure, which can take deadly form in neighborhoods that are rife with guns and drugs.
"You want to be out having fun, not stuck in the house," said Ms. Gray, who said she sold drugs as a teen-ager to support the 13 siblings she was raising because her mother was an addict. "Somebody says, 'Let's go get a gun.' If you don't do it, they think you're a punk. You don't want to be looked down at, disrespected."
Dr. Staggers filled out charts and mused on the suffering of these children one recent night before heading home to fix dinner for her 6-year-old son. Darkness pressed against the clinic windows, the teen-agers had scattered and Vivaldi had replaced rap.
"I don't know who's worse off," Dr. Staggers said, comparing the children who survive to the ones who don't. "When you're dead, you're dead. You don't experience any more pain. But we've got the walking dead here. We've got the zombies."

HEADLINE: 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Bad News for Bush as Poll Shows National Gloom

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
In his State of the Union Message tonight, President Bush will address a nation that is gloomier than it has been in 13 years, more disapproving of his Presidency than ever and increasingly willing to try a Democrat in the White House, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
The survey suggests that Mr. Bush's speech at 9 o'clock tonight may be the most important of his Presidency. He is facing a discontented and volatile electorate that on a variety of issues is willing to give the opposition party the benefit of the doubt. 
 Seventy-three percent of those polled see the country as being in worse shape today than it was five years ago, a crucial measure of the national mood that has not been this grim since the days of "malaise" under Jimmy Carter when the figure was 63 percent.
 
Giving Democrats a Chance
 The public tends to think a Democratic President would do a better job on improving schools, helping the middle class, assuring national health care and even ending the recession, the poll found.
Sixty percent in the telephone survey of 1,281 adults nationwide say it is time to give a Democrat a chance as President, but Republican strategists note that an idealized generic nominee is likely to fare far better in polls than an actual one.
Support for Mr. Bush continues to erode, with just 43 percent saying they approve of his performance as President, an astonishing drop of 45 points since his popularity rating reached 88 percent, a historic peak, after the Persian Gulf war.
Perhaps most tellingly, the public has even lost confidence in Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy, long his strong suit in the polls. In the latest survey, conducted Wednesday through Saturday, 46 percent approved of his conduct of foreign policy, while 46 percent disapproved. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
On the eve of his speech, Mr. Bush took an opportunity today to bolster his standing among the religious right. Addressing Christian radio and television station officials, he called for voluntary prayer in schools and cited the teachings of Jesus as the moral force behind the Persian Gulf war. Earlier, he reviewed final drafts of his State of the Union Message and staged a dress rehearsal of it before aides in a White House theater. [Page A17.]
While the poll outlines extraordinary opportunity for the Democrats, it is just that. The survey shows that less than a month before the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18 only one Democrat, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, has broken from the pack in the race for the Presidential nomination.
Among those who said they were likely to vote in the Democratic primaries nationwide, Mr. Clinton's support has jumped to 22 percent, from 5 percent in October. The Governor is currently trying to steady his campaign in the face of accusations in a supermarket tabloid that he committed adultery.
Presidential approval ratings at this stage of a campaign are not a reliable indicator of a President's chances on Election Day. Two recent Presidents had ratings in the Gallup polls similar to Mr. Bush's in January of their re-election year: Gerald R. Ford, who went on to lose, though narrowly, and Richard M. Nixon, who stood at 46 percent approval at the beginning of 1972, and won 49 states that November against George S. McGovern.
Charles R. Black Jr., a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, said that the Democratic race was "in its embryonic stages" and that any predictions about the strength of the party's eventual nominee were highly premature.
The economy is clearly driving political attitudes now and profoundly changing the zeitgeist of the 1980's. Seventy-eight percent of those polled say the economy is in bad shape, and only 9 percent say they think it is improving.
Even with a burdensome Federal deficit, the survey suggests that the public is in the mood for a more active Federal Government engaged in some basic pump-priming. Sixty-five percent said they favored more Federal spending to create jobs; 74 percent favored more spending to improve education, and 74 percent said they would spend more to provide affordable health care to all Americans.
 
Paying for Health Insurance
 The idea of national health insurance has clearly caught fire: 65 percent said they would favor a system financed through taxes. Fifty-three percent said they would be willing to pay $1,000 a year more in Federal taxes to cover it, if that freed them from other medical costs.
The public voiced a clear preference on the best way to jump start the economy: 59 percent said the Federal Government should spend more and try to create jobs, while 28 percent said that tax cuts were the way to go.
The public seemed to have only modest expectations about what a tax cut for the middle class could do for the economy. Asked what kind of effect a tax cut of $400 or $500 would have, 11 percent said it would a major effect in ending the recession, 34 percent said small and 49 percent said it would make no difference.
Still, the middle class -- and 75 percent of those polled said they considered themselves part of it -- feels a clear sense of grievance. When asked who had suffered most from the policies of the Federal Government in the past decade, 46 percent said the poor and 43 percent said the middle class. When asked who had most benefited, 82 percent said the rich.
 
An Edge for Democrats
 Moreover, the Democrats' efforts to cast themselves as the champions of the middle class are paying off. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents said a Democratic President would be more likely to care about the needs of the middle class, while 25 percent said Mr. Bush would.
That was just part of the edge that the public gives to an idealized Democrat when asked who could do a better job on several issues. Forty-six percent said a Democratic President would be more likely to improve education, as against 31 percent who cited Mr. Bush. Sixty-one percent said a Democratic President would be more likely to make health care available to all, as against 19 percent who cited Mr. Bush.
Forty-two percent of the respondents said they thought a Democratic President would do a better job dealing with the abortion issue, while 32 percent cited Mr. Bush.
Perhaps most worrisome to Mr. Bush, 45 percent said a Democratic President would be most likely to end the recession, as against 32 percent who cited the incumbent.
Mr. Bush was given the edge in two categories in the poll: protecting family values and seeing to it that the United States is respected by other countries.
The poll shows public attitudes toward Japan changing remarkably fast, reflecting the debate surrounding Mr. Bush's recent trade mission there. The number of Americans who say the Japanese look down on them has risen 24 points in two months, to 67 percent from 43 percent in November.
A majority of Americans -- 56 percent -- say they favor protecting American industries and jobs by limiting imports, while 38 percent said they backed free trade that would make available good products at low price regardless of where they were made.
And Mr. Bush's effort to cast his Japanese trip as a mission for jobs clearly backfired. Sixty-three percent said the trip was a failure; 19 percent judged it a success.
But the results in the current poll were not all bad for Mr. Bush. Seventy-one percent of the public disapproves of the way Congress is doing its job, suggesting that Mr. Bush's Congress-bashing will fall on receptive ears.
But the overall mood of the public was a striking change from that in the expansive 1980's. It was measured by questions asking people to rate the present state of national affairs on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 the worst and 10 the best. They were asked to do the same for the state of affairs five years ago and five years in the future.
Over all, the respondents gave an average rating to the present of 4.63, lower than any measure taken by The New York Times/CBS News Poll since it began asking the question in November 1979. Reflecting little optimism, they gave the future a rating of 4.97. But looking back five years, they saw a better time, and gave it a rating of 6.54.
Looking at the Democratic Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton was first at 22 percent, followed by former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California at 13 percent, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts at 10 percent, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska at 9 percent and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa at 4 percent.

"The National Mood: A 13-Year Low"
 Using a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being the worst possible situation and 10 being the best, these charts show how respondents on average rated "the way things are going in the United States" at the time of the poll [Nov. 1979, Jan. 1985, Jan. 1986 and Jan. 1992], how they recalled them as having been five years earlier and how they expected them to be in five years.

How the Survey Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 22 to 25 with 1,281 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, it is plus or minus five percentage points for either Democratic primary voters or Republican primary voters.
For the question that asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 the way things are going in the United States, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 0.11; that is, in 19 cases out of 20 a mean rating of 4.63 on that scale would be no lower than 4.52 and no higher than 4.74. For means based on smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin, Out of Sight Again, Prompts Anxiety and Rumor

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 27

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made another characteristically abrupt retreat from public life today, this time stirring a sense of mystery and diplomatic risk on the eve of the Middle East conference here of leading nations whose economic aid he has been courting.
Mr. Yeltsin has canceled all meetings for two days and left Moscow to focus on domestic problems and a coming foreign mission, according to the office of the Russian President, who has previously disappeared on sudden restorative retreats that caused world anxiety about the stability of this troubled nation and its leader. 
 Aside from any perceived slight to the conference officials, his unexpected departure to an undisclosed location heightened the focus on Mr. Yeltsin's executive style and resiliency as he prepared to depart later this week for another trip to the United States.
He will be intent on reassuring the world, at the United Nations and in a White House visit, that Russia deserves moral and economic support as it tries to lead the republics of the fallen Soviet Union in a new Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr. Yeltsin's chief aides have said they prefer to sacrifice parts of his busy agenda occasionally to see him better prepared for important missions. But the tactic invariably proves unsettling in this crisis-bedeviled land and in the world's stock markets.
Mr. Yeltsin, who received mixed personal reviews in two previous visits to the United States, will resume his Kremlin schedule on Wednesday and meet with Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d, the President's office said.
"Circumstances arose which required his departure from Moscow," his spokesman, Pavel Voshchanov, said, again denying speculation that Mr. Yeltsin might be seriously ill from heart disease or alcohol abuse. "These rumors are absolutely foolish and are being circulated by those who do not want Yeltsin to be Russian President."
His agenda has lately been heavy with the pressures of trying to create a free-market economy from the ashes of Communism. The first step, switching to free-floating consumer prices after 74 years of drastically suppressed prices through state subsidies, has incurred the public wrath and loss of personal popularity that Mr. Yeltsin predicted when he ordered the change on Jan. 2 as an unavoidable necessity.
His other major headache has been in trying to encourage enough economic and military cooperation among republics in the new commonwealth to win some early credit and aid from overseas. Nationalist-minded Ukraine has been confronting Mr. Yeltsin with complaints about the severity and suddenness of his free-market plans and with demands for a substantial part of former Soviet Army and Navy units for building a separate military force.
In again secluding himself, Mr. Yeltsin left his domestic constituency once more speculating on the personality and staying power of their broad-shouldered, mercurial leader, who proved strong enough to stand up to old Communist Party enemies in August and deliver Mikhail S. Gorbachev from a Kremlin coup. The last thing needed by Mr. Yeltsin is another bout of personality scrutiny and increased doubts about his fitness by the world at large.
Although his initial visit to Washington was marred by press charges of buffoonery and bibulousness, Mr. Yeltsin's second visit after his heroic role in the failed coup reflected more favor and respect. One concern that has been omnipresent but rarely mentioned in his public scheduling has been personal security. The Russian President, who admits to concern about vengeful party hard-liners, is sometimes protected by portable shields in public.
Among his canceled appointments today was a meeting with Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of Japan, whose economic aid Mr. Yeltsin has been seeking. The Interfax news agency said Russian Foreign Ministry officials were insisting that his decision to miss the meeting and head out of the city was mainly because of other pressing issues and not frustration at Japan's linking of foreign aid to regaining four Kurile Islands that were seized by the Soviets at the end of World War II.
 
A Day's Rest Ordered
 In testing the social trauma of his price liberalizations, Mr. Yeltsin undertook an ambitious tour of the Russian provinces this month and was then ordered to take a day's rest by his doctors, with his office insisting that he suffered fatigue but no serious ailment.
In a previous sudden disappearance, his aides said that although Mr. Yeltsin needed treatment for a "minor" heart disorder, he was in good physical condition. The Russian President, who is 60 years old, had previously suffered a back ailment that caused him to withdraw for a while from public life. That established something of a now familiar habit of encouraging a sense of mystery that he might then dispel upon returning with a flourish to deal with a pressing issue.
In some of his most recent tours on state and commonwealth business, members of the Soviet press entourage have said Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be heavily imbibing alcohol at times. His aides have repeatedly rejected such talk. Mr. Yeltsin himself, strapping and ebullient, has been the best defense against such rumors as he often puts in long public days wrangling with Parliament and traveling the republic.
"He is in good health," insisted his spokesman, Mr. Voshchanov. "He's in more than good health. He is in excellent sports condition," the official added, referring to Mr. Yeltsin's playing tennis and volleyball as often as time permits.
 
Absence Is Criticized
 Mr. Yeltsin had not been expected to play an active role in the two-day Middle East peace conference opening here on Tuesday, a meeting conducted at the foreign ministers' level. But some of those arriving for the conference remarked on a certain crudity of timing in the Russian leader's announcement that he must suddenly leave Moscow. They noted as well his missed opportunity to extend a personal early welcome of some sort in the interests of the glaring economic needs of Russia and the other commonwealth members that have been lobbying for extensive foreign aid from many of the nations represented here.
After Mr. Gorbachev resigned as the Soviet President, Russian officials insisted that Mr. Yeltsin would offer the same sort of support and enthusiasm for the conference as did Mr. Gorbachev, its chief proponent. It has been obvious, though, that Mr. Yeltsin has neither the global wanderlust of Mr. Gorbachev nor a cornucopia of diplomatic concessions to offer in return for foreign aid, since considerable ground had already been yielded in disarmament agreements with Washington.
Still, apart from the focus on Mr. Yeltsin's decision to stay out of the Kremlin for the next two days, the arriving American delegation was according considerable credit to the Russian President and the leaders of the three other former Soviet nuclear republics -- Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- for carrying out the disarmament treaties.

HEADLINE: Florio's Budget Plan Charts Collision Course With G.O.P.

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Florio administration unveiled a budget today that counts on a turnaround in the economy, a substantial reduction in state payments for pensions, and as-yet-unapproved Federal Medicaid payments to bring it into balance. It also counts on sales tax revenues that the Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature, have vowed to cut.
The precariously balanced budget is the largest in state history at $15.7 billion -- actually more than $16 billion if an unappropriated buffer of about $300 million is included. It relies heavily on a new formula that would cut state pension contributions and increase the amount to be paid from the investment income of the pension funds.
 
No Drop in Sales Tax
 
 The new formula is used by about half the states, according to the State Treasurer, Samuel Crane, who said the old formula forced the state to shoulder more than its fair share of pension costs while revenues from pension fund investments went disproportionately back into the funds instead of being paid to retirees. The new formula would not affect the size of the pensions themselves.
As expected in the wake of still-smoldering outrage over a $2.8 billion tax increase rushed through the Legislature 19 months ago, the budget includes no additional taxes.
But neither does it include any reduction in projected sales-tax revenues, which means that it does not take into account a promise by the new, veto-proof Republican majority to roll back the one-cent increase in state sales taxes that was part of the 1990 package. The Republicans wrested control of the Legislature from the Democrats who passed the increase by riding a tide of anger over it.
And with the ink barely dry on the proposed budget, a pledge of bipartisan cooperation on the part of the Republican majority that took office last week quickly evaporated.
In a strongly worded message sent to Gov. Jim Florio as the budget was being released, the new Republican Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco of Scotch Plains, vowed that the Senate would not act on any budget proposal that did not include a tax cut.
"I am amazed that Governor Florio is not including a tax cut in his budget message," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "Less than three months ago, the people of New Jersey sent an overwhelming message that they wanted tax relief. It is simply not good enough to tout a budget that leaves record tax increases in place.
"I will not post for a vote in the Senate any budget that does not include meaningful tax relief."
As Senate President, Mr. DiFrancesco has the authority to bring the matter to a vote or bottle it up. His challenge foreshadowed a renewal of the partisan infighting that brought legislation to a virtual halt in the final days of the lame-duck Democratic majority.
Then, rather than pushing for a tax cut, the Republicans did all they could to forestall one. Even though they had campaigned unceasingly against the tax increase, they boycotted legislative sessions in which the Democrats, stunned and angered by their shattering defeat, turned the tables by offering bills to repeal every penny of the $2.8 billion increase, a move that would have left the Republicans desperate for a way to replace the lost revenues.
Since the election, the Republicans have maintained that they never intended to roll back all the taxes, just the one-percentage-point increase in the sales tax to 7 percent, which produced $590 million in revenue.
The Democratic move to roll back the taxes died when even some Democrats declined to engage in such fiscal brinkmanship, leaving the Republicans to mount their charge against taxes again.
Governor Florio is to deliver his budget message to the Legislature Tuesday afternoon, and Republican leaders like Mr. DiFrancesco have vowed to grill administration department heads at length on where they intend to spend money and where cuts can be made. Mr. DiFrancesco has gone so far as to threaten to subpoena department heads to testify if the administration is reluctant to allow them to appear.
"I will not hesitate to draw upon the subpoena powers of the Senate as our committee system conducts its detailed analysis of government programs," Mr. DiFrancesco said. The threat was similar to one issued by the former Democratic Assembly Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, when the Republicans boycotted sessions to frustrate the Democrats' threat to roll back the whole tax package. Mr. Doria said he had authority to send marshals to dragoon recalcitrant legislators back into the chamber. He did not do it.
But while politics dictated talk of tax cuts, fiscal realities demanded that officials find ways to balance a new budget with revenues that are stagnant and show no signs of turning upward despite optimistic predictions.
 
'Modest-Growth' Budget
 In the proposal outlined today, Mr. Crane proposed balancing the "modest-growth" budget for the fiscal year 1993, which begins July 1, with a combination of actuarial revisions in the pension system, requests to the Federal Government for more Medicaid reimbursements, some broad but modest cuts in departmental budgets and prayers for an upswing in the economy.
The budget calls for an increase of $1 billion over the budget for the 1992 fiscal year, to $15.7 billion from $14.7 billion.
Although there is an increase in the overall budget, it promises no new taxes, $425 million more in aid to school districts, subsidies to New Jersey Transit to avoid fare increases, and stabilization of tuition at New Jersey's public colleges and universities to keep increases at or below 4.5 percent. It would also keep the homestead property tax rebate program, a pet of Governor Florio's, intact and fully funded at $685 million.
To raise the money to do all that without a tax increase, the budget counts on cutting operating expenditures in 14 of the state's 19 departments by modest amounts ranging from a tenth of 1 percent to eight-tenths of 1 percent. The agencies for which some growth is planned are Corrections, Military and Veterans Affairs, Law and Public Safety and the Department of the Public Advocate, which polices utility rates and brings suits in the public interest.
The budget also counts on increases of about 5 percent in collections of sales, income and corporate taxes, based on predictions that the economy will significantly grow.
There are two major fiscal changes in the new budget. One is a revaluation of the pension system, which would allow the state to reduce its outlay for pension costs by about $700 million.
This would be accomplished by an actuarial revision in the way the value of pension funds is counted. The new method would use the true, or market, value of the pension, which would let the state increase the amount of pension costs that could be assessed against investment income, thereby decreasing the state's contribution.
Mr. Crane said this could be accomplished without in any way endangering the fiscal health of the state's pension funds, which have a current market value of $29 billion.
While not specifically endorsing the pension fund revaluation as a budget-balancing device, legislative Republicans seemed receptive. Mr. DiFrancesco, for example, said he was pleased that the administration was "exploring all avenues in an effort to solve the fiscal crisis."

HEADLINE: These Tax Cuts Stunt Growth

 BODY:
To judge by advance leaks to reporters, the "growth" tax cuts that President Bush will announce in his State of the Union address tonight and his budget tomorrow will promote precious little growth. Taken individually, they range from inconsequential to destructive. Taken together, they would put billions into undeserving pockets -- and wreck the tax code.
Economic recovery cannot be bought with a mishmash of political handouts. What the economy does need is a swift kick, most easily delivered by a temporary tax cut that doesn't drain away revenues once the economy recovers. For the long term, the economy needs a tax code that favors saving over consumption. Perhaps there's more to the Bush plan than has been leaked, but otherwise, it won't do much to hasten recovery or reform. 
 Mr. Bush reportedly plans to propose tax breaks for middle-class families, capital gains, corporate investment, first-time home buyers and retirement savings. Most of these ideas fail on the merits. In combination, they're worse.
Middle-Class Relief. The President wants to increase personal exemptions, perhaps targeted to children. This idea is triply flawed:
 The tax cuts would be permanent, robbing Congress of revenues desperately needed for infrastructure, children and research.
 Higher exemptions are unfair because they would be worth twice as much to richer families than to families in lower tax brackets.
 The proposal is mistargeted. Middle-class families are suffering because their wages haven't been rising, not because their taxes have been rising. Sluggish wages are a problem of productivity that can only be solved by more investment.
What kind of growth can be expected from a plan that has so much wrong with it?
Retirement Subsidies. Mr. Bush wants to give rich families a tax break on retirement savings already available to low-income families. Properly targeted, and financed, subsidies for savings might be good policy. But Mr. Bush's idea is a gimmick, rigged to produce a deceptive bulge in revenues in the short run -- while creating a huge budget hemorrhage in 5 or 10 years.
At that point, Congress will have to cut back public programs, including investment.
Real Estate Giveaways. Apparently Mr. Bush believes America can reclaim its technological lead by building housing. He proposes to bring back wasteful tax shelters for investors in real estate, the most tax-subsidized industry. He's also expected to propose a subsidy for first-time home buyers. When economists say the U.S. needs more investment, they mean in education, telecommunications, research. Not houses.
Corporate Investment. Here, finally, Mr. Bush seems to be on track. Higher subsidies for corporate investment could promote growth. But even here there's a catch.
He's also reportedly going to propose new subsidies for saving. Putting both ideas together, the President apparently wants corporations to borrow money from tax-subsidized retirement funds in order to make tax-subsidized investments. That's a double subsidy, which could well encourage corporations to buy $100 machines that produce only $90 worth of output.
The error of simultaneously subsidizing savings and investment dramatizes the folly of piecemeal tax reform. That's why Mr. Bush would do better by pledging temporary tax cuts tonight and calling for an expert commission on long-term tax reform to report back to Congress after the November election.
Mr. Bush is likely to propose more than this list of misconceived tax cuts tonight, if only to rehearse his ill-advised capital gains cut. But unless there are some notable surprises, the tax package in his larger program looks perverse: In the name of growth, it would stunt growth.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Clinton Couple

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The Clinton couple of Arkansas have presented to the American public a gift and a testing opportunity.
The gift is that they treated us as adults. The opportunity is for us to act that way. 
 They spoke as individuals but it was as the couple that grew from two personalities that they were most effective -- united without losing separateness and supportive without mawkishness.
In the appearance that "60 Minutes" handled so well they put the responsibility for passing judgment on the Governor's conduct and deciding its consequences where it belonged -- not on the press but on themselves and the American voter.
For themselves, they made it plain that it was up to the Clintons as wife, husband and couple to decide whether whatever happened in their married life that saddened them could and should be repaired. They had made the decision that what gladdened them was more important -- and do not intend to allow anybody else to have a role in their choice.
To the public, which they recognize does have the right to decide the Governor's political future on whatever grounds seem just to the voters, they said there was no 12-year affair -- and that the rest, if there is any, is their own business to deal with. Vote for the Governor if that position satisfies you, said the Clinton couple, do not if you think more should be squeezed out of us.
I think that for now many American voters will accept that position of the Clintons -- particularly his supporters and those of us still considering all options. But "for now" is the easy part.
Suppose some other woman makes a charge of infidelity. It will be printed, or aired.
There is no one such thing as "the American press" but a collection of wildly varying presses. They do their jobs according to the tastes of their editors and owners, and readers. (Here I want to give myself the pleasure of congratulating the editors of The New York Times, in whose decisions I had no part, for playing the news story exactly right. They reported the episode, because to ignore it entirely would have been journalistically pretentious. But they kept the reports conspicuously brief. Disdain for the poison-pen press and its emulators leapt deliciously from the page.)
The poison-pen press, like The Star, Spy and others, exists for three reasons. First, enough Americans will pay for journalistic garbage; it's a market economy out there.
Second: Enough editors, publishers and writers are willing -- eager -- to make whores of themselves to pro duce salable nastiness. Their reward is to be noticed -- worth more to them than the cash fee for their services.
And sadly, there are enough mainstream "journalists" and publishers who through fear or admiration give the nasties the publicity and social acceptance they need to get attention for their poison product.
I can think of only two ways to put the vermin of the printed and electronic press out of business. One would be to rewrite in practice or law the Constitution they so demean; forget it, that would give them too much pleasure and notice. The other is to stop buying the garbage publications and click off garbage programs. Easy, and results guaranteed.
Until then, any new charge against Mr. Clinton will find a buyer. Now the difficult part: Suppose it has some portion of truth. I raise the theoretical possibility not through any knowledge but because the Clinton couple straightforwardly said thus far and no further about sexual questions and because the "gotchas" are hard at work to trap them.
If so, what then? Will we condemn the Governor without a trial? More important, will we demand a trial at all -- the print and TV sexual examination that is the monument to American immaturity and prurience?
I know there are voters who do believe that a President should have what they consider a spotless sexual history. Personally the only candidate for public office I would automatically disqualify on sexual grounds would be a rapist or a virgin.
But we can at least treasure the hope that Americans would be fed up with the slavering inquisition on politicians' sexual history and say to hell with that and the torturers. That would be a thank-you card worthy of the gift from the Clinton couple -- the presumption that Americans have achieved adulthood, at last.

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
"Welcome, election fans, to 'Meet the Adulterer,' the Emmy-Award-winning news show that lets Presidential candidates tell their own revolting stories of squalid and sordid conduct with models, actresses, bimbos and --"
"Hold it right there, fella. I categorically deny ever having had a relationship with a bimbo. What's more, even if I had, under no circumstances would I ever refer to any woman by a viciously sexist word like 'bimbo.' I am here to tell America candidly and entertainingly about adultery and me, not to be smeared as a sexist." 
 "Just a minute, Governor --"
"What's more, I am not a governor. Don't you even bother to find out who your guests are?"
"We do indeed, sir, and we know you are a Presidential candidate with a squalid, sordid, entertaining story of adultery in your background. Having to confess to a nationwide television audience must make you feel deeply ashamed."
"Not deeply, no. If she'd been one of those women who got rich off tax breaks handed out by Reagan-Bush trickle-down economics, you can bet I'd be deeply ashamed. But she wasn't. What's more, she was a woman who had never accepted a single welfare check either."
"You are saying --"
"She was middle-class."
"So the shame you feel is not deep shame?"
"Moderate shame is the way to describe it. Middle-of-the-road shame."
"You are aware, I suppose, of the allegations made by certain newspapers available at the supermarket?"
"You mean the vile accusation that I committed this adultery despite having heard the woman speak passionately at a hotel bar against a national health-care program? That is a despicable concoction which I categorically --"
"Don't change the subject, Mr. Candidate. You know the allegations I'm talking about: The grocery papers say your adultery story is a complete fabrication, that in fact you have never in your life engaged in hanky-panky --"
"That is a damnable lie which I categorically --"
"-- that with all the other candidates getting great TV exposure on shows like Emmy-Award-winning 'Meet the Adulterer,' you were afraid Americans wouldn't notice you were even running --"
"A lie which I categorically --"
"-- or worse, that they'd think you were a dull old homebody."
"I categorically deny being a dull old homebody."
"In that case, sir, you will want to give our viewers the kind of details the other candidates have provided so we can judge their credibility."
"No names. I will not reveal any names."
"Because of some quaint, old-fashioned philosophy about gentlemen not telling?"
"Now listen here, fella: I told you once I'm here to talk adultery. Why do you try to smear me by alleging I'm a gentleman?"
"You deny you're a gentleman?"
"Sordid detail is my game; let's get to it."
"All right, first the question we ask every candidate: Did you or did you not at any time before, during or after the illicit congress tell your adulterous partner you loved her?"
"Never. At some time during the proceedings, however, I definitely remember saying, 'Ma'am, I heard you tell those folks at the hotel bar that the present white-collar unemployment rate is a disgrace to this country, and I loved every word of it.' "
"Answer the question: Was that remark made before, during or after the illicit congress?"
"During. It must have been during. I'd never make a remark that personal to a woman before, and afterward the only possible thing to say is, 'I still respect you.' "
"Do you expect America to believe you didn't take advantage of that moment to tell your feminine friend your program for world peace?"
"Absolutely not. All I did was offer her a stick of chewing gum, then peeled one for myself, and we both chewed hopefully."
"Hopefully? What were you hoping?"
"I was hoping if the grocery press got this story they wouldn't get it wrong and say we'd had a smoke because if there's one thing the American voter won't stand for, it's a smoker."

HEADLINE: New York City Schools Can't Afford Any More Budget Cuts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was appointed to the New York City Board of Education on July 1, 1990 -- a little more than 19 months ago. It was an exciting time for me. After all, it was a predominantly new board -- five new members out of seven, mostly women, significant Latino representation for the first time in the history of the board, an outspoken Republican member, a Parent-Teacher Association activist and generally a good mix of committed people who wanted to change the school system so that all of our students could succeed 
 In addition, the Board of Education boasted a new Schools Chancellor in Joseph A. Fernandez, who was making sweeping changes to a system that James Gill called a "lumbering dinosaur." I had big hopes for the New York City schools. After all, we had an education President in Washington, a Governor in Albany who spoke reverently about the Decade of the Child and a New York City Mayor who had dedicated his administration to children.
What could possibly go wrong?
We all know what went wrong -- a sagging economy and the necessity for tough decisions.
Our public officials had to establish priorities -- and, unfortunately, the priority rating that we all thought would be accorded to education never materialized.
Since I took office, since this new dynamic Board of Education became a reality in July 1990, we have been forced to cut and cut and cut again. Thanks to the sacrifices our employees have made, and thanks to the creativity and hard work of the board, and of the Chancellor, we have been able at least to hold our ground.
But now the state and the city are talking about more cuts to education, cuts that would set education back immeasurably, far surpassing the pain we felt in the 1970's, from which our schools have yet to recover.
We must say no to the savaging of the school system. Our schools and our children deserve to be held in the same high regard as the Police Department, which has escaped budget cuts because of its high priority.
Not until all of the public officials who talk about their commitment to children begin to finance our children's education, will our students enjoy the bright future I envisioned for them when I became a board member.

HEADLINE: MACY'S ASKS COURT TO PROVIDE SHIELD AGAINST CREDITORS

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
R. H. Macy & Company, the proud retail business whose executives confidently took on billions in debt in the late 1980's, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, finally admitting defeat in its bruising battle with creditors and the deteriorating economy.
At a brief noontime meeting, the company's board voted unanimously to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Several board members, including Laurence A. Tisch, whose Loews Corporation had tried to prop up Macy with a $1 billion buyout plan, participated by telephone. 
 The decision puts another one of the nation's largest and best-known retailing chains into the humbling position of seeking court protection to keep its creditors at bay. It also leaves another group of suppliers and investors with little to show for their faith and scant hopes of getting all their money back.
 
 
'Best for Macy's Future'
 In bankruptcy, Macy's will conduct business as usual at its flagship store on 34th Street in Manhattan, as well as at its 250 other Macy's, Bullock's and I. Magnin department stores and small specialty chains throughout the country. The protection of bankruptcy court puts Macy's creditors on hold until its executives can draw up a plan to give the company a more manageable balance between its cash flow and costs. That will allow Macy to reduce its $3.6 billion debt load significantly and restore its balance sheet so that it can meet its obligations without resorting to the borrowing it has used to keep its business going over the last year.
"We worked day and night to find a suitable solution and ultimately came to the conclusion that filing for Chapter 11 was best for Macy's future," Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement issued yesterday. "I am convinced that beginning this rehabilitative process is the best way to protect our valuable franchise."
 
Tisch Plan Fell Through
 The Chemical Banking Corporation and Bankers Trust Company are providing $600 million in short-term financing that Macy will use to pay for merchandise, utility bills, wages and salaries for its 69,500 employees and other operating expenses.
The filing became all but inevitable when the Tisch plan fell through late Friday. With nothing but bankruptcy on the table late Saturday afternoon, Macy's executives left their offices and let the company's lawyers and investment bankers take over the assembling of legal documents and financing needed to file for bankruptcy.
Under the first step in the bankruptcy proceeding, Macy will ask Judge Burton R. Lifland for permission to make pension and payroll payments, retain lawyers and accountants and use current bank accounts.
The "debtor in possession" financing provided by Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust will not be available for 15 days. In the meantime, the judge will arrange interim financing.
The papers filed by Macy's lawyers yesterday with the Federal Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York show the company has $4.9 billion in assets and $5.3 billion in liabilities.
A panoply of bondholders, banks, building contractors and garment manufacturers are Macy's largest unsecured creditors. The biggest are Macy's junk bondholders, who are collectively owed $1.6 billion. The next largest are Alexander & Alexander, an insurance company that Macy's owes $6.3 million, and Kraus-Anderson Construction of Minneapolis, which is owed $1.6 million.
Although the law gives Macy up to 120 days to formulate a plan for getting its business back into working order and 60 more days to seek its creditors' approval for the plan, judges often extend those periods.
"We estimate that this will be not longer than a two-year process, and that the bondholders will receive about 60 cents on the dollar at the conclusion," said Jack Hersch, an analyst who follows bankrupt companies for Lehman Brothers. "We would also expect to see Macy emerge with a far healthier balance sheet."
 
Fate of Management
 Bankruptcy law favors keeping the management team in place if possible, and since Mr. Finkelstein, Mark S. Handler, the company's president and chief operating officer, and many of the top managers are highly regarded merchants, they are likely to keep their offices on the 13th floor of Macy's flagship store.
But bankruptcy will likely force them to focus more than ever on the financial side of their business. "They belong to the old school of the retailing business, which attends to the merchandising assortment but not the business fundamentals," said Kurt Barnard, a retail consultant. "They may be somewhat uncomfortable with the financial requirements of bankruptcy."
The fate of Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade and the other promotional events it sponsors rests in Judge Lifland's hands, and few analysts could imagine that the judge would want to be remembered as the villain who put those institutions to death. A Macy's spokesman said that the company would try to demonstrate that the parade and other Macy events contribute to the company's franchise.
Founded in 1858 by Rowland Hussey Macy, a Nantucket whaler whose previous six attempts at retailing failed miserably, Macy's built an empire and a reputation for department store merchandising that has been copied by many competitors. But no amount of merchandising magic was able to overcome a recession and the debt Macy took on in the late 1980's.
Macy borrowed heavily to go private in a $3.5 billion management buyout in 1986 and then it added more debt when it bought the two West Coast chains, Bullock's and I. Magnin, for $1.1 billion in 1988.
The buyout gave Mr. Finkelstein and the other executives a bigger stake in the company, but they are now likely to lose almost all of their original investment.
A report by Raz Kafri, David Teolis and Jack Hersch of Lehman Brothers estimates that holders of Macy's common shares -- company officers, managers and directors -- can only expect to recoup 2 percent of their investments after bankruptcy.
The preferred stockholders, a group including subsidiaries of the General Electric Corporation and Loews, are likely to get only 8 percent of the value of their shares, the analysts estimate.
Several apparel manufacturers said yesterday that they were relieved Macy had filed for bankruptcy protection. Many have delayed shipments to Macy because they were afraid they would not get paid if the retailer filed for bankruptcy.
Those suppliers who are due payments from I. Magnin and Bullock's are likely to be paid in full after the company emerges from bankruptcy. But analysts at Lehman Brothers said those manufacturers who are owed money by Macy's department stores may only get 55 cents on the dollar, because of a provision in the original buyout agreement.
"This was something they needed to do for a long time," said Morris Marmalstein, chairman of the Warren Group, a collection of dress manufacturing companies.
Mr. Marmalstein said he had made partial shipments to Macy during the last month but would now ship everything the company ordered.
It was Macy's inability to pay manufacturers like Mr. Marmalstein that forced it to take the bankruptcy step.
Macy's desperate situation became apparent when the company told its suppliers it would be two weeks late with payments due on Jan. 10. The terms of its revolving credit line required Macy to keep its borrowing below $150 million for 30 consecutive days, and it could not satisfy that requirement and pay the companies that make the merchandise sold in its stores.
Macy's, which rang up $6.7 billion of sales during its fiscal year ended Aug. 3, 1991, was strapped for cash.
Yesterday's court papers described the 1991 holiday selling season as "the Christmas that never came."
During the next two weeks, Sir Run Run Shaw, a Hong Kong investor in Macy's, offered to give the company a $250 million loan that would allow it to pay its bills. But Macy's institutional lenders, whose loans to the retailer are backed by its stores and inventory, refused to share that collateral with Sir Run Run and the deal fell through.
The same banks and insurance companies that had seemed so willing to renegotiate and waive the restrictions on Macy's loans in December suddenly seemed to get cold feet.
 
Pattern Held True
 That seemed to hold true last week when Mr. Tisch, chairman and chief executive of Loews and a big Macy shareholder, proposed that Loews buy the company for more than $1 billion.
When the board assembled on Friday afternoon to consider the Tisch proposal, the only other option on the table was bankruptcy, an option Mr. Finkelstein had vowed to avoid since late 1989 when Macy's losses began mounting and the specter of bankruptcy first emerged.
The meeting was somber and sad, even before word came that Loews and the Prudential Insurance Company of America had failed to agree on new terms to refinance the $811 million mortgage the insurer held on dozens of Macy's stores. With no plan to vote on, the board decided to meet yesterday on a bankruptcy filing.
On Saturday, analysts and consultants speculated Prudential would buckle to pressure and return to the table. But Mr. Tisch flew to Minneapolis early Sunday for the Super Bowl, and Prudential never returned to the bargaining table.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Win or Lose, Buyouts Do It Big

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The bankruptcy filing of R. H. Macy & Company represents yet another leveraged buyout gone bad. But while the list of leveraged failures is long, the list of leveraged successes is also substantial.
Safeway, the supermarket chain; Duracell, the battery maker; American Medical International, which owns hospitals, and RJR Nabisco, the largest leveraged buyout ever, have succeeded despite the huge debts they took on. Among the companies that went from buyout to bankruptcy are Federated Department Stores, the parent of Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus; Jim Walter, a leading home builder; Southland, the owner of the 7-Eleven stores, and Interco, a shoe and furniture company.
 
Mitigating Factors
 Luck played a part in which group a company ended up in. It is not Macy's fault that the economy entered a prolonged period of weakness just as the company needed to improve cash flow. But there is also the matter of timing, and of the rising optimism through much of the 1980's. In general, leveraged purchases in the last years of the decade were made at much higher prices than those earlier in the decade. It was not impossible to make a good deal in 1987, but it was highly unlikely. 
 The Gibson Greetings deal, one of the first big leveraged buyout successes and one that caught the eye of Wall Street when it provided huge profits to investors, was in fact a rather conservative one when it was done in 1981. Its financial statements showed it had cash flow more than twice what would be needed to meet its interest obligations, even if business did not improve.
But from 1986 on, many junk bond issues, most of them intended to pay for acquisitions, had financial statements that showed the company was not taking in enough money to meet its projected interest payments, according to a study by Barrie Wigmore of Goldman, Sachs & Company. It was assumed that business would improve, and in some cases that subsidiaries would be sold off, at a fast enough rate to allow the company to meet its obligations.
The highly leveraged companies left over from that credit expansion have now been broadly divided by lenders and investors into two groups. In the first group, deemed successful, the companies have been able to go public by selling stock if they wished. Many have also been able to refinance their debt, taking advantage of lower interest rates.
It is the second group that has suffered as lenders have refused to make new loans. Part of Macy's debt is a 12 percent mortgage on at least 70 of the retailer's stores, owed to the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Mortgage rates for creditworthy customers are now far lower, but Macy cannot get the lower rates. Prudential refused last week to cut the interest rate on the mortgage, citing its obligations to policyholders, which led Laurence A. Tisch, the chairman of Loews and CBS and a Macy director, to withdraw an offer to refinance the company.
In that regard, Macy is like an unemployed homeowner with a 12 percent mortgage. The homeowner can no longer meet interest payments, and because he is out of work cannot persuade a bank to refinance his mortgage at lower rates. His employed neighbor, who can afford higher payments, will be able to get a new loan from the bank at a lower rate.
There is nothing mysterious about the basic structure of a leveraged buyout. A company is purchased, as in any buyout, although in a leveraged deal virtually all the money is borrowed. As in any buyout, the eventual success or failure depends largely on whether the future operations of the company are profitable enough to justify the price paid. A difference is that the more leverage is used, the less room there is for error in forecasting.
A key factor in separating the winners from the losers is whether a company had dependable cash flows. RJR Nabisco succeeded in part because smokers kept buying cigarettes as prices were raised. "Highly cyclical companies are terrible candidates for an LBO," said Artur Raviv, a finance professor at Northwestern University. He pointed to the bankruptcy of the USG Group, the former U.S. Gypsum, a company heavily dependent on home construction.
But some cyclical buyouts worked, reflecting lower purchase prices and perhaps better luck. "One of the great successes of the 1980's was Cain Chemical," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a harsh critic of many buyouts.
Macy itself might by now have been deemed a winner had it gone through just one highly leveraged transaction, rather than two. The first deal was in 1986, when Macy went private in a $3.5 billion buyout led by its management. It had a large amount of debt but also an operating cushion so large that in the fiscal year ended Aug. 1, 1987, the first after the buyout, cash flow was enough to cover all interest expenses, plus capital spending -- with $54 million left over.
Then came the 1988 bidding war for Federated Department Stores, fought by Macy and the Campeau Corporation, controlled by Robert Campeau, a Canadian financier. As the price escalated, some people said that whoever won would be paying too much. That did not quell the frenzy, and in the end, a deal was struck. Campeau won most of the company but Macy got what it most coveted, the California-based Bullock's and I. Magnin chains, for $1.1 billion.
It took less than a year for Campeau to fail, and its stores, which include Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, went through bankruptcy proceedings in a pattern that is likely to be repeated with Macy. The stores remained open, but the owners changed. It is likely that Macy creditors, from bondholders to banks, will end up owning most of the stock in a reorganized Macy. Current shareholders will see their stakes sharply reduced, and perhaps eliminated.
In late 1990 and early 1991, those shareholders were willing to step up and make new investments, giving Macy the money to buy back some bonds at greatly reduced prices. This year, after another 12 months of poor results, they were not willing to invest any more.
As the Federated debacle was unfolding, Macy's chairman, Edward S. Finkelstein, liked to emphasize that his company, unlike Campeau, was run by merchandisers who understood retailing. But his financiers underestimated the degree to which cash flow could suffer if consumers turned cautious.
"Taking note that the consumer led us out of the recession in 1982, investment bankers and investors embraced the belief that consumer-oriented LBO's would show sufficient growth to meet aggressive debt schedules," said Mariel Clemensen, the director of high-yield bond research at Lehman Brothers. "But the consumer is in no position to lead us out of the current recession."
That fact, as much as any overpaying, helps to explain why Macy is now in bankruptcy.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 29, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday about leveraged buyouts misstated the condition of the USG Corporation, the parent of U.S. Gypsum. Although USG has defaulted on bond payments and bank loans, it has not filed for bankruptcy protection and hopes to avoid doing so.

R.H. MACY & CO.
 Currently operating more than 251 stores, including the I. Magnin and Bullock's chains, Macy sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday. Most of the debts stemmed from Macy's $3.5 billion leveraged buyout by management in 1986 and subsequent $1.1 billion purchase of I. Magnin and Bullock's.
 
FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES
 The operator of 140 stores including the Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Lazarus chains, Federated failed to pay interest on loans after Campeau Corp. of Canada bought the company in 1988 for $6.6 billion. Federated filed for Chapter 11 protection in January 1990 along with Allied Stores Corp. They are expected to emerge from bankruptcy in mid-February.
 
ALLIED STORES
 Currently operating 82 stores, including the Bon Marche and Stern's, Allied failed to make interest payments after Campaeu Corp. bought it for $3.4 billion in 1986. Allied filed for Chapter 11 in January 1990 along with Federated.
 
CARTER HAWLEY HALE STORES
 Carter Hawley Hale currently operates 88 stores, including Broadway and Emporium chains based in California. It failed to make payments on $1.3 billion in debt from 1987 restructuring undertaken to fend off takeover bid by Limited Inc. It filed for Chapter 11 in February 1991.
 
REVCO D.S.
 The 1,141 unit drugstore chain, currently operating in 10 states, was unable to make interest payments on debt from $1.25 billion leveraged buyout in 1986. It filed for Chapter 11 in July 1988. Creditors have failed to approve a reorganization plan. Rival drugstore retailer Jack Eckerd Corp. has offered to buy Revco for $925 million.
 
AMES DEPARTMENT STORES
 Ames, a discount chain operating 371 stores in 15 states, was unable to handle debt after buying the Zayre discount store chain for $788 million in 1988. It filed for Chapter 11 in April 1990 and hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 this year.
 
HILLS DEPARTMENT STORES
 Currently operating 154 stores in 12 states, Hills was unable to handle remaining debt from $637 million leveraged buyout in 1985. It filed for Chapter 11 in February 1991. (Source: Associated Press)

HEADLINE: Land and Health Also Erode in Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PONT SONDE, Haiti, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The fields are still green here, but they do not mask the ominous signs that the international economic embargo intended to force a return to democratic rule in Haiti is accelerating land and environmental damage, and threatening already precarious food supplies for the hemisphere's poorest people.
Trade sanctions imposed by the Organization of American States have blocked fuel, fertilizer and pesticides to the rice farmers of the Artibonite Valley. The sanctions were voted early in October in an effort to reverse the Sept. 30 coup in which the elected civilian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown. 
 Now, water from the nearby hydroelectric dam, which normally spills into the farmers' irrigation canals, is being diverted for hydroelectric turbines that will light Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, to the south. Not enough fuel is left for the diesel-burning generators that usually supply power to the city.
Where rice paddies once bathed in pools of water, farmers in this valley now labor in mud to save what they can of the harvest. The diversion of water has left these farmers, in Haiti's vital growing area, with stunted, bug-infested crops that specialists say will fall far short of what Haitians will need in the months ahead.
"If we got 10 sacks of rice per plot before, we would be lucky to get two or three now," said a farmer, Helas Kenol, as he surveyed his paddies. "If we don't get water and fertilizer soon, this field won't be worth a thing."
Mr. Kenol said the fertilizer that farmers once bought for $12 a bag now cost $27, when it could be found at all. At this price, he said, fertilizer was out of reach for most people.
 
Worst in the Backwaters

 By Haitian standards, this rice-growing valley has been prosperous. But the embargo is squeezing even these areas. And in poor places, which in the best of times had to struggle to make do, the economic sanctions are having deadly effects.
In Pont Leocan, a dusty, hillside stand of mud-walled houses just five miles from the rice paddies, villagers told of the recent deaths of two children from what they called "the curse" -- a famine caused by the embargo -- combined with two years of drought.
"We sell a little wood; that is all we have to live from now," said one of the villagers, Eternel Seide, pointing to bundles of kindling gathered from the nearly naked hillsides. "With a little money, one of us can go to town and buy some flour, or whatever else we can find. That is how we survive."
Aid workers say the scavenging that Mr. Seide described is typical of desperate rural survival tactics in this country, which accelerate damage to the environment and threaten wider famine in the near future.
Since supplies of propane were cut off by the embargo, most restaurants, hotels and households that used bottled gas have reverted to burning charcoal and wood to cook and to heat water. This speeds the deforestation process.
Trees cut to the stump or stripped of their branches line every country road, as do stacks of firewood and bundles of charcoal offered by eager vendors.
With each felled tree, experts say, Haiti, already with one of the world's worst soil-erosion problems, becomes a drier, less arable country.
As hunger has become more prevalent, other destructive survival tactics have taken hold. Aid experts say that in many poor areas, farmers have been forced to choose between planting seeds for future harvest and eating them now to keep their families alive.
 
A Daily Diet of Seeds
 Virginia H. Ubik, local director of Project Care said that in some of the poorest areas, she said, practices like eating seeds and foraging for plants as food have contributed to the wide outbreak of skin rash and other illnesses.
And with many rural areas having no electricity to refrigerate vaccine or little transportation to distribute it, Ms. Ubik said, preventable diseases like measles had begun killing already weakened children.
A Bush Administration official who is close to efforts to resolve Haiti's crisis said that reports of deaths in the countryside from hunger and inadequate health care were "highly disturbing."
"We signed on to this embargo to help democracy, not to destroy the country's economy," the official said. "Something is going to have to be done to assure that our efforts penalize the right people and not just everyone in a blanket fashion."
In the meantime, as evidence mounts that the elite in Port-au-Prince has largely escaped the embargo's full force, devising ways to obtain at least minimum supplies of gasoline and other essential imports, American diplomats are reportedly considering punitive measures against people believed to have backed the coup and the military-led government that was created from it.
But diplomats say that the steps contemplated, including the freezing of individuals' assets in the United States and the selective canceling of visas, could run into legal obstacles.
Concern that the embargo may be hurting the wrong people comes amid other signs that international efforts to restore Father Aristide are foundering.
In a series of interviews in recent days, O.A.S. officials and others involved in negotiations over Haiti have expressed near-exasperation that each time real progress seems to be at hand, political leaders in Haiti and Father Aristide in exile change the terms of discussion, derailing the talks.
 
Politician Intimidated

 At the same time, outlaw elements of the armed forces and drug dealers have reappeared.
Last week, when a compromise arrangement seemed in place to name the pragmatic leader of Haiti's small Communist Party, Rene Theodore, as Prime Minister, gunmen burst into a meeting he was attending, firing shots into the air around his house.
[On Saturday, plainclothes policemen disrupted a meeting in Port-au-Prince between Mr. Theodore and other political leaders. Mr. Theodore's bodyguard was slain, and several others were beaten.]
Diplomats say the police fear the return of Father Aristide because of their role in the coup. They add that former members of the notorious Duvalier militia, the Tontons Macoute, and corrupt officers purged from the armed forces are also working to prevent a political settlement as it might interfere with plans to resurrect drug trafficking or extortion.
Father Aristide's supporters have started accusing the United States of lax enforcement of the embargo, which they say has prolonged Haiti's crisis.
 
Industry Is Vanishing
 "The way the embargo has been applied is not serious," said the Rev. Antoine Adrien, an adviser to Father Aristide, citing the arrival of three fuel shipments that circumvented the sanctions. "A short-term, very strict embargo would have done the job, and at the grass-roots level, people still support such a measure."
But amid hope for a political solution, others point to the flight of industries from the capital and the accelerating devastation of the countryside, and say that the sanctions, if continued, will wreak irreparable damage.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAING: Finances;
Candidates Scramble For Dollars

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Ohio Presidential primary is not until May. So why did Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is in a hard primary fight in New Hampshire, travel here the other night, and in a snowstorm no less?
For the same reason that Senator Bob Kerrey took time out from New Hampshire to go to Minneapolis not long ago, Gov. Bill Clinton went to Memphis, Edmund G. Brown Jr. went to Manhattan and Paul E. Tsongas went to Tampa. They went for money. 
 Almost as critical, and certainly as intense, as the competition for votes in early primary states is the battle for campaign donations. No matter how popular candidates are, they cannot survive without money for television commercials, travel and salaries.
So rather than devote all their effort to New Hampshire, candidates are darting around the country, following the money trail. Even when they are campaigning in New Hampshire, candidates often steal away for what is called "dialing for dollars," telephoning potential donors.
 
The Millionaires Disappeared
 The scrambling for contributions is particularly frenetic among Democrats this year because most campaigns started late and the sour economy appears to be making donors stingier than usual. Worse, many do not want to give when an incumbent President is running.
"This is tough fund raising for all these guys," said Donald R. Sweitzer, a Harkin adviser who was the finance director for the Democratic National Committee in the 1988 campaign. "A lot of the millionaires I did business with in '88 are gone. They ain't millionaires anymore."
Indeed, there were no high rollers in a lounge at the Sheraton Hopkins here the other night for a Harkin reception that was similar to the events that all the candidates stage. For a suggested donation of $250, the 70 people who attended snacked on cheese and raw vegetables, bought drinks from a cash bar and, though the gathering was billed as private, heard the same basic speech that the candidate gives everywhere. The only difference was that he concluded with a plea for contributions.
"If I get into the ring, I can flatten Bush," he told the donors. "I know I can. What I need is your help to get into the ring. You helped me here tonight and for that I thank you very much."
 
Helping Harkin and Themselves
 Those who came to help Mr. Harkin varied, as did their motives: There were local labor leaders and politically active liberals who form Mr. Harkin's natural base of support. There were lawyers who came out of obligation to the event's organizer, Maureen Mancuso, who worked for the former Ohio Attorney General. There were Democrats who were curious about Mr. Harkin and wanted to meet him. And there were the political hangers-on who cannot pass up any opportunity to mingle with local elected officials and a candidate for President.
Charles Natkins, a Cleveland lawyer, suggested that he was leaning toward Mr. Clinton, whom he had also given $250. "Frankly," he said over a glass of punch, "Harkin's a little too liberal for me."
Then why did he show up?
"It's networking," Mr. Natkins said, motioning toward Ms. Mancuso. "Maureen is my friend. She says, 'Come out and meet Tom Harkin.' I say, 'Fine.' "
Steve Chesler, another Cleveland lawyer, offered a practical reason: Mr. Harkin was a primary backer of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a civil rights statute for the disabled enacted in 1990. "The A.D.A. is going to make a lot of money for a lot of lawyers," Mr. Chesler said.
 
The Sympathy Donation
 Other donors simply said they thought Mr. Harkin was the best candidate. "He's a good liberal," said Dr. Jerry Leibman, a cardiologist. "He's going to get the country moving again."
J. Howard Flower, who runs a civil-engineering surveying company, said he gave $250 simply because "I sympathize with any candidate, no matter what office, who has to raise funds."
Individuals can give up to $1,000 to a candidate for President. But the Harkin event sought a more manageable $250, which is also the maximum donation that the Government will match in Federal subsidies for candidates who adhere to spending limits.
Few candidates take pleasure in asking for money, and they rarely take in as much as they think they need. "It's never as good as you'd like," Mr. Harkin said of his campaign's receipts. "But we're continuing to move ahead."
Mr. Clinton collected the most by the end of 1991, nearly $3.3 million, followed by Mr. Harkin with $2 million and Mr. Kerrey with $1.8 million.
 
Stand and Deliver
 But the campaigns must raise millions more if they are to survive for long after the New Hampshire primary. To that end, Presidential campaigns sometimes try bold tactics. After Mr. Harkin recently spoke before a group of longtime supporters in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one of his aides, Julie Gammack, took to the podium and implored people to stand up and tell the Senator what they would do for him.
"More than 80 percent of the voters in New Hampshire have not decided who to support," Ms. Gammack said. "Money is crucial. I want you to tell Tom Harkin, to his face, what you are willing to do to help his campaign. Tell this man right now!"
As Harkin aides roamed through the room carrying big brown buckets for contributions, most in the audience stuck to their seats, frozen in embarrassment. Finally, one man stood up and drew mild applause when he proclaimed, "I just wrote a $100 check."
The real stir in the room came when a local ironworker rose and said his union's political action committee was giving $2,000 (PAC's can give more than individuals). His reward: a standing ovation.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Campaign;
After Hoopla, a Repositioning, Not a Call to Arms

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Billed for weeks by the White House as the kickoff to his re-election campaign, President Bush's State of the Union Message tonight was, by extension, also intended to begin his comeback from an astonishing tumble in the public opinion polls.
Despite the buildup though, there was little revolutionary in the speech. It was more a careful attempt at repositioning, with Mr. Bush reminding voters of past accomplishments while signaling his concern over the state of domestic affairs. 
 The unusually long speech was incremental in most of its domestic policy prescriptions and defensive in tone. It amounted to a Presidential acknowledgement of the sweeping changes on the political scene since Mr. Bush stood before Congress a year ago, the popular Commander in Chief of a nation consumed with the war in the Persian Gulf.
Were Mr. Bush facing a strong Democratic opponent, the speech would probably be considered far short of what he needed in the current political climate. But instead he faces a Democratic Party whose message may be gaining in the opinion polls but whose field of candidates is still sorting itself out. So for the moment he has some breathing space as he sets about repairing his Presidency.
In his 51-minute address, Mr. Bush acknowleged it was time for him to "look homeward," a bow to all the polls that show the American people angry and discontented with his record on domestic policy. He was also forced to acknowledge that in his three years as President he had seen the country move from prosperity to "hard times."
But even as he tried to address an electorate that has changed so dramatically from the 1980's, that appears increasingly eager for a more active Federal Government and for bold action on the economy, he seemed to cling to his earlier policy prescriptions. Democrats quickly denounced his plan for the economy as incremental and inadequate.
 
Capital Gains Tax, Again
 While he called for tax cuts for a variety of groups, he also repeated his call for a cut in the tax on capital gains, asserting that "never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents." He argued, once again, that the cut would spur investment and create jobs, an argument his critics dismiss more and more vocally as discredited "trickle-down economics."
On health care, an issue that has soared to the top of the public agenda, Mr. Bush called for action but offered few details. Instead, he said, "we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world."
Across the domestic policy front, from education to taxes to urban problems, Mr. Bush seemed intent on trying to defuse his critics on the left, much as he did during the 1988 campaign, when he promised to be the "education President" and the "environment President."
But now he faces an increasingly skeptical public, which gave the Democrats the edge on a variety of domestic issues in last week's New York Times/ CBS News Poll. And now he faces a Democratic opposition quick to denounce him as given to mere gestures when it comes to domestic policy.
 
Gibes From Democrats
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington sounded the Democratic line tonight in his party's response to the President. Democrats, he said, are setting forth an agenda of "fundamental change" with tax cuts for the middle class, comprehensive national health care and new trade policies.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, asserted that Mr. Bush's speech was "voodoo economics continued."
"George Bush just offered promises, promises, promises," Mr. Tsongas said.
On Capitol Hill, Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey said: "It was like a Chinese meal. It took forever, you got a thousand courses, but at the end you were still hungry."
Still, Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, argued that the President's economic program would put him back on the political offensive "and the ball deep in the Democrats' court."
Mr. Bush, keenly aware of the public's discontent with Congress, urged lawmakers to act quickly and put aside partisan politics. If tonight's speech was a preview to his campaign, it will include some Congress-bashing.
There were also other themes for the campaign year: pledges to promote family values, to fight street crime and to change the welfare system. And, perhaps most important, there was the emphasis on the attributes of a tested Commander in Chief, expected to be an important line of attack against whomever the Democrats nominate.
Mr. Bush spoke of the triumph of America in the cold war, but also of the challenges that remain. He warned of the dangers of isolationism, a slap both at many of the Democrats who are calling for a renewed emphasis on the home front and at the "America First" campaign of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is challenging him in the New Hampshire primary.
And the President simply reminded the public of the extraordinary turmoil in the world over the last three years.
Mr. Teeter argued, "The President is unique in that national security and foreign policy are his responsiblity." Down the road, it is a message that is likely to be heard, again and again, against a Democratic field that is short on foreign policy credentials.
Still, the electorate is focused on other matters at the moment. And it was telling that when Mr. Bush recalled one of his defining moments -- the flat declaration after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that "this will not stand" -- he felt compelled to apply the phrase to the lagging economy.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: Washington Memo;
Darman on Outskirts of Inner Circle

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
For Richard G. Darman, who has been a dominant figure in shaping President Bush's domestic policy, the sudden White House order this week to rewrite an Administration statement on health policy was a rare rebuke.
It is hard to tell how seriously Mr. Darman, the President's budget director, will be damaged by the incident. But he has been momentarily humiliated, and his future influence is threatened for several reasons. 
 The new White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, is building a domestic policy apparatus that would reduce Mr. Darman's role by establishing a new domestic policy coordinator for the President.
Conservatives, critical of Mr. Darman for more than a decade, are stepping up their attacks on him at a time when Mr. Bush needs all the support he can get on the right. "Darman is anathema to conservatives," said Richard A. Viguerie, a master of direct-mail fund-raising for conservative candidates.
 
Tax Increase Not Forgotten
 Conservatives support some of Mr. Darman's efforts to cut Federal spending. But, said Mr. Viguerie, they see him as far too willing to "cut deals with the Washington establishment," and they have not forgiven him for negotiating a deal with Congress in 1990 that raised taxes just as the nation was entering a recession.
Mr. Darman's longtime ally in the formulation of domestic policy, John H. Sununu, is gone, replaced by Mr. Skinner last month.
In explaining why Mr. Darman has been able to dominate domestic policy, Administration officials observed that he was knowledgeable about Government programs and the intricacies of the Federal budget law. Equally important, they said, is that the President has neglected details of many domestic programs and entrusted them to him.
Health care is emerging as a volatile issue. Democrats have repeatedly criticized Mr. Bush, saying that he has failed to come up with any comprehensive health proposals. Congressional Republicans say Mr. Darman's handling of the issue embarrassed Mr. Bush, who was hoping to use the budget that he is to release Wednesday to show that he could be as decisive on domestic problems as he has been on foreign policy.
 
'Evidence of Indecisiveness'
 Dr. Raymond Scalettar, secretary-treasurer of the American Medical Association, said today that the rewriting of the budget under duress was "evidence of indecisiveness and problems within the Administration."
On Monday, Mr. Skinner, with Mr. Bush's blessing, instructed Mr. Darman to rewrite parts of the budget that contained detailed proposals to control health costs and improve access to care for 34 million people who have no health insurance. The proposals included a tax on health insurance benefits provided by employers to high-income workers. They also included a sharp increase in Medicare premiums for affluent elderly people.
Republicans led by Representative Bill Gradison of Ohio objected to Mr. Darman's proposals as politically unwise. They also complained that the White House expected them to support the health-care package but had not consulted them on its contents.
Mr. Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, and other White House officials made comments today that suggested they did not fully appreciate or understand the objections.
 
Dispute? What Dispute?
 Mr. Fitzwater played down the dispute. He said that Mr. Gradison "objected to one of the provisions" in the budget, the White House "agreed to take another look at it" and printing of the budget was stopped briefly to "change a paragraph."
Republicans said their concerns were much more profound than Mr. Fitzwater's comments would suggest. The concerns involve basic questions of legislative strategy and the wisdom of setting forth detailed proposals. Many Republicans say such proposals will be criticized by Democrats, labor unions and business groups, while having little chance of becoming law this year.
Relations between Mr. Darman and Mr. Skinner were already strained. "The tension between Darman and Skinner is so obvious you can see it," said an Administration official who attended a meeting with them two men last week.
Mr. Darman's job would have been in immediate jeopardy if he had not made himself almost indispensable to the President in dealing with Congress on the budget, White House officials said.
The budget director has often clashed with Republicans in the Administration and Congress. Many Republicans see a pattern of secretive maneuvering in his efforts to devise a health policy for the Administration. Aides to Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, say Mr. Darman relegated the Secretary to a secondary role in formulating health policy for the President.
 
'Social Darmanism'
 Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, describes the budget director's approach to domestic problems as "social Darmanism." The term recalls social Darwinism, the 19th-century theory that the human species would improve through survival of the fittest, obviating the need for government efforts to alleviate poverty.
What remains of Mr. Bush's health policy, after the excisions ordered by Mr. Skinner, is a combination of tax credits for poor people and new tax deductions for middle-income people to help them buy health insurance. But the President has no way to pay for the package, and he has no obvious way to control health costs.
Nor is there any guarantee that all Americans would actually be covered by health insurance under his plan. Mr. Bush and his aides have rejected proposals that would require employers to pay extra taxes or otherwise contribute to the cost of health care for employees.
Frederick H. Graefe, Washington counsel for the American Protestant Health Association, which represents 500 nonprofit hospitals, said today: "The apparent disarray in the Bush Administration reflects the intractability of the health-care issue. Proposals that make good health policy may not make good national politics."

Some of the largest banks on Long Island are finding that their problems with bad real estate loans are lingering longer than at many other banks in the Northeast, whose loan problems have begun to subside.
The North Fork Bank in Mattituck, for example, said Friday that it expected its fourth-quarter results -- and those for all of 1991 -- to show a large loss. "Much of the loss is attributed to the write-down of Long Island real estate values held as collateral for loans," the company said. 
 The drop in real estate prices, which was confirmed by bank examiners who are nearly finished looking at North Fork, continues the decline seen earlier in the year.
"Problems are emerging a little later in Long Island compared to other areas," said John A. Kanas, chairman of North Fork. In eastern Long Island, he said, the biggest problems are with vacation houses valued at more than $250,000 when loans were issued, but which have fallen in value by up to 25 percent since. On western Long Island, the greatest problems involve commercial real estate developments.
 
Reserves Are Depleted
 Although North Fork said it would meet regulatory standards after its fourth-quarter loss, some investors worry that the bank's $51.4 million of reserves and $145 million of capital could be greatly depleted by loan losses. Some $102 million of commercial loans were already in trouble at the end of the third quarter. It also had $355 million of high-risk loans for construction or mortgages on commercial real estate projects.
North Fork stock, which traded as high as 36 3/8 on Sept. 4, closed yesterday at 5 3/8, up 12 1/2 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
Norstar Bank, a Melville-based subsidiary of the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., is another Long Island bank with heavy losses recently. The bank, which has 78 branches and more than $3 billion of assets, lost $49 million last year, including $15.5 million in the fourth quarter.
John B. Robinson Jr., an executive vice president at Fleet/Norstar, said the problems emerged at the end of 1990. Although the bank has increased staff to deal with troubled loans, he said holdings of badly delinquent or other loans not likely to be repaid in full would probably continue to rise in 1992, "just because of the lousy economy."
 
Worst Showing
 The loss at the Melville bank was by far the worst showing of any of Fleet's bank subsidiaries. Its other New York bank subsidiaries in Albany and Buffalo, for example, were profitable. Fleet's New England subsidiaries in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine and New Hampshire are several times the size of its Long Island bank, and had a combined loss of $72 million for the year. In some states, including Rhode Island and New Hampshire, Fleet's holdings of badly troubled loans have been declining for several quarters, while such loans are expected to continue growing at the Long Island bank.
Gary Huth, an economist at the New York State Labor Department said the downturn in the Long Island economy was so long-lasting and severe that "even when it bottoms out, the consequences might continue for a longer time than in other areas."
Real estate development has been hit hard on Long Island because a steep drop in the area's employment base has decimated the ranks of jobholders who were expected to buy new apartments and houses and shop at local stores. From 1988 to the end of last year, Mr. Huth noted, Long Island's employment base has fallen by 68,000 jobs, to 1.1 million. Until the current recession, Long Island employment had fallen only in 1975.
 
Help From a Parent
 Even at banks where loan problems peaked earlier in 1991, the weakness from the Long Island economy is lingering. The European American Bank, for example, has returned to profitability after its Dutch parent, the ABN AMRO Bank, provided extra money last year so that European American could absorb losses of more than $250 million from 1990.
To earn a profit at a time when the economy is weak and loan demand is sluggish, European American is relying more heavily now on interest payments from investments in bonds and mortgage-backed securities rather than loans. At the end of 1991, the bank's investments rose to $2.39 billion, 35 percent higher than the $1.77 billion it had a year earlier. At the same time, its holdings of loans fell 23 percent, to $1.91 billion.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: The Tax Plan;
For Most, the First Effect of the White House's Tax Plan Will Be Larger Paychecks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
While a main feature of the tax incentives in the White House's economic recovery plan is aid for the sagging real estate market, the first thing most people will experience is fatter paychecks because of less tax being withheld by employers.
The recovery plan, which senior officials said would not increase the deficit, also includes a new deduction for people who sell personal residences at a loss. 
 The surprise decision to update the income-tax withholding tables means that about 89 million of taxpayers, or 75 percent, will in effect get an advance payment on next year's refund. Over the past decade, the average refund has climbed to over $900 from $680, reflecting a withholding increase due in part to people failing, for example, to request an adjustment when they have another child.
This change, which will not reduce any taxpayer's ultimate liability, is expected to inject some $2 billion a month into the economy. It is being made administratively and will take effect almost immediately.
Overall, the plan's architects contend the various measures will provide tens of billions of dollars to stimulate economy this year and many hundreds of thousands of jobs -- 250,000 of them attributed to the added business activity resulting from a special credit for first-time home buyers alone.
 
Move on Capital Gains
 Some of the measures are aimed at higher education while others, like a $500 personal exemption for each child 18 and under, are portrayed as aiding families. And while some elements of the plan can be expected to win broad support in Congress, others, some of which have been offered before, will be contentious or ignored.
The Administration also proposed cutting the capital gains tax, long a priority of the Bush Administration but rebuffed by Congress as overly favorable to the wealthy.
The capital gains proposal would exclude from taxation 45 percent of the capital gain on assets held for three years or more, 30 percent of the gain on an asset held between two and three years and 15 percent of the gain when the asset is held at least one year.
A 45 percent exclusion would effectively cut the levy to 15.4 percent for taxpayers now subject to a 28 percent capital gains rate and to 8 1/4 percent for those in the lowest bracket, 15 percent.
Administration officials emphasized statistics showing that 60 percent of the people who benefit from capital gains each year are of moderate income, but private analysts and members of Congress pointed out that much of the gains, in dollar terms, go to the wealthy.
 
Smaller Deductions
 The adjusted withholding tables for 1992, effective March 1, will result in $345 less withheld over the next 12 months for a married worker earning up to $78,700. For most single workers whose wages subject to withholding are less than $47,450, the adjustment will cut withholding by $172.50. Bigger companies are expected to be able the make the transition first, officials said.
The adjustment will be automatic but taxpayers who want to continue to be overwithheld so refunds are larger may choose to do so by notifying their employer.
The provision to aid first-time home buyers would give them an a tax credit of 10 percent of the purchase price, up to $5,000, spread evenly over the 1992 and 1993 tax years. The house must be bought between Feb. 1, 1992 and Jan. 1, 1993. A first-time buyer is someone not owning a home during the previous three years.
Tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax that is owed while deductions reduce the income on which tax is computed.
 
Proposal on I.R.A.'s
 Various provisions deal with individual retirement accounts, including one that allows first-time home buyers to make a penalty-free withdrawal of up to $10,000 from their I.R.A. for this purpose. There is usually a 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal.
The Administration also proposed to expand current I.R.A.'s by establishing a flexible plan under which investment earnings are not taxed when withdrawn, provided the money is left in the account for at least seven years. Individuals could contribute up to $2,500 a year, subject to certain income limits from $60,000 for single filers to $120,000 for joint returns.
Another incentive would provide a new 15 percent investment tax allowance, a replacement for the investment tax credit that was most recently dropped in 1986.
Other incentives to help bolster the real estate market -- a large industry as well as the biggest repository of consumer wealth -- include four changes to rules governing the extent to which pension funds and other tax-exempt organizations are subject to the unrelated business income tax. Real estate would also benefit by amendment to passive-loss rules so that people active in real estate development could net gains and losses, the same as those in other businesses.

NEW YORK CITY
 
ASSESSING DINKINS'S PLANS 
 Mayor Dinkins's latest proposals for cutting New York City's capital budget for construction took his own city agency heads by surprise, and many commissioners are still scrambling to figure out what the cuts would mean. Some officials and fiscal monitors have expressed concern that the cutbacks would risk damaging the city's aging infrastructure even further, while construction groups worry that they would hurt the economy. But the administration says that most of the cuts would not begin taking effect for 18 months, and that special efforts have been made to protect such vital areas as bridge reconstruction. B3.
 
ANATOMY OF A SHOOTING
The shot shattered a police officer's ankle and landed a 15-year-old boy in jail. But perhaps the most remarkable thing about the bullet fired from a Brooklyn housing project roof last Tuesday was how unremarkable the sniping seemed: An act that would have been unthinkable not too long ago drew barely a flicker of public attention and surprised almost no one, not the boy's friends or teachers, and least of all the wounded officer himself. B4.
 
THAT OTHER MOB TRIAL
Eclipsed by the intense publicity that the trial of John Gotti has attracted, Thomas Gambino and his brother, Joseph, are being tried in Manhattan on charges of extorting a "mob tax" on virtually every garment manufactured in the garment industry over the last decade. B2.
 
HOUSING POLICE UNION: PAST VS. PRESENT
The new leadership of the Housing Authority police officers' union sued the union's former president, charging him with misappropriating $76,000 and with having a secret financial deal with a consultant who managed a $300,000 union welfare fund. B3.
Democrats win two Assembly elections. B2.

PAINTING PICTURE OF DECEPTION
Through tough questioning of Paul Solomon, who was at the vertex of a love triangle, Carolyn Warmus's lawyer elicted a portrait of a philandering husband who lied to his wife and deceived his mistress. B6.
 
MORE AID FOR THE SCHOOLS
New Jersey education officials unveiled a revised school aid package intended to direct an extra $341 million to middle-income districts that were angered by cuts announced just a month ago. The new aid money derives from Governor Florio's budget proposal to cut the government's contribution to state employee pension funds. B6.
 
STATE RESTS IN TEANECK TRIAL
The state rested its case in the manslaughter trial of a Teaneck, N.J., police officer accused of killing a 16-year-old black youth. Immediately afterward, the officer's lawyer began calling friends of the slain youth to testify. B6.

Transcript of President Bush's Address on the State of the Union

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's State of the Union Message tonight, as recorded by The New York Times.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored guests and fellow citizens, thank you very much for that warm reception. 
 You know, with the big buildup this address has had I wanted to be sure it'd be a big hit, but I couldn't convince Barbara to deliver it for me. I see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan and they're just happy to be sitting behind me.
I mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.
And we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history, and in the history of man on earth. For in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions. And even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I am not sure we've absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened.
But Communism died this year. And even as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy helping to manage progress and helping to lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was in my heart.
But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the cold war.
I mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. And now we can look homeward even more, and move to set right what needs to be set right.
 
A 'Roll-call of Honor'
 I will speak of those things. But let me tell you something I've been thinking these past few months. It's a kind of roll-call of honor. For the cold war didn't "end" -- it was won.
And I think of those who won it, in places like Korea and Vietnam. And some of them didn't come back. Back then, they were heroes, but this year they were victors. The long roll-call, all the G.I. Joes and Janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror.
This may seem frivolous, and I don't mean it so. But it's moving to me how the world saw them.
The world saw not only their special valor but their special style, their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. What a group we've put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote "Kilroy was here" on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said, "I saw Elvis." What a group of kids we've sent out into the world.
And there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant. And I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country's bill or an alliance's bill. But for half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial Communism had never existed.
But it did.
It doesn't anymore.
 
Ending of an Era
 And here is a fact I wouldn't mind the world acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden, and deserves a hunk of the glory.
And so, now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. No longer are they on round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won't have, as my children did, air-raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don't have to do that, and won't have the bad dreams children had once in decades past. There are still threats. But the long drawn-out dread is over.
A year ago tonight I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America's armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared, and that you endorsed: We liberated Kuwait.
And soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously, and comprehensively, about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were vindicated.
Much good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come of this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and pre-eminent power, the United States of America.
And they regard this with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be on the side of decency. They trust us to do what's right.
And I use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the gulf, Lieut. Comdr. Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day, when her children were old enough, she would tell them "that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do."
She said it all. It was the right thing to do.
And we did it together. There were honest differences right here in this chamber. But when the war began, you put partisanship aside and we supported our troops. And this is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them -- and not let our country down.
 
Reduction of Military
 Two years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with imperial Communism gone, that process can be accelerated.
Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on our own, because they are the right thing to do.
After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the B-2 bomber. We will cancel the small I.C.B.M. program. We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles.
This weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation. I have informed President Yeltsin that if the commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following:
We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use.
President Yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful.
I want you to know that for half a century, American presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend.
For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen the end of conflict. And though yesterday's challenges are behind us, tomorrow's are being born.
The Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not misunderstand me:
The reductions I have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next five years. By 1997 we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: This deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history.
 
Rejection of Isolationism
 We must not go back to the days of "the hollow army." We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century, when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe.
I remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative, S.D.I.
There are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world.
And as long as I am President I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children.
This is a fact: Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue.
Now to our troubles at home. They are not all economic, but the primary problem is our economy. And there are some good signs. Inflation, that thief, is down, and interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble and growth is not what it should be.
And let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart: I know we're in hard times, but I know something else: This will not stand.
In this chamber, we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can defeat hard times together.
I believe you'll help. One reason is that you're patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done, because it's the right thing to do.
The power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea: That people will do great things if only you set them free. Well, we're going to set the economy free, for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it's that if we can change the world, we can change America.
We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries and new jobs.
We must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, red tape and, yes, wasteful government spending.
None of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling.
The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks. They're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of a plan is, Is it sound and will it work?
We must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a longer-term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy.
There are certain things that a President can do without Congress. And I'm going to do them.
 
Revamping of Government
 I have this evening asked major Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new Federal regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth.
Further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and businessmen and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I have instructed our government regulators to stop it.
I have directed Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to speed up pro-growth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next six months. And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well being. That means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges and jobs building railways.
And I have this evening directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the Federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of Americans from whom the Government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the Government withhold less from their paychecks.
Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car.
And finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down.
Now these are the things I can do.
And now, members of Congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. You must, you must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs.
Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery.
 
Proposals on Taxes
 And I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax, and the creation of a new 15 percent investment tax allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work.
Real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we've ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work, people buy homes and take out mortgages.
My plan would modify the passive-loss rule for active real estate developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time home buyers to withdraw savings from I.R.A.'s without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home.
And, finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business, or a farm or a single investment.
This time, at this hour, I cannot take 'No' for an answer. You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country.
Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogues are wrong. They are wrong, and they know it. Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country.
And so I'm asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, those of you who say, "Oh, no, someone who's comfortable may benefit from that," you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan, who couldn't sleep at night worrying that somehow someone somewhere was out having a good time.
The opponents of this measure and those who've authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. And maybe it's time that stopped.
This then is my short-term plan. Your part, members of Congress, requires enactment of these common-sense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy, without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates.
And while my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care for those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend Federal unemployment benefits, and I ask for Congressional action right away.
And I thank the committee ---- Well, at last.
And let's be frank. Let's be frank; let me level with you.
I know, and you know, that my plan is unveiled in a political season. I know, and you know, that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my aim is to increase our nation's good. And I'm doing what I think is right; I'm proposing what I know will help.
I pride myself that I'm a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue, but I understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement.
But let me tell you, let me tell you, far more important than my political future -- and far more important than yours -- is the well-being of our country. And members of this chamber, members of this chamber, are practical people, and I know you won't resent some practical advice: When people put their party's fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country, but for themselves. And they will certainly deserve it.
And I submit my plan tomorrow. And I am asking you to pass it by March 20. And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20. From the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined.
And you know, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.
 
Plan for Long-Term Growth
 And I said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it's the second part that is the heart of the matter. For it's not enough to get an immediate burst. We need long-term improvement in our economic position.
We all know that the key to our economic future is to insure that America continues as the economic leader of the world. We have that in our power.
Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future.
First, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. We will work to open markets everywhere.
And in our major trade negotiations I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America's farmers and workers. And we'll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American Free Trade Agreement, and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.
But changes are here, and more are coming. The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer literate, highly educated.
And we must be the world's leader in education. And we must revolutionize America's schools.
My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility and help communities create new American schools.
Thirty states across the nation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. Now Congress must join this great movement. Pass my proposals for new American schools.
 That was my second long-term proposal. And here's my third: We must make common-sense investments that will help us compete, long term, in the marketplace.
We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make the R and D tax credit permanent, and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion dollars this year alone for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies.
 
On Crime and Education
 And fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs.
And it is time for a major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society, and in our future together.
Surely, a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. And surely, it's true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime -- from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for -- surely these people have been denied a basic civil right.
It is time to restore it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country.
And fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our Hope housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation, which will get businesses into the inner city. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things.
My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing.
And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence: Head Start.
Step six: We must reform our health-care system, for this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world.
American health costs have been exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We simply cannot afford this.
 
Tackling Health Insurance
 The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget, but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes. And you pay the bill.
We must make a choice.
Now some pretend we can have it both ways; they call it play or pay. But that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs and, eventually, a system under complete Government control.
Really, there are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the Government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we'll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service and a huge new tax burden.
Or we can reform our own private health-care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world.
Well, let's build on our strengths.
My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered. We do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. The middle class gets help, too. And, by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems.
We must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice and reduce the people's nagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I will announce shortly, does just that.
 
Deficit-Control Plan
 And seventh, we must get the Federal deficit under control.
We now have in law enforceable spending caps, and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now. But I cannot let them do it. And I won't.
My plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. And I will not tamper with Social Security, but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would also freeze Federal domestic government employment.
And with the help of Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve Federal funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. We can get rid of each and every one of them.
You know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten: This government is too big and spends too much.
And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork-barrel appropriations. Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples, a Lawrence Welk museum, a research grant for Belgian endive.
We all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. And I know how to say it. And you know what I need to make it stick. Give me the same thing 43 Governors have -- the line-item veto -- and let me help you control spending.
We must put an end to unfinanced Federal Government mandates. These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without supplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a mandate just increases someone else's burden, and that means higher taxes at the state and local level.
Step Eight: Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting Congressional action, bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform and my national energy strategy.
And finally: We must strengthen the family, because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this country, "Family matters."
 
Help for Families
 And I am announcing tonight a new commission on America's urban families. I've asked Missouri's Governor, John Ashcroft, to be chairman, former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be co-chair.
You know, I had mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities in the other day at the White House, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of them, Republican and Democrat, agreed on one thing: That the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. And they asked for this commission, and they were right to ask, because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound.
There's one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child. I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. For a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2,000. This is a good start, in the right direction, and it's what we can afford.
It's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. And I'm asking you to do just that.
And I'm asking you to allow people to use money from their l.R.A.'s to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. And I'm asking for more. Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare.
Americans are the most generous people on earth. But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit.
Welfare was never meant to be a life style. It was never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy.
It's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system.
States throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions: That when able-bodied people receive government assistance they have responsibilities to the taxpayer. A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training. A responsibility to get their lives in order. A responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock. And a responsibility to obey the law.
We are going to help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving certain Federal regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks our help.
And I want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger pointing. If you read the papers or watch TV you know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division.
Really, this is not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable.
And so you have my plan for America. And I am asking for big things, but I believe in my heart you will do what's right.
And you know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress.
But you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine.
But, my friends, the people cannot wait. They need help now.
And there's a mood among us. People are worried. There has been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired.
And I thought, "Really? Go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the men and women who put him there. Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women of Desert Storm."
Moods come and go, but greatness endures. Ours does.
And maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailyness of our lives, we forget.
We are still and ever the freest nation on earth, the kindest nation on earth, the strongest nation on earth.
And we have always risen to the occasion.
And we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. Because I look at hard times and I make this vow: This will not stand.
And so we move on, together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world.
Thank you. God bless you.
And God bless our beloved country. Thank you very, very much.

Prices Rise as Confidence Drops

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A surprisingly big drop in consumer confidence and sales of big inventories of corporate bonds helped to lift prices of Treasury securities yesterday.
In addition, an important measure of inflation showed that cost pressures continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, a trend that analysts expect to continue. 
 Prices began to move higher shortly after the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell sharply in January.
 
 
Spending Hasn't Risen
 Some analysts had hoped that the big decline in interest rates in late December and early January might brighten consumers' attitudes. And home builders have been indicating that they expect sales to rise. But those expectations have not yet been translated into increased spending.
"Two bad 10-day auto sales numbers told me that consumers just weren't around" in January, said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
At the moment, Mr. Liro said, "I can't tell if the economy is growing or contracting, and that is a bad situation for any economy to be in."
The rise in Treasury prices was enhanced as demand began to appear for investment-grade corporate bonds issued earlier in the month. For the last few weeks, dealers have been selling Treasury issues to cover unsold corporate bonds. Dealers have been buying back Treasury issues as inventories of corporate securities have been pared.
 
 
Interest in Corporate Issues
 "Interest rates have backed up enough so that corporate yields look more attractive now," one government bond trader said. "Even with the good jump in stock prices, we had some people selling equities to buy corporates."
Traders did not appear to pay much attention to the nine-tenths of a percent rise in the fourth-quarter employment cost index, an increase that was slightly lower than anticipated.
But the number pleased economists, who said that because of the weak economy and rising productivity, employer costs should come down further this year, and perhaps into 1993.
 Since many of the proposals in President Bush's State of the Union Message were already in the public domain, the speech itself is unlikely to come as a surprise to the financial markets, traders and analysts said.
Indeed, some suggested that the substance and nature of the Democrats' response to the President might be of greater significance to the fixed-income market.
"I'm more interested in what the Democrats have to say," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America. "That will tell us if this will degenerate into a bidding match" over the nature and extent of the fiscal stimulus that ultimately emerges, "as well as the timing of the package."
Many market participants were assuming that Mr. Bush would ask Congress to produce a fiscal package by late February or early March. Indeed, in his address, Mr. Bush set a deadline of March 20 for Congress to act.
 
 
Long Bond Yield Off 0.06%
 Those sorts of thoughts were not reflected in the market yesterday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10330/32 , up 23/32 , to yield 7.66 percent, compared with 7.72 percent late Monday.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10213/32 , up 22/32 , to yield 7.15 percent. And prices of the 6 1/4 percent five-year notes rose by 17/32 , to 9925/32 , to yield 6.30 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly.

HEADLINE: ARAB-ISRAEL ON REGIONAL ISSUES START IN MOSCOW

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 28

 BODY:
A Middle East conference opened here today, with Israel for the first time sitting down for talks on regional cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the other Arab gulf countries, but the meeting was overshadowed by the Palestinians' absence.
The Palestinian spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said the Palestinians were barred from the conference by the United States and Russia, who objected to the presence of Palestinians from East Jerusalem and from outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said it was the Palestinians who had refused to come according to the terms set out in the invitation, and he added that he was "disappointed" that they had missed yet another opportunity to advance their cause.
 
A Lot of New Faces
 The opening day of the conference was full of unusual scenes and contradictory emotions. The setting of the meeting was bizarre: 24 countries gathered in food-strapped Moscow in the dead of winter -- in the same Hall of Columns where the Stalin show trials were conducted in 1938 -- to discuss regional development of the Mideast.
The discussions themselves seemed to combine some strikingly dramatic signs that the age-old Arab-Israeli conflict was thawing -- and some very strained speeches that suggested it might not be changing much after all.
 
'Who Would Have Imagined?'
 Today's high point may have come when the co-chairmen, Mr. Baker and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, gaveled the conference to order and looked out to see sitting before them around a rectangular table a lot of people who have never sat together before: Russians and Americans co-sponsoring a peace conference, the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait sitting alongside Israelis, and China and Japan for the first time joining Mideast peace talks. China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Yang Fuchang, went out of his way to walk across the room and warmly embrace Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy.
"Look around you, ladies and gentlemen, at the parties who are gathered at this table," Secretary Baker told his fellow delegates. "Who would have imagined even five years ago that the United States would launch a new partnership with a democratizing Russia?"
The American and Russian co-sponsors envisaged this two-day conference as a vehicle to open a dialogue between Israel and the wider circle of Arab countries -- Tunisia, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- about regional problems like arms control, water, the environment, refugees and economic development.
Algeria and Yemen had planned to attend but did not show up once it became apparent the Palestinians were not coming. The Syrians and Lebanese had never planned to attend the meeting and urged the other Arabs to join them, but they would not.
The hope of the co-sponsors is that if Israel can be drawn into negotiations with the wider Arab world, this will demonstrate to the Israeli public the potential for real acceptance around the region and therefore make Israel more willing to trade land for peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians in their separate negotiations, which were started in Madrid and are being dealt with separately from this conference.
When the United States and the Soviet Union invited Arabs and Israelis to open direct peace talks in Madrid last October, the invitation included plans for a multinational conference that would follow two weeks later. It was also envisaged that it would be held in Moscow, but because of several technical problems it was delayed.
In the meantime, the direct talks begun in Madrid between Israel and Jordan, Israel and Syria, Israel and Lebanon, and Israel and the Palestinians were followed up by two rounds in Washington, one in December and one in mid-January.
 
Moderation and Stubbornness
 Today's session was confined to 10-minute speeches by each country, and the Arab delegates made it immediately clear that they had no intention of engaging in any serious regional cooperation with Israel until the Palestinians were brought into the process and Israel agreed to trade land for peace with its immediate neighbors.
Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, like all the Arabs present, gave a low-key, relatively moderate speech. He nevertheless captured the mood of the Arab delegations when he declared that no matter what statements were made here today, "We cannot make or attain specific progress if Arab lands continue to be occupied and the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination."
The speech by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Levy, was also generally conciliatory, but made clear that Israel viewed regional cooperation with the Arab world as something that could and should progress independently of talks over territory with Israel's immediate neighbors.
 
Levy, Alone
 None of the Arab ministers, save for Egypt, applauded Mr. Levy's speech, or spoke with him. The standoffishness was symbolized by Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, Chief of Planning for the Israeli Army and a member of the Israeli delegation, who was taking photographs with his Instamatic camera of Jordanians seated next to him, but was too uncertain to speak to them.
The chilly atmosphere between Arabs and Israelis was inadvertantly summed up by Mr. Yang. Trying to express the idea that no one should expect progress overnight, he said: "As the Chinese saying goes, 'It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep.' "
 
Who Is a 'Palestinian'?
 The dispute that kept the Palestinians away is likely to bedevil this conference, as well as the separate Arab-Israeli negotiations.
The Palestinians insist that their delegation be made up of a cross-section of their community: Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and from the refugee diaspora abroad. The Israelis insisted, and the United States and Russia backed them up, that the rules of the Madrid conference applied here, and therefore the only Palestinians with whom Israelis have to negotiate are Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza.
The Palestinians countered that just because they had made a pragmatic compromise in Madrid, accepting Israel's terms in order to begin separate talks on Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, that did not mean that at this conference to discuss broader regional questions, they should make the same compromise.
 
A Compromise Rejected, Twice
 Mrs. Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman, said during a news conference outside the conference hall: "We wanted to address the world and speak out on behalf of all the Palestinians people, but unfortunately we were excluded."
At the eleventh hour, Mr. Baker offered the Palestinians a deal: He added refugees to the list of regional issues to be discussed in the working-group negotiations, which are to be set up tomorrow, and said the United States would back the Palestinians' demand to send diaspora representatives to such a session. The Palestinians said this was not enough.
Mr. Levy immediately rejected this proposal, too, saying: "If those whose participation we object to do arrive and if this runs counter to the agreement, they will meet by themselves."

Protests Among Arabs
 BEIRUT, Lebanon, Jan. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- Syria condemned the talks in Moscow today, thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon went on strike demanding a boycott of the conference and pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalists staged sit-ins at mosques here to oppose what they termed "the negotiations of capitulation."
The Syrian Information Minister, Mohammed Salman, said in an interview published in the Beirut daily Al Sharq that the talks would only play into Israel's hands. "How can there be discussions on regional issues when no progress had been achieved at bilateral negotiations," he asked.
Israel also announced that it was sending reinforcements to what it calls its security zone in southern Lebanon to head off what an army spokesman described as "terrorist attacks" and possible violence by guerrillas of the Iranian-sponsored Party of God.
Fundamentalist soldiers of the "Islamic Resistance Movement," led by the Party of God, killed one Israeli soldier and wounded another in a raid inside the zone last Sunday.
Clerics who lead the Party of God told worshipers at a mosque in the Bir al Abed quarter in Beirut's southern suburbs that holy war "against Israel and America must be stepped up." Sheikh Abbas Musawi, the party's general secretary, said Israel and the United States would use the talks "to tighten their hegemony over the Arab and Islamic worlds."
In Palestinian refugee districts in Lebanon, marchers protested and shops and schools were closed.

Chart: "The Process So Far"
 
ROUND 1: MADRID
 
Dates: Oct. 30-Nov. 3, 1991
 
Taking part: Seionr officials of Israel, Lebanon, Syria and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union.
 
Purpose: Get the process started.
 
The parties met together for the first time, thanks to compromises on the format and on the makeup of the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. Talks between Israel and Lebanon and Israel and the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation were cordial, but those between Israel and Syria quickly bogged down.
 
ROUNDS 2 AND 3: WASHINGTON
 
Dates: Dec. 10-19, 1991 and Jan. 13-16, 1992
 
Taking part: Same parties as in Madrid.
 
Purpose: One-on-one talks on substantive issues.
 
The Israelis arrived nearly a week late in December, saying they had not been fully consulted on the dates. Talks between Israel and the Palestinians could not get past arguments over procedure, and the Israelis went home again after 10 futile days. When talks were to resume in January, it was the Arabs who came a week late, waiting until after a United Nations vote to censure Israel for expelling a group of Palestinians. This time the Israelis and Palestinians managed to agree on procedure but made little progress on substantive issues.
 
ROUND 4: MOSCOW
 
Dates: Began yesterday.
 
Taking part: Israel, Jordan, eight other Arab governments, Turkey, the European Community, China, Japan and other nations, but not Syria, Lebanon or the Palestinians.
 
Purpose: Multinational discussion of regional issues.
 
The conference was originally to take place shortly after Madrid, but was delayed. The Palestinians wanted to include delegates from East Jerusalem and from outside the West Bank and Gaza. When the co-sponsors, Russia and the United States, would not agree, the Palestinians decided not to attend the talks.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION;
Transcript of Democratic Reply by House Speaker

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of remarks last night by Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker, for the Democratic response to the State of the Union Message, as recorded by The New York Times.
My fellow Americans:
Tonight I speak for the Democratic Party. But I also speak for working families and the middle class; for those who worked hard to move ahead, but now find themselves falling behind; for so many of strength and spirit and skill who watch with increasing uncertainty as so many of their hopes have been threatened. 
 This should be America's high noon.
But instead, after winning both a war in the Persian Gulf a year ago and the historic struggle of the last half century against Communism, we face an ominous, persistent recession which reminds us anew of President Kennedy's warning that "this nation cannot be strong abroad if it is weak at home."
At home in America today, thousands wait on a frozen morning outside a hotel in Chicago for just a chance to apply for a job, no matter what the work or wages.
At home in America today, the largest auto maker in the world, which once seemed to be the most secure of all corporations, announces that it will have to lay off 75,000 people in order to survive.
 
Hammers Average Earnings
 At home in America today, the average earnings increase of our workers has declined from first in the world to 10th. This year, millions more of our workers find themselves unemployed and their family's health uninsured. Many state governments are slashing education and other services and raising taxes. The nations whose freedom we protected in the past continue to surpass us in high paying jobs and the industries of the future.
The standard of living of the American people is a first and fundamental measure of the state of the American union.
So the urgent, overriding task of 1992 is to restore growth and jobs. And the great challenge of the 1990's is to reclaim our industrial edge, revive our economic leadership and make America once more the most prosperous and powerful economy on earth.
For too long we were told to wait -- that things would get better on their own. There was even an effort to talk us out of the recession -- or to tell us that it wasn't really happening at all.
But the truth finally became all too painful -- and all too clear. The supply-side, trickle-down decade of the 1980's finally led to an economy in decline, and left us month after month with a national Administration adrift in domestic policy, seemingly without ideas and without apparent commitment or energy to move America ahead.
In the midst of this recession, the Administration even resisted extending unemployment benefits; Congress had to pass it three times last year before the President would sign it. Today, before the President had sent his message, Congress took action to renew that extension, and we now welcome the President's support.
 
A Democratic Tax Cut
 For many months, Democrats have set forth an agenda for change. We have proposed a tax cut for the middle class to help lift the consumer demand that fuels our economy. We have demanded policies to bring down the trade barriers that lock American products out of markets from Europe to Asia. We've called for national health insurance to make health care a fundamental right of all Americans.
Here too we will seek common ground with the President -- and the Republicans. To achieve all this and more, we will work with him and with them to do what is best for the country.
But we will also stand our ground when basic principles are at stake. We will not agree to do the wrong thing simply for the sake of doing something. In short, we seek a fundamental change from the unsuccessful economic policies of the past 12 years.
When we say a middle-class tax cut, we mean exactly that. Not more of the tax cuts of the 1980's, which gave most of the benefits to the very few and left most of our people actually paying more in taxes.
We will insist that this time, the benefits must go to working families, not to the privileged.
We will insist that a middle-class tax cut be paid for not by taking money that should go to schools and health care, but by calling on the richest of our citizens, at long last, to pay their fair share.
 
Seeds of the Recession
 We will oppose any efforts to misuse the present crisis as an excuse to repeat the worst errors of the last decade. Then we sowed the seeds of the recession we are now in; we must not go down that path again.
During the past two Administrations, there have been consistent efforts to undo government protection of public health and safety. Today, the hurt of the unemployed is no excuse to undermine regulatory rules that protect their families and all of us from pollution, deceptive advertising, unsafe food and medicine, workplace injury and death. This is not a way to create jobs or make American business prosperous.
Nor will we accept the kind of capital gains tax cut that will lead largely to accelerated profit-taking, not accelerated investment. One can play a lot of games with statistics, but the bottom line is that two-thirds of all the money from the Administration's capital gains tax cut would go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. Instead, we need targeted incentives to reward companies that build and buy now -- that hire instead of laying-off.
The President said tonight that when you aim at the well off you usually hit the little guy. The truth is, for 12 years they have been promising to help the little guy and then giving all the breaks to the well off, and it is time that that stopped. As Democrats our purpose is not just to end this recession but to begin a new time of economic growth and progress.
So we will propose a new commitment to civilian technology and research. For half a century American weapons were the best in the world; as we enter the new century, America must build the best consumer and industrial products.
 
Seeking Open Markets
 We will pursue a trade policy that opens markets on equal terms so that when we buy from Europe and Asia they will be buying from us as well. We will demand far-reaching changes in education and training so that our students will be the first, not the last, among the industrial nations in science and math -- and so our workers will have the skills and the chance to compete successfully with anyone, anywhere.
We will also fight for fundamental change in the area of health care.
Today, millions of Americans have no health insurance at all -- and even those who do have no assurance that they're safe. People worry that if they get sick their coverage will be canceled. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs continue to multiply. Workers who lose their jobs suddenly find their children without health insurance.
This issue will be a test of our national character.
Few Americans realize that the United States and South Africa are the only economically advanced nations that do not guarantee the health care of their people.
We will fight to change that in this Congress -- and in the next one -- as long as it takes -- because lives and health are at stake, and so is the financial health of America's families.
It is not enough to make minor changes, to tinker with the edges while tolerating basic flaws. We want to replace the status quo, not protect it. We want to help the middle-class family, not tax its health care benefits.
It is time for national health insurance. It is time to cover every American. It is time to control costs. Because otherwise we will continue to pay more and more for less and less.
And soon the burden will break the budgets of middle-class families, of business and of government at every level.
Health care is one of the great unfinished tasks of our society. Almost 60 years ago America decided that people should age with dignity -- and we passed Social Security. Now we must decide that families will live with dignity -- and pass national health insurance.
Finally there are other, urgent issues of basic justice that also go to our character as a nation.
So we will oppose any effort from any quarter to widen and exploit racial division -- or lessen our commitment to break down the barriers and at long last fulfill the pledge that millions of us make every day, from the schoolhouses of America to the floor of the House of Representatives: that we shall be "one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." Appeals to race should have no place in our politics or our national life.
 
Civil Rights Promise
 We will stand for another civil right of every American -- the civil right to be protected from violence and crime.
Election after election, we hear tough talk; this year we will pass tougher laws if the President will ask the Republicans in the Senate to stop filibustering the crime bill that has already been passed by the House of Representatives. We will stand -- and we will fight -- for a woman's right to choose. If the Supreme Court removes the guarantee of choice from the Constitution of the United States, this Congress will write it into the laws of the United States.
We will stand for day care and family leave, so that workers who take time off to help a sick parent or child will no longer risk their jobs.
In closing, let me reaffirm our essential resolve -- which is to make America work again. For when the economy is wrong, nothing else is right.
We cannot undo all the mistakes of the past 12 years in a single year, or in a single Congress. The Administration has waited a long time to act. Over and over we have said we can fight this recession, and we will.
We can change this nation fundamentally, and we have to.
It is true the cold war is over; the old world is past; the ways of thinking and leading will not do.
It is time now to turn our attention to our own land and to our own people, to rebuild its economic strength and standard of life, to master the very different challenges of this new era.
Only a few times have Americans stood at so decisive a turning point. Now, with all of us working together, let's get this nation moving again.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAING: Media;
Low-Key Tsongas Tries New, Louder Approach

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 28

 BODY:
At first, Paul E. Tsongas hoped his message alone would carry him through in his drive for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Mr. Tsongas, the diffident former Senator from Massachusetts, refused to be packaged by consultants like some other candidates.
But after 10 months of campaigning and little evidence that his candidacy was taking off, he has discovered that some media savvy and aggressive television advertisements might sweeten the appeal of his tough prescription for economic recovery. 
 While it is not possible to show a cause and effect, Mr. Tsongas in recent weeks has strengthened his second- place standing behind Bill Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, in several surveys of New Hampshire voters. In the aftermath of assertions about Mr. Clinton's personal life, one poll this week even showed him ahead.
But before he agreed to be coached in public speaking and to use message-oriented advertising, Mr. Tsongas had to overcome his own dislike of consultants and what he saw as President Reagan's reliance on them. "It's never been a matter of my confidence," Mr. Tsongas said. "But perception is a function of television personality. I had such a strong negative reaction to Reagan that I didn't want to be a made-over person. I had to accept the fact that this is important."
Mr. Tsongas said that in the first televised debate, held in December, he thought that he let his supporters down.
"My instinct was to defer to someone and to look over at them and away from the camera," said Mr. Tsongas. But before the last debate Jan. 19, Mr. Tsongas took voice lessons and got coaching tips about television from his cousin Joyce Tsongas, who is a speech coach.
Mr. Tsongas also said he was getting better at controlling his urge in speeching to grab paper and pencil and draw charts and graphs that no one in the back rows can see. And for the most part, he has stopped letting his voice drop to inaudibility at the end of sentences. He has also bought two new suits.
 
Attacking an Image Problem
 The make-over appeared to be working during a day's campaigning here.
Mr. Tsongas attacked his image problem head on, joking with a insurance workers in Concord about how central casting would never pick "another Greek from Massachusetts" like Michael S. Dukakis as a Democratic Presidential candidate. He mixed humor and his message of economic responsibility when he added, "Look at the Japanese: Who was the last charismatic prime minister?"
And in a meeting with a group of environmentalists in Concord, when one person asked Mr. Tsongas which of the competitors he would be willing to serve with as a running mate, he replied, "At some point, I will interview them all as my running mate." The audience laughed.
Tonight, as he watched President Bush's State of the Union Message at the home of Ken and Sandra Lord in Salem, Mr. Tsongas passed around a bowl of popcorn and said, "This will taste better than that," in a reference to Mr. Bush's speech.
Afterward, Mr. Tsongas termedthe President's message, which included several proposals meant to invigorate the economy, "voodoo economics continued."
 
Seeing a Breakthrough
 Mr. Tsongas said that his two main goals in the final weeks before the Feb. 18 primary here were improving his television presence and emphasizing the differences between his economic message and those of the other candidates.
Mr. Tsongas said that he felt the second debate, which was broadcast by a local television station and C-Span and seen by 90,000 New Hampshire adults, was a breakthrough for him and that voters were taking a second look at his candidacy.
Delmar (Doc) Anderson, the Democratic committeeman for Raymond who introduced Mr. Tsongas at a recent gathering, underscored that point when he told the audience they should focus on whether "you like what he says rather than thinking about whether he can be elected."
Mr. Anderson, a former Boston University professor who now raises goats, said of Mr. Tsongas: "He's got a dry sense of humor and I don't think he's going to be talked into riding a tank." Mr. Dukakis was derided in the last Presidential campaign as trying to show he was tough by riding a tank.
 
Wishing for Two Votes
 At the town meeting in Raymond, Laura Caron stood up and told Mr. Tsongas that she agreed with everything he had to say.
"But who is on the cover of the news magazines?" she said. "That's my concern for you."
Ms. Caron's question crystallizes Mr. Tsongas' political problem in this first primary state and beyond. Some Democrats here give Mr. Tsongas high marks for his tough economic message, but they just as often doubt whether the dour, low-key Massachusetts native with the plaintive voice and deferential stance can succeed in New Hampshire or beyond.
"People feel a really big responsibility in this primary," Mr. Anderson said. "A lot of people wish they had two votes, one for the person they think could be elected, the other for Tsongas as president."
After the meeting, Ms. Caron said, "What he's got to say isn't easy to swallow, but it makes sense." Mr. Tsongas offers an uncompromisingly tough message to voters. In his latest advertisement he stands outside a closed factory, and says: "All the Japan bashing in the world won't open this factory."
Mr. Tsongas differentiates himself from the other Democratic candidates who vow to get tough on what they describe as unfair trade practices. "Let's not kid ourselves," says Mr. Tsongas in the advertisement. "America must take control of its own fate."Mr. Tsongas promises to "shake things up" from the board room to the factory floor and beat the Japanese the "American way," by making "quality come first again."
Mr. Tsongas said upon his inauguration as President, he would overhaul what he says is an antiquated economic system. He would freeze Federal spending, and order regulators to halt banks from calling the loans of viable businesses and home owners.
Mr. Tsongas said he must finish first, second or a strong third in the New Hampshire primary, Feb. 18, if he is to remain in the race.
Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager, Dennis Kanin, said the campaign organization was set to take that same message to the nation, but that Mr. Tsongas would not be redesigning his message for other primary and caucus states.
"There is no reason to," said Mr. Kanin. "We think people are looking for straight answers and that is what Paul Tsongas is about."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Pools of Memory, Waves of Dispute

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALTHAM, Mass.

 BODY:
Henry Burkhardt is scheming to ambush the computer industry.
His radically different supercomputer, intended for both scientific and commercial markets, has still not been formally introduced, although a handful of university and government research labs are putting prototypes through the paces of Big Science number crunching. But in recent weeks, Mr. Burkhardt's design has fired an emotional debate inside the usually clinically calm community of elite scientists and engineers who build the world's fastest computers. 
 On one side are experts who contend that Mr. Burkhardt's company, the Kendall Square Research Corporation, has built a conceptually clean and simple machine. The computer's fundamental difference lies in the way it creates a giant pool of memory, rather than the many smaller puddles that characterize the memory of other supercomputers.
The Burkhardt machine, advocates say, will make it far easier for business and scientific computer users and software designers to adapt existing work station or mainframe programs for tasks requiring a supercomputer's speed and capacity.
On the other side of the controversy are engineers -- and competitors -- who argue that Kendall Square's vaunted advantages are so much hype and hooey and predict that the five-year-old company committed a fatal blunder by basing its machine on a custom-made chip that could quickly fall behind the industry's rapidly evolving technology.
At the center of the storm is Mr. Burkhardt, who is 47 years old, a Princeton dropout who started his career in the mid-1960's as a computer designer at Digital Equipment. He subsequently helped to found Data General and Encore Computer before forming Kendall Square in 1986.
"There is an extraordinary transformation taking place at the high end of the computer industry, and there is a tremendous interest in running applications beyond the reach of today's machines," Mr. Burkhardt said in a recent interview at Kendall Square headquarters, just yards from Route 128, the central artery of the Boston area's high-tech industry. Large photographs of his supercomputer's custom chips dominate the three-story atrium of the secluded brick building.
If his business plan plays out, Mr. Burkhardt said, the company will become a force in the commercial market for high-end computers. Target customers for his KSR1 include companies like banks or airlines that must frequently search huge data bases and quickly retrieve information for thousands of transactions or customer reservations.
Mr. Burkhardt hopes to begin installing machines for commercial customers by the middle of the year. "We resisted the urge to hold a press conference and tell all sorts of lies," he said.
 
 
How Controversy Began
 Igniting the Kendall Square controversy was an article by the economist George Gilder, published this month in a narrowly circulated but closely read Silicon Valley magazine called Upside. Mr. Gilder, perhaps best known as the supply-sider whose book "Wealth and Poverty" provided the intellectual underpinnings of the so-called Reagan revolution, has no experience in computer design. But he has written widely on the subject in recent years and his opinions, though often controversial, are taken seriously among the computer digerati.
Mr. Gilder's article endorsed Kendall Square's system while fiercely challenging the design work of one of Mr. Burkhardt's principal competitors, Danny Hillis.
In October, Mr. Hillis, co-founder of the Thinking Machines Corporation, based in Cambridge, Mass., introduced a new version of his own pioneering supercomputer, the Connection Machine. Like Mr. Burkhardt's, it is a so-called massively parallel computer.
"There have been more letters in response to this article than I've provoked since I stopped writing about feminism," Mr. Gilder said in a telephone interview.
 Mr. Gilder's article attacks Thinking Machines' new computer and argues that Mr. Hillis erred in redesigning his new CM-5 system around thousands of off-the-shelf microprocessor chips rather than building a custom machine from the ground up.
But Mr. Hillis, whose industry supporters include I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems, responds that he is being unfairly attacked on the basis of false information about his computer's specifications. "The article has so much wrong information in it," he said. "There was absolutely no fact checking done."
The dispute has focused on the best way to design massively parallel supercomputers, machines that harness the power of hundreds or hundreds of thousands of microprocessors and break complex problems into small pieces for quick solutions.
Most computer designers believe that massively parallel systems will soon displace conventional supercomputers, such as those originally designed in the early 1970's by Seymour Cray. Those machines gained their speed with either a single or small group of specially engineered processors.
But while there is general agreement on the inevitability of massive parallelism, there is little agreement about which of the designs will prevail. Into this debate waded Mr. Gilder with his article, which seems to have incited sniping within the usually cordial community of computer architects.
"I don't want to hurt Danny's feeling's, but I really don't like his computer," said Gordon Bell, a widely respected computer designer in his own right, who is also an investor in Mr. Burkhardt's company.
David Patterson, a well-known computer scientist at the University of California at Berkeley and a consultant to Danny Hillis and Thinking Machines, fired back: "I was disappointed in the article. It was entertaining and provocative, but Gilder is breaking the Golden Rule of computer design. There has to be a current market for your current machine. Otherwise you don't get the gold to design the next one."
Mr. Patterson said Mr. Gilder's article was wrong about such details as the cost of a Connection Machine, its speed and the rate at which information is transmitted between processors within the system.
Mr. Gilder, however, said he stood by his article.
More than a dozen small and large firms are working on different massively parallel designs.
Nearly all of the current generation of massively parallel machines are designed around commercial microprocessor chips, the same chips that are found in today's work stations and personal computers.
Thinking Machines, Intel and Alliant for example, have decided to use off-the-shelf chips like Intel's i860 microprocessor or Sun's Sparc design, hooking thousands of them together through a complex switching network to pass information from chip to chip.
In contrast, Kendall Square has designed its own processors, taking advantage of new chip-design tools to customize the system.
There is a second crucial difference between Kendall Square's approach and the designs of the other massively parallel computers, Mr. Gilder contends. He says that systems like the Connection Machine from Thinking Machines and similar computers from Intel and Ncube are little more than expensive collections of work stations and that they will be surpassed by a new generation of supercomputers that have what is called a "shared memory model."
In this approach, the designer hides much of the complexity of the massively parallel hardware design from the programmer, so the system appears to function like a conventional single-processor machine.
But computer scientists working with early versions of the Kendall Square supercomputer say it does not entirely free the programmer.
 
 
'A Simpler Picture'
 "It's a simpler picture, and it's one that is more convenient," said Jack Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee, who has worked on a entry-level Kendall Square system being used at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. "However, one shouldn't have a false sense of security. It's still critical for the user to understand how the machine is put together to get performance."
The crucial issue is whether a piece of data is indeed automatically placed in the correct location when it is needed by a particular processor. If it turns out to be in another part of the machine, performance suffers because of the time taken to route the data along the computer's internal network to place it closer to the appropriate processor.
In this regard, Mr. Hillis argues, there is far less difference between the Kendall Square computer and the new CM-5 Thinking Machines system than is claimed by Mr. Gilder. Mr. Hillis says his new machine can automatically restructure standard Fortran programs just as Kendall Square's computer can.
 
 
Eyeing Mainframe Markets
 For his part, Mr. Burkhardt sees Kendall Square's principal opportunity as entering markets that were previously the province of conventional mainframes. He says the new KSR1 supercomputer will have almost four times the speed of a high-end I.B.M. mainframe but cost less than an eighth of the price -- starting in the $1 million price range, rather than the $8.5 million an I.B.M. customer can easily spend.
But he acknowledges that the new company has a limited amount of time to rush its system out.
"My theory is that if you wake up one morning and figure out that you can build something 10 times better," he said, "go do it, because somebody else might have had the same idea."

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE UNION: Unemployment;
Accord on Extending Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Agreeing to sidestep a bitter election-year issue, President Bush and House leaders decided today to spend $2.7 billion on another 13 weeks of unemployment benefits for about two million long-term jobless people.
Democrats in the Senate did not commit themselves to the plan immediately, but Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said he was confident a bill could be sent to Mr. Bush for signing "by the end of next week." 
 If Mr. Bentsen is right, Republican lawmakers and Mr. Bush will have put aside a painful political issue that Democrats used for months last year to paint Mr. Bush as uncaring about hardships on the home front and endlessly concerned with foreign problems. Last year Mr. Bush killed two versions of the bill, arguing that the budget deficit should not be increased. But he ultimately did sign an extension into law last November.
This time around, Democrats seized a quick, certain agreement with the Administration, abandoning a partisan advantage in part to avoid a fight that could make Congress appear to be bickering while thousands of unemployed Americans suffered.
For some workers, the extra benefits adopted last November will begin running out in mid-February.
Instead of trying to roll over the Republicans and adopt the $4.5 billion measure proposed last week by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats settled for a less costly measure that expires in July. The measure proposed by Mr. Rostenkowski would have expired in October.
The bill would make some workers in states with high unemployment eligible for a total of 59 weeks of jobless benefits, which average about $170 a week. That would be a longer period of benefits than in any previous recession. In 1976, up to 55 weeks were paid. The bill would benefit people who have already run out of their benefits or who will by July 4.
The committee sent the compromise measure, sponsored by Mr. Rostenkowski and Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, to the floor on a voice vote today. The whole House will vote next Tuesday, under a procedure allowing only 40 minutes of debate and requiring a two-thirds majority for adoption.
Like November's measure, this bill would be financed with accounting devices and not by imposing any new taxes or cutting other Federal spending. Part of the cost would come from $500 million raised by requiring some corporations to make higher estimated tax payments sooner.
The remaining $2.2 billion would be from savings that the Office of Management and Budget says were achieved last year by Congress. A budget office report this month concluded that Congress had raised that much more money by extending taxes in future years and by other financial devices that it had put into extra Federal spending.
 
'The Land of Oz'
 Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Suffolk Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee who was a leading sponsor of extended benefits last year, told reporters today, "Only in the land of Oz could you take a $350 billion deficit and find $2 billion in savings."
The bill would allow workers in all states who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states, another 13 weeks of payments.
Those could be added on to the 13 to 20 weeks adopted last fall, so that some people could receive as many as 26 weeks of regular benefits and 33 weeks of extra benefits. Others would receive less, depending on when their benefits were exhausted and whether they lived in the handful of states eligible for 20 weeks of benefits because they have particularly high unemployment rates.
Last November's measure is to expire June 13. The Rostenkowski-Michel bill would expire July 4. If no further legislation is enacted, people exhausting basic 26 weeks after July 4 would not be eligible for extra benefits.
But at today's committee meeting Mr. Rostenkowski supported Mr. Downey's call for permanent changes that would remove those anomalies. Republicans on the committee urged that the trust fund that pays extended benefits be taken out of regular budget accounting altogether, so that it would not affect the deficit. That trust fund, filled by taxes paid by employers, now contains about $6 billion.
President Bush, in a letter to Mr. Rostenkowski, said he was pleased that the Administration and both parties "have been able to reach agreement." He said he hoped to have the bill on his desk for signing before the Congress begins its recess, now set for Feb. 7.

HEADLINE: In a Cold Setting, Numbing Speeches

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 28

 BODY:
If they happened to be paying attention, delegates and assorted hangers-on at the Moscow peace talks got tipped off to what lay ahead for them as soon as they stepped off the plane.
Pasted to a broad pillar at the airport was a sign saying "Middle East Conference." 
 It was the sort of sign that is normally accompanied by arrows telling arrivals exactly where to go to get through the landing procedures.
This time, there were no arrows, no pointers, no guides, nothing, just a curious sign saying "Middle East Conference" suspended there, having nothing to do with anything else swirling around it.
 
At the Same Table
 Just like the peace conference itself, one could say, as it got under way today in the colonnaded ballroom of an 18th-century mansion called the House of Unions.
By rights, this gathering of diplomats in flowing robes and pinstripes merited the shopworn label of "historic."
There they were, Israel and a sweeping arc of the Arab world, sitting together. The two dozen participants included Saudi Arabia, which for decades has led an economic boycott that continues to scratch away at Israel's frayed pockets. Now the Saudis and Israelis were at the same table, talking, albeit only in theory, about possible economic cooperation.
If peace ever does come calling in the Middle East, the abstractions under discussion today -- regional development, water resources, arms control -- may one day prove to be the most lasting achievements of the entire peace process.
Yet inside the House of Unions -- once called the Nobles' Club and perhaps destined in the post-Communist age to be renamed again -- it all seems suspended in gauze, filmy and divorced from the world outside.
 
Palestinians Stay Away
 Part of it was due to the fact that the Palestinian delegation stayed away. However the various sides may debate that development, it was like watching a performance of Chekhov's "Three Sisters" with one of the sisters written out of the play.
Muscovites could not have cared less. Even the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, could not be bothered with these talks, which were the last major diplomatic achievement bearing the stamp of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet President.
Only a handful of people stood at police barricades to gawk at the Middle East visitors. The real crowds were a few blocks away in Lubyanka Square, near the K.G.B. headquarters. Hundreds of Russians stood there in long, grim ranks, silently holding forth clothing and other goods for inspection by hundreds of others who filed past looking at the merchandise.
It was a quorum of desperation. One man held up for sale a single boot and nothing else. Another held two mismatched sneakers. This woman offered a sweater, that man a shirt. One man held nothing but a pinwheel that spun gently in the breeze.
On the wintry plaza, talks about occupied Arab lands, desalting of the Red Sea, Palestinian refugee camps and Israeli agricultural techniques might as well have been taking place on the moon.
 
Baker Is Keynote Speaker
 "People," said a clerk at the Hotel Moskva across the street from the conference hall, "are thinking about other things."
As though to underline the Russian nonpresence, the real master of ceremonies and keynote speaker was Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, not the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, who was technically the host.
The building where they met could fit any sort of symbolism one might seek.
It is a lime-green gem tucked among hulking monuments to totalitarianism. It is a place for concerts. Great writers have been celebrated there.
But it is also where many of Stalin's show trials were held in the 1930's, and according to some accounts Stalin watched the malevolence from a secret room high up in the Hall of Columns where the delegates met today.
There in 1880, Dostoyevsky delivered an emotional eulogy to the Russian poet Pushkin, and later he wrote his wife, saying that "when at the end I proclaimed the worldwide unity of mankind, the whole hall was in hysterics."
"People in the audience who were unknown to one another wept, sobbed, embraced each other and swore to be better men in the future," the writer said.
 
A Verbal Overload
 Certainly, mankind's unity and betterment were recurring themes in the speeches today, but if anyone wept, sobbed or embraced someone else, the act went undetected. In fact, after a few hours, most of the delegates looked numb from verbal overload, and many did not bother to show up for the afternoon session, joining the teams from Yemen and Algeria (not to mention the Palestinians) that stayed away entirely.
Still, there were bubbles of lightness.
One involved Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel, who had to interrupt his speech just as he started because of balky speakers that carried translations of his speech from Hebrew into other languages.
As Mr. Baker played with the device in front of him, Mr. Levy turned and said:
"Jimmy, O.K.?"
"Let's try again," the Secretary replied.
"O.K.," Mr. Levy said, ending an exchange that for Israelis was notable as much as anything else because it involved more English than some had thought he knew.

HEADLINE: Betting, in Harmony With Nature

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn.

 BODY:
Atlantic City and Las Vegas have the glitz and glamour, with neon cowboys and glittering marquees beckoning gamblers inside to a world of fantasy and chance.
Here, they have windows. 
 The Mashantucket Pequot Indians insisted on a wall of bay windows in the new Foxwoods casino -- an absolute no-no in traditional casinos, where bettors are encouraged to lose all track of time and money. Tribal leaders said that the densely wooded landscape was integral to the point of building a casino and could not be shut away.
"The land is everything," said Theresa D. Bell, the tribal affairs coordinator. "If you lose the land, you lose yourself."
As the $58 million casino's Feb. 15 opening day approaches, the doings in these piney woods have drawn the attention of a whole universe of people who stand to win or lose from a Pequot success, including the casinos of New Jersey and Nevada and politicians in Hartford, where pressures are growing to expand legalized gambling.
Here in southeastern Connecticut, the land of the Seawolf submarine and the sinking military dollar, the interest is keenest of all. With tens of thousands of jobs threatened as Pentagon spending falls, politicians and residents are desperately hoping that the Mashantucket Pequots can rescue this area from economic disaster.
For the short term, at least, it will certainly help. With an initial payroll of 2,300, and 1,000 more workers projected by the end of the year when the first of two hotels is completed, the Mashantucket Pequots will become an economic force to be reckoned with. The 250-member tribe hopes to gross $100 million a year, and pump $40 million into the local economy in annual payroll alone.
Some local business and community leaders have grander visions still. They say that with two of the top three tourist attractions in the state within 15 miles of the casino, southeastern Connecticut might be able to reinvent itself as a resort location even as military spending collapses.
But no one, least of all the tribe, expects easy sailing. The Mashantucket Pequots, having decided to retain control of the casino, rather than hire a management company from Las Vegas or Atlantic City, as some Western tribes are considering, found no bank in the nation willing to lend them money.
Eventually, they borrowed $55 million from a company in Malaysia that operates hotels and casinos in Asia.
And as with the bay windows, tribal control has meant occasional conflicts between ancient tradition and hard-headed profit-making.
When the water line to the casino was discovered to be in the path of ancient tribal encampments, for example, it was rerouted. When the motif for the casino, a beaded Pequot wampum belt, was deemed too close in design to a belt found in a tribal grave, the design was changed to avoid offending the spirits of a long-dead ancestor.
The council also agonized for weeks on a name for the casino, forcing printers and other contractors to cram their work into the final weeks before opening day.
"They're dealing with a culture; I'm dealing with a business," said Alfred J. Luciani, who was hired by the tribe last year from the Merv Griffin Resorts in Atlantic City to oversee the construction and startup of the casino. "We think in the short term; they're worried about the next 100 years," Mr. Luciani said.
A long downward spiral began for the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in 1636, when a trade dispute culminated in the bloody Pequot War. As many as 700 men, women and children were shot or burned alive by Puritan militiamen in one battle alone in Mystic. Survivors were sold into slavery.
By 1900, the last native speaker was dead. By the early 1970's, only about 40 people identified themselves with the tribe. And only one old woman, Elizabeth George, a quarter-blood Pequot, lived on the reservation, which had shrunk to 213 acres. State officials said the land would become a state park when she died.
 
Power to Poverty
 To tribal members and their allies, the turn of history's wheel in the late 20th century has been something to savor.
"In 1636, they were the economic power of the region, and they are about to be again," said Kevin A. McBride, an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Connecticut who has worked on the reservation since the 1970's, excavating and identifying tribal cultural sites.
With revenues from a high-stakes bingo operation that the tribe started in 1986, the reservation has grown to 2,000 acres, with another 2,000-acre purchase under negotiation. There is full employment on the reservation. Dozens of traditional New England-style white colonial homes have been built on the winding wooded roads leading up from Elizabeth George Drive.
Last year, when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vowed to block the casino because it would attract organized crime, the tribe also showed its sophistication in turning the gears of government. Flanked by lawyers and some of Connecticut's highest paid lobbyists, the tribe saw the Governor's plan killed in the State House of Representatives.
But success, and the prospect of greater success to come, has not been without costs.
The council chairman, Richard A. Hayward -- one of Mrs. George's nine grandchildren -- is said by tribe members and lawyers to be gripped by anxieties about the casino opening. Unable to sleep, he reportedly haunts the unfinished buildings until 4 A.M. or later. Mr. Hayward declined to be interviewed.
 
Hiring Other Indians
 Another sign of the times is posted in the tribal office: "Ten ways to control stress." The poster advises tribe members just to stop and take a walk when it all gets to be too much.
And although the tribe has announced a preference for hiring American Indians, including members of other tribes, there is resentment. The Mashantuckets are the only tribe in Connecticut with full recognition from the Federal Government, and thus the only tribe that can take advantage of Federal statutes allowing gaming on Indian lands. And the casino's scale has also turned heads. Gambling experts say Foxwoods will be the most ambitious Indian gaming hall in the nation.
"This is a good decade for the Indians," said Mark Sebastian, an Eastern Pequot Indian who works as a guard outside the gate to the casino. The Eastern Pequots are closely related to the Mashantucket branch but are not entitled to full tribal rights. "It's giving everyone that spark," Mr. Sebastian said. "If they can do it, anyone can do it."
"But there's a lot of jealousy," he conceded.
 
Business of Gambling
Slots and Compact With Connecticut
 Foxwoods Casino will be oddly quiet compared with the clanking, change-clattering siren-calls of Atlantic City: here there will be no slot machines. Although the tribe spent more than $500,000 to have 50 video-bingo games designed and built, the machines will not be producing revenue when the casino opens.
Whether the games will be stored or used for nongambling purposes has not been decided. Under the compact between the state and the tribe that took effect last year, the Mashantucket Pequots may offer almost any game of chance that they choose except the very game that makes the most money and draws the biggest crowds: slot machines. In Las Vegas, for example, about 60 percent of profits are generated by the machines, which require little maintenance, no dealers and less security surveillance than table games. The Federal Indian Gaming Commission has ruled that the tribe's bingo electronic game is a form of slot machine.
"The Mashantuckets will not seriously challenge Atlantic City without slots," said Paul M. Dworin, publisher and editor of Gaming and Wagering Business magazine.
But industry experts like Mr. Dworin also say that the state and Federal regulations are in flux and that the Pequots are wise to have slots ready in case the rules change.
In Connecticut, the rules could be changed because of budget pressures. The state will collect no tax windfall from the Foxwoods Casino because the Mashantucket Pequots pay no taxes to the state or Federal Government. In addition, revenues from existing state gambling enterprises like jai alai and dog racing have plummeted because of the recession.
State lawmakers say the Pequot casino will only further the decline in revenue. That could heighten pressure on the state to strike back by expanding gambling off the reservation, possibly including slot machines in Off Track Betting parlors.
And that in turn, under the quirky rules of the 1988 Federal Indian Gaming Act, would complete the circle: if the state expands legal gambling, the tribe has the right to negotiate with the state to do the same thing.
And slot machines are a possibility, state lawmakers say. The co-chairman of the General Assembly's Public Safety Committee, which oversees gambling in the state, said he believed the state would expand legal gambling this spring.
"People are going to try and get the video slots -- this session you might see that done," said Senator Frank David Barrows, a Democrat from Hartford who heads the committee. "It's better than 50-50."
 
How About Bridgeport?
 Whether that would be a victory for the Mashantucket Pequots is the next question. With slot machines, industry analysts say, Foxwoods could compete with Atlantic City for the New York City market. Casino managers here say New England will be the main market -- Boston is 100 miles away. Ledyard is 125 miles from New York City, five miles farther than Atlantic City.
But with one casino on Indian land, some politicians say that Connecticut might find the momentum irresistible for a second casino, one that would pay taxes. Bridgeport, the state's largest and most financially troubled city, has been mentioned as the likely site.
And if that happens, some industry analysts say the tribal casino might simply be too far from New York City to compete, however many windows look out on the revered landscape.
 
Impact on Economy
Lure of Prosperity As Jobs Disappear
 A study commissioned last year by the state said that under the best-case scenario, New London County will lose 13,000 jobs, or more than 10 percent of all its jobs, over the next five years as military expenditures decline. The worst case would mean 27,000 jobs lost.
The Mashantucket Pequots predict, on the other hand, that about 13,000 people a day will be drawn to the Foxwoods Casino and High Stakes Bingo, or 3.9 million tourist visits, assuming the casino closes one day a week. By contrast, Connecticut's No. 1 attraction, the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, drew 765,000 people in 1990.
The prospect of such a flood of new visitors has excited business owners. But while some see an economic miracle that could rescue southeastern Connecticut from its dependence on the Navy, others see congestion and a decline in the quality of life.
There is little argument that change will come. Even the best-case scenario put forward in the state study projected the eventual end of the Navy's Seawolf submarine program, which has almost single-handedly kept the region's economy functioning in recent years. In his State of the Union Address, President Bush proposed canceling the Seawolf.
 
Slowing the Fall
 The Electric Boat division of General Dynamics employs 23,000 people alone building Seawolf submarines. Out of 110,670 jobs in the county in 1990, fully 66,000 were jobs dependent on the Pentagon. Here in Ledyard, 39 percent of all households had at least one person in a job related to the military, according to a town survey.
The question facing local officials is how much casino gambling could help arrest the fall from the recession and the end of the Cold War.
"The longer the recession continues, the more positive the casino development appears," said William R. Haase, the Ledyard town planner. "What the tribe is doing is presenting an opportunity for economic diversification."
On the two-lane winding section of Route 2 where the casino is situated, the concerns are more narrow: are there enough gas stations, enough restaurants, is the road wide enough?
"The infrastructure can't handle it," said William D. Moore, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Southeastern Connecticut. "If you've ever been here in the summer months, with the beach traffic, you know what a nightmare it is," he said. "It's really going to have a much more significant impact than anybody anticipates."
Mr. Haase and other planners working with the tribe envision a national marketing campaign for the region as a full resort destination, with something for everyone, patterned after the tourism campaigns for James City County, Va., where Colonial Williamsburg and the Busch Gardens theme park have joined forces. Economists say that such a transformation, with tourism replacing military work, is possible, though it would involve wrenching dislocations, including pay cuts for many. At Foxwoods, many of the jobs pay only the minimum wage, plus tips.
"What you could be looking at five years from now is a completely different economy," said Donald L. Klepper-Smith, an economist at Southern New England Telephone. "There is tremendous upside potential for that side of the state," he said. "But it's a painful process getting there."

HEADLINE: VIETNAMESE TO GET FULBRIGHT AWARDS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
This year, for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War, Washington will be offering scholarships for Vietnamese to study in the United States under the 46-year-old Fulbright fellowship program.
Fifteen scholarships have been set aside for 1992 and another 15 for 1993 as part of the legislation that provides money for running the State Department and the United States Information Agency. The agency, which has been allocated $300,000 for the program, is now beginning the process of recruiting competitors for the awards in a country with which Washington does not have diplomatic relations. 
 Addie O'Connell, chief of academic exchange programs for the agency, said that U.S.I.A. is about to begin discussions with the New York-based Institute for International Education on how to locate and evaluate potential fellows, since American testing programs are not available in Vietnam. Ms. O'Connell said the agency hoped to have at least of few of the first Vietnamese Fulbright scholars in American universities by the fall.
The Fulbright scholarship program, conceived and sponsored by Senator J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas, came into being in 1946 as a means of using the sale of war materiel to aquaint Americans with overseas cultures. The new program is specifically limited to Vietnamese residents in Vietnam, and will not be open to exiles.
 
Discussing Embargo
 Under the legislation passed by Congress in October, it was decided that preference would be given to Vietnamese "intending to pursue studies in economics and commercial law."
Vietnam and the United States are still discussing steps to be taken by Hanoi before Washington will lift a trade and investment embargo, 17 years after the end of the war. This week, the Pentagon's new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, Alan Ptak, is to meet Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi to talk about resolving the cases of Americans still unaccounted for.
He will be accompanied by John Vessey, the retired army general who is a special Presidential envoy to Vietnam, and Brig. Gen. Thomas Needham, the head of a newly expanded office set up to coordinate all P.O.W.-M.I.A. efforts.
On Wednesday, a meeting will take place in Washington between Trinh Xuan Lang, Hanoi's representative at the United Nations, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn, who heads the American team in continuing talks with the Vietnamese on normalizing relations between the two countries.
 
Ways of Training Sought
 Hanoi has been looking for ways to train economists, business managers and international lawyers in the West. American law firms are eager to establish branches in Vietnam and have offered to assist the private United States-Vietnam Trade Council in setting up legal training. The council hopes to set up its own legal exchange.
The Fulbright program had been available to scholars in what was formerly South Vietnam before the collapse of the country in 1975.
Students from unified Vietnam have been granted visas in increasing numbers for individual programs in the United States over the last five years, according to John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a private organization that has been helping Vietnamese scholars come to this country and Americans go to Vietnam.
"These exchanges were done fairly quietly at first because there was a fear that the overseas Vietnamese community would harass people from Vietnam," Mr. McAuliff said. "But that seems to be a thing of the past. The numbers of students coming increased dramatically in 1991."
The Vietnamese Fulbright scholarship program originated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the sponsorship of Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. Senator Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, is also chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Bill to Improve Schools

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
After scuttling the heart of President Bush's school program, the Senate today overwhelmingly passed an $850 million Democratic education bill that would channel money to schools in poor communities and schools trying experimental improvements.
Even supporters of the bill say its financing, the equivalent of what it takes to build one B-2 Stealth bomber, is insufficient to improve the performance of most American schools. But the bill is intended to set new national goals to improve teacher performance, increase graduation rates and expand student access to training in science and mathematics. 
 After Republican members expressed bitter disappointment last week with the defeat of most of their education program, they signed on to the Democratic bill, saying it was a partial remedy that was better than no effort to improve education at all. The bill passed by a vote of 92 to 6, with 37 Republicans joining 55 Democrats voting to endorse the measure. All six negative votes were cast by Republicans.
The Senate last week rejected Mr. Bush's plan, which would have provided Federal money to a limited number of poor parents wishing to send their children to private schools. It also would have granted Education Secretary Lamar Alexander the power to select 535 new model schools for special financing.
 
Highly Partisan Debate
 Instead, the Democratic bill would grant the states the power to select the new experimental schools and seek to provide assistance only to public schools, most of which have been characterized by inadequate performance.
Mr. Alexander was somewhat critical of the bill, saying: "The President will keep fighting for more radical change in the American system. We will especially keep fighting to give middle- and low-income families more of the same choices of all schools that wealthy families already have."
In a highly partisan debate last week, Senate Democrats accused Mr. Bush of offering little more than privatization and rhetoric to resolve the nation's education needs.
"If President Bush wants to be the education President, he has to do more than talk about it," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, a principal sponsor of the Senate bill. "We cannot expect to compete in tomorrow's global economy when today's students are already far behind those of other nations."
Republican Senators said that by laying aside the President's proposals, the education bill would reward failure by pouring money into the least successful schools. They also argued that by helping disadvantaged parents send their children to private schools they would pressure public schools to improve. The National Catholic Conference and several of the country's bishops lobbied hard for that proposal until it was defeated in a near party-line vote last Thursday.
The education bill lays out national education goals to be met by the year 2000. Among them are the inclusion of all eligible preschoolers in the Head Start program, more Federal money for updating teacher training in mathematics and science and a sweeping extension of adult literacy programs. The bill also establishes a council of political leaders and education experts to develop a national academic report card to measure educational progress and shortcomings across the country.
 
Grants to the States
 The core of the legislation provides $850 million in grants to the states for distribution among local schools that would apply for the money by proposing improvement plans. The states could withhold a fraction of the money for statewide efforts to create new model schools and to finance programs to train teachers. At least three-quarters of the money would be set aside for the most needy schools.
Before the Senate bill can be enacted, it must be reconciled with a House education bill. The House bill would provide money for private schools in states where local law permits it. Only two states, Vermont and Wisconsin, fit in that category, but some Senate Democrats are strongly critical of the House version, saying it breaks the boundaries between church and state.
The Administration has been critical of the Democratic bill, and Mr. Bush in his State of the Union Message tonight, hours after the bill's passage, was still insisting that Congress "pass my proposals for new American schools."
But before the speech, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said he thought the President would find "more reasons to sign it than not to sign it."
Earlier today, by a vote of 55 to 43, the Senate tabled a Republican amendment that would have allowed states to require welfare recipients to make their children attend school or cut their benefits. Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, who sponsored the amendment, said it was necessary "to break this cycle of dependency."
But Democrats argued that the proposal would penalize children in cases where their parents were delinquent because of drug or alcohol abuse.

Clinton, Cheered by New Polls, Again Assails Bush on Economy

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 28

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, restored to good humor and some short-term political stability by news of several polls showing that most New Hampshire voters care little about recent accusations of marital infidelity, today returned to criticizing President Bush about the nation's troubled economy.
Even Mr. Clinton's opponents acknowledge that his organizers in Texas have assembled the most extensive network of endorsements so far this year. They also say that the assertions of marital infidelity against the Governor do not appear to have cost him any of his early strength in Texas, one of the 11 states whose voters will participate in primaries on March 10. 
 But there were signs today that even Mr. Clinton's staunchest supporters have been concerned by the widespread reporting of the accusations by Gennifer Flowers, who is now an Arkansas government employee, that she and Mr. Clinton had a 12-year affair.
 
Endorsement of House Speaker
 At a news conference at the State Capitol here announcing some endorsements of Mr. Clinton by Texas Democrats, the House Speaker pro tem, Wilhemina Delco, introduced the Governor warmly. "I don't know about you, but I want a strong man for President, not God," she said.
But when Mr. Clinton responded by laughing and placing an arm around her shoulders for a hug, she also felt compelled to add, "just in case you misunderstand," that she and her husband have been friends with Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, for years.
In his subsequent remarks, Mr. Clinton also acknowledged what many of the supporters were apparently thinking as they applauded and cheered him when he entered the ornate State Senate chamber. "You'll never know how much it means for us to receive this warm welcome when I walked in this room," he said. "I think I know what it is you were trying to say.
"I knew what I was getting into when I entered this race," he said. "But what I want you to think of is what you are going to get into in the next four years. The issue in this race is not me, it's you, and the you's in America."
In a poll of New Hampshire Democrats taken Monday night, The Boston Globe found that Mr. Clinton had retained a high favorable rating and a lead over his opponents. The Globe's poll found that the Democratic voters thought the news media had been unfair to Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Clinton turned his attention to President Bush, who he said is promising too little, too late in his State of the Union Message.
"We cannot do the things we must do -- I'm talking about fundamental change in this country -- until we have a new commitment to equal opportunity in this country, both economic and political," Mr. Clinton said.
Echoing the theme raised by national Democrats who hope to take advantage of the politically weakened Mr. Bush this year Mr. Clinton derided the President's plans for rescuing the battered economy, including cutting the capital gains tax.
Such solutions, he said, are "a whole bunch of Band-Aids that are good for scratches but won't fix the open wounds of the American economy."
Mr. Clinton released a statement today saying he had tried unsuccessfully to reach Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York by telephone to apologize for comments attributed to him on the tape played by Ms. Flowers on Monday. On the tape, Mr. Clinton describes Mr. Cuomo as "aggressive," and when Ms. Flowers said she thought he might have some "mafioso" connections, Mr. Clinton replied, "Well, he acts like one."
In the statement released today, Mr. Clinton said: "If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it. At the time that conversation was held, there had been some political give-and-take between myself and the Governor, and I meant simply to imply that Governor Cuomo is a tough and worthy competitor."
In Albany, Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference that the apology missed the point. "Don't limit your explanation to Italian-Americans," Mr. Cuomo said. "This is part of an ugly syndrome that strikes Italian-Americans, Jewish people, blacks, women, all the different ethnic groups."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
P.& G. Profits Are Up 6.7% In Quarter

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Fueled by strong sales in the United States and overseas, the Procter & Gamble Company yesterday reported profits for its second fiscal quarter that were better than expected, sending the company's stock up by more than 5 percent.
For the three months that ended on Dec. 31, Procter & Gamble's net earnings totaled $523 million, up by 6.7 percent from the $490 million reported in the comparable period in 1990. 
 The company's earnings per share rose by 8 percent, to $1.47 from $1.36, and sales totaled $7.50 billion, up by 9.4 percent from $6.85 billion.
Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said the higher earnings and sales resulted from "broadly based unit volume growth in the United States and international businesses."
 
Lower Profits Expected
 The stock jumped $5.50 a share, to $102.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, because Wall Street analysts had expected the company to post lower profits for the quarter. The consensus estimate had been about $1.36 a share.
The gains came despite what Procter & Gamble's chairman, Edwin L. Artzt, characterized as "continued recessionary market softness" in the United States. He said sales in the United States rose by 5 percent in most major product groups. Mr. Artzt said the company's international business grew at double-digit rates for the first six months of the fiscal year.
"They are gaining market share in every market they compete in," said Joseph H. Kozloff, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. "P.& G. is out there hurting people," he added, referring to the company's competitors in the coffee, diapers and detergent business.
Analysts said Procter & Gamble was finally beginning to benefit from its heavy spending in new products and advertising throughout the recession. The company's spending hurt profits for the last 12 months. Last year, for example, the company introduced a new line of diapers and spent heavily to promote them.
"They didn't really pull back when other companies did," said Jay H. Freedman, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. "It's pretty well documented that companies that are willing to bite the bullet and invest wisely through a recession tend to pick up share."
Because of the continuing investment, Mr. Kozloff of Smith Barney said P.& G.'s earnings were poised to improve, predicting a series of quarterly earnings increases. "Procter is getting ready to explode on the upside," he said.

HEADLINE: Robert Brooks, 86, Dean at Williams And Labor Expert

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Robert R. R. Brooks, an expert on labor economics who had been the dean and a professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., died yesterday at the house of his sister-in-law, Ruth Brooks, in Nyack, N.Y. He was 86 years old and lived in Williamstown.
Dean Brooks, who was a deputy administrator of the Office of Price Administration in World War II, died of cancer of the pancreas, his family said. 
 When his book "Unions of Their Own Choosing" (Yale University Press), about the National Labor Relations Board, came out in 1938, it was praised by Francis Brown in The New York Times Book Review as a "timely and temperate study." Lewis Gannett, writing in The New York Herald Tribune, called it "a sober, circumstantial and impressive history."
His 1937 book, "When Labor Organizes" (Yale), was lauded by R. L. Duffus, also in the New York Times Book Review, as a "well-poised study of union labor in the United States."
Dean Brooks was born in Rome and grew up in Vermont and Florida. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1926 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., studied from 1926 to 1928 at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, receiving another bachelor's degree, and earned a doctorate in economics at Yale in 1935. He was dean and the Orin Sage Professor of Economics at Williams from 1945 to 1963. He retired in 1971 as a professor of economics there.
A volume of his memoirs, "A Tumult of Years," came out in 1980. He wrote, co-wrote or edited six other books.
His wife, the former Mary Elizabeth Storer, died in 1975. They had been married 46 years.
Dean Brooks is survived by a sister, Helen Coombs of Essex, Conn.; a daughter, Patricia Skidmore of Takoma Park, Md.; two sons, Robin, of Orrs Island, Maine, and Jonathan, of Waterport, N.Y.; nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A 4.3% Gain For Workers

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 28

 BODY:
Restrained by the weak economy, wages and benefits for American workers rose just 4.3 percent in 1991, the smallest gain in four years, the Government said today.
The gain in compensation, as measured by the Employment Cost Index, compared with a 4.9 percent rise in 1990, the Labor Department said. 
 Most of the slowdown last year was because of smaller wage gains in the public sector, where compensation lagged behind private industry for the first time since record-keeping began a decade ago.
The last time total compensation gained so slowly was in 1987, when the overall increase in wages and benefits was 3.6 percent.
"The good news is labor costs are under control," said Michael Evans, head of a Washington-based economic consulting firm. "The bad news is that employees are broke."
Total benefit costs, most of which are for health care, rose 5.6 percent last year, after gaining 6.7 percent in 1990, the department said. Benefit costs also include employer-sponsored pension plans and other items.
