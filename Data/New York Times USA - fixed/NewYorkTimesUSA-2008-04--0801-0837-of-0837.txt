HEADLINE: Visa Reports Higher Profit Amid a Rise In Card Use

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card processor, said Monday that its profit rose 28 percent in the first three months of the year as customers around the world charged more to their cards. 
 Cardholder spending outside the United States grew particularly quickly, as more people in developing markets adopted plastic over cash, Visa said.
 Spending in the United States increased as well, a trend other major card companies also reported for early 2008, suggesting that while consumer spending on the whole is slowing down because of the weak economy, people are still using credit.
 After the markets closed Monday, Visa posted fiscal second-quarter profit of $314 million, or 39 cents a share, up from $246 million in the comparable period last year.
 Net operating revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was $1.45 billion, up from $1.19 billion.
 Visa, however, is proceeding cautiously.
 ''At some point, the softening economy will likely impact our business in the U.S.,'' the chief financial officer, Byron Pollitt, said on a conference call with analysts.
 In its three-year outlook, Visa forecast annual net revenue growth of 11 percent to 15 percent, an annual adjusted operating margin of 40 percent or a bit better, annual adjusted growth of 20 percent a share or greater and annual free cash flow above $1 billion.
 Stock in Visa, which is based in San Francisco, fell 6 percent in after-hours trading, having risen 53 cents to close at $75.63 a share. Visa's stock has risen more than 70 percent since its initial public offering at $44 a share on March 19.

HEADLINE: In a 6-to-3 Vote, Justices Uphold A Voter ID Law

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court upheld Indiana's voter identification law on Monday, concluding in a splintered decision that the challengers failed to prove that the law's photo ID requirement placed an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote.
 The 6-to-3 ruling kept the door open to future lawsuits that provided more evidence. But this theoretical possibility was small comfort to the dissenters or to critics of voter ID laws, who predicted that a more likely outcome than successful lawsuits would be the spread of measures that would keep some legitimate would-be voters from the polls. 
 Voting experts said the ruling was likely to complicate election administration, leading to both more litigation and more legislation, at least in states with Republican legislative majorities, but would probably have a limited impact on this year's presidential voting. 
 The issue has been intensely partisan, with Republicans supporting increased identification requirements for voters and Democrats opposing them. In what the court described as the ''lead opinion,'' which was written by Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court acknowledged that the record of the case contained ''no evidence'' of the type of voter fraud the law was ostensibly devised to detect and deter, the effort by a voter to cast a ballot in another person's name.
 But Justice Stevens said that neither was there ''any concrete evidence of the burden imposed on voters who now lack photo identification.'' The ''risk of voter fraud'' was ''real,'' he said, and there was ''no question about the legitimacy or importance of the state's interest in counting only the votes of eligible voters.''
 The three others who made up the majority, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel A. Alito Jr., said in an opinion by Justice Scalia that the law was so obviously justified as ''a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory voting regulation'' that there was no basis for scrutinizing the record to assess the impact on any individual voters. ''This is an area where the dos and don'ts need to be known in advance of the election,'' Justice Scalia said.
 In a dissenting opinion, Justice David H. Souter said that for those on whom the law had an impact, the burden was ''serious'' and the state had failed to justify it. Like the Virginia poll tax the court struck down 42 years ago, he said, ''the onus of the Indiana law is illegitimate just because it correlates with no state interest so well as it does with the object of deterring poorer residents from exercising the franchise.'' The other dissenters were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
 Six states in addition to Indiana -- Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Michigan, and South Dakota -- now require voters to provide photo identification before casting a ballot. Bills are pending in two dozen other states, although they are not likely to pass this year in more than a handful, due to short legislative sessions and Democratic opposition.
 The Indiana law, adopted by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2005 without a single Democratic vote, is regarded as the strictest in the country. It requires a voter to present a photograph as part of an unexpired document issued either by Indiana or the federal government, a requirement that in most cases can be satisfied only by a current driver's license or a passport. The state's motor vehicle agency provides a free photo ID card for people who do not drive, but obtaining it requires a ''primary document'' like an original birth certificate or a passport.
 Would-be voters without proper identification may cast a provisional ballot that will be counted only if they appear within 10 days at a county clerk's office and present acceptable photo identification or, alternatively, swear either that they are indigent or that they have a religious objection to being photographed. 
 The Indiana law was challenged in separate suits filed by the Indiana Democratic Party and by another group of plaintiffs that included elected officials and community groups. The plaintiffs argued that the state had failed to justify a requirement they said would place a special burden on thousands of eligible voters in Indiana who lack driver's licenses, a group that disproportionately includes the poor, the elderly and people with disabilities.
 The plaintiffs lost, both in Federal District Court in Indianapolis and in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago. Writing for the 2-to-1 majority at the appeals court, Judge Richard A. Posner agreed with the plaintiffs that the law would have the greatest impact on people who were ''low on the economic ladder and thus, if they do vote, are more likely to vote for Democratic than Republican candidates.'' While that fact gave the Democratic Party standing to sue, he said, it did not make the law unconstitutional.
 The suits were filed before the statute took effect, challenging the law ''on its face.'' This technique, known as a ''facial challenge,'' has been a staple of election litigation, based on the notion that once an election has taken place, the asserted damage has been done and it is too late to make judicial amends.
 A debate over the legitimacy of a facial challenge in the voter ID context did not enter this case until the Bush administration filed a brief at the Supreme Court stage supporting Indiana. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement told the court in his brief that, as a facial challenge, the suit was premature and based on nothing more than ''speculation and as-yet untested evidence.'' In the decision on Monday, Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, No. 07-21, the Supreme Court did not go quite so far as to make facial challenges unavailable. But Justice Stevens said in his opinion that in their effort to invalidate the statute in all its applications, the plaintiffs failed to carry their ''heavy burden of persuasion,'' given the weight of the state's interest in election integrity.
 In his dissenting opinion, which Justice Ginsburg also signed, Justice Souter examined the case from the opposite end of the telescope. Given that there was ''no evidence of in-person voter impersonation fraud in a state, and very little of it nationwide,'' he said it was Indiana's job to justify placing even a slight burden on even a limited number of people. ''The interest in combating voter fraud has too often served as a cover for unnecessarily restrictive electoral rules,'' Justice Souter said.
 Justice Breyer, in a separate dissenting opinion, compared Indiana's law with those in Georgia and Florida, which also require photo identification but accept a range of more broadly accessible documents. Florida accepts student identification cards, employee badges and cards from neighborhood associations, for example, and accepts a provisional ballot as long as the voter's signature matches one on file. Indiana has not justified its ''significantly harsher'' requirements, he said.
 The vote of Justice Stevens, a reliable anchor of the court's liberal bloc, was something of a surprise. Some speculated that his strategic aim was to keep Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy from joining the Scalia camp. Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said the Stevens opinion might represent an effort to ''depoliticize election law cases.''

HEADLINE: United Said to Restart Talks With US Airways

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeff Bailey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For the last five years, Glenn F. Tilton has talked often about the need for mergers and consolidation in the airline industry, hanging out the equivalent of a ''for sale'' sign at his troubled United Airlines.
 But like many frustrated home sellers these days, Mr. Tilton, United's chief executive, has found no takers so far. 
 After seeing its latest prospect slip away on Sunday with the decision of Continental Airlines to end merger talks, United restarted discussions with US Airways about a possible deal, according to people with direct knowledge of the negotiations.
 The two airlines talked during the last few months, but the negotiations took a back seat so that United could explore a deal with Continental. A deal now between United and US Airways is far from certain, however. 
 Analysts said Monday that US Airways was less attractive to United than Continental, whose hubs in Houston and Newark would have complemented United's operations in Chicago. By contrast, United and US Airways both have extensive service to Washington and might have to cut flights there. But the cuts both airlines made while under bankruptcy protection could make the deal easier to carry out. 
 After Continental's board rejected the idea of a merger late Sunday, saying that the risks outweighed the possible benefits, Mr. Tilton told employees on Monday that the reasons for a merger remained valid. 
 United continues to believe that ''new business models are required to respond to the challenging market environment,'' he said in a recorded message. ''For a shift of that magnitude, management teams must fully embrace the inevitability of change and have a meeting of the minds for any prospective partnership to be successful.''
 Despite spending more than three years in bankruptcy, United's costs remain high compared with those of other major airlines. Its planes generally carry fewer passengers than other airlines, and it has a contentious relationship with its unions, especially its pilots.
 In recent months, United has held talks of varying seriousness with Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines -- which are pursuing their own merger -- as well as Continental, which backed out after the managers of the two airlines had ironed out all the major issues of a deal. 
 United officials said Monday that they were not surprised by the 11th-hour decision, given Continental's preference to remain independent, and they said United's financial condition was not a factor. 
 But other industry executives and airline analysts said United's $537 million first-quarter loss gave Continental a reason to back out.
 It was the biggest loss during the quarter for the major airlines, and it caused United's stock to plummet. The shares fell another 40 cents Monday, to $14.81.
 Given the first-quarter loss, some industry experts questioned United's decision to pay a special dividend in January of $2.07 a share, totaling about $250 million, at a time when airlines are looking for ways to conserve cash.
 United took the step after paying back $3.6 billion in debt, Jean Medina, a company spokeswoman, said Monday. She noted that the company still had nearly $3 billion in cash, as well as $3 billion in assets like planes, engines and other property that it could sell to raise money.
 Still, Philip A. Baggaley, a senior credit analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, said, ''It would be nice to have that cash at this point.''
 United, like many airlines, is facing pressure to stay in compliance with covenants on bank loans. 
 Last week, United's chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace, noted that the airline was well within the requirements set by its lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse. 
 But he acknowledged that United faced cost challenges that prompted it to make another round of cuts in costs and jobs, on top of those it undertook while in bankruptcy protection.
 Analysts were particularly concerned that one main measurement, the cost per available seat mile, rose nearly 16 percent in the first quarter, compared with 2007. United said the increase reflected a 50 percent rise in the cost of jet fuel, but the jump in seat-mile expense was greater than competitors reported.
 In an earlier era, it was relatively simple for an airline to gain a waiver from a lender or to renegotiate loan terms. But as with many such transactions, United's debt upon emerging from bankruptcy in 2006 was syndicated to hedge funds and other investors. They, like the banks, have found themselves under financial stress, from the housing crisis and other problems in the economy.
 Likewise, United left bankruptcy anticipating that oil would cost $50 a barrel through 2010, less than half its current price. Should United's finances worsen, industry officials warned that it might not get the automatic pass it could have expected only a few months ago. United officials said they were confident they could work out any issues.
 At US Airways, Mr. Tilton has a kindred spirit in its chief executive, W. Douglas Parker, who led America West before it merged with US Airways in 2005. 
 Mr. Parker, for his part, knows the sting of embarrassment that comes from a deflected bid. Last year, Delta, which agreed last week to merge with Northwest, turned down a hostile offer from US Airways. 
 ''You at least have two willing partners, and that could be important, given that the clock is ticking,'' Mr. Baggaley said. ''If they are going to have a merger, they better announce it soon.''
 One reason for the fast timetable is the desire of airlines to have their deals considered by the Bush administration rather than risk a rejection by a new president. 
 But a United-US Airways deal has already been turned down once by the Bush administration, in 2001, when the Justice Department vowed to sue if the merger went through. The prospect prompted them to call it off.
 That was before the industry was pummeled by a wave of bankruptcy filings, including two at US Airways and another at United, and soaring fuel prices. Those fuel costs were a main reason cited by Delta and Northwest for their merger.
 Delta and Northwest have said they do not plan extensive cuts once their merger takes effect, a reason some analysts believe their stocks have not climbed. 
 But investors would cheer a deal in which airlines seriously restructure their operations rather than glue them together, said James B. Lee, vice chairman at JPMorgan Chase, who has advised Mr. Tilton since he has been at United. 
 Mr. Lee said investors would be eager to participate in a merger of two carriers that took a serious approach to restructuring their operations rather than simply combining them. ''You could take that kind of a combination on the road'' -- raising equity and paying down debt -- ''and tell a fascinating global growth story. You would end up with a real company with a real balance sheet,'' he said. ''To me, that's the vision here.''
 Mr. Tilton's push for consolidation may be hampered by more than its finances. The airline also has a difficult relationship with its unions -- another reason Continental officials shied away from a deal, according to an executive who declined to be identified because the situation was sensitive.
 On Monday, United's pilots issued a statement denouncing Mr. Tilton's 2007 compensation, disclosed Friday: $10.3 million, including salary, stock awards, stock options and a bonus. 
 The union called on Mr. Tilton and other United managers to reject their compensation in light of the first-quarter results and ''this management group's inability to find a suitable merger partner.''
 But Mr. Tilton said in his message Monday that the airline had a strong balance sheet. Its performance over the last 12 months, he said, had given United ''a solid foundation to manage through the complexities of this current economic environment.''

HEADLINE: Europeans See Inflation Penalizing The Poorest

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Europe is facing a ''very strong inflationary shock'' as a result of rising energy and food costs, the top European Union official for economic affairs said on Monday as the price of oil traded not far from $120 a barrel. 
 The official, Joaquin Almunia, commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said higher inflation was emerging as ''a big punishment to the weakest sectors of society'' eating away at the purchasing power of consumers who are struggling with stagnant incomes. 
 His remarks came as the European Commission, the European Union's year-round executive agency, revised its forecast for inflation this year to 3.2 percent, from 2.1 percent in 2007, well above the target of slightly under 2 percent that the European Central Bank aims for. 
 In response, Mr. Almunia said that governments should change laws and regulations that keep prices high. European officials have said that these measures include fostering greater competition in services and keeping down administrative fees and sales taxes. 
 ''We need to be concerned not only because of economic reasons but also because of social reasons,'' Mr. Almunia said, ''and we need to ask the governments to step up their efforts of adopting structural reforms that can counter these inflation risks.'' 
 Commodity price increases, amplified by rising demand from fast-growing Asian economies, have contributed to higher inflation. On Monday, oil touched a high in New York trading of $119.40 a barrel, settling at $118.75, after a weekend strike closed a pipeline that delivers crude oil to British refineries from the North Sea and violence reduced production in Nigeria. 
 Mr. Almunia acknowledged that inflation was biting hard in Europe because many incomes had not risen as much in the current economic upswing as in past expansions, amplifying a feeling of being squeezed.
 ''The disposable income of households is not increasing as much as in previous recoveries,'' he said, ''and this means wage increases have not increased so far as much as in previous recoveries.'' 
 The European Central Bank has inflation, which reached a 3.6 percent annual pace in March, firmly in view, as required by its mandate. The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said Monday in Vienna that it would set interest rates based on ''no other considerations than the delivery of price stability in the medium term.'' 
 In recent weeks, the tough stances of several senior bank policy makers on inflation has contributed to a broad impression that at least some officials are itching to raise interest rates as soon as tension eases in the financial markets. Many economists say that the strength of the euro, which helps keep import prices down, has probably helped curb any rush by the bank to increase borrowing costs. 
 ''There is no doubt in my mind that without the financial crisis, and maybe the strong euro, they would have long since hiked rates,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs in London. 
 Like central bankers, Mr. Almunia has frequently cautioned against wage settlements that incorporate these price rises into pay scales because they increase the chances that companies will pass the costs along to consumers, fueling an inflation cycle. But he cited Germany as one country where rising wages should bolster consumer spending after years of relying on exports for growth, a development that would help spur growth across Europe. 
 The commission predicted Monday that European economic growth would cool somewhat this year, to 1.7 percent in the 15-nation euro zone, down from the 2.2 percent it forecast in the autumn. The euro zone economy grew 2.6 percent in 2007. 
 Mr. Almunia also said that the strong euro, which so far has shown little sign of pinching European growth, would eventually affect, and be amplified by, a weaker world economy. The euro settled in New York Monday at $1.5645, below its record just over $1.60, but is probably still overvalued, he said.

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN. 
Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Catrin Einhorn from Chicago.

 BODY:
The federal government began issuing electronic tax rebates on Monday under a $168 billion program to bolster the economy.
 President Bush and Congress hope the plan will generate spending and jump-start the economy by putting money in people's hands. The plan, which was passed by Congress in February, also includes tax breaks for businesses. 
 Economists have debated how much of an impact the stimulus plan will have. A study of similar rebates in 2001, performed by Joel Slemrod and Matthew D. Shapiro, economics professors at the University of Michigan, found that taxpayers primarily saved the money or used it to pay off debts. 
 The Treasury Department plans to send electronic rebates to nearly 7.7 million people by the end of this week, said Andrew DeSouza, a spokesman for the department.
 The government intends to begin mailing checks on May 9 and expects to send a total of about 130 million rebates. The bulk of those will be mailed by early July, Mr. DeSouza said.
 People who chose direct deposit for their tax refunds or provided bank routing numbers to the Internal Revenue Service will receive their rebates electronically, said Eric Smith, an I.R.S. spokesman.
 The plan provides rebates of up to $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for couples filing jointly, with additional payments to families of $300 per child. Payments will be reduced for people with adjusted 2007 gross incomes above $75,000 and for couples with incomes above $150,000. Taxpayers whose incomes exceeded certain amounts -- for example, an individual with no children who earned $87,000 -- are not eligible, Mr. Smith said. 
 People who are not normally required to file a tax return are also eligible, provided they had at least $3,000 in qualifying income, which includes some payments from Social Security and the Department of Veterans Affairs, the I.R.S. said. 
 For Phylishia White, the rebate check will be a measure of help at a difficult time. Ms. White, 26, of Los Angeles, said her family rented part of a duplex that is now in foreclosure. Facing eviction, they have to move on short notice, and Ms. White said the rebate would help with some of the expenses.
 ''It's going to go to something important,'' said Ms. White, an administrative assistant. ''To the move, to clothes, to food. Probably to the move mostly.''
 Professor Slemrod, the Michigan researcher, said Monday that because the tax rebate plan was intended to increase spending rapidly, the tendency among consumers to save or reduce debt with such payments would lessen its impact.
 He said it mattered little to the economy what type of purchases -- whether groceries or a new washing machine -- were made with money from the rebates. What is important, he said, is that the money does go into the economy.
 ''If we start talking about this year, my view is on balance it was a good idea,'' Professor Slemrod said. ''Even if only modestly, it will lean against the wind.''
 Michael Miller, 27, said he was grateful for the $600 he expects to use for credit card bills, student loans and rent for the apartment he shares in Chicago.
 Recently, he said, money has been so tight he has started moonlighting as a host at a restaurant. 
 ''I would bet a lot of people are in the same boat I am: falling behind and trying to catch up,'' said Mr. Miller, who works for a mortgage company. ''And this helps.''

 The Olympic torch has been greeted with protests at many of its stops during the run-up to this summer's Games.

French efforts to shut down the camps and arrest the migrants have done little to deter them from seeking a better future in Britain, drawn by the English language, the absence of national identity cards and the possibility of illegal work.

 A TEXAS COUNTY AND THE DEATH PENALTY
 Over the last three decades, Harris County, Tex., which includes Houston, has executed more people than any other state in the country except Texas itself. A new study found that defendants who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who kill blacks, which other studies on the death penalty have found. But the study also found that the race of the defendant plays a major role in explaining who is sentenced to death. Sidebar, Adam Liptak. PAGE A10 
 FIRST STIMULUS REBATES SENT OUT
 Many Americans will begin seeing rebates from the federal government's $168 billion economic stimulus plans as early as this week, and the government ultimately to mail out 130 million rebates, with $600 for individuals and up to $1,200 for couples filing jointly. But there is still debate over how much the rebates will help bolster the economy, if at all. PAGE A10

HEADLINE: As Clinton Seeks Gas Tax Break For Summer, Obama Says No

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Jeff Zeleny and Julie Bosman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As angry truckers encircled the Capitol in a horn-blaring caravan and consumers across the country agonized over $60 fill-ups, the issue of high fuel prices flared on the campaign trail on Monday, sharply dividing the two Democratic candidates.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lined up with Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, in endorsing a plan to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline, 18.4 cents a gallon, for the summer travel season. But Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton's Democratic rival, spoke out firmly against the proposal, saying it would save consumers little and do nothing to curtail oil consumption and imports.
 While Mr. Obama's view is shared by environmentalists and many independent energy analysts, his position allowed Mrs. Clinton to draw a contrast with her opponent in appealing to the hard-hit middle-class families and older Americans who have proven to be the bedrock of her support. She has accused Mr. Obama of being out of touch with ordinary Americans who are struggling to meet their mortgages and gas up their cars and trucks.
 Mrs. Clinton said at a rally on Monday morning in Graham, N.C., that she would introduce legislation to impose a windfall-profits tax on oil companies and use the revenue to suspend the gasoline tax temporarily. 
 ''At the heart of my approach is a simple belief,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Middle-class families are paying too much and oil companies aren't paying their fair share to help us solve the problems at the pump.''
 The split occurred as Senators Clinton and Obama were competing intensely in primaries in Indiana and North Carolina, where voters go to the polls next Tuesday. Opinion surveys have shown that the faltering economy and high gas prices are the top concerns of voters across the country, edging out the war in Iraq.
 The Clinton campaign is running television advertising in Indiana contrasting her approach on gas prices with Mr. Obama's.
 Mrs. Clinton said the tax on the oil companies, which have been reporting record profits as oil prices soar, would cover all of the lost revenue from the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. She also said no highway projects would suffer.
 Mr. Obama derided the McCain-Clinton idea of a federal tax holiday as a ''short-term, quick-fix'' proposal that would do more harm than good, and said the money, which is earmarked for the federal highway trust fund, is badly needed to maintain the nation's roads and bridges.
 In 2000, Mr. Obama supported a bill in the Illinois legislature to suspend most of the state's 6.25 percent gasoline sales tax. But he later opposed making the reduction permanent, arguing that the state needed the revenue and that the measure had saved consumers little.
 Mrs. Clinton, of New York, has also taken varying stands on the issue of gas taxes. In her 2000 Senate campaign, she spoke against repealing the federal gasoline tax, calling it ''one of those few taxes that New York actually gets more money from Washington than we send.''
 At a meeting with voters in North Carolina on Monday, Mr. Obama said lifting the gas tax for three months would save the average consumer no more than $30, a figure confirmed by Congressional analysts. Mr. Obama has previously dismissed Mr. McCain's proposal as a ''scheme.''
 ''Half a tank of gas,'' Mr. Obama told his audience. ''That's his big solution.''
 President Bush's spokeswoman essentially sided with Mr. Obama in saying that tax holidays and new levies on oil companies would not address the long-term problems of dependence on foreign oil.
 Dana Perino, the White House spokeswoman, said gasoline prices were ''entirely too high, but I think it would be disingenuous and unfortunate for American consumers for them to be led to believe that there is a short-term fix.''
 ''There is not going to be one,'' Ms. Perino said.
 It is not clear whether Congress will act quickly on a fuel tax suspension and a new levy on oil companies, particularly given the White House opposition. While Democratic leaders are sympathetic, aides said, similar plans have failed a number of times.
 The debate erupted as both candidates rounded up more superdelegate endorsements on Monday, with Mr. Obama highlighting the backing of Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, while Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina was preparing to endorse Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday. 
 The split on the gas tax is a relatively rare one for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, who agree on the broad outlines of policy in most areas. They have both called for the suspension of purchases for the national strategic petroleum stockpile, a supply of oil to protect the country against sudden supply disruptions; new taxes on oil companies; measures to curb global warming; and heavy federal spending on renewable energy sources. They have also called for a federal investigation of possible manipulation in oil markets.
 Mr. McCain has also called for a halt to purchases for the petroleum reserve and expressed support of climate-change legislation, but opposes the imposition of windfall-profits taxes on oil companies.
 All three candidates have endorsed tougher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks and diplomatic measures to pressure oil-producing nations to lower prices.
 The federal tax on motor fuels -- the tax on diesel fuel is 24.4 cents a gallon -- yielded $28.2 billion in 2006, the last full year for which statistics are available. The last time the federal fuel taxes were raised significantly was in 1993 as part of President Bill Clinton's budget-balancing package.
 The highway trust fund that the gas tax finances provides money to states and local governments to pay for road and bridge construction, repair and maintenance. Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton propose to suspend the tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day, the peak driving season, which would lower tax receipts by roughly $9 billion and potentially cost 300,000 highway construction jobs, according to state highway officials.
 Mrs. Clinton would replace that money with the new tax on oil company profits, an idea that has been kicking around Congress for several years but has not been enacted into law. Mr. McCain would divert tax revenue from other sources to make the highway trust fund whole.
 The Senate blocked a $15 billion tax on oil companies last December that was part of a larger energy package. 
 A McCain spokesman sought to use the gas tax issue to drive a wedge between the two Democratic candidates and paint Mr. Obama as a flip-flopper given how he voted as a state lawmaker in 2000.
 ''It's clear Barack Obama's not strong enough to provide immediate relief at the pump, and it shows he doesn't understand our economy or have the ability to deliver for hard-working Americans,'' said Tucker Bounds, a McCain aide. ''Senator Obama's arguments against John McCain's gas tax holiday are complete fiction, and the reality is that he used to support a gas tax holiday before he was running for president.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Students in the U.S. Fight a 'Biased' View of Home

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Michael Anti contributed reporting from Cambridge, Mass.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When the time came for the smiling Tibetan monk at the front of the University of Southern California lecture hall to answer questions, the Chinese students who packed the audience for the talk last Tuesday had plenty to lob at their guest: 
 If Tibet was not part of China, why had the Chinese emperor been the one to give the Dalai Lama his title? How did the tenets of Buddhism jibe with the ''slavery system'' in Tibet before China's modernization efforts? What about the Dalai Lama's connection to Hitler?
 As the monk tried to rebut the students, they grew more hostile. They brandished photographs and statistics to support their claims. ''Stop lying! Stop lying!'' one young man said. A plastic bottle of water hit the wall behind the monk, and campus police officers hustled the person who threw it out of the room. 
 Scenes like this, ranging from civil to aggressive, have played out at colleges across the country over the past month, as Chinese students in the United States have been forced to confront an image of their homeland that they neither recognize nor appreciate. Since the riots last month in Tibet, the disrupted Olympic torch relays and calls to boycott the opening ceremony of the Games in Beijing, Chinese students, traditionally silent on political issues, have begun to lash out at what they perceive as a pervasive anti-Chinese bias. 
 Last year, there were more than 42,000 students from mainland China studying in the United States, an increase from fewer than 20,000 in 2003, according to the State Department.
 Campuses including Cornell, the University of Washington in Seattle and the University of California, Irvine, have seen a wave of counterdemonstrations using tactics that seem jarring in the American academic context. At the University of Washington, students fought to limit the Dalai Lama's address to nonpolitical topics. At Duke, pro-China students surrounded and drowned out a pro-Tibet vigil; a Chinese freshman who tried to mediate received death threats, and her family was forced into hiding. 
 And last Saturday, students from as far as Florida and Tennessee traveled to Atlanta to picket CNN after a commentator, Jack Cafferty, referred to the Chinese as ''goons and thugs.'' (CNN said he was referring to the government, not the people.)
 The student anger, stoked through e-mail messages sent to large campus mailing lists, stems not so much from satisfaction with the Chinese government but from shock at the portrayal of its actions, as well as frustration over the West's long-standing love affair with Tibet -- a love these students see as willfully blind. 
 By and large, they do not acknowledge the cultural and religious crackdown in Tibet, insisting that ordinary Tibetans have prospered under China's economic development, and that only a small minority are unhappy. 
 ''Before I came here, I'm very liberal,'' said Minna Jia, a graduate student in political science at U.S.C. who encouraged fellow students to attend the monk's lecture. ''But after I come here, my professor told me that I'm nationalist.'' 
 ''I believe in democracy,'' Ms. Jia added, ''but I can't stand for someone to criticize my country using biased ways. You are wearing Chinese clothes and you are using Chinese goods.''
 Students interviewed for this article deplored the more extreme expressions of anger, like death threats against the Duke freshman and the tossing of the water bottle, and pointed out that Chinese students had little experience in the art of protest. But, they said, they could also understand them. 
 ''We've been smothered for too long time,'' said Jasmine Dong, another graduate student who attended the U.S.C. lecture. 
 By that, Ms. Dong did not mean that Chinese students had been repressed or censored by their own government. She meant that the Western news media had not acknowledged the strides China had made or the voices of overseas Chinese. ''We are still neglected or misunderstood as either brainwashed or manipulated by the government,'' she said.
 No matter what China does, these students say, it cannot win in the arena of world opinion. ''When we have a billion people, you said we were destroying the planet./ When we tried limiting our numbers, you said it is human rights abuse,'' reads a poem posted on the Internet by ''a silent, silent Chinese'' and cited by some students as an accurate expression of their feelings. ''When we were poor, you thought we were dogs./ When we loan you cash, you blame us for your debts./ When we build our industries, you called us polluters./ When we sell you goods, you blame us for global warming.''
 Rather than blend in to the prevailing campus ethos of free debate, the more strident Chinese students seem to replicate the authoritarian framework of their homeland, photographing demonstration participants and sometimes drowning out dissent. 
 A Tibetan student who declined to be identified for fear of harassment said he decided not to attend a vigil for Tibet on his campus, which he also did not want identified because there are so few Tibetans there. ''It's not that I didn't want to, I really did want to go -- it's our cause,'' he said. ''At the same time, I have to consider that my family's back there, and I'm going back there in May.''
 Another factor fueling the zeal of many Chinese demonstrators could be that they, too, intend to return home; the Chinese government is widely believed to be monitoring large e-mail lists. 
 Universities have often tried to accommodate the anger of their Chinese students. Before the Dalai Lama's visit to the University of Washington, the campus Chinese Students and Scholars Association wrote to the university president expressing hopes that the visit would focus only on nonpolitical issues and not arouse anti-China sentiments. According to a posting on the group's Web site, the university president, Mark A. Emmert, told them in a meeting that no political questions would be raised at the Dalai Lama's speech. A spokesman said the university, which opened an office in Beijing last fall, had prescreened student questions before the Chinese students voiced their concerns.
 Some experts say that colleges feel constrained from reining in the more extreme protests through a combination of concerns about cultural sensitivity and a desire to expand their own ties with China.
 ''I think there tends to be a great deal of self-censorship,'' said Peter Gries, director of the Institute for U.S.-China Issues at the University of Oklahoma, ''and not just among American China scholars but among the whole web of people who do business with China, including school administrators.''
 At the U.S.C. lecture, the Chinese students arrived early to distribute handouts on Tibet and China that contained a jumble of abbreviated history, slogans and maps with little context. A chart showing that infant mortality in Tibet had plummeted since 1951, when the Communist Chinese government asserted control, did not provide any means for comparison with mortality rates in China or other countries. 
 One photograph showed the Dalai Lama with Heinrich Harrer, author of ''Seven Years in Tibet'' and a one-time member of the Nazi Party -- hence the question about the Dalai Lama's connection to Hitler, who died when the Dalai Lama was nine. The question about slavery referred to the feudal system in place in Tibet until the mid-20th century. Another photograph purported to show a Tibetan drum that, according to the caption, was covered with ''a virgin girl's skin.'' 
 The students said they were frustrated by a sense that many accounts of the recent riots did not reflect the violence and destruction by the Tibetan protesters, who vandalized shops owned by Han Chinese (the ethnic majority in China). According to official Chinese news sources, 22 died in the rioting. 
 Much of the anger has the tenor of disillusionment. During the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, the Western news media was seen as a source of otherwise elusive truth. 
 ''We thought Western media is very objective,'' said Chou Wu, a 28-year-old working on his doctorate in material science, ''and what it turned out is that Western media is even more biased than Chinese media. They're no better, and even more, they're against us.''
 Students argue that China has spent billions on Tibet, building schools, roads and other infrastructure. Asked if the Tibetans wanted such development, they looked blankly incredulous. ''They don't ask that question,'' said Lionel Jensen, a China scholar at Notre Dame. ''They've accepted the basic premise of aggressive modernization.''
 That may be, some experts suggest, because the students whose families can afford to send them abroad are the ones who have benefited the most from China's economic liberalization. 
 Spring Zheng, 27, another graduate student at U.S.C., dismissed the notion that her patriotism stemmed from the government's efforts to use the schools to instill national pride, particularly after Tiananmen Square. 
 Rather, Ms. Zheng said, ''We have witnessed with our own eyes about the rapid change of China. China is developing fast, and Chinese people's lives'' are ''becoming better and better, fast.''
 As the U.S.C. session wound to a close, the organizer, Lisa Leeman, a documentary film instructor, pleaded for a change in tone. ''My hope for this event, which I don't totally see happening here, is for people on both, quote, sides to really hear each other and maybe learn from each other,'' Ms. Leeman said. ''Are there any genuine questions that don't stem from a political point of view, that are really not here to be on a soap box?''
 At that moment, the bottle hit the wall.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 1, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Chinese students in the United States who have to deal with negative images of their home country misspelled the family name of a doctoral student at the University of Southern California who said the Western news media were biased against China. He is Chau Wu, not Chou Wu.

HEADLINE: Demography Is King

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Fifty-five years ago, 80 percent of American television viewers, young and old, tuned in to see Milton Berle on Tuesday nights. Tens of millions, rich and poor, worked together at Elks Lodges and Rotary Clubs. Millions more, rural and urban, read general-interest magazines like Look and Life. In those days, the owner of the local bank lived in the same town as the grocery clerk, and their boys might play on the same basketball team. Only 7 percent of adult Americans had a college degree. 
 But that's all changed. In the decades since, some social divides, mostly involving ethnicity, have narrowed. But others, mostly involving education, have widened. Today there is a mass educated class. The college educated and non-college educated are likely to live in different towns. They have radically different divorce rates and starkly different ways of raising their children. The non-college educated not only earn less, they smoke more, grow more obese and die sooner. 
 Retailers, home builders and TV executives identify and reinforce these lifestyle clusters. There are more niche offerings and fewer common experiences. 
 The ensuing segmentation has reshaped politics. We're used to the ideological divide between Red and Blue America. This year's election has revealed a deep cultural gap within the Democratic Party, separating what Stuart Rothenberg calls the two Democratic parties.
 In state after state (Wisconsin being the outlier), Barack Obama has won densely populated, well-educated areas. Hillary Clinton has won less-populated, less-educated areas. For example, Obama has won roughly 70 percent of the most-educated counties in the primary states. Clinton has won 90 percent of the least-educated counties. In state after state, Obama has won a few urban and inner-ring suburban counties. Clinton has won nearly everywhere else. 
 This social divide has overshadowed regional differences. Sixty-year-old, working-class Catholics vote the same, whether they live in Fresno, Scranton, Nashua or Orlando.
 The divide has even overshadowed campaigning. Surely the most interesting feature of the Democratic race is how unimportant political events are. The candidates can spend tens of millions of dollars on advertising, but they are not able to sway their opponent's voters to their side. They can win a stunning victory, but the momentum doesn't carry over from state to state. They can make horrific gaffes, deliver brilliant speeches, turn in good or bad debate performances, but these things do not alter the race. 
 In Pennsylvania, Obama did everything conceivable to win over Clinton's working-class voters. The effort was a failure. The great uniter failed to unite. In this election, persuasion isn't important. Social identity is everything. Demography is king.
 Over the years, different theories have emerged to describe the educated/less-educated divide. Conservatives have gravitated toward the culture war narrative, dividing the country between the wholesome masses and the decadent cultural elites. Some liberals believe income inequality drives everything. They wait for an uprising of economic populism. Other liberals divide the country morally, between the enlightened urbanites and the racist rednecks who will never vote for a black man. 
 None of these theories really fit the facts. It's more accurate to say that the country has simply drifted apart into different subcultures. There's no great hostility between the cultures. Americans have a fuzzy sense of where the boundaries lie. But people in different niches have developed different unconscious maps of reality. They have developed different communal understandings of what constitutes a good leader, of what sort of world they live in. They have developed different communal definitions, which they can't even articulate, of what they mean by liberty, security and virtue. Demographic groups have begun to function like tribes or cultures. 
 We can all play the parlor game of trying to figure out why Obama, a Harvard Law grad, resonates with the more educated while Clinton, a Yale Law grad, resonates with the less educated. I'd throw in that Obama's offer of a secular crusade hits a nerve among his fellow bobos, while Clinton's talk of fighting and resilience plays well down market. 
 But these theories only scratch the surface. The mental maps people in different cultures form are infinitely complex and poorly understood even by those who hold them. People pick up millions of subtle signals from body language, word choice, facial expressions, policy positions and biographical details. Efforts to rebrand a candidate to appeal to down-market voters are inevitably crude and counterproductive. 
 The core message is that even if you take away the ideological differences between the parties, you are still left with profound social gulfs within the parties. There's poignancy to that. The upscale liberals who revere Obama have spent their lives championing equality and opposing privilege. But they've smashed the old WASP social hierarchy only to create a new educational one.

HEADLINE: Its Candidates Otherwise Engaged, Democratic Party Goes After McCain

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With no end in sight to the nominating contest between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has begun its first sustained advertising campaign against Senator John McCain, introducing a new commercial this week criticizing his recent comments that he could envision a United States presence in Iraq for 100 years.
 The advertisement drew immediate recriminations from Republican Party officials, who said on Monday that it took Mr. McCain's words out of context and demanded that television outlets refuse to show it. The commercial is expected to run only on CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC, a limited purchase of air time that the party clearly hopes will be amplified by news coverage about the advertisements. 
 The spot is a modest effort by the relatively cash-poor party headquarters to do what the far better financed campaigns of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are too busy fighting each other to do themselves: press a challenge to Mr. McCain, whom one of them will face in the fall -- and who has been able to campaign this spring without sustained challenge from Democrats. 
 The Democratic National Committee's new commercial, its second in two weeks, is part of a hodgepodge of efforts by the party and its allies to pick up the slack against Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee. 
 They come at a time of deepening concern among some party leaders that the prolonged primary fight is eating up a crucial opportunity to attack the senator in the last few weeks before voters traditionally tune out for summer vacation -- a point by which sophisticated presidential campaigns hope to have left some sort of lasting mark on their opponents' public image.
 ''We don't have a nominee, we might not have one for awhile, and the D.N.C.'s job is to not let John McCain run free and unchallenged,'' said Steve McMahon, a strategist for the party whose company is producing the anti-McCain spots. ''McCain isn't still very well defined -- we don't want to let him set the frame for himself while our nominee isn't settled.''
 Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton between them are raising and spending record sums of money. But the party is limited in how much it can do because fund-raising at the committee level has been anemic by comparison with that of the Republicans. 
 The Democratic Party had only $5.3 million in the bank at the end of March -- when the Republican National Committee had $31 million -- and its new campaign is limited, costing about a million dollars for three weeks on the cable networks.
 The liberal group MoveOn is planning to begin running an advertisement against Mr. McCain on Thursday, the fifth anniversary of President Bush's declaration that major combat operations in Iraq were over.
 Another group called Progressive Media USA has run advertisements linking Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush on cable and some broadcast stations. It is vowing to spend tens of millions of dollars against Mr. McCain.
 The independent groups -- operating outside the fund-raising restrictions imposed on the parties and candidates -- have this year been the envy of Republicans, who say they are scrambling to match what they expect will be several major efforts against them in the coming months financed by wealthy liberals like George Soros. 
 But Democratic officials said the fund-raising efforts by the groups had been slower than expected, as most donors are splitting their giving between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.
 And, so far, none of the independent efforts against Mr. McCain has come close to matching the cost of the television campaigns that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have been running in their ever-more-heated competition against each other.
 According to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a private firm known as CMAG that monitors political advertising, their intramural television advertising battle has surpassed $100 million, easily a record for a party nominating contest.
 The candidates are unleashing advertising barrages in Indiana and North Carolina and beyond, putting them on a pace to triple what the Democratic presidential candidates spent on commercials in the entire 2004 nominating season.
 The expense, combined with the sharpness of some of the back-and-forth, is adding to anxiety in the party that a protracted fight that has produced unparalleled voter excitement and turnout is now taking up substantial sums that would have been otherwise devoted to fighting Mr. McCain.
 ''The great danger, of course, is they will end up spending so much money trying to knock out each other that when it comes time to knock John McCain out we might be too exhausted,'' said Donna Brazile, a Democratic superdelegate who is unaligned. ''We might deplete this well of fortune that we've somehow or another found.''
 With his own money challenges, Mr. McCain has yet to run a substantial national advertising campaign against either of his potential Democratic opponents -- something Mr. Bush had already been doing against his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, for weeks at this point four years ago. 
 But Democrats have openly worried that at times Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have done the work for Mr. McCain while going through the geyser of cash they are finding on the Internet.
 Though the Democratic candidates' advertisements have been primarily focused on their biographies, as well as economic and domestic concerns, their exchanges have grown increasingly confrontational.
 So far the advertisements Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are running before the next votes, in Indiana and North Carolina next Tuesday, have yet to include attacks. But Mr. Obama's campaign was girding for new advertisements from an outside group that supports Mrs. Clinton, the American Leadership Project.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Clinton supporter and head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the roughhousing would ultimately lead to a stronger, more battle-tested nominee in the fall. ''It's sort of like having an extended practice round,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 Still, he added, ''It's not fun to watch.''
 Speaking with reporters on Monday, the Democratic National Committee chairman, Howard Dean, expressed urgency when he described deciding to run a party-sponsored advertisement against Mr. McCain. ''I said look, it is time for us to get this done,'' he said.
 Republicans charged that Mr. Dean had produced the advertisement illegally, in coordination with the campaigns, which he strenuously denied. And they said television outlets should not run it, arguing that it misleadingly implied that Mr. McCain supported a prolonged war footing in Iraq when in fact he said he could foresee a sustained troop presence there along the lines of the one in South Korea, ''as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed.''

CHART: BATTLE OF THE ADS: After spending nearly $16 million in Pennsylvania, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama have already passed the $100 million mark on television advertising in the states that have had primaries so far.

HEADLINE: Muzzling the Watchdog

BYLINE: By WILLIAM DONALDSON, ARTHUR LEVITT Jr. and DAVID RUDER. 
William Donaldson was the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2003 to 2005, Arthur Levitt Jr. from 1993 to 2001 and David Ruder from 1987 to 1989.

 BODY:
THE downfall of Bear Stearns, the release of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's sweeping blueprint for the overhaul of our financial regulatory structure, and the worsening health of the stock market and our economy has raised serious questions for the future of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the capital-markets regulator and investor's advocate, the S.E.C. is a natural recipient of finger-pointing during a market crisis. 
 Each of us led the S.E.C. during challenging times -- the stock market crash of 1987, the price-fixing scandal at Nasdaq in the 1990s, and the accounting and governance failures and mutual fund scandals of this decade. We are in agreement with Secretary Paulson that the world of finance is changing rapidly, having eclipsed in many areas the regulatory structure put in place, piece by piece, over the past century. Yet we fear that the current conversation about the future of the S.E.C. is getting ahead of itself. Secretary Paulson's proposals to change the structure and function of the S.E.C., if adopted, risk inflicting serious damage to investors and our capital markets. 
 The current housing and credit troubles do not present a sufficient basis for reforming the entire financial regulatory system. Instead of moving hastily, policymakers need to examine what went wrong, why it went wrong and what the best approaches are for re-establishing the unequaled reputation and performance of the American capital markets.
 There is precedent for such an exercise. In 1987, a presidential task force was established to investigate the Black Monday crash. Today, we need a similar exhaustive, bipartisan and impartial examination to explore a series of possible business and regulatory failures. 
 This investigation should include apparent conflicts of interest on the part of the credit ratings agencies; the failure of banks and other lenders to adopt sound lending practices; the failure of investment banks to disclose that they had significant portfolios of securities backed by subprime mortgages; the sale of high-risk securities to investors for whom they were unsuited; the breakdown (or absence) of adequate risk management systems among the top financial services firms; and the failure of regulators to recognize and take early action to deal with the problems that have grown to today's magnitude.
 Any reforms undertaken after the commission completes its study should not undermine the S.E.C.'s central roles as an investor's advocate and a law enforcement agency. But the Treasury Department proposal envisions an S.E.C. that would no longer regulate through hard-and-fast rules enforced swiftly and justly, but rather would practice ''prudential'' regulation, offering up principles and conceptual guidelines and working collaboratively behind closed doors with regulated entities and their self-regulatory organizations when they have violated the law.
 This approach would turn the S.E.C. from a market referee into an industry coach -- a regulator that is heavy on forgiveness and light on punishment. That's not a viable way to address wrongdoing. In our experience, tough enforcement of the securities laws deters bad behavior by market participants. 
 The problem with the S.E.C. today is that it lacks the money, manpower and tools it needs to do its job. The commission's 2009 enforcement budget does not keep pace with inflation, although it does provide significant increases in the risk-assessment function.
 The S.E.C.'s effectiveness is not contingent just on the size of its budget. Historically, the S.E.C. has been effective in using the bully pulpit to affect the behavior of market actors. But before we merge the S.E.C. with other regulatory agencies or change its regulatory mission, we should empower it to do its current job by providing it with what it needs to be a more effective regulator.
 We are not advocating a preservation of the status quo. The only thing constant in our global economy is change, and to keep pace with the capital markets and needs of investors, our regulators too must change. But before we embark on a radical restructuring of the financial regulatory system, we must understand clearly where the current problems lie, what was and was not done by regulators leading up to the current crisis, and whether new powers are needed to keep pace with financial innovation. 
 And above all, whatever we do, we must preserve the S.E.C.'s role as the enforcer of the markets' rules of the road and as the government's advocate for investors of all sizes.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Says Drug Tainting May Be Deliberate

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal drug regulators believe that a contaminant detected in a crucial blood thinner that has caused 81 deaths was added deliberately, something the Food and Drug Administration has only hinted at previously.
 ''F.D.A.'s working hypothesis is that this was intentional contamination, but this is not yet proven,'' Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the Food and Drug Administration's drug center, told the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in written testimony given Tuesday. 
 A third of the material in some batches of the thinner heparin were contaminants, ''and it does strain one's credulity to suggest that might have been done accidentally,'' Dr. Woodcock said. 
 Two weeks ago, Food and Drug Commissioner Andrew C. von Eschenbach told a Senate subcommittee that the contamination was done ''by virtue of economic fraud,'' but he quickly withdrew the remark, saying he had ''probably gone too far.''
 Dr. Woodcock's statement on Tuesday was part of growing chorus that has labeled the heparin contamination as perhaps the most brazen poisoning episode since 1982, when seven people in the Chicago area died after taking Tylenol that had been laced with cyanide. 
 The Tylenol case led to substantial changes in product packaging, and the heparin contamination has led both Democratic and Republican committee members to call for major changes in the way the F.D.A. functions and is financed.
 Tuesday's hearing was also the first in which family members of those who died were asked to testify.
 LeRoy Hubley of Toledo, Ohio, described how both his 65-year-old wife and his 47-year-old son died within a few weeks of each other. Both suffered from a genetic kidney disease that required constant dialysis, for which heparin is routinely used.
 ''As Christmas music softly played in the background, we each said our goodbyes,'' Mr. Hubley said, breaking down in tears. ''Then my wife and love of 48 years drifted away.''
 He did not know for weeks after their deaths that his wife, Bonnie, and son, Randy, had been given contaminated heparin. 
 ''Now I am left to deal not only with the pain of losing my wife and son, but anger that an unsafe drug was permitted to be sold in this country,'' he said.
 David G. Strunce, chief executive of Scientific Protein Laboratories, the company that supplied contaminated heparin material to Baxter International, which manufactured and distributed the finished drug, described the contamination as ''an insidious act'' that ''seems to us an intentional act upstream in the supply chain.''
 The F.D.A. has identified Changzhou SPL, a Chinese subsidiary of Scientific Protein Laboratories, as the source of the contaminated heparin. A Congressional investigator said the contaminant, oversulfated chondroitin sulfate, cost $9 a pound compared with $900 a pound for heparin.
 Mr. Strunce said that his company tried to find the original source of the contamination but was stopped by the Chinese authorities. 
 Robert L. Parkinson, Baxter's chairman and chief executive, told the committee, ''We're alarmed that one of our products was used in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme to adulterate a life-saving medication.'' 
 Chinese officials have disputed the F.D.A. contention that the contaminant caused death and injury, and they have insisted on the right to inspect American drug plants if the F.D.A. insists on inspecting Chinese ones.
 David Nelson, a Congressional investigator, told the House panel that had the F.D.A. inspected the Chinese plant, the contamination could have been averted. 
 F.D.A. officials have admitted that they mistakenly failed to conduct an inspection of the Changzhou SPL plant but said that an inspection would not have been able to uncover the contamination.
 The agency finally conducted an inspection of the facility in February and found so many problems that the F.D.A. blocked the plant from exporting to the United States. Mr. Nelson was even more critical of Baxter International, which bought heparin ingredients from Changzhou SPL from 2004 through 2008 but did not inspect the facility until September 2007. 
 The company sent one person who spent one day in the plant, Mr. Nelson said. Five months later, the F.D.A. discovered myriad problems, he said.
 ''It really is impossible for a plant to have fallen that far out of compliance in five months,'' Mr. Nelson said.
 Under withering questioning, Dr. Woodcock said that the F.D.A. would need another $225 million annually to inspect every foreign drug plant every other year, the frequency most say is needed. The agency will spend $11 million this year on foreign drug inspections.
 There is a growing bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill that the F.D.A. needs a rapid increase in its budget to ensure the safety of the nation's drugs, medical devices and food. 
 The Bush Administration has proposed increasing the agency's budget next year by only 3 percent to $1.8 billion, not enough to cover even its expected cost increases.

HEADLINE: Easing the Pain at Airports

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY and HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
KAREN W. ELLIS, customer services manager at the airport in Atlanta, is used to getting a certain reaction when she describes her job.
 ''When I say I enjoy hearing passengers' problems or replying to their calls and e-mails, people say, Are you crazy?'' she said.
 You could hardly blame Ms. Ellis if she did go crazy, given the state of air travel these days. Yet there she was one morning, chipper as a camp counselor as she stood under the soaring neck of a 33-foot-long dinosaur skeleton (lent by a local museum) in the atrium of the bustling airport, which is undergoing a 10-year, $6 billion-plus renovation. 
 ''You get complaints,'' she said, glancing at the people trudging by. ''You give out information. You acknowledge to people the fact that they are there and you are here to help.'' It keeps Ms. Ellis and her team hopping. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International is the world's busiest airport, handling 994,000 flights and 89.3 million passengers last year, many of them anxious business travelers in a huge hurry. 
 Passengers are spending more time than ever in airports as delays, cancellations and other disruptions mount. While airlines have cut back even on normal services, some airports -- Hartsfield among them -- are trying to make life easier for travelers. A few are succeeding, becoming the bright spots in domestic air travel these days. 
 ''The airport is saying, I need to be accountable to my customers regardless of what carrier they're on,'' said Meara McLaughlin, vice president for business development at FlightStats.com, which provides statistics for airports and other clients.
 Enhanced customer service, like that practiced by Ms. Ellis, goes only so far. Airports have been adding amenities, too: more spas, massage centers, walk-in medical clinics, wine bars, lounges with showers, pet centers, art exhibitions, performances and free Wi-Fi. At Hartsfield, there are even places to buy stamps, mail a package and rent a cellphone.
 But at Atlanta and elsewhere, the more important changes are occurring in less glamorous arenas, as authorities work hard to streamline the time-consuming check-in and security process. 
 ''To me the biggest issue in Atlanta is getting through security,'' said Anne Genevieve Gallivan, an associate director for the Corporate Executive Board, who uses the airport about five times a month. ''It doesn't matter what time of day. It takes forever.''
 Hartsfield's managers have heard, loud and clear, complaints from passengers like Ms. Gallivan. The airport's new international terminal, which opens in 2011, will feature its own security checkpoint with nine lanes and six more for arriving international passengers making domestic connections. Meanwhile, the airport is adding four security lanes and updating screening equipment, all by summer's end. 
 Other domestic airports are also addressing security congestion. The new $1.3 billion American Airlines terminal at Kennedy Airport, which opened last summer, has eight CTX (explosive-detection device) luggage scanners, compared with six in the old terminal, and has integrated them into the underground baggage-handling system. That means that passengers no longer have to carry heavy bags to freestanding scanners. 
 ''We're able to process double the number of bags than we were before,'' said Chuck Imhof, vice president for passenger sales for greater New York for American Airlines. 
 The airline's premium members go through a private check-in line walled off with frosted glass, their paths laid out by red carpet. ''We wanted to create an oasis of sorts where our members would feel more special,'' Mr. Imhof said. 
 The new terminal was recently selected by the Transportation Security Administration to test millimeter-wave scanning, a whole-body imaging technology that is a quicker, more impersonal alternative to the pat-down technique currently used on passengers who have been selected for secondary screening. Elsewhere at Kennedy, JetBlue Airways is opening a new $750 million terminal this fall. They ''were very clear at the outset that they wanted to get passengers off the curb, through ticketing and through security as soon as possible,'' said William D. Hooper Jr., the project director and a managing director for Gensler, the architect firm that designed the terminal. Mr. Hooper chose a ''different proportioning'' of the main terminal's space, allotting more to the security process and less to ticketing counters. 
 ''We tried to centralize security as much as possible,'' Mr. Hooper said, explaining that design decisions involving security equipment came down to inches. ''The more you decentralize security, the greater the likelihood that you'll pick the wrong line.'' If you put X-rays and magnetometers close together, he added, ''by literally one to two inches, you'll end up with a security checkpoint that will slow the passengers down.'' JetBlue has also dedicated a zone with benches and a glowing blue wall, meant to calm hectic passengers, on the other side of its security check-in for ''putting yourself back together,'' as Mr. Hooper put it. ''This is one of the least understood places in the security process,'' he said. 
 At Hartsfield, the new international terminal will also ease the strain on its people mover rail system. Businesspeople like Ms. Gallivan dread rushing from one terminal to the next on the system to make a connection. 
 ''If I'm in heels and a suit and I'm trucking it, I typically just have to wait for it,'' Ms. Gallivan said. 
 Hartsfield is speeding up the people mover, which runs about every 105 seconds. By 2011, it will run every 90 seconds, and international passengers will no longer have to use it because they will have a dedicated terminal. 
 Ultimately, even a faster rail system cannot do much to help travelers who are subjected to long delays, flight cancellations and instances where packed airplanes sit on the tarmac for hours. William R. DeCota, director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said there would be no easy solution to these problems until airspace issues are resolved. 
 ''The capacity of the system to handle demand is only as good as the capacity of each individual link,'' he said. ''It's important to think about the airport infrastructure as more than just physical assets at the airport but also in terms of airspace.'' 
 Still, airports want to reduce stress not only for customers but also for workers. Tom Murphy, an aviation consultant, directs a worker-training program called the Aviation Resiliency Project, which is operating at Kennedy. 
 He developed the program after writing a book on how airport employees pulled together after the 2001 terrorist attacks. The book, ''Reclaiming the Sky: 9/11 and the Untold Story of the Men and Women Who Kept America Flying,'' said that airport employees ''have to have the skills to deal with these new problems that are arising -- congestion and delays and airplanes running full -- which will only get worse.'' 
 Domestic airports could gain by looking overseas, where air travel is prospering. Some of the international airports -- notably in parts of Asia -- have become models of efficiency in handling the increase in passengers. 
 One of the ''most-admired'' airports is Singapore Changi Airport, according to a 2007 survey compiled from 200,000 online passenger questionnaires sponsored partly by the Airports Council International, which representsmore than 870 airports. ''Everything is about speed at Changi,'' said Matthew Holden, vice president of PodAsia Traveller (podasia.net), a podcast that streams audio and video segments. ''There are people movers on all routes, high-speed lifts and a light rail between terminals,'' he said. ''Getting through metal detectors and X-rays is almost a pleasant experience,'' and the technology ''ensures that your bags are on the carousel before you get there.'' Layover at Changi? Mr. Holden raved about its gymnasium, movie theater and spaciousness. 
 But in the competition for better services, an airport can overreach, with dire consequences, as the operators of London Heathrow Airport's new $8.6 billion Terminal 5 and its sole tenant, British Airways, learned this spring.
 Praised as a landmark in airport innovation, the massive new terminal opened with great ceremony in late March, then promptly fell into chaos as baggage handling systems and customer service broke down. Tens of thousands of bags were misplaced, and more than 300 flights were canceled.
 British Airways apologized profusely and has said that operations are now smooth at the terminal. But analysts said that the debacle would cost British Airways at least $50 million. Britain's premier airline took a public relations beating that some said -- showing how important an airport's reputation can be -- reflected adversely on the nation itself.
 ''Terminal 5 is a farce that makes us the laughingstock of the world,'' concluded The Sun, the British tabloid.

HEADLINE: In China, Exporters Hedge Bets On Dollar

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Facing the double-barreled threat of a falling dollar and weakening American demand, some Chinese exporters are starting to ask European customers to pay in euros.
 Others are trying to increase domestic sales. This, in a nation whose economic juggernaut was built on exports.
 Drastic times call for drastic measures. The dollar's fall against China's currency has been accelerating -- it is down 4 percent so far this year, after dropping 7 percent last year. That has left businesses across China nursing losses and trying to figure out how to raise prices for overseas buyers, Chinese executives and sales representatives said in interviews here at the Canton Trade Fair. The fair runs through Wednesday. 
 Ma Lin Ping, the general manager of Taizhou City Qizhou Industry, said that his company had lost $43,000 on a single deal last year because of the dollar's tumble against China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi.
 The company agreed at the end of 2006 to send 16 shipping containers of collapsible wood houses for use in gardens and at the beach. When the company finally completed the deal at the start of this year, the payment was in dollars that had lost nearly a tenth of their value in yuan.
 Since the start of this year, ''I quote prices in euros to all my European clients,'' Mr. Ma said, adding that the company was also starting to make products for the Chinese market.
 Mr. Ma's company already sells 70 percent of its goods to Europe. Companies that sell mostly to the United States have not yet tried to set prices in euros. 
 Instead, Chen Mang, a manager at a musical instrument exporter, said his company now quoted dollar prices that were valid only for two or three months. That limits exposure to declines in the dollar over longer periods of time.
 Making matters worse for many Chinese companies, American buyers have become tough negotiators as the American economy has slowed. ''They're just extremely sensitive to any price adjustment I make,'' said Wang Ming Guang, a sales manager at a company that exports salt and pepper shakers and spice racks.
 Chinese exporters face a double blow as the dollars that they earn buy fewer yuan even as Chinese workers are demanding fairly sizable wage increases, at least in percentage terms.
 At the Jiangsu Easthigh Group Import and Export Company in Nanjing, workers' monthly wages have risen in the last year to 1,800 renminbi, or $257, from 1,600 renminbi, said Stephen King, a salesman. The company makes elaborately carved wooden chairs, vases and Buddha statues.
 The wage increase works out to 12.5 percent in renminbi terms, and nearly double that in dollar terms after the effects of the yuan's appreciation are included.
 Some European buyers have agreed to pay in euros, which protects them from the risk they previously took that the dollar would strengthen against the euro. But other European buyers have been so delighted with the fall in the dollar and the falling cost of dollar-denominated imports from China that they still insist on paying in dollars, said several Chinese exporters, who added that they had agreed to continue accepting dollars from these customers.
 The Chinese currency has been fairly stable against the euro over the last several years, even as the dollar has fallen to 7 yuan, from 8.28 yuan in the summer of 2005. European Union officials have been increasingly vocal in recent months in demanding that China allow the yuan to rise against the euro as well.
 China intervenes intensely in the currency markets to slow the rise of the yuan and preserve the competitiveness of Chinese goods in foreign markets. It has quintupled foreign reserves in the last five years, to $1.68 trillion last month.
 Despite the hesitancy of American buyers, several exporters said that they were passing on sizable price increases for shipments to the United States.
 Mr. Chen, the sales manager at a musical instrument company, the Shanghai Lansheng Grand Luck Import and Export Company, said his company had raised prices sharply -- by 10 percent over the last year to offset the fall of the dollar, and by an additional 5 percent to cover rising costs in China for labor and raw materials. 
 Other exporters cited similar increases, part of a broader pattern of rising prices for goods from Asia that has prompted some economists to warn that the United States was starting to import inflation from the region.
 SeaSunStar, a manufacturer of small fountains for the home and garden with their own recirculating water systems, sometimes needs many months to make special models. For deals closing at the end of this year, the company assumes the dollar will have fallen to 6.5 yuan, from 7 yuan now, said Charlie Xu, the sales manager.
 Quite a few Chinese exporters are concluding that the best way to minimize currency risk may be to turn inward and sell more at home. Mark Yuan, the president and chief artist of the Hefei Hande Artistic Lamps Factory, which makes stained-glass lamps and windows, began selling his products in China just a few months ago and has found that these sales already account for 20 percent of total revenue.
 ''In big cities there is demand; people are wealthier,'' Mr. Yuan said. ''We are gradually increasing our emphasis on the domestic market until we can forget about the export market, because the profit margins on exports are so thin.''

HEADLINE: A Team On the Rise Dismisses Dallas

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
In a city seeking revival, in an arena they were once forced to abandon, the New Orleans Hornets celebrated a rebirth Tuesday night, and set off a party that may not end until June.
 Chris Paul was magnificent, David West was steady and the crowd was electric as the Hornets won their first playoff series in six years with a 99-94 victory over the disintegrating Dallas Mavericks.
 Paul certified his superstar status with a triple-double -- 24 points, 15 assists and 11 rebounds -- and West scored 25 points to finish off a 4-1 series victory. For a young team that began the season with modest expectations, the Hornets' dismantling of Dallas served as a milestone. 
 As teal and yellow streamers fell from the rafters, the players exulted in the franchise's brightest moment since returning to the city for good in the fall. The team played most of the past two seasons in Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina damaged New Orleans Arena.
 ''Everything that we have done is all about this city,'' Paul said. ''It's about rebuilding the city of New Orleans.''
 The Hornets will play the winner of the Phoenix-San Antonio series in the Western Conference semifinals. As the No. 2 seed in the playoffs, the Hornets will have home-court advantage -- and may still be regarded as an underdog.
 It is a role they are used to, even if they do not exactly embrace it.
 ''We came into the postseason expecting to win,'' West said. ''A lot of people may be surprised at how this thing turned out, but we're not too surprised at where we're sitting now.''
 West and Paul overwhelmed their more veteran counterparts on the Mavericks throughout the series. Paul was too quick and too clever for Jason Kidd; West consistently beat Dirk Nowitzki, Erick Dampier and whoever else stood in his path.
 On Tuesday, with their season and perhaps their coach's job on the line, the Mavericks came up short. They never held a lead and trailed by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter before closing within 3 with 33.2 seconds left. Had the Mavericks grabbed a missed shot by Paul, they would have had a chance to tie the score. But Tyson Chandler tipped the ball back out to Jannero Pargo, sealing the outcome.
 Afterward, Mavericks Coach Avery Johnson lavishly praised Paul and Hornets Coach Byron Scott -- and in doing so seemed to take a slight dig at his own point guard, Kidd. Johnson called Paul ''a young Nate Archibald.''
 ''He's relentless, he's strong, he's intelligent, he has a bright future,'' Johnson said of Paul. ''He and his coach have great chemistry. And he seems like he's very coachable and he pretty much dominated us this series.''
 Paul averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 assists in the series. Kidd, who was supposed to be the missing piece to a championship team when Dallas acquired him in February, never made a major impact.
 Nowitzki led Dallas with 22 points and 13 rebounds Tuesday. Kidd had 14 points and 9 assists -- his best game of the week. The Mavericks were eliminated in the first round for the second straight year, which could cost Johnson his job.
 ''Um, I would hope not,'' Johnson said earlier in the day. ''I love what I'm doing, and I love the team.''
 The Mavericks spent much of the series embarrassing themselves with ill-advised comments, poor play and moments of stupefying behavior. Tuesday was no different. After Dallas cut the deficit to 8 points, Jerry Stackhouse was ejected with 1 minute 47 seconds left for smacking Paul in the ribs.
 Last week, Stackhouse insulted Scott during a radio program, and Josh Howard admitted to marijuana use in a separate radio interview. After Tuesday's loss, Nowitzki acknowledged that those incidents had been a distraction. It did not help that Howard and Stackhouse played poorly in the series.
 ''Obviously, it's very disappointing, what happened here in the playoffs with everything,'' Nowitzki said.
 The Mavericks fell behind by 15 in the second quarter, but pulled within 5 points in the third. The Hornets met every rally with a big shot or a big stop. Paul hit a runner and a 3-pointer late in the third, and West converted a 3-point play. And as the final seconds of the third quarter ticked away, Chandler rejected consecutive shots by Stackhouse.
 It was a day of contrasts and simmering conflict. Scott was given the coach of the year trophy while Kidd -- who was blamed for getting Scott fired in New Jersey -- politely clapped 50 feet away.
 ''He's well deserved for that award,'' Kidd had said earlier. ''He probably should have got it when he was in New Jersey.''
 The Hornets had their first double-digit lead late in the first quarter. Halftime arrived with the Hornets holding a 15-point lead, with Nowitzki laying on his back after losing a tussle for the ball, and with Mark Cuban, the Mavericks' owner, shouting at the officiating crew.

HEADLINE: Television Segment Helps CBS Beat Forecast

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The CBS Corporation said Tuesday that its profit rose 14 percent in the first quarter, mostly on the strength of its television business.
 CBS, which also owns a major radio broadcaster and the Simon & Schuster book publishing business, reported first-quarter income of $244.3 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $213.5 million, or 28 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 The company also increased its quarterly dividend to 27 cents a share, from 25 cents. 
 Revenue was flat at $3.65 billion in the first quarter compared with $3.66 billion a year ago, when CBS broadcast both the Super Bowl and the semifinals of the men's college basketball tournament. 
 On average, analysts had expected CBS to report a profit of 33 cents a share and revenue of $3.55 billion, according to Thomson Financial. 
 ''The solid financial performance of CBS Corporation, in spite of a challenging economic environment, demonstrates the enduring strength of its brands and world-class assets,'' the executive chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, said.
 Most of the earnings came from television, which took in $2.6 billion compared with $2.57 billion in the period a year earlier. Television profit rose 15 percent, to $402 million from $350 million, in part because of lower production costs during the strike by the Writers Guild of America.
 The 2008 first quarter also benefited from higher license fees, including those from distribution of the ''CSI'' crime series.
 The outdoor advertising division's revenue increased 7 percent, to $496.9 million from $462.3 million in the period a year ago.
 Radio, where revenue on a same-station basis decreased 6 percent, and publishing, where revenue fell 12 percent, remained weak spots. 
 CBS is in danger of losing its status as America's most-watched network to Fox. Most analysts project that when the current broadcast season ends in May, CBS will be in second place among the four major broadcast networks. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Redstone split his media empire into two publicly traded companies, CBS and Viacom. At first, in a surprise, CBS outperformed its corporate sibling, but that is no longer the case.
 The share price has declined at CBS, which relies more on advertising than its peers in the media industry; in mid-April the stock hit a 52-week low of $20.68.
 CBS shares closed Tuesday at $23.20, up 66 cents.
 Among the company's woes, its prime-time television schedule has been suffering from a lack of new hits, and its high-profile broadcast news division is languishing in third place behind NBC News and ABC News.
 In an effort to cut costs at the news division, CBS has held discussions with CNN about outsourcing some of its news-gathering capacity. 
 At the same time, Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, has had to contend with persistent speculation about the fate of Katie Couric, the anchor of ''CBS Evening News.'' Poor ratings have reportedly set off discussions about whether she would leave the anchor chair after the presidential election.
 For the week of April 21, ''CBS Evening News'' posted a record low in the ratings when an average of 5.34 million viewers tuned in. ''NBC Nightly News'' was No. 1 during the week, according to Nielsen Media Research, with 8.01 million viewers, followed by ABC's ''World News,'' with 7.79 million.
 Broadcast television is by far the largest segment of CBS's business, and the writers' strike, which ended in February, forced the network to show more reruns. 
 On Tuesday, CBS cited the strike and the absence of the Super Bowl and basketball broadcasts as contributing to a 15 percent decline in advertising revenue in the quarter. Those factors, the company said, were partly offset by increased political advertising.

HEADLINE: Against Odds, New Orleans Schools Fight Back

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
No road leads to George Washington Carver Senior High School here. It sits on no street and has no address. No sign announces it. 
 It is little more than a collection of prefabricated steel-and-wood classrooms floating in a no man's land by the highway, and its vague location and bootstrap atmosphere sum up the problems and promise of the big education experiment now under way in this city nearly three years after Hurricane Katrina. There is no gym and no auditorium at Carver, and at breaks the school's 350 students congregate on unshaded strips of concrete between the trailerlike boxes. 
 Carver's only context is ruin -- it sits across a field from the flooded-out pre-Katrina Carver High -- and yet it is trying all over again, with new teachers and new methods, at what largely failed before the storm and immediately afterward: educating its students. Carver High is hope's challenge to bleak circumstance. 
 And it is beginning to meet that challenge. Though there is disorder in many classrooms, there is also learning going on, amid the struggle. In an English class taught by Courtney Stuckwisch, the searing hard-times images of a Langston Hughes poem touch a chord, and the students look up eagerly. In Colleston Morgan's social studies class, students beetle earnestly over textbooks for a lesson on supply and demand.
 All around the city there is a similar would-be alchemy. Dozens of new charter schools, a flood of idealistic young teachers from elsewhere around the country -- now as many as 17 percent of the total here -- and a hard-charging reform superintendent from Chicago are all arrayed to rescue one of America's most needy student bodies, which ranked at the bottom of a bottom-dwelling state even before Hurricane Katrina. 
 Only in the last year, with the marshaling of new forces, has anything like a coherent poststorm strategy for the shaky schools here emerged. It is too early for results -- standardized-test scores are out in May -- but educators here insist that there are some promising signs. At the very least, early shortages of teachers and space for students have been overcome. 
 On one level the transformation has already been total. Even without concurrent transformations in the city's minimal economy and fragmentary social structure, the schools are being administered with a vigor that would have been unrecognizable here before the storm.
 If this experiment succeeds, it will have accomplished something rare in the annals of American schools; academic experts cannot recall any campaign this ''radical,'' in the words of one. An educational superstructure, assembled in large part from outside brains and muscle, has brought itself in to remake a group of students years behind, overwhelmingly impoverished and often from broken homes. By next year, this will be the largest Teach for America district in the nation, administrators say.
 Schools with names that reflect the largely African-American student body (Akili Academy, Sojourner Truth Academy) are now competing with one another for students, clamoring for recruits by way of signs on the grassy medians of this city's broad avenues. Veteran school principals, used to the slumbering ways of the old system, are removed quickly if they do not measure up. 
 ''There's a recognition that it matters who's in the building,'' said Sarah Usdin, founder of a nonprofit here, New Schools for New Orleans, which is playing a leading role in formulating policy. ''They have to perform.'' 
 Citizen-run boards have suddenly been thrust into managing individual schools all over the city. Neophyte teachers barely out of college instruct students sometimes older than they are. A wide range of teaching styles has been employed, from the rotelike call-and-response methods of the KIPP (Knowledge Is Power Program) Foundation school to more traditional textbook-based approaches. For the first time, parents are being asked to choose schools for their children (though in many cases the parents are absent, and the student is being raised by relatives).
 Success will be a tall order in a school district where 85 percent of some 32,000 students are a year and a half to two years below their grade level. In a typical district, the figure would be around 15 percent, said Paul G. Vallas, the new superintendent here.
 Worse, a third of the students here are some four years below grade level, a challenge that Mr. Vallas, a veteran of the Chicago and Philadelphia schools, calls ''extreme.''
 Yet nearly a year into the job, Mr. Vallas professes to be unfazed. With no politics in his way -- he answers neither to the neutered parish school board nor to the mayor, but to the state -- he is far freer to plan grand schemes than in the much larger cities where he made his mark. 
 ''I don't burn out,'' he boasts. ''I burn other people out.''
 His vision is a broad one, with dreams of new campuses around the city. There are extended days in school to keep students off the streets and at the books, themed academies oriented toward the arts or civil rights, ''transition schools'' for the 17-year-old eighth graders reading at a third-grade level.
 The contrast between the dream and the current reality is substantial. For instance, Mr. Vallas reckons that his plan to reconstruct the ramshackle school facilities here will cost some $1.3 billion, of which only half is in sight. Yet before Katrina, perhaps the cruelest among many deficiencies in the school district were a lack of ambition and a widely acknowledged acquiescence to failure. 
 Now school administrators will be unable to ''just hide within this large urban behemoth and never have to change,'' Ms. Usdin said. ''There's more change now than there ever has been before.''
 From one classroom to another, from disorder to calm, Carver High illustrates the current challenges. In two English classes, Ms. Stuckwisch's juniors and seniors are quiet and sometimes attentive; Curtis Sherrod's freshmen -- some 17 or 18 -- are another story. 
 ''If I was not a nondrinker, it would be a four- or five-beer night every night,'' said Mr. Sherrod, a bearded, ponytailed Navy veteran, looking out with exasperation over his remedial reading and writing class. One student was slumped over a desk, immobilized in sleep. Four others were chattering and twirling their hair. Nearly half the class had not bothered to show up. From time to time, the teacher vainly called his charges to order. 
 Still, to the side a handful were diligently seated at computers, ignoring the near chaos to focus on an intensive catch-up reading and writing program. It requires students to spell words or read passages, then quickly corrects their errors while scoring them. 
 Usually a kind of extreme measure, here that reading program is ''almost a foundation of the general curriculum,'' with large majorities of students enrolled, Mr. Vallas said.
 Mr. Sherrod's class has made improvements in reading since the start of the school year, but the hurdles are real nonetheless.
 ''Most of the kids come from broken homes,'' he said. ''Their parents are dead, in jail or on drugs. You can tell the kids from two-parent homes. They're getting straight A's, and they are respectful.''
 They are a minority, though. ''The kids, for most of them, it's no more than a social dating scene,'' Mr. Sherrod said. ''They don't care about the work.''
 It is a relationship on pins and needles, this interplay between the young teachers -- 75 percent at the school are under 30 -- and their close-in-age students, and all the difficulties in educating a group toughened by social and physical hurricanes is summed up in it. A student cursed Ms. Stuckwisch last week -- ''I was pretty upset'' -- and she sent him to the office. 
 The principal, Vanessa Eugene, praises her young staff's energy and enthusiasm, so essential as an antidote to the cynicism that many say was the norm before the storm. 
 Yet the new energy comes with a cost. Ms. Eugene has had to emphasize to the teachers ''not being a friend.''
 ''You're here to educate,'' she said. ''You have to be willing to impose discipline. Some of the teachers have not been willing to confront.'' 
 One of the young recruits, overcome, has already quit. 
 But with the school year coming to a close, some of the lessons have clearly sunk in, among teachers and students as well. 
 ''I like the teachers, how they run things around here,'' said McArthur Parker, a 15-year-old freshman, only seven years younger than the teacher he was playfully visiting with, a Harvard graduate named Colleston Morgan. 
 ''Strict, keep people in line,'' said McArthur, who lives with his mother and does not know where his father is. ''Because if you don't have order, you don't have nothing.''

HEADLINE: Cost and Shortages Threaten Farmers' Crucial Tool: Fertilizer

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and ANDREW MARTIN; Keith Bradsher reported from Vietnam and did additional reporting from Hong Kong. Andrew Martin reported from New York and Iowa.

DATELINE: XUAN CANH, Vietnam 

 BODY:
Truong Thi Nha stands just four and a half feet tall. Her three grown children tower over her, just as many young people in this village outside Hanoi dwarf their parents.
 The biggest reason the children are so robust: fertilizer.
 Ms. Nha, her face weathered beyond its 51 years, said her growth was stunted by a childhood of hunger and malnutrition. Just a few decades ago, crop yields here were far lower and diets much worse.
 Then the widespread use of inexpensive chemical fertilizer, coupled with market reforms, helped power an agricultural explosion here that had already occurred in other parts of the world. Yields of rice and corn rose, and diets grew richer.
 Now those gains are threatened in many countries by spot shortages and soaring prices for fertilizer, the most essential ingredient of modern agriculture. 
 Some kinds of fertilizer have nearly tripled in price in the last year, keeping farmers from buying all they need. That is one of many factors contributing to a rise in food prices that, according to the United Nations' World Food Program, threatens to push tens of millions of poor people into malnutrition. 
 Protests over high food prices have erupted across the developing world, and the stability of governments from Senegal to the Philippines is threatened. 
 In the United States, farmers in Iowa eager to replenish nutrients in the soil have increased the age-old practice of spreading hog manure on fields. In India, the cost of subsidizing fertilizer for farmers has soared, leading to political dispute. And in Africa, plans to stave off hunger by increasing crop yields are suddenly in jeopardy. 
 The squeeze on the supply of fertilizer has been building for roughly five years. Rising demand for food and biofuels prompted farmers everywhere to plant more crops. As demand grew, the fertilizer mines and factories of the world proved unable to keep up. 
 Some dealers in the Midwest ran out of fertilizer last fall, and they continue to restrict sales this spring because of a limited supply.
 ''If you want 10,000 tons, they'll sell you 5,000 today, maybe 3,000,'' said W. Scott Tinsman Jr., a fertilizer dealer in Davenport, Iowa. ''The rubber band is stretched really far.''
 Fertilizer companies are confident the shortage will be solved eventually, noting that they plan to build scores of new factories. But that will probably create fresh problems in the long run as the world grows more dependent on fossil fuels to produce chemical fertilizers. Intensified use of such fertilizers is certain to mean greater pollution of waterways, too. 
 Agriculture and development experts say the world has few alternatives to its growing dependence on fertilizer. As population increases and a rising global middle class demands more food, fertilizer is among the most effective strategies to increase crop yields. 
 ''Putting fertilizer on the ground on a one-acre plot can, in typical cases, raise an extra ton of output,'' said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who has focused on eradicating poverty. ''That's the difference between life and death.''
 The demand for fertilizer has been driven by a confluence of events, including population growth, shrinking world grain stocks and the appetite for corn and palm oil to make biofuel. But experts say the biggest factor has been the growing demand for food, especially meat, in the developing world.
 Recently, Ms. Nha, the tiny Vietnamese woman, stood in a field outside her village, her weather-beaten face shielded from the drizzle by a big straw hat. She took a break from wielding her wood-handled hoe and described the meager diets of her youth.
 Her family, including six brothers and sisters, struggled to survive on rations from the commune where they lived, eating little protein. The occasional pigs they raised on rice stalks and mush ''fattened very slowly,'' Ms. Nha recalled.
 But with market reforms, better seeds and increased fertilizer use, Vietnam's rice yields per acre have doubled and corn yields have tripled, allowing farmers to fatten a growing herd of livestock.
 Several times a season, Ms. Nha and her neighbors walk down their rows of corn with battered metal buckets full of chemical fertilizer, which looks like coarse gray sand, sprinkling a bit at the base of each plant. Ms. Nha's husband, Le Van Son, remembers villagers' amazement in the 1990s when they learned that a pound of chemical fertilizer contained more of the major nutrients than 100 pounds of manure. 
 Overall global consumption of fertilizer increased by an estimated 31 percent from 1996 to 2008, driven by a 56 percent increase in developing countries, according to the International Fertilizer Industry Association.
 ''Markets are asking farmers to step on the accelerator,'' said Michael R. Rahm, vice president for market analysis and strategic planning at Mosaic, a fertilizer producer in Plymouth, Minn. ''They've pressed on it, but the market has told them to step on it harder.''
 Fertilizer is plant food, a combination of nutrients added to soil to help plants grow. The three most important are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The latter two have long been available. But nitrogen in a form that plants can absorb is scarce, and the lack of it led to low crop yields for centuries. 
 That limitation ended in the early 20th century with the invention of a procedure, now primarily fueled by natural gas, that draws chemically inert nitrogen from the air and converts it into a usable form. 
 As the use of such fertilizer spread, it was accompanied by improved plant varieties and greater mechanization. From 1900 to 2000, worldwide food production jumped by 600 percent. Scientists said that increase was the fundamental reason world population was able to rise to about 6.7 billion today from 1.7 billion in 1900.
 Vaclav Smil, a professor at the University of Manitoba, calculates that without nitrogen fertilizer, there would be insufficient food for 40 percent of the world's population, at least based on today's diets.
 Initially, much of the increased production of fertilizer went to grains like wheat and rice that served as the foundation of a basic diet. But recently, with world economic growth at a brisk 5 percent a year, hundreds of millions of people began earning enough money to buy more meat from animals fattened with grains. That occurred at the same time that rising production of biofuels, like ethanol, put new pressure on grain supplies.
 These factors translated into rising fertilizer demand. Prices at a terminal in Tampa, Fla., for one fertilizer, diammonium phosphate, jumped to $1,102 a ton from $393 a ton in the last year, according to JPMorgan Securities, which tracks the prices. Urea, a type of granular nitrogen fertilizer, jumped to $505 a ton from $273 a ton in the last year. 
 Manufacturers are scrambling to increase supply. At least 50 plants to make nitrogen fertilizer are under construction, many in the Middle East where natural gas is abundant, and phosphorous and potassium mines are being expanded. But these projects are expensive and time-consuming, and supplies are expected to remain tight for years.
 Fertilizer is vitally important in Iowa, whose farmers grow more corn than in any other state and depend on fertilizer to increase yields.
 But the combination of high prices and spot shortages has forced some farmers to revert to older methods of fertilization, making hog manure a hot commodity. Farmers are cutting deals to have hog barns built on the edges of their corn and soybean fields.
 On a tour of his rolling farm in Oxford Junction in eastern Iowa, Jayson Willimack pointed to the future sites of two buildings that will hold 2,400 hogs. Their manure will eventually replace commercial fertilizer on 400 acres, about 10 percent of his farm, and save him perhaps $50,000 annually. ''Every little bit helps,'' he said.
 Such a strategy has severe limits -- manure contains so little nitrogen that tons are required on each acre. That means farmers in Iowa and abroad have little choice but to pay the higher prices for commercial fertilizer. 
 In many countries, those cost increases have so far been offset by record high prices for crops. But fertilizer inflation has created a crisis in countries that subsidize fertilizer use for farmers. In India, for instance, the government's subsidy bill could be as high as $22 billion in the coming year, up from $4 billion in 2004-5.
 Once new supplies become available, the rising use of fertilizer will still pose difficulties.
 Environmental groups fear increased use, particularly of nitrogen fertilizer made using fossil fuels. Because plants do not absorb all the nitrogen, much of it leaches into streams and groundwater. That runoff has long been recognized as a major pollution problem, and it is growing.
 A barometer of the pollution is the rising number of dead zones where rivers meet the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, for instance, nitrogen runoff from fields in the Corn Belt washes downstream and feeds plant life in the gulf. The algae blooms suck oxygen from the water, killing other marine life.
 More than 400 dead zones have been identified, from the coasts of China to the Chesapeake Bay, and the primary reason is agricultural runoff, said Robert J. Diaz, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
 ''Nitrogen is nitrogen,'' Professor Diaz said. ''If it's on land, it produces corn. If it gets in the water, it produces algae.''
 This month, a United Nations panel called for changes in agricultural practices to make them less damaging. The panel recommended techniques that offer some of the same benefits as chemical fertilizer, like increased crop rotation with legumes that naturally add some nitrogen to the soil.
 But others say those approaches, while helpful, will be not be enough to meet the world's rapidly rising demand for food and biofuel.
 ''This is a basic problem, to feed 6.6 billion people,'' said Norman Borlaug, an American scientist who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his role in spreading intensive agricultural practices to poor countries. ''Without chemical fertilizer, forget it. The game is over.''

HEADLINE: Silk, Spices, Gold and Destiny: Global History Is Part of the Bargain

A SPLENDID EXCHANGE 
 How Trade Shaped the World 
 By William J. Bernstein 
 467 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $30. 
 In 2006 the world's countries exported $11.8 trillion in goods and services, far above the gross domestic product of any single country except the United States, which itself exported over $1 trillion worth. World trade has nearly doubled in less than a decade, and its increase since World War II is simply staggering. 
 The world is knit together as never before with a cat's cradle of trade, which has already had immense consequences and will have many more. But while global trade has been much in the news lately, especially during this election year, it has an extremely long history. As William J. Bernstein makes clear in his entertaining and greatly enlightening book ''A Splendid Exchange,'' it has been a major force in driving the whole history of humankind. 
 Adam Smith explained in ''The Wealth of Nations'' that humans, and humans alone, are endowed with ''a propensity to truck, barter and exchange one thing for another.'' Equally important, skills and talents are not evenly distributed across the human landscape, nor are the world's resources equally distributed across the natural one. Since humans also have a propensity to bash in one another's skulls, we have always traded for what we wanted or raided for it. Mr. Bernstein's book is a history of the first option, a refreshing view, to say the least.
 Ancient Mesopotamia was richly endowed with fertile soils and water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, but it lacked stone and wood for building, and metals like copper for tools and weapons. The Sumerians, however, had surplus food to trade, so they could bargain for stone from near the headwaters of the rivers, wood from what is now Lebanon and metal from Sinai, Cyprus and elsewhere.
 The scope of ancient trade was immense. A single Bronze Age shipwreck around 1350 B.C. near Bodrum, a Turkish coastal town, yielded no less than 10 tons of copper and a ton of tin ingots along with other merchandise like ivory. (The ideal ratio of copper to tin for making bronze is 10 to 1.) 
 By Roman times vast armadas ferried Egyptian grain, Greek wine, Spanish copper and silver, and a hundred other commodities around the Mediterranean. India has yielded rich troves of Roman coins that reached that subcontinent to pay for spices the Romans coveted, especially pepper. Chinese silk -- literally worth its weight in gold -- traveled through the heart of Asia on the Silk Road to reach markets in the West.
 As the West collapsed at the end of antiquity, so did its long-distance trade. Few Roman coins dating later than A.D. 180 are found in India, as the Roman economy began to run out of gold and silver. The Arabs came to dominate the major trade routes of the Indian Ocean after the rise of Islam. And as Western Europe revived economically, a lively trade developed between rising powers in Venice and the Middle East. (Venice supplied slaves from the Crimea and Caucasus in exchange for spices and sugar.)
 When the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople slammed shut the sea route to the Crimea, Europe began seeking other routes to reach the resources of the East and eliminate the middleman. Columbus sailed west in 1492 and stumbled onto the New World. Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498, having rounded the southern tip of Africa. The modern world began, thanks to trade.
 The history of global trade is so long and so vast that Mr. Bernstein could have easily produced a toe-breaker of a book. Happily he has not. By treating many aspects thematically rather than strictly chronologically, he shows in fewer than 400 pages of readable type how people and nations have faced the same problems over and over and often solved them the same way.
 The poor soil and scant rain of ancient Greece, for instance, meant that the terrain's ability to grow grain was limited, but grape vines and olive trees grew in abundance. To export its wine and olive oil, Athens developed a pottery industry to supply the jars in which those products were transported. As Greek trade, and colonies, flourished across the length and breadth of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, naval power was needed to suppress piracy. To control choke points like the Dardanelles and Bosporus, which led to the rich grain lands of what is now Ukraine, the Athenian empire developed. 
 This succession of trade, colonies, naval power and empire repeated itself with the Venetians and Genoese, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British. Even the strategic bottlenecks have stayed the same: Suez; the Strait of Hormuz leading to the Persian Gulf; the Strait of Malacca leading to East Asia; the Bosporus and Dardanelles. Only now, instead of slaves and spices flowing through them, it is oil. 
 Mr. Bernstein is a fine writer and knows how to tell a great story well. And he has many in this book, from Francis Drake's voyage around the world (which repaid its backers, including Queen Elizabeth I, $:50 for every one invested) to the Black Death that remorselessly followed the trade routes as it worked its devastating way through Europe and the Middle East. But he never loses sight of his overall goal: to show how trade shaped the world in the past and will shape the world in the future, whether we like it or not.
 ''A Splendid Exchange'' is a splendid book.

HEADLINE: Montana Museum Board Breached Duty, Court Says

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM and JIM ROBBINS

 BODY:
The Montana Supreme Court dismissed on Tuesday the board of the Charles M. Bair Family Museum in Martinsdale, Mont., saying it breached its fiduciary duties by closing the museum in 2002.
 The court said the board had not spent enough money to give a good start to the museum -- home to an eclectic collection of fine European antiques, valuable art works and priceless Indian artifacts. It ordered U.S. Bank, the trustee, to create a new board that has to meet within six months.
 ''As a result of the board's failure to spend 'whatever principal and income of the Charles M. Bair Family Trust that is necessary to improve and maintain the museum,' the museum never received a fair opportunity to succeed; the museum was destined for failure rather than success,'' the court wrote in its opinion, quoting the trust document. ''The board's ensuing breaches emanated from this initial failure.'' 
 U.S. Bank had not seen the ruling and had no comment, said a spokesman, Steve Dale. It controlled four of the five seats on the trust's board of advisers, which oversaw the museum.
 The case has been widely watched in the nonprofit world and among state regulators of charities. The regulators are often responsible for interpreting and defending donors' intentions long after their deaths and in the face of strong opposition from powerful boards. Thirteen states filed amicus briefs in support of the Montana attorney general.
 ''It's great news,'' said the attorney general, Mike McGrath. ''The Montana Supreme Court said the board does not have unfettered discretion.''
 The case was brought by a community group, the Friends of the Bair Museum, whose members were overjoyed. 
 ''The little guy won,'' said Jamie Doggett, chairwoman of the group. ''The court realized that this was Alberta's first and foremost desire to have the museum in her home in Martinsdale in memory of her father.''
 Alberta is Alberta M. Bair, the strong-willed, quirky heiress who favored red hats and vodka and established the trust that had financed the museum. She died in 1993, leaving the fortune her father had amassed in minerals, finance and sheep.
 The trust created on her death stated that it was her ''cherished aim and foremost desire'' to establish a museum in the Bair family house, where she and her sister, Marguerite, had gathered their collection. She directed the board to spend whatever necessary from the trust's principal and interest to maintain the museum and buy property, if needed.
 She also gave the board the option of closing the museum after five years. The board members said that attendance had declined, that the house was ill suited to be a museum and that it lacked adequate security and protection against fire as the collection was increasing in value. From 2002 to 2005, the value of just the art collection increased 40 percent, to $6.7 million.
 Some of the most valuable pieces were moved to other institutions at the board's discretion, reducing the attraction, and the court did not order their return. Mr. McGrath said he expected an accord with the new board.
 Ms. Doggett said reopening the museum would be a boon to the Martindale economy. ''People stop and look at a museum,'' she said. ''Not just a display on the wall, but to go into someone's home and see how they lived.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 5, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about a court ruling that dismissed the board of a Montana museum misspelled the surname of the man for whom the museum is named. As the article correctly noted, he is Charles M. Bair, not Blair. 
An article on Wednesday about the Charles M. Bair Family Museum in Martinsdale, Mont., may have left an incorrect impression about the amount of time the museum had been closed. The museum, which is open only during the summer, was closed from 2002 through 2005 and was open in the summer of 2006 and 2007. The article may have implied it had been closed entirely since 2002.

HEADLINE: Confidence Falls as Home Prices Decline

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Americans' confidence in the economy plunged again this month, and their homes lost value at the fastest rate in two decades, according to two reports released on Tuesday.
 The data ratcheted up pressure on the Federal Reserve to take further steps to stave off a prolonged slowdown, even as inflation remains a threat. The central bank is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point when it concludes its policy-setting meeting on Wednesday. 
 Most economists said the consumer confidence and housing reports were consistent with a recession, although some maintain that the economy is growing, albeit at a very slow pace. In a news conference on Tuesday, President Bush sided with the optimists although he said the economy was facing ''a tough time.'' 
 In the 12 months ended in February, the S.& P./Case-Shiller home price index, which measures the value of single-family homes in 10 major metropolitan regions, fell 13.6 percent, the biggest decline since records began in 1987. 
 The slump in home prices was more severe than at the deepest point of the recession of the 1990s, which was the last time values fell so far so quickly. 
 A broader 20-city index dropped 12.7 percent. Prices are nearly 15 percent off their high in July 2006. 
 As foreclosures rise and mortgage lenders tighten their standards for loans, the market is expected to continue to feel the pressure of large inventories and a dearth of qualified buyers, economists said. 
 ''This is not, alas, a fluke,'' Ian Shepherdson, a London-based economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients. ''The monthly declines have been accelerating steadily over the past year and this just marks another step on the way.''
 The slump has hurt manufacturers, construction firms and other businesses that depend on the housing industry, forcing layoffs in some companies. It also lies at the root of the credit crisis on Wall Street, where banks were left holding investments linked to mortgages that defaulted or were downgraded.
 The problems are likely to weigh heavily on the nation's overall economic growth in the first three months of 2008. Many economists think the economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter; some predict it contracted. The government will release its first-quarter growth estimate on Wednesday. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
 The fall in home prices has also cut into Americans' home equity and forced some homeowners to grapple with mortgages for more money than their houses are worth. The problems have contributed to a deepening gloom, reinforced on Tuesday by the grim confidence survey released by the Conference Board.
 The private report, which polled up to 5,000 households in April, showed Americans' confidence in the economy fell to its lowest point since March 2003, at the start of the invasion of Iraq. The respondents also felt worse about the economy's future prospects than at any time since the mid-1970s, and many were bracing for job losses.
 At just over 15 percent, the number of respondents who said they expected their income to increase in the next six months was the lowest reading since the survey began 41 years ago.
 A depressed consumer is likely to spend less, which will also suppress overall growth. ''With house prices falling, wages failing to keep pace with inflation and job worries growing, we suspect that both confidence and spending will remain under downward pressure,'' wrote James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, in a research note.
 The effects of the housing slump were spread more or less evenly across the country. All 20 regions included in the Case-Shiller index recorded price declines during February, with Western cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego showing the steepest drops. 
 Compared with February of last year, only the Charlotte, N.C., region showed a price increase. 
 Single-family homes in Las Vegas, Miami and Phoenix lost more than a fifth of their value over that period, according to the report, which is released by the Standard & Poor's ratings firm.
 Home values in the New York City area fell 1.2 percent in February and were down 6.6 percent compared with February 2007. Homes in Washington suffered a 13 percent year-over-year decline. In both Boston and Atlanta, home prices fell about 5 percent in 12 months.
 David M. Blitzer, who oversees the index, said the prices would most likely keep falling. ''There is no sign of a bottom in the numbers,'' he said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Private Jets Are Flying Higher

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
 DEFYING the sagging economy, the business-jet market is performing better than ever. That is partly because domestic commercial airlines are performing worse than ever, especially in terms of customer service in the air and on the ground.
 ''I will do anything to avoid airports or being wedged into a seat on an airline with no food,'' said Cheryl Tiegs, who has been flying for business on all sorts of commercial and private planes since she began appearing as a model in the mid-1960s. Ms. Tiegs, who lives in Los Angeles and flies almost weekly, does not own a jet. But her work -- she owns a skin-care and beauty products company and does corporate-sponsored appearances -- sometimes allows her to travel by private jet.
 While Ms. Tiegs usually flies commercially, if business-jet transportation is available she will ''hop right on board,'' she said. ''If not, I'll drive if I can. I've even looked into taking a train halfway across the country.'' 
 The business-jet market may well slow as the economy weakens further, but industry analysts say there is no sign yet of its decline. According to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, a record 1,138 business jets were delivered in 2007, compared with 886 in 2006.
 Passengers can fly on jets in many categories, from small-capacity light cabins to midsize and supermidsize cabins to so-called heavy-metal jets. The private-jet market has experienced ''little discernible effect'' from the current economy, said Rob Wilson, president for business aviation at Honeywell Aerospace. 
 Honeywell predicts that with manufacturers' backlogs exceeding two and a half years, this will be another record year for deliveries, and that sales of 14,000 new business jets from 2007 through 2017 will exceed $233 billion.
 The business-jet market is heavily segmented, with the most visible users being corporate and private owners, and those who buy shares in jets for an annual number of on-demand flight hours. 
 But in recent years, sales have been helped by companies that guarantee a specific number of annual flight hours without ownership requirements, and by a rapidly growing market in charter flights.
 The business-jet market faces challenges, among them mounting congestion at general aviation airports that cater to big markets. The airline industry is also campaigning to mark business jets as contributors to congestion and therefore delays.
 Meanwhile, a new segment of the market has emerged around new very light jets, also known as microjets, which are compact, short-range, four- to six-seat aircraft priced at the lowest end of the market. The Federal Aviation Administration has estimated that as many as 4,000 may be in the skies by 2015.
 And the parsing of the market continues. Last week, a group headed by Alex Wilcox, who was a founding executive at JetBlue, announced the start-up of a private-jet company called JetSuite, which has ordered 50 new Embraer Phenom 100 very light jets with options to order 50 more. 
 The company's business plan is based on its partners' buying the jets and allowing them to be used part time by JetSuite for charter flights, starting next year in Southern California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, Mr. Wilcox said.
 The lower cost and fuel efficiency of using the Phenom 100s will halve the cost of chartering a small jet to about $3,500 an hour from the typical $7,000, he said. The price is comparable to flying first class on commercial airlines' regional routes in the Southwest -- with a big difference in time saved and other conveniences, like the use of small, conveniently located airports, he added. 
 ''If you're traveling with three or four people who would otherwise have flown domestic first class, and you want to go on your own schedule, we'll be in the same ballpark,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A New Wave Of Vilifying Short Sellers

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
In the days when square-rigged galleons plied the spice route to the East, the Dutch outlawed a band of rebels that they feared might plunder their new-found riches. 
 The troublemakers were neither Barbary pirates nor Spanish spies -- they were certain traders on the stock exchange in Amsterdam. Their offense: shorting the shares of the Dutch East India Company, purportedly the first company in the world to issue stock. 
 Short sellers, who sell assets like stocks in the hope that the price will fall, have been reviled ever since. England banned them for much of the 18th and 19th centuries. Napoleon deemed them enemies of the state. And Germany's last kaiser enlisted them to attack American markets (or so some Americans feared). 
 Now short sellers are drawing fire once again, this time from some unexpected quarters. Across the world, these market bears are being accused of spreading rumors, persecuting companies and unsettling entire economies. Even on Wall Street, where money is seen as the ultimate measure of success, some wonder whether the shorts have gone too far. 
 Some Wall Street executives question whether unscrupulous short sellers caused the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns this year. Others complain that shorts have been telling lies about other major firms in an attempt to sink stock prices. 
 The uproar has drawn the attention of Washington. ''This goes beyond rumors,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd said at a recent Senate hearing about Bear Stearns. ''This is about collusion.''
 Short sellers dismiss the idea that they killed off Bear Stearns. They say they often get the blame when things go wrong in the markets. 
 ''Show me the evidence,'' said James S. Chanos, one of Wall Street's most prominent short sellers. ''It's always easier to blame someone else, some unnamed market force than the people responsible.''
 Whatever the case, short sellers are coming under scrutiny. British regulators are looking into rumor mongering in London, Europe's financial hub. The Financial Services Authority there recently took the unusual step of announcing that it would investigate how scuttlebutt spreads through the city. The regulator made it clear that it would cast a wide net to snare those who start what Sally Dewar, an F.S.A. managing director, called ''completely unfounded rumors.''
 Market watchdogs in Iceland, meantime, are looking into whether short sellers are behind a plunge in that tiny nation's currency, the krona, which has lost a quarter of its value this year. Their counterparts in Ireland have started investigations into short selling and market rumors, too. 
 And in the United States, concern about short sellers' growing power gained new urgency last week when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused a former trader of spreading rumors about a big takeover and then profiting from the ploy. 
 Granted, most kinds of short selling are perfectly legal. To sell short, traders typically borrow assets like stocks and sell them. If the price falls, the trader buys back the shares at a lower price and profits from the difference. Short sellers have always been viewed with suspicion because their style of trading seems to run counter to the essential optimism of the markets. After all, they win when other investors lose. 
 Short selling is drawing a lot of attention partly because it has become so prevalent. On the New York Stock Exchange, short selling is running near record levels. Just over 4 percent of all the shares on the Big Board were sold short as of March. 
 That figure, however, excludes many rapid trades made every day. Market makers, for example, often go short to ensure customers' orders are filled quickly. And most hedge funds take short positions to offset their other bets in the markets. So, in all, short selling probably accounts for a quarter or more of all trading. 
 But another reason that shorts are drawing fire is that hedge funds that specialize in this kind of trading are making money -- lots of it -- at a time many other investors are losing. On average, short funds returned 7.43 percent during the first three months of this year, according to Hedge Fund Research, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell almost 10 percent. And one hedge fund manager, John Paulson, made a staggering $3.7 billion last year by betting against subprime mortgages and the companies that make such home loans. 
 Many Wall Streeters have long argued that short selling is healthy for the markets. The practice tempers investors' exuberance and helps market participants value securities properly. In the past few years, shorts warned about the troubles brewing at Enron and Tyco and also uncovered financial shenanigans at many small companies. As the financier Bernard M. Baruch once said, ''A market without bears would be like a nation without a free press.''
 Owen A. Lamont, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management, studied a group of companies that battled with short sellers and found that those companies' share prices fell 42 percent on average over the next three years, suggesting their share prices were inflated, just as the shorts had claimed. 
 ''When there is a big decline in the market, short sellers are often blamed,'' said Mr. Lamont, who is also a money manager at DKR Capital Partners, a hedge fund. 
 Shorts certainly were criticized when Bear Stearns collapsed in March after what was essentially a bank run. Speculation about a cash shortage drove Bear stock down almost 60 percent in a few days, a decline that coincided with a surge in short bets against the firm's stock. Alan D. Schwartz, the chief executive of Bear, later said that malicious rumors helped fuel the panic. 
 Other Wall Street banks have also been buffeted by short sellers this year. Shares of Lehman Brothers fell almost 40 percent the day before that investment bank reported earnings in March. ''We are suspicious that the rumors are being promulgated by short sellers of our stock that have an economic self-interest,'' a Lehman spokeswoman said at the time. 
 But Wall Street deals in rumors all the time. For regulators, the challenge is proving that short sellers tried to profit by spreading false information. 
 The complaint filed last week by the S.E.C. provides a rare glimpse into the Wall Street rumor machine. The commission said Paul S. Berliner, a trader for the New York trading firm Schottenfeld Group, used instant messages to spread rumors that the Blackstone Group was considering lowering its price for Alliance Data Systems, which it had agreed to acquire for about $6.4 billion last year. 
 ''Hearing the board is now meeting on a revised proposal,'' Mr. Berliner wrote shortly after 1 p.m. on Nov. 29. ''Blackstone is negotiating a lower price.'' 
 Mr. Berliner then began selling short 10,000 shares of Alliance Data, the S.E.C. said. As the stock fell, he turned a profit of $25,000 within 10 minutes on his short positions.

HEADLINE: Putting the Rental Cars Farther Out to Cut Congestion

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
IF you have ever rented a car at an airport you might understand what it is like to be caught in traffic trying to return the vehicle with your departure time looming.
 Over the last decade, airports have tried to alleviate traffic congestion by consolidating rental-car companies into remote sites served by buses or people movers. Kansas City, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Phoenix Sky Harbor and Ted Stevens Anchorage international airports have recently opened consolidated sites. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International is building a site scheduled to open late next year, part of a 10-year development program budgeted at more than $6 billion. The $590 million center will include 10 rental-car companies and 8,700 parking spaces. 
 ''We'll have a first-rate facility,'' said Daniel J. Molloy, assistant general manager for capital development at Hartsfield-Jackson, who said that congestion, growing rental-car use and lack of land immediately surrounding the airport had contributed to the decision to build the 70-acre rental-car center a mile away. It will have two parking decks and a common space for the rental-company counters. An elevated rail will connect to the terminal. 
 ''Proximity is what makes a successful consolidated facility,'' said Simon Ellis, vice president for global real estate and concessions for Hertz. He cited the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood complex as a good example. ''It's practically within the terminal complex,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''If it's feasible to develop a facility right outside the terminal to eliminate busing, that's the best of both worlds.'' But finding enough land adjacent to the airports in rapidly sprawling cities like Atlanta and Las Vegas can be difficult. 
 Last year, McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas opened its rental site three miles from the airport. Less traffic congestion more than compensates for the site's distance, said Randall H. Walker, director of aviation for Clark County, Nev. ''We've moved about six million vehicles off the airport roadway system with the facility,'' he said. 
 Before, the rental companies had been about a mile from the airport, each providing its own shuttle bus. ''One bus would pick up five people, another bus would pick up eight people -- it just wasn't convenient,'' Mr. Walker said. Now, more than 50 buses shared by all the rental companies shuttle passengers. ''You go through a tunnel underneath the roadways,'' he said. ''It's a real straight shot.'' 
 Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina -- a gateway to another rapidly growing metropolis where available land is scarce -- has a plan to build a rental-car center right in front of the airport. The authorities are ''seriously working on a plan that would tear down the two parking decks that are currently in front of the terminal building and rebuild them twice as large,'' said Jerry Orr, aviation director for the airport. He said that construction should begin within a year. 
 In some cities, however, building a consolidated rental site can be overwhelmingly expensive. Los Angeles International Airport has been trying to lower the costs of a proposed $800 million car-rental site a short distance from the airport, said Gina Marie Lindsey, executive director of Los Angeles Worldwide Airports. The cost of the proposed site -- which would require an extensive bus system or people mover -- exceeds the amount that can be raised by the state-sanctioned fees charged to car renters to help pay for such projects.
 Despite the price tag, Ms. Lindsey said the airport was committed to the project. ''We're looking to be as environmentally friendly as possible,'' she said. ''I think a consolidated center with busing or a people mover could ultimately really reduce the number of trips coming into the central terminal area.''

HEADLINE: Investors Cautious Before Rate Decision

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street turned in a mixed performance Tuesday as investors traded cautiously ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday on interest rates.
 Many investors are speculating that Fed policy makers will cut interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting Wednesday, and will then signal that they are planning to hold rates steady for a while to curb inflation.
 Inflation is a concern to Wall Street because it tends to curtail consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.81, or 0.31 percent, to 12,831.94. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 5.43, or 0.39 percent, to 1,390.94, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.70, or 0.07 percent, to 2,426.10.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.44, or 0.89 percent, to 718.93.
 A pullback in oil prices Tuesday eased inflation concerns a bit and helped keep the stock market from tumbling sharply. Oil's decline was helped by expectations that a supply disruption in Britain would soon be resolved and by the American dollar's continued strengthening against the euro. 
 Light crude for June delivery fell $3.12, to $115.63 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Falling energy prices helped lift airline stocks. Continental Airlines rose 60 cents, to $17.56; Southwest Airlines gained 43 cents, to $13.34; and AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines, increased 79 cents, to $8.53. A Citigroup analyst, Andrew Light, said that AMR stood to gain from industry consolidation even though the company itself was unlikely to merge with another airline.
 But Wall Street was pressured by a report from a research firm, RealtyTrac, that showed the number of American homes heading toward foreclosure more than doubled in the first quarter from a year earlier.
 The biggest drag on the Dow was Merck, one of its 30 companies, which sank $4.30, or 10.4 percent, to $37.14 after it announced that the Food and Drug Administration had refused to approve a new cholesterol drug called Cordaptive.
 Earnings reports came in mixed. On the positive side, the auto supplier Lear reported a first-quarter profit rise, revised its 2008 sales outlook higher, and stood by its earnings prediction for the year. The auto supplier rose $5.08, or 19.2 percent, to $31.50.
 MasterCard rose $31.48, or 13 percent, to $273.98 after reporting that its profit more than doubled in the first quarter, and its rival, Visa Inc., rebounded from an early decline to rise $5.25, to $80.88, after reporting late Monday that its first-quarter profit increased 28 percent.
 Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender and servicer, said it lost $893 million during the first quarter because of a sharp increase in its provisions for unpaid home mortgage loans. The latest results were the third consecutive quarterly loss for Countrywide, which agreed in January to sell itself to Bank of America for about $4 billion in stock.
 Shares of Countrywide rose 2 cents, to $5.85, while Bank of America fell 32 cents, to $37.86.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was little changed, rising 2/32, to 97 13/32. The yield, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.82 percent, from 3.83 percent. 
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Dead Ends and Wrong Turns

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
In early February, Congress gave beleaguered mortgage borrowers a rare cause for celebration. As part of the economic stimulus package, it passed rules intended to make it easier and less expensive for people to take out hefty loans in the nation's costliest housing markets.
 Economists and legislators said that helping tens of thousands of borrowers take out billions of dollars in new loans could stanch the bleeding in the housing market, spur spending and reduce the pain of a likely recession. 
 Instead, the effort to make it easier to get jumbo mortgages -- loans over $417,000 -- has yielded frustration and disillusionment. 
 Since the rules took effect April 1, many prospective borrowers and their mortgage brokers say the new loans are either not available or the rates are far higher than they expected. Relief, they say, has been replaced by grief. 
 The program ''is so much of a failure that it's really unbelievable,'' said Daniel M. Shlufman, president of the FCMC Mortgage Corporation in Clifton, N.J. Mr. Shlufman likened Congress's effort to ''coming up with a vaccine to a terrible disease, and then not giving it to people, or making it too expensive.'' 
 Under the new rules, a sizable number of jumbo loan would be treated by the mortgage industry in the same way as smaller conventional loans. This change -- raising the ceiling for loans backed by government-sponsored housing finance agencies to nearly $730,000 in the nation's costliest locations -- was intended to bring rates down for more borrowers and stimulate the lending that is needed to get the economy moving again. 
 The goal of making most of these jumbo loans accessible was aimed not at helping subprime borrowers, those people with spotty credit histories. Rather, it was meant for borrowers with good credit and ample down payments, but who wanted to buy a house or refinance a home loan in the costliest housing markets, like New York, San Francisco, Anchorage, Baltimore, Edwards, Colo., and Jackson, Wyo. 
 In such markets, a two-bedroom home can easily cost more than $1 million. 
 But the real concern over this program's failure goes beyond people seeking million-dollar homes. The danger, economists say, is in how a wave of foreclosures and rising inventory of homes for sale will deepen and prolong the economic downturn started by the subprime mortgage crisis. 
 In 2007, around 14 percent of new loans were jumbos, compared with 8 percent for subprime and 48 percent for traditional conforming loans, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter that tracks mortgage activity.
 Robert Edelstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said that it is essential to a healthy economy that jumbo borrowers in these upper-tier markets are able to get financing. ''There could be a contagion,'' he said, as the subprime woes ''move up the chain.'' 
 ''The housing market has to stabilize,'' he said. ''And in these markets large loans are needed because the values are big.''
 Members of Congress and people in the mortgage-backed securities industry remain optimistic about the new rules. They say it is too soon to declare success or failure. Relief, they insist, remains around the corner. They argue that the credit market that fuels home ownership must be given time to adapt to rule changes that affect billions in potential loans.
 This month, Freddie Mac, one of the two main government-chartered companies (along with Fannie Mae) that helps the housing market by purchasing loans in bulk from lenders, said that over the next year, it would buy up to $15 billion of the jumbo loans. That change and others that may follow, optimists argue, could lead to more loans and bring down interest rates. 
 ''We're getting some benefit but not as much as I'd hoped,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''That will change shortly,'' he said an interview. ''I am confident that within a month or less, it will be fully operational.''
 Freddie Mac estimates the new rules could encourage $40 billion or more in loans by year's end, which it estimates could finance new mortgages or mortgage refinancings for 50,000 or more borrowers. 
 Despite an eager consumer base, it appears few such loans have been made, according to John Bancroft, executive editor of Inside Mortgage Finance. He expects activity to pick up as the market adjusts to the rules. ''It's going to take some time,'' he said. 
 But time may run out at the end of the year, when the system is supposed to revert to the old rules. Not surprisingly, lenders and their secondary investors are hesitant about changing their business for a short time.
 And rates have not dropped -- at least not to the degree that many borrowers and mortgage brokers had expected. In some cases, ''conforming'' loans, so designated because they conform to the government-sponsored rules, are a full percentage point below the newly conforming jumbo loans intended to be covered by the new law. 
 ''It's a complete joke,'' said Jose Lemus, president of Brymus Capital, a mortgage brokerage firm in Santa Ana, Calif. He said a buyer in Southern California looking to borrow $417,000 would pay an interest rate of 5.75 percent, while someone borrowing slightly more for a conforming jumbo loan would pay an interest rate of 6.99 percent.
 For a jumbo loan that is not conforming, the rate could be as low as 7.35 percent for someone with excellent credit, Mr. Lemus said, but the rate for someone with average credit could be as high as 9 percent. ''It's getting harder by the day,'' Mr. Lemus said. 
 Because the rates have not fallen as Mr. Lemus and his customers had hoped, he has not processed a single loan under the new rules. 
 Some prospective borrowers, like Nathan Menaged, 29, are skeptical that things will change. Mr. Menaged, a marketing consultant, owes about $574,000 on his Brooklyn home. He makes monthly payments of $4,000. 
 ''I thought I had some good possibilities for getting into something more comfortable,'' Mr. Menaged said of the new rules, which he has been tracking with great hope since January. But the interest rates on them remain prohibitively high. If rates had fallen as he expected, he hoped to lower his monthly payments by $1,000 -- money he wanted to pay for his daughter's tuition.
 ''It's frustrating and it could become desperate if I don't find an alternative in the near future,'' he said. Members of the financial services community, including executives of major banks, investors and mortgage lenders, have said there are good reasons that rates are not dropping and more new-style jumbo loans are not being written. They say that jumbo rates -- even ''conforming'' ones -- are unlikely to fall completely in line with conforming rates.
 The reason has to do with the way loans are sold and securitized. Conforming loans carry a lower interest rate in part because lenders can package and sell those loans as mortgage-backed securities directly to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or to private investors who know that the housing finance agencies can buy them later. And some of those loans can be sold even before they are finalized because they qualify for the ''to be announced'' market that allows fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities to be traded freely as interchangeable commodities. 
 An influential trade group of the nation's largest financial institutions, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, recently made a key decision that some critics say has kept those rates from dropping. The association decided that loans above $417,000 -- even those jumbo loans now considered by law as conforming -- would not be eligible to participate in the ''to be announced'' market. 
 Sean Davy, a managing director at the trade association, said that lumping the new loans in with the smaller conforming ones could have created enough uncertainty and instability to drive up rates on the conventional loans. 
 But critics in Congress counter that lenders and the mortgage-backed securities industry have dragged their feet.
 ''I've been a little disappointed by the securitization people,'' Representative Frank said. ''What I'm told when I complain is that they have to iron out some wrinkles. It's taken them longer to take advantage of this than I expected.''

HEADLINE: Patent Bill Is Bonanza To Lobbyists

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A fight has erupted in Congress over the question of whether drug makers and other companies should be allowed to keep patents they obtained by misrepresentation or cheating.
 The issue has emerged as a contentious point in legislation to overhaul patent laws. In several cases, the courts have voided patents after finding that companies intentionally misled the Patent and Trademark Office.
 The legislation, affecting a wide swath of the American economy, has been a boon to lobbyists. In 15 months, two dueling business coalitions have spent $4.3 million lobbying on the legislation, which calls for the biggest changes in United States patent law in more than 50 years. Companies from almost every major industry have joined the battle. 
 Patents can protect an invention for up to 20 years. But federal judges can void patents after finding that companies engaged in ''inequitable conduct,'' meaning that they misrepresented or concealed information with an intent to deceive the patent office. In such cases, judges can declare the patents unenforceable.
 Robert A. Armitage, a senior vice president and general counsel of Eli Lilly & Company, said, ''This is like imposing the death penalty for relatively minor acts of misconduct.''
 Brand-name drug companies are urging Congress to eliminate the penalty -- or to curtail it as proposed under a bill passed by the House.
 Debra S. Barrett, a vice president of the American unit of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the world's largest maker of generic drugs, said the changes sought by brand-name drug companies ''would make it easier for them to cheat and get away with it, easier for them to defend their patents and more difficult for us to get generic products onto the market in a timely way.''
 Consumer groups like AARP share that concern. They want to speed access to generic medicines, which can cost 30 percent to 80 percent less than the equivalent brand-name drugs.
 The House has approved a comprehensive patent bill that would make it harder to prove inequitable conduct. Senators are haggling over a companion bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and hope to take it to the floor this summer.
 In the last 15 years, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles patent cases, has affirmed findings of inequitable conduct in at least 40 cases, including 14 that involved pharmaceutical or health care products. Similar findings have been issued by federal district judges in an unknown number of cases that were not appealed.
 Courts have found that drug makers knowingly submitted false statements to the patent office, inaccurately described experiments and concealed information that contradicted their claims.
 In one case, the appeals court said that Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals improperly failed to disclose that it had not performed an experiment described in its application for a patent related to synthetic human growth hormone. In another case, the court said Pharmacia had used an ''inaccurate and misleading'' affidavit in obtaining a patent for a glaucoma medication.
 Brand-name drug companies say that generic drug makers routinely attack their patents by accusing them of inequitable conduct when they are blameless or guilty of no more than honest mistakes.
 The aggressive use of such accusations has become ''a plague on the patent system,'' the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, told Congress.
 Harry F. Manbeck Jr., who was commissioner of patents and trademarks under the first President Bush, said the existing penalty was a powerful deterrent to misconduct.
 ''Patents can be very valuable,'' Mr. Manbeck said. ''There are strong incentives to want to get them. Cheating occurs from time to time. The inequitable conduct doctrine says that if you cheated to get a patent, you should not be able to enforce it.''
 Under federal regulations, people applying for a patent have a duty to deal with the patent office in ''candor, good faith and honesty.'' They are supposed to disclose if their invention was previously known or used by others, offered for sale or described in a publication. In that case, it may not be innovative enough to warrant a patent.
 In reviewing an application, patent examiners can search the relevant literature, but may not find all the pertinent information, so they depend on applicants to be forthright.
 ''If Congress eliminated or reduced the penalty for inequitable conduct, applicants would no longer have a reason to disclose all the information they are aware of,'' said Robert D. Budens, president of the Patent Office Professional Association, which represents 5,500 examiners. 
 Mr. Armitage, the Lilly executive, said: ''The doctrine of inequitable conduct is used so aggressively in litigation that it has unintended consequences. Applicants give the Patent and Trademark Office too much information, to avoid allegations that they concealed anything, and they refuse to explain the information, to avoid later allegations that they engaged in some form of misrepresentation.''
 James C. Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said, ''The poor patent examiner gets a dump truck full of information that he has to pore over without any assistance from the applicant.''
 The number of patent applications -- 467,243 in 2007 -- has nearly doubled in the last 10 years and has more than tripled since 1987.
 Jon W. Dudas, the under secretary of commerce for intellectual property, said: ''We are getting more and more unpatentable ideas, worse and worse quality applications. Historically, in the last 40 years, the allowance rate -- the percentage of applications ultimately approved -- hovered around 62 percent to 72 percent. It went up to 72 percent in 2000, but dropped to 43 percent in the first quarter of this year.''
 A major impetus for the patent legislation is the desire of technology companies to limit the damage awards and legal costs they sometimes face when they are accused of infringing patents. Companies like Cisco and Palm say the disputes drain resources that could be better spent on research and innovation.
 Many of these companies have banded together in the Coalition for Patent Fairness, which in the last 15 months has spent $2.5 million for a small army of lobbyists including Mark W. Isakowitz, a Republican, and Steven A. Elmendorf, a longtime Democratic strategist.
 A rival group, the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform, consists of about 50 companies that zealously guard their intellectual property and are more likely to file suit to protect their patents. It includes pharmaceutical and biotech companies like Genzyme, Lilly, Merck and Pfizer. This coalition has paid $1.8 million to lobbyists, much of it to the law firm of Akin Gump.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Planned Accord With Militants Alarms U.S.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and MARK MAZZETTI; Ismail Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that a deal being negotiated between the new Pakistani government and militant tribes in the country's unruly border area will lead to further unraveling of security in the region. 
 Cross-border attacks into Afghanistan by militants based in Pakistan doubled in March from the same period a year ago and have not diminished in April, a Western military official said, while Pakistani counterinsurgency operations in the tribal areas have dropped sharply during the talks.
 American counterterrorism officials express concern that the new coalition government in Islamabad may withdraw some of the 120,000 Pakistani troops in the border area or curtail flights by the Central Intelligence Agency's armed Predator aircraft in the region. 
 Indeed, Washington and Islamabad seem to be on dueling timetables, with the Bush administration trying to cripple Al Qaeda's safe havens before leaving office, and the new Pakistani government seeking to establish credibility with its public by distancing itself from the American-backed policies of President Pervez Musharraf. 
 American officials say that Washington's options now are even more limited, in part because Mr. Musharraf is no longer calling the shots, and that the situation in the tribal areas is unlikely to significantly improve before President Bush leaves office. American economic and development aid aimed to help wean the region off the militants' influence is just now seeping into the tribal areas, while a tribal paramilitary force still needs years of training and equipping to be an effective counterinsurgency unit. 
 The problems confronting the administration reflect what critics say is a failure over the past several years to pay sufficient attention to the growing numbers of Qaeda and Taliban fighters drawn to safe havens in the tribal area. Even under Mr. Musharraf, the administration's main ally in Pakistan, the United States failed to develop a governmentwide plan to combat the militancy in the turbulent borderlands, these critics say. 
 The leaders of Pakistan's new government, Asif Ali Zardari of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-N, have vowed to honor their campaign pledges to break with Mr. Musharraf's emphasis on using military force in the tribal areas, a practice critics say has been heavy-handed and has undercut the government's goals. 
 The government has begun a negotiating strategy that officials hope will win over those in the tribal areas who in recent years have been caught up in a wave of anti-American sentiment and, in some cases, who are actively helping Al Qaeda. 
 American policy makers, diplomats and senior military officers voice fears that a new agreement, like past accords brokered with the militants by Mr. Musharraf, would allow Al Qaeda and the Taliban to regroup, rearm and plot new attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Europe and the United States. American defense officials and independent analysts estimate between 150 and 500 hard-core Qaeda fighters are operating in the tribal areas.
 But administration officials concede they have limited leverage with Pakistan's new government and, for now, may have to allow the talks to play out and then press the government to enforce any deals. ''We have only a marginal ability to influence actions right now,'' said one senior administration official who is involved in Pakistan policy and who agreed to speak candidly on condition of anonymity. 
 Members of the new government believe that the current peace talks have a better chance for lasting success that those by Mr. Musharraf's government because this time around it is civilian Pashtun officials, rather than military leaders, who are negotiating directly with tribal elders in the mountainous provinces. 
 For example, they believe that negotiations with the Mehsud tribe can help isolate militants from the clan of Baitullah Mehsud, whose network is believed responsible for the killing of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Mehsud, one of most hard-line militants, said Tuesday that talks with the government had been temporarily suspended over the army's refusal to withdraw from all of the tribal areas. But other Pakistani officials said the stalemate could be a momentary bargaining ploy.
 Members of the new government argue that since negotiations during Mr. Musharraf's administration had usually occurred after the Pakistani military was soundly defeated by militants in the tribal areas, the government was forced to negotiate from a position of weakness. 
 ''The Pakistan government has no plans to diminish its military presence in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region,'' said Husain Haqqani, who has been tapped to be Pakistan's new ambassador to the United States. ''Negotiations with tribesmen are aimed at supplementing military efforts with political ones. The security requirements will not be abandoned or ignored.'' 
 Still, Pakistani officials acknowledge that it could take several years to achieve the ultimate goal: peeling hard-line militants, so-called irreconcilables, from what they see as a majority of tribal area residents who have little desire to support international terrorism. And American counterterrorism officials say that a peace accord could sap momentum from Pakistan's broader campaign against militants.
 ''An agreement will preclude the need of the Pakistani government to enter into serious dialogue and planning with its military to develop a national, even regional, counterinsurgency strategy,'' one senior American military officer said in an e-mail message from the region, speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic considerations.
 Discussions between senior American officials and Pakistan's new leaders have not gone particularly well. Deputy Secretary of State John D. Negroponte and Richard A. Boucher, one of his top aides, traveled to Islamabad in March to discuss plans to combat militants in the tribal areas. 
 During the meetings, Pakistani officials bristled at what they saw as an American determination to ignore the results of the recent Pakistani elections that had stripped Mr. Musharraf's party of power. ''The Americans were acting as if nothing had changed,'' said one senior Pakistani official. 
 After the meetings, Pakistani officials told reporters that the new government's counterterrorism strategy would be significantly different from that of Mr. Musharraf.
 American officials in Islamabad are trying to adapt to the new government's strategy, and in some cases resisting pleas by American commanders to step up unilateral strikes on Pakistani militants in the tribal areas. 
 Pakistani officials said that Anne Patterson, the American ambassador in Islamabad, is particularly concerned about the fragility of the coalition government. It was this concern, they said, that has led her to turn down requests by American military officials in Afghanistan to hit targets in the tribal areas. The senior Pakistani official said, ''What she was saying was, do not go around bombing -- and missing -- targets inside Pakistan and embarrassing the new government.''
 Administration officials said the ability of the United States to help the Pakistani Army, and the Frontier Corps in the tribal areas, was constrained. American officials say the Pakistani Army remains focused on India, its traditional adversary, despite efforts by the new army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, to step up counterinsurgency operations. 
 ''I have no information to suggest that what Pakistanis have done in past two to three months has seriously impeded Al Qaeda's ability'' to recruit new members and train them in small compounds in the tribal areas, said a senior American intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

 PAKISTAN'S TALKS WITH MILITANTS
 Alarm Bush Administration
 Bush administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that a deal being negotiated between the new Pakistani government and militant tribes in the country's unruly border area will lead to further unraveling of security in the region. Cross-border attacks into Afghanistan by militants based in Pakistan have increased while Pakistani counterinsurgency operations in the areas have dropped sharply, a military official said. PAGE A10 
 AFGHAN PRESIDENT WAS WARNED
 President Hamid Karzai was warned that an attack was being planned on a military parade on Sunday, when he escaped an assassination attempt, Afghanistan's intelligence chief told Parliament. He said two groups of attackers were thwarted the same day, though a third succeeded in opening fire on the ceremony. PAGE A6 
 CHINA SENDS 30 TO PRISON FOR RIOTS
 A Chinese court in Tibet sentenced 30 people to prison terms ranging from three years to life for what the authorities said were their roles in the deadly rioting last month, the state news media reported. The sentences are the first batch of punishments meted out to those accused of taking part vandalism and violence against ethnic Han Chinese that began March 14 in the Tibetan capital. PAGE A11 
 ON THE SYRIA DISCLOSURE
 President Bush said that last week's disclosure of what senior American officials called evidence of a nearly completed nuclear reactor in Syria was intended to warn North Korea and Iran about the dangers of spreading nuclear weapons. Mr. Bush also defended his administration's decision to keep that evidence secret for more than seven months after Israeli bombers destroyed the Syrian building. PAGE A7 
 MAY '68 STILL DIVIDES THE FRENCH
 The student demonstrations of May 1968 were a watershed in French life, a holy moment of liberation for many, when youth coalesced, the workers listened and the semi-royal French government of de Gaulle took fright. But for others, the unrest represented anarchy and moral relativism, a destruction of social and patriotic values. The fierce debate still raging about what happened 40 years ago is very French.

 FACING FALLING DONATIONS,
 Charities Put Faith in Tax Rebates
 Charities dealing with falling donations and higher operating costs are hoping to benefit from the tax rebates many families expect to receive this week. And while most families will need to use the money they get from the rebates, other families will have more options. ''The key for charities is to recognize that while 95 percent of the people who are getting these rebates need to use them to pay for their own gas and groceries, 5 percent can afford to give them away and that's a lot,'' said one fund-raising consultant.

 FIGHT OVER TRAPS ON PUBLIC LAND
 As the number of second homeowners and retirees grows in Montana, where fur trapping is common practice on public lands, more pets have been caught in traps. The issue has become a contentious one between residents who want a ban on trapping on public lands and others who say a ban would be an attack on a Western way of life. PAGE A12 
 MCCAIN TRIES TO EASE TENSIONS
 During his tenure in the Senate, John McCain has often been viewed with suspicion by his fellow Republicans -- an opinion that was often mutual. Mr. McCain's reputation as a maverick, though, could be a boon to the party in an election year in which Republicans have sagging popularity, and both he and party leaders in the House are trying to assuage fears and strengthen their political marriage.

 STEEL WORKER INJURED 
 In Fall From Building
 This year, 13 people have been killed in construction accidents in New York City. Another left a steel worker critically injured after he fell 25 feet from a building under construction in Manhattan on Tuesday. The series of accidents have led to shake-ups at the city's Department of Buildings, which oversees building safety and code violations, and the department's acting commissioner said he would take a hard line if it were found that code violations played a role in the man's fall.

 QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO IS HELPED
 By Federal Mortgage Aid Program
 President Bush said a program run by the Federal Housing Association would aid homeowners who had fallen behind on their mortgage payments. But according to statistics, most of the 150,000 people helped by the program, called F.H.A. Secure, were homeowners who had made their payments on time, and fewer than 2,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure have actually received assistance from the program. PAGE C1 
 PATENT BATTLE IS BOON TO LOBBYISTS
 Congress is mired in a fight over the question of whether drug makers should be allowed to keep patents they obtained by misrepresentation or cheating -- but that fight has been a gift to lobbyists. Over the last 15 months, two competing business coalitions have spent $4.3 million lobbying on the legislation, which calls for the biggest changes in United States patent law in more than 50 years.

 REPORTS MAY HINT AT RECESSION
 Is the United States in a recession? Data from a report indicated that American homes lost their value at the fastest rate in almost two decades, and another said that Americans' confidence in the economy continued to dip. Some economists said that the information in the reports was consistent with a recession, while other said the economy is growing, albeit very slowly. The reports have placed more pressure on the Federal Reserve. PAGE C4 
 RECORD QUARTER FOR OIL COMPANIES
 While a headache for many, the high price of oil is good for oil companies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP reported record first-quarter profits beating expectations and prompting share gains across the industry. Shell's net income for the first three months was up 25 percent, to $9.08 billion. Meanwhile BP reported its profit increased 63 percent, to $7.62 billion. PAGE C9

 AIRPORTS PICK UP SLACK LEFT BY AIRLINES
 It is tough being an air passenger these days. Carriers have cut back on normal services, flights are canceled by the hundreds, and delays are the order of the day. Some airports, like Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, are trying to assuage customers' anxieties by picking up the customer service slack that airlines have jettisoned. Still, there is the issue of cutting down the wait times for airport security. PAGE H1 
 TAKING MINUTES AND PLAYING JENGA
 Some hotel chains are forgoing meeting spaces that look like boardrooms in favor of those that look like lounges. The idea is that a relaxed environment stimulates the right side of the brain, which is linked to creativity. Some provide Etch A Sketches, others the video game Guitar Hero. One expert credits Starbucks for ushering in the casual conference room. ''Hard wooden chairs don't do it anymore,'' he said. PAGE H4 
 FOIE GRAS FOR PEOPLE ON THE GO
 There was a time when fine dining in airports was available only to travelers with frequent-flier status. But some big-name chefs, including Gordon Ramsay and Todd English, have opened luxury restaurants in airport terminals. Airports, though, provide certain culinary challenges for restaurateurs, like smaller cutlery for security reasons, and electric stovetops, which are not allowed for safety reasons. PAGE H6

 The mystical Swiss chemist who gave the world LSD, the most powerful psychotropic substance known, he first synthesized the compound in 1938 but did not discover its psychopharmacological effects until five years later, when he accidentally ingested the substance. PAGE B7 
 WILL ROBINSON, 96
 A pioneering college basketball coach who broke racial barriers, he became the first black man to hold a head-coaching post in Division I. During his five years at the helm of Illinois State's basketball program, the team never finished with a losing record.

 CINEPHILES TO TRIBECA FESTIVAL:
 Is That All You've Got?
 The seven-year-old Tribeca Film Festival has presented world premieres and played a significant role in helping a neighborhood find its footing after Sept. 11. Yet despite its generous size, range of interests and world-class backdrop, the event has yet to establish an identity and is still viewed as flyover territory by many in the industry seeking sales or buzz.

 LIL MAMA, BIG PLANS
 The 18-year-old Brooklyn rapper Lil Mama, whose single ''Lip Gloss'' was a novelty hit last summer, is in a rare position in hip-hop: a female M.C. aiming to jump from dance-floor hotness to inspiration. ''Growing up in a neighborhood like mine, I always had to be a positive influence on the youth,'' she said. ''I'm the outlet of the things that we want the world to know about us.'' PAGE E1 
 HISTORY WE NEVER LEARNED
 Tony Horwitz's new book, ''A Voyage Long and Strange,'' is about the American history most Americans never learned: Columbus was a much lousier navigator than we were taught, the Pilgrims were latecomers, and much of what we think of as heroic exploration was bumbling and misguided. Fittingly, Mr. Horwitz, too, is a passionate amateur of sorts. PAGE E1 
 A HOMEGROWN NEWSCAST
 The New York public television stations WNET and WLIW plan to drop a BBC-produced nightly newscast, ''BBC World News,'' and replace it with a new half-hour program focused on international issues, WLIW is expected to announce. The weekday program will likely replace the BBC show on more than 200 public stations nationwide. PAGE E3

 HOW TO SAVE A SPECIES? PUT IT ON A PLATE
 In a new book, Gary Nabhan proposes an idea that at first seems counterintuitive: in order to save certain endangered species that were once staples of American cuisines, people should eat more of them. He hopes that if foods like the Plains pronghorn antelope and the mission olive become popular in the culinary marketplace, breeders, farmers and chefs will want to grow and use more of them.

 THE BEST THINGS IN SLICED BREAD
 Julia Moskin went in search of the next great New York sandwich, which was a tall order. In an effort to narrow down the vast array of meats and fixings on bread, she laid out some ground rules. No burgers or wraps. No empanadas, samosas, patties or arepas. But the most important quality of her candidates was that they could actually be eaten on the go. It is New York, after all. PAGE F1

 A PLAYER'S SELECTION BRINGS 
 New Scrutiny to Army Policy
 When Caleb Campbell, a West Point cadet, was drafted in the seventh round of the N.F.L. draft, he became the first Army player to be selected since a new policy was instituted in 2005 that allows individuals with exceptional skills to pursue their professional careers while remaining on active duty. The aim of the policy is that talented people can help boost recruiting and promote military service. And while little attention was paid to the policy, Mr. Campbell's selection has earned it fresh scrutiny. PAGE D7 
 REPRESENTING THEIR COUNTRY
 After coming back from what should have been a career-ending injury, Arielle Martin will be representing the United States when BMX racing makes its debut at the Olympic Games in Beijing. Her husband of a little over one year, Michael Verhaaren, shipped out for his deployment to Afghanistan the same day she left to begin training for the Games. ''People love a hero story, right?'' she said. PAGE D3
 A TOUCHING ACT OF SPORTSMANSHIP
 In softball, if a player is touched by a teammate on the bases, she cannot advance. When Sara Tucholsky, a diminutive senior for Western Oregon, hit a three-run home run -- the first homer of her life --her legs buckled on the base path and she fell to the ground in pain. That left Ms. Tucholsky's coach with a quandary: were her teammates to help her up, she would be credited with only a single. Then opposing players asked the Western Oregon coach to help Ms. Tucholsky around the bases. Sports of The Times, George Vescey. PAGE D1 
 Editorial
 MR. OBAMA AND MR. WRIGHT
 It took more time than it should have, but Barack Obama has firmly rejected the racism and paranoia of his former pastor. This country needs a healthy and open discussion of race. Mr. Obama's repudiation of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. is part of that. His opponents also have a responsibility -- to repudiate the race-baiting and make sure it stops. PAGE A18 
 REINING IN THE IMMIGRATION POSSES
 Many parts of the nation have tilted severely toward harsh, unyielding policies to catch and punish illegal immigrants, but not everyone has gone over the edge. Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona on Monday pushed back. PAGE A18 
 ZIMBABWE CHOSE CHANGE
 Zimbabwe's voters have waited more than four weeks for the results of the March 29 presidential election. The only explanation for the delay is that President Robert Mugabe and his henchmen are still trying to figure out a way to fix the vote. PAGE A18

HEADLINE: Myriad Crises on the Nation's Doorstep, but Inertia in Official Washington

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Americans are pumping their paychecks into their gas tanks, and the economy is in a stall. Food scarcities threaten governments overseas and spur hoarding at home. Foreclosures are up, home sales are down. Progress in Iraq and Afghanistan is halting. 
 Despite this confluence of crises on the nation's doorstep, official Washington is beset by election-year inertia. After a fleeting bipartisan moment in January produced the rebate checks that began going out this week, the House and Senate floors have been given over to partisan sniping and small-bore bills. The House voted Tuesday to designate National Watermelon Month and National Funeral Director and Mortician Recognition Day. The Senate is often tied in procedural knots and goes days without senators voting at all. 
 Frustration is building as lawmakers see a major disconnect between the everyday anxieties of people back home and the Washington agenda.
 ''It is incomprehensible that we are not grappling with the major challenges confronting the American people,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine. ''People need to hear that their national leaders are working together, the president in concert with the Congress. It is political negligence on the part of both branches and both parties.''
 The reasons for the gridlock are evident, and there is plenty of blame to go around. Democrats, and some Republicans, are trying to wait out the Bush administration, hoping to find a more receptive audience in whomever the next president is. Both parties are pushing political initiatives, trying to avoid tough votes themselves while inflicting them on the other side. Republicans are happy to slow legislation out of ideological opposition and an urge to flummox Democrats, forcing votes on even the most routine matters in the Senate.
 ''This is a very difficult climate to achieve anything substantive,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, who referred derisively to the ''break neck'' pace of the Senate. ''The rebate check was an exception; I don't know if we can have a repeat performance.''
 At the same time, President Bush set Congressional eyes rolling on Tuesday when he pushed again for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an initiative that could not clear Congress when Republicans were in charge and would offer little in the way of immediate help. 
 Democratic leaders see Mr. Bush as unyielding, unreasonable and unwilling to compromise on any front. They viewed the president's ultimatum on Tuesday on a war spending bill as typical. He pledged he would not budge from a $108 billion ceiling he had set for a bill that Democrats hoped to use as a way to provide some domestic economic relief and new benefits for members of the military.
 Mr. Bush said, ''108 is 108.'' 
 In an effort to wring some concessions out of the White House, Congressional Democrats tied up a free-trade agreement with Colombia that Mr. Bush wants to record as a final accomplishment. The idea was to trade a vote on the Colombia deal for some domestic spending on items like an extension of unemployment benefits. But the tactic has so far generated no meeting of the minds, and the Colombia agreement has just been added to the stalemate mix.
 Congress is not completely locked down, and some legislation is advancing. The House is preparing this week to send the White House a bill prohibiting discrimination by insurers and employers on the basis of genetic makeup, a measure that has been years in the making. A major farm bill is emerging, as is a measure to make sure the credit crunch does not dry up student loans.
 And Democrats are on the verge of laying out their ideas for financing the war and any additional spending, though that seems likely to lead to a prolonged clash first with Congressional Republicans and then Mr. Bush, given his line in the sand on the $108 billion. Republican leaders are already predicting a veto fight into the summer.
 Yet the current frustration in and with Congress stems from the feeling that the House, the Senate and the White House are not approaching the most pressing problems with an appropriate sense of urgency. Help for troubled homeowners is still taking shape in the House banking committee, and the administration has been taking a tougher stance against it. Democrats want more money to aid the economy, but Mr. Bush and many Republicans say they want to see the impact of the new stimulus payments first.
 The price of gas might be the most vexing problem. It is taking a serious bite out of family and business budgets across the country, but lawmakers are now essentially trying to fix blame for the rising costs. An immediate remedy is elusive.
 ''The truth is we are not going to legislate a substantial reduction in gas prices over the short term,'' said Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ''That is not going to happen.''
 He and others say the government can provide some relief by halting any new purchases of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and increasing supply. Others are calling for a temporary suspension of federal gasoline and diesel taxes. But there is bickering about the merits of these ideas even though they are considered strictly Band-aids.
 Big-rig truckers who converged on the Capitol on Monday to warn of the potential danger to the economy and the supply chain should they be unable to afford to fill up with diesel were calling on Congress to look for big solutions. Their message: with so many important matters confronting Washington, this is no time for government to suffer a breakdown.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Pain From Economy Defies Easy Fix

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With consumer confidence slipping and gasoline and food prices soaring, President Bush delivered an unusually dark assessment of the economy on Tuesday, saying the nation was in ''very difficult times, very difficult.'' 
 There are no quick fixes, Mr. Bush said, to ease the pain Americans feel. Mr. Bush used a Rose Garden news conference to go on the offensive against the Democratic-controlled Congress, accusing lawmakers of being uncooperative on bills that would address pocketbook issues. 
 Democrats pushed back, accusing Mr. Bush of trotting out old ideas and of favoring big oil companies at the expense of average Americans.
 The sharp exchanges struck a different tone from when the two parties joined forces on an economic stimulus package, including tax rebates that are being issued. Since then, the president and Congress have not agreed on addressing the economic troubles, and by Tuesday they mostly blamed each other. 
 The paralysis is a product of election jockeying, as the parties avoid hard choices and try to inflict tough votes on the rivals. Although Democrats and Republicans came to terms on the tax rebates, neither has given way on bigger tax and spending issues. Both sides seem inclined to wait, hoping November shifts the balance in their favor.
 The gasoline price might be the most vexing problem for Congress, but after steady price increases, a quick solution seems elusive. 
 ''If there was a magic wand to wave, I'd be waving it, of course,'' Mr. Bush said, referring specifically to gasoline prices, which have climbed $1.40 a gallon in 18 months. ''But there is no magic wand to wave right now. It took us a while to get to this fix.''
 Instead of embracing new proposals, Mr. Bush mainly dusted off old ones. He called on Congress to address the cost of energy by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling for petroleum and expanding nuclear power, two plans that have long been on the legislative shelf. 
 Mr. Bush also said, ''Those who worry about recession, slowdown, whatever you want to call it'' ought to make his tax cuts permanent.
 Mr. Bush was cool to proposals by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, a Democratic presidential contender, to give drivers a break by temporarily suspending the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal excise tax on gasoline. 
 The other Democratic contender, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, on Tuesday dismissed the suspension of the gasoline tax as a gimmick.
 Mr. Bush similarly rejected an idea by a fellow Texas Republican, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to stop making deposits in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
 ''If I thought it would affect the price of oil positively,'' he said, ''I would seriously consider it.''
 Mr. Bush has spent much of his presidency riding high on claims of unparalleled job growth, but with nine months left in office, he has to confront a new reality. In recent weeks, he has said the economy is in a ''rough patch.'' This month, he expressed optimism, saying, ''I'm confident we're going to come out of it.''
 But his tone on Tuesday was more somber, reflecting a new report that found consumer confidence plummeting as home prices have collapsed more rapidly than at any time in 20 years. 
 ''I will tell you that these are very difficult times, very difficult,'' he said while continuing to avoid the word ''recession.'' ''And we'll let the economists define it for what it is.''
 Americans, Mr. Bush said are ''looking to their elected leaders in Congress for action.''
 ''Unfortunately,'' he added, ''on many of these issues all they're getting is delay.'' 
 Democrats responded with a news conference where Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said: 
 ''He says he's concerned with high gas prices and high food prices and student and home loan problems. But the truth is that the president has closed his eyes and put his hands over his ears as these crises have grown.''
 Mr. Schumer and other Democrats, including Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, urged the administration to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve temporarily and work to limit speculative trading in oil futures. 
 ''Why not deal with the unbelievable orgy of speculation that's occurring in these futures markets?'' Mr. Dorgan asked. ''That's what's driving up prices.''
 Mr. Bush attributed high prices to the lack of refining capacity and said opening the Arctic refuge, a proposal that Democrats and environmentalists have long opposed, would enable the United States to produce a million additional barrels of oil a day. 
 He called it an ''intermediate term'' solution, saying, ''It sends a signal to markets that the United States is not going to restrict exploration.''
 On housing, Mr. Bush called on lawmakers to pass two measures that have long been in the works, one to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration and the other to revamp the government-sponsored mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But he did not address a proposal being drafted by House Democrats to expand the availability of federally insured mortgages. 
 Mr. Bush also said Democrats were ''considering a massive, bloated farm bill'' that would fail to eliminate farmers' subsidies as food prices skyrocket and the farm economy thrives. 
 ''It's not the time to ask American families who are already paying more in the checkout line to pay more in subsidies for wealthy farmers,'' he said.
 When Democrats won control of Congress in November 2006, Mr. Bush promised to work with them. But their cooperation has been limited at best, and with the presidential campaign in full swing, it will be difficult for them to agree on all but the most noncontroversial questions. 
 On Tuesday, signs were evident that Mr. Bush's criticism of Democrats might actually widen gaps between lawmakers who share similar policy goals. Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida, has recently expressed support for aggressive measures to prevent foreclosures, a huge issue in his home state. 
 But after Mr. Bush's news conference, Mr. Martinez echoed the president, saying he was skeptical of the measure that the House Democrats are drafting.
 ''I think the last thing we need to do is create a program that is going to go into effect after the crisis is over and then become a new bureaucracy,'' he said.
 At another news conference, Senate Republicans blamed Congressional Democrats for blocking efforts to increase oil production in the United States, both off the shores of states like Virginia and in Alaska. The minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, noted that gasoline prices were $1.20 a gallon higher than when Democrats took control of Congress in January 2007.
 One area where Democrats and Mr. Bush might find agreement, however, is student loans, a sector of the credit market that is not nearly as troubled as the mortgage market. The House last week passed a bill sponsored by Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, to increase amounts that students can borrow through federal programs. Mr. Bush praised it.
 ''I hope the Senate moves it, moves a version of it very quickly,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Barricades Of May '68 Still Divide The French

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: NANTERRE, France 

 BODY:
Forty years ago, French students in neckties and bobby socks threw cobblestones at the police and demanded that the sclerotic postwar system must change. Today, French students, worried about finding jobs and losing state benefits, are marching through the streets demanding that nothing change at all.
 May 1968 was a watershed in French life, a holy moment of liberation for many, when youth coalesced, the workers listened and the semi-royal French government of de Gaulle took fright. 
 But for others, like the current French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was only 13 years old at the time, May 1968 represents anarchy and moral relativism, a destruction of social and patriotic values that, he has said in harsh terms, ''must be liquidated.''
 The fierce debate about what happened 40 years ago is very French. There is even a fight about labels -- the right calls it ''the events,'' while the left calls it ''the movement.'' 
 While a youth revolt became general in the West -- from anti-Vietnam protests in the United States to the Rolling Stones in swinging London and finally the Baader-Meinhof gang in West Germany -- France was where the protests of the baby-boom generation came closest to a real political revolution, with 10 million workers on strike, and not just a revulsion against stifling social rules of class, education and sexual behavior.
 For Andre Glucksmann, a prime actor then and still a famous ''public intellectual,'' May 1968 is ''a monument, either sublime or detested, that we want to commemorate or bury.
 ''It is a 'cadaver,' '' he said, ''from which everyone wants to rob a piece.'' 
 Mr. Glucksmann, 71 and still with a mop of Beatles-like hair, wrote a book with his filmmaker son, Raphael, 28, called ''May 68 Explained to Nicolas Sarkozy.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy, in a stinging campaign speech a year ago as he ran against the Socialist candidate, attacked May 1968 and ''its leftist heirs,'' whom he blamed for a crisis of ''morality, authority, work and national identity.'' He attacked ''the cynicism of the gauche caviars,'' the high-livers on the left.
 In 1968, ''The hope was to change the world, like the Bolshevik Revolution, but it was inevitably incomplete, and the institutions of the state are untouched,'' Mr. Glucksmann said. ''We commemorate, but the right is in power!'' 
 As for the French left, he said, ''It's in a state of mental coma.''
 For Raphael Glucksmann, who led his first strike at high school in 1995, his generation has nostalgia for their rebel fathers but no stomach for a fight in hard economic times.
 ''The young people are marching now to refuse all reforms, to defend the rights of their professors,'' he said. ''We see no alternatives. We're a generation without bearings.''
 The events (or movement) of 40 years ago began in March at Nanterre University, just outside Paris, where a young French-born German named Daniel Cohn-Bendit led demonstrations against parietal rules -- when young men and women could be together in dormitory rooms -- that got out of hand. 
 When the university was closed in early May, the anger soon spread to central Paris, to the Latin Quarter and the Sorbonne, where the student elite demonstrated against antiquated university rules, and then outward, to workers in the big factories.
 Scenes of the barricades, the police charges and the tear gas are dear to the French, recaptured in every magazine and scores of books, including one by photographer Marc Riboud, now 84, called: ''Under the Cobblestones,'' a reference to a famous slogan of the time from the leader-jester, Mr. Cohn-Bendit, now a member of the European Parliament: ''Under the cobblestones, the beach.''
 Mr. Cohn-Bendit, known then as ''Danny the Red'' for the color of both his politics and his hair, is also thought responsible for other famous slogans of the time: ''It is forbidden to forbid'' and ''Live without limits and enjoy without restraint!'' -- with the word for enjoy, ''jouir,'' having the double meaning of sexual climax. 
 The injunction was especially potent in a straight-laced country where the birth-control pill had been authorized for sale only the year before, noted Alain Geismar, another leader of the time.
 Mr. Geismar, a physicist who spent 18 months in jail -- but later served as a counselor to government ministers -- wrote his own book, ''My May 1968.''
 Now 69, Mr. Geisner, a former Maoist, uses an iPhone. He happily displays his music catalog, which is mostly Mozart.
 The movement succeeded ''as a social revolution, not as a political one,'' he said. While the de Gaulle government responded with the police and mobilized troops in case the students marched on the presidential palace, he said the idea never occurred to student leaders, who talked of revolution but never intended to carry one out. 
 Most significantly, Mr. Geismar noted, the movement was ''the beginning of the end of the Communist Party in France,'' which deeply opposed the revolt of these young leftists it could not control.
 The leftists also managed in important ways to break the party's authority over the big industrial unions.
 The society of May 1968 ''was completely blocked,'' Mr. Geismar said -- a conservative recreation of pre-World War II society, shaken by the Algerian war and the baby boom, its schools badly overcrowded.
 ''As a divorced man, Sarkozy couldn't have been invited to dinner at the Elysee Palace, let alone be elected president of France,'' Mr. Geismar said. Both the vivid personal life and political success of Mr. Sarkozy, with foreign and Jewish roots, ''are unimaginable without 1968,'' he said. ''The neo-conservatives are unimaginable without '68.''
 Andre Glucksmann, who still supports Mr. Sarkozy as the best chance to modernize ''the gilded museum of France'' and reduce the power of ''the sacralized state,'' is amused by Mr. Sarkozy's fierce campaign attack on the events of May 1968.
 ''Sarkozy is the first post-'68 president,'' Mr. Glucksmann said. ''To liquidate '68 is to liquidate himself.''
 But there is also a fashionable absurdity to the commemoration. The designers Sonia Rykiel and Agnes b. discuss their views of May 1968 in every magazine, there are documentaries and discussions on every channel and a Parisian jeweler, Jean Dinh Van, Vietnamese-born, has reissued a silver cobblestone pendant he made at the time, ''to celebrate 40 years of liberty'' -- and, in his case, success.

HEADLINE: Who Is Getting the Mortgage Aid?

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Fewer than 2,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure have been helped by a Federal Housing Administration program that President Bush promised would help homeowners who had fallen behind on their mortgage payments, federal housing statistics show.
 F.H.A. officials have asserted in recent weeks that more than 150,000 people have benefited from the program, which was intended to help troubled homeowners refinance into stable, government-issued loans. But the vast majority of participants have been homeowners who have made their mortgage payments on time, not the borrowers in crisis who were the targets of the president's plan, the statistics show.
 Housing officials, who initially expected that 60,000 or more delinquent borrowers would benefit, say they greatly overestimated the demand from troubled homeowners. 
 But they say the program, known as F.H.A. Secure, has helped people who were anticipating difficulties in paying their mortgages. Such homeowners were able to refinance before they fell behind, officials say.
 ''They came to us before they got into trouble,'' said Stephen C. O'Halloran, a spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the F.H.A. ''We'd rather have them come to us before they fell behind on their loans.'' 
 But some lawmakers and industry analysts say that the statistics prove that the program, which was announced by Mr. Bush in August, has failed to help the most vulnerable homeowners and, consequently, has failed to ease the foreclosure crisis significantly.
 Democratic lawmakers estimate that at least 1.5 million people have fallen behind on their mortgage payments. Yet from October 2007 through the end of March, only 1,729 delinquent mortgages were refinanced by F.H.A., housing statistics show. Officials project that 4,000 such mortgages will be refinanced by the end of September.
 More than 400,000 mortgages will be refinanced through F.H.A. Secure this year, officials say. Of those, only about 4,000 will be held by homeowners who have fallen behind on their payments, the statistics show. 
 ''F.H.A. Secure, while a good idea, is not addressing the magnitude of the problem,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is the chairman of the Banking Committee, said at a hearing this month. He is calling for legislation that would help many more troubled borrowers.
 Scott Stern of Lenders One, an alliance of mortgage bankers based in St. Louis, called the program's record with the neediest homeowners ''a tragedy.''
 ''F.H.A. is helping borrowers who aren't currently in trouble and that is fine,'' Mr. Stern said. ''But there is a specific subset of borrowers right now who are in trouble. The program needs to be helping people who need the help immediately.''
 Housing officials say they have worked hard to reach such borrowers. In August, the program was tailored toward low-income homeowners who were falling behind because of interest rate increases on their adjustable-rate mortgages. The officials say that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve reduced the number of such people.
 Homeowners who were not delinquent on their loans, however, were hearing about the F.H.A.'s refinancing programs for the first time as HUD expanded its outreach. The phones at F.H.A. started ringing as consumers and lenders tried to get more information about the new program.
 ''I think a lot of people thought we were the Federal Highway Administration,'' Brian Montgomery, the F.H.A. commissioner, told lawmakers this month. 
 Until recently, Mr. Montgomery said, ''we were almost an afterthought for many borrowers.''
 The publicity surrounding the program led to a surge of refinance business for F.H.A., mostly from homeowners in good standing with their mortgage companies. From October 2007 through the end of March, F.H.A. refinanced 131,881 conventional loans. Only 43,397 conventional loans were refinanced in the period a year earlier, statistics show. 
 This month, the Bush administration announced that it would broaden the eligibility criteria for F.H.A. Secure to help larger numbers of troubled homeowners.
 Under the original program announced in August, homeowners were eligible to refinance only if they were current on their mortgages before their interest rates spiked. Under the new plan, homeowners who fall behind because of extenuating conditions -- lost jobs, declining wages, family illnesses -- are eligible, regardless of whether their rates have increased or not. 
 Officials say the change would allow an additional 100,000 people to refinance this year.
 ''We're trying to figure out how to serve consumers caught up in economic circumstances,'' said Meg Burns, director of F.H.A.'s single family program development.
 ''Interest rates are no longer spiking,'' Ms. Burns said. ''People are going into delinquency not as a result of the resets, but because of the local economy.''
 Advocates for homeowners say the changes represent some progress, but not enough. 
 The F.H.A. still requires borrowers hoping to refinance to have made 10 on-time payments in the 12 months before they went into default. That will block many borrowers, said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, which helps people in underserved communities get credit.

HEADLINE: In His Own Words, Then and Now

 BODY:
Excerpts of prepared remarks made by Senator Barack Obama on March 18 in his speech on race, addressing the sermons of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.: 
 '' I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely -- just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed. 
 But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's effort to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country -- a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. 
 As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems -- two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all ... 
 But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. The man I met more than 20 years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor. He is a man who served his country as a U.S. Marine, who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country, and who for over 30 years led a church that serves the community by doing God's work here on Earth -- by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries ... As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me.''
