HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Rally in Gold Prices Begins On Signs of Mideast Buying

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in two months yesterday as sharply lower stock prices, a weaker dollar and signs of Middle Eastern buying revived investors' interest in the metal.
On other commodity markets, silver rose; energy futures climbed; livestock and meat futures retreated, and grains and soybeans were mostly higher. 
Gold futures settled $7.70 to $7.80 higher on New York's Commodity Exchange, with the contract for delivery in August up $7.70, at $369.70 an ounce. The spot July contract settled at $369.10 an ounce, the highest settlement of a spot contract since May 22.
Silver futures settled 3 cents to 3.4 cents higher, with July at $4.882 an ounce.
Gold opened with a surge in New York following news of a large purchase of gold bullion in London that analysts believe originated in the Middle East. Some previous Middle Eastern transactions have been large enough to swing prices wildly, leaving the market sensitive to signs of interest in the region.
And the Dow Jones industrial average's early plunge of 107 points sent many stock investors fleeing to the perceived safety of precious metals. The stock market slowly trimmed its losses throughout the day, but gold remained strong. New support stemmed from higher oil prices - an inflationary signal - and a weaker dollar.
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said the Federal Reserve Board's recent moves to lower interest rates had been a boon to the gold market.
Energy futures continued to rise amid optimism that OPEC oil ministers meeting this week in Geneva will agree on measures to reduce their crude output and raise prices. The organization's midyear meeting begins Thursday.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Educating Engineers For Top Posts

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
MANY engineering schools have been broadening their curriculums to hone the management skills of their students, so that they can hold more top management positions.
The changes are coming at a time when deans of many engineering schools are struggling to stay abreast of the rapid changes in technology.
''Curriculum changes are constantly under study,'' John R. McLaughlin, associate dean of engineering at Purdue University, said recently. ''We have to prepare our engineers today for things that we cannot even imagine. So the best we can do is to identifiy building blocks with enough humanistic and communication skills so engineers can continue to grow after graduation.'' 
Dr. McLaughlin said that when he graduated from engineering school 40 years ago, ''I could have lasted 10 years before becoming technologically obsolete.'' Now an engineer ''has only five years at best before obsolescence,'' he added. ''Engineers need education every day.''
But Dr. McLaughlin said he did not foresee radical changes in Purdue's engineering program. Instead, the university will stress the importance of continuous postgraduate study to keep up with change.
A few years ago there was talk that leading engineering schools might urge undergraduates to take five years to complete their education. Dartmouth College requires this, and so do a few other schools, permitting more liberal arts programs. ''Cornell and Ohio State used to insist on five years also, but no longer,'' Dr. McLaughlin said. He noted that engineering schools had not agreed on such an approach and said that ''our product seems to be quite acceptable to United States companies.''
At least a fourth of engineering school graduates eventually work toward master's degrees. Others keep up with change by participating in seminars, many of them sent by satellite or television links.
''We granted more than 40 master's degrees in engineering this year to students who never set foot on the Purdue campus,'' Dr. McLaughlin said. They listened to lectures in a company auditorium or on local campuses by means of a television network called the Indiana Higher Education Television System, and they were able to interact with students and professors at other locations.
The National Technological University, which has its headquarters in Fort Collins, Colo., and offers master's degree programs in a similar way, provides more and more short courses aimed at broadening an engineer's education. These have titles like Fundamentals of Crisis Management, Moving Into Management, Economics and Statistics for Managers of Technology, Sales Management and Marketing for Customer Retention in the 90's.
David G. Vice, vice chairman, products and technololgy, for Northern Telecom Ltd., one of Canada's largest companies, recently stressed the need for broadening engineering education at a joint session of American and Canadian engineering groups. ''A broad education leaves engineers better prepared to communicate, to avoid technological obsolescence and to learn new skills as technology advances,'' he said.
He added that the discipline had some pressing needs, including increasing the number of women engineers. ''Young engineers must learn foreign languages and cultures,'' he said. This could be done in part by more bilateral exchanges ''to advance international cooperation and knowledge,'' he added.
Mr. Vice urged that there be more ''joint research endeavors'' between universities and companies. With the use of computers and other tools, engineers ''will be less involved in routine work and more involved in the formulation of ideas and in the making of choices,'' he told the engineering groups.
He urged other companies to do what his did - ''work hard to give engineers status and keep them informed about how important they are to our success.''
They must be taught managerial and business skills, he said, if they wanted to be a more important part of management. He emphasized the importance of subjects like international economics and technical communications, along with continued broadening of undergraduate backgrounds in the humanities and the social sciences.
He said he was concerned about a shortage of faculty in engineering schools and about the lack of industrial experience of professors, and urged that companies ''encourage professors to spend their sabbaticals working in offices and laboratories.''

HEADLINE: Manville Net Declines 24%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DENVER, July 23

 BODY:
Citing eroding construction-related markets, the Manville Corporation today reported second-quarter earnings of $52.6 million, or 41 cents a share, down 24 percent from $69.4 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales were $561.1 million in the quarter, down slighlty from the $564.6 million reported a year earlier. 
For the first six months of 1990, the company reported net income of $77.5 million, or 58 cents a share, down 25 percent from $103.8 million, or 80 cents a share, in 1989. Sales were up slightly over the first six months of last year, at $1.08 billion, compared with $1.07 billion during the period last year.
''Our second-quarter results reflect a mixture of forces driving our company,'' said Tom Stephens, chairman, chief executive and president of the Denver-based building products company.
''Construction-related markets continued to erode slowly, and while demand for our coated paperboard products was strong, packaging sales were down,'' he said.
''In Brazil, our domestic markets continue to be negatively affected by the country's new economic program, but our exports from Brazil remain on target,'' Mr. Stephens said. ''We remain confident about Manville's long-term prospects in Brazil and continue to strengthen our position in worldwide paper markets.''
Mr. Stephens said the competitive pressures in all of the company's product lines were expected to intensify during the second half of 1990.
Manville, which employs more than 18,000 worldwide, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 1982 as it faced billions of dollars' worth of lawsuits stemming from asbestos-related operations. The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 1988 with a plan to repay creditors and people claiming personal injury or property damage from asbestos.

HEADLINE: U.S. Policies Criticized by Allies in Asia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 24

 BODY:
America's allies in Southeast Asia today bitterly criticized Washington's policies on Indochina and refugees as inconsistent and counterproductive.
The nations at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations here issued a joint statement repeating their collective threat to stop giving asylum to Vietnamese boat people unless Washington altered its stand and allowed the mandatory repatriation of Vietnamese judged to be not refugees but economic migrants.
The open and sometimes patronizing criticism of American policy by the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, will make the visit here of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, starting late Thursday, less ceremonial and polite than usual.
''I think Mr. Baker is in for a rough time,'' a senior Asean official said. 
 
Criticism of Washington Policy
The Foreign Ministers of Asean members - Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines - are here for their annual meeting, which is followed by discussions that are usually routine with their colleagues from major allies like the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan.
Criticism from the Asean nations continued today over the American shift on Cambodian policy last week, when Washington withdrew diplomatic support at the United Nations for an opposition coalition including the Khmer Rouge. Among those who complained about the shift today was Singapore's Foreign Minister, Wong Kan Seng, who said he was unable to understand the logic of the American move.
But after a joint Asean statement on Cambodia issued Monday night, it was Washington's policy on Vietnamese boat people that got the most attention today.
A joint statement by Asean criticized the United States for being inconsistent and risking the ''breakdown of international understanding'' on protecting refugees.
 
Screening of Boat People
The statement repeated Asean's threat to abandon its commitment to provide refuge to boat people ''in a more coordinated and concerted manner'' unless Washington shifted position. For over a year now, only Malaysia has been turning away Vietnamese boats.
In Geneva two weeks ago, a 28-nation conference on Vietnamese boat people, which was to have been held at the headquarters of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, was postponed when it became clear that differences between the United States and Vietnam on one side and the Southeast Asian nations and Hong Kong on the other had not been bridged.
In June 1989 Washington agreed that Vietnamese boat people landing in the region should be screened to see if they are real refugees, fleeing persecution, or only economic migrants seeking a better life. But unlike its policy with Haitians or Mexicans, Washington will not allow Vietnamese economic migrants to be deported against their will back to Vietnam.
In that policy, which ''sees Vietnam as a uniquely reprehensible nation,'' an Asean diplomat said, the United States finds itself in agreement only with Vietnam, which says it will not accept the forcible repatriation of its citizens on humanitarian grounds.
 
Threat to First Asylum
The American position has infuriated Hong Kong and the Asean countries, who provide first asylum, or temporary refuge, to the boat people. While those judged refugees are guaranteed resettlement in the West, the rest are ''piling up,'' as a Malaysian official said.
The Malaysian Foreign Minister, Abu Hassan Omar, said today that the American position only ''provides comfort and protection to Vietnamese intransigence.'' By insisting Vietnamese migrants are different, he said, America ''puts the very principle of first asylum in peril.''
American and United Nations officials say that Malaysia has already done that by pushing off the boats of Vietnamese refuge seekers. Since May 1989, United Nations officials say, the Malaysians have pushed off more than 8,700 Vietnamese, many of whom have since landed in Indonesia. How many may have died on the way is unknown.
In an effort to change Washington's stand, or at least get Washington and Vietnam to house those rejected economic migrants on their territory, the Asean countries and Hong Kong said in May that they reserved the right to abandon first asylum ''to safeguard their national interests.''
 
Forced Repatriation
The countries set a deadline of July 1, but only Malaysia is now pushing off boats. They wanted to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to try to work out a deal with Washington.
The Commissioner has pursued a distinction between ''involuntary repatriation,'' which Hanoi says it will accept, and ''forcible repatriation,'' which it will not. If migrants can be induced to return home without volunteering to do so, but without the use of force. Hanoi, it seems, is satisfied.
But Washington is not, officials say. The Bush Administration, in particular the National Security Council, ''has put so many conditions on involuntary repatriation that it is in reality voluntary,'' an Asean diplomat said today.
''We need a clear statement from the U.S. supporting involuntary repatriation,'' he continued. ''Otherwise there is no solution and no deterrent.''
 
Flexible Stance for Baker
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Special to The New York Times) - Secretary of State Baker will try to head off confrontations with the Asean nations in Jakarta by seeking to take flexible positions on Cambodia and Vietnamese refugees, State Department officials said today.
As Mr. Baker prepared to leave Wednesday for a 12-day tour of Indonesia, Singapore, the Soviet Union and Mongolia, American officials privately commented that it was a sign of the times that his easiest stops would be in the two Communist countries.
On the Administration's Cambodia policy, one State Department official said Mr. Baker would combine ''explanation and co-optation'' to demonstrate to the Asean officials that ''we have not shifted our policy as much as reports seem to indicate.''
Administration officials say Mr. Baker will stress that the Administration remains pledged to providing assistance to the two non-Communist guerrilla groups loosely aligned with the Khmer Rouge, who presided over the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during their reign in the 1970's.
He will continue to oppose the involuntary return of Vietnamese, which is proposed by Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian nations to clear out their teaming refugee camps. But Mr. Baker will discuss ways in which the nations might cooperate in generating ''voluntary repatriation,'' stressing improved screening and counseling to convince Vietnamese that life in the refugee camps will be hard and will not necessarily lead them to lives in the United States.

HEADLINE: ASYLUM-SEEKERS STRAIN CUBA'S TIES

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, July 24

 BODY:
An influx of Cubans seeking asylum in foreign embassies here has strained relations between the Castro Government and the country's two most important Western economic partners, Spain and Canada. Several unexplained incidents during the crisis have raised suspicions among some Western diplomats that Government agents have infiltrated the would-be refugees.
The refugee flow began on July 9, when five Cubans known as dissidents entered the Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana, saying they suspected their activities put them at risk of arrest.
After five days inside the embassy, some of them left voluntarily. Appearing on Cuban television later, one of the dissidents, Lazaro Cabrera, asserted they had been encouraged to seek asylum by the Czechoslovaks in a plot with the United States to provoke a refugee crisis. His statement led some in Cuba's dissident community to voice suspicions that he had been working with the authorities. 
In the days after the first asylum effort, several more Cubans made their way into the Czechoslovak and Spanish Embassies, some of them managing to get through cordons of barbed wire and numerous police guards at wooden and metal barricades placed around the missions, raising suspicions about their true identities among diplomats.
 
Harsh Diplomatic Exchanges
Last week, several of the Cubans who had made their way into Czechoslovak diplomatic premises became violent, briefly taking diplomats hostage, destroying property and threatening to blow up the mission. Western diplomats say that those Cubans were almost certainly disguised agents.
The crisis escalated on Friday, when Cuban police officers fired warning shots and followed a man onto the patio of the Spanish Embassy before dragging him away. The incident led to a series of increasingly harsh diplomatic exchanges between Havana and Madrid, with Spain cutting off its economic aid and recalling its Ambassador on Monday to protest Cuba's handling of the refugee crisis.
As of today, 18 Cuban asylum-seekers remained inside the Spanish Embassy, four were at an Italian diplomatic residence and three were inside the Swiss Embassy. And the West German and Canadian Embassies have been publicly accused by the Cuban Government of taking part in an effort to fan the crisis and have been sealed off by the police.
Canada is the largest source of Western visitors in Cuba's increasingly vital tourism industry.
 
Western Conspiracy Asserted
All of the Cubans who had sought refuge at the Czechoslovak Embassy left voluntarily last week.
Havana has sought to portray the crisis as a Western conspiracy aimed at creating a political crisis at a time of growing economic difficulty.
Western diplomats uniformly deny the Cuban assertion and say that the crisis was either manufactured from the start or quickly manipulated by Cuban authorities anxious to prevent a repetition of the 1980 refugee crisis, when thousands of Cubans sought refuge at the Peruvian Embassy, leading to an embarrassing exodus through the port of Mariel by 125,000 disenchanted Cubans to the United States.
By sending agents into the embassies to commit violently disruptive acts, the diplomats say, the Cuban Government was attempting to depict all asylum-seekers as dangerous criminals. But the diplomats have different theories as to whether the authorities instigated the entire affair, or acted to take advantage of a spontaneous incident.
 
'Quite a Novel Technique'
''The basic objective of Castro here was to try to pre-empt the whole asylum issue to prevent the kind of thing that happened in Albania recently,'' said a senior Western diplomat, who suggested that the crisis had been planned from the start by Havana but quickly got out of hand. ''It is quite a novel technique to teach a lesson to any would-be asylees, and also to send a message to the foreign missions.''
''But it is kind of a risky business, and besides, it won't work,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on the condition he not be named.
A Western diplomat from another country who also insisted on anonymity discounted the idea that the crisis had been instigated from the start by the Cuban Government, but said that several security agents had infiltrated the embassies soon after the initial rush began.
That diplomat said that the Cuban Government appeared to have wanted to use the crisis to rally the population in anticipation of the expected announcement next month of dramatic reductions in Soviet subsidies for Cuba. The diplomat said the dispute with Spain will likely have the greater costs in terms of economic support.
 
Dissident Appears on TV
One of the dissidents who appeared on Cuban television to implicate the United States, Tania Diaz Castro, is a prominent leader of the Cuban Human Rights Party who has spent most of the last two years in jail.
Diplomats and fellow dissidents said they believed that Miss Diaz had cooperated with officials to gain lenient treatment for herself. She is in prison currently, and could face execution or a long sentence for her supposed involvement in a terrorist conspiracy.
''They broke her,'' said one prominent dissident of the Government's use of Miss Diaz. ''It is sad, but it does not surprise me. These are manuevers of the cold war.''

HEADLINE: Deficit Raises as Much Alarm As Illegal Drugs, a Poll Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

 BODY:
The American public now cites the Federal budget deficit as frequently as it mentions illegal drugs as the most important problem facing the country, according to the latest Gallup Poll.
The shift to parity between the two problems is significant because the drug problem had dominated the public's agenda for more than a year, previously swamping people's concern about the deficit or other problems.
Twenty-one percent of the 1,242 adults interviewed by Gallup from Thursday to Sunday said the Federal budget deficit was the most important problem facing the country. This was virtually identical to the 18 percent who cited the problem of illegal drugs. 
But both priorities had shifted since an April Gallup Poll, when only 6 percent of the public mentioned the deficit as the nation's No. 1 problem while 30 percent mentioned drugs.
Both national telephone polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Shift to Dissatisfaction
On another question in the new poll, 51 percent of the public expressed dissatisfaction with ''the way things are going in the United States at this time,'' while 45 percent said they were satisfied.
This represents a shift toward greater dissatisfaction since Gallup last asked the question in February. At that time, 55 percent expressed satisfaction with the country's direction, while only 39 percent were dissatisfied.
In the new poll, 60 percent of the public approved of the way President Bush is handling his job. That is virtually unchanged from the 63 percent who approved in a Gallup Poll taken earlier this month, but clearly down from the 69 percent approval level in a June Gallup Poll.
But the Gallup Poll taken earlier this month, just after Mr. Bush renounced his ''read my lips - no new taxes'' pledge, showed that majorities disapproved of the President's handling of several economic particulars that may be coming together in the public's mind. For instance, 58 percent disapproved of Mr. Bush's handling of the savings and loan crisis, 64 disapproved of his handling of the budget deficit and 54 percent disapproved of his announcement that he would consider increasing taxes, if necessary, to reduce that deficit.
President Bush's peak to date was 80 percent in January, in the aftermath of the United States invasion of Panama.
Fifty-six percent of the public said the savings and loan crisis was very serious for the United States. But in their analysis of the poll, George Gallup Jr. and Frank Newport found ''no clear evidence that the savings and loan crisis is behind general dissatisfaction or the declines in Bush approval.'' Whom to Blame? The Gallup researchers pointed out that very few Americans spontaneously mentioned the savings and loan crisis as the No. 1 problem facing the country, and that more people put the blame for the situation on savings and loan management or on government in general than on President Bush, former President Ronald Reagan or Congress.
An optimistic finding in the poll was that when Americans were asked about their own personal lives, rather than the direction of the country, the satisfaction level remained high and unchanged. In the latest poll 81 percent said they were satisfied with the way things were going in their personal lives, virtually identical to the 83 percent who gave that answer in a February Gallup Poll.

HEADLINE: The Right Way to Raise Taxes

 BODY:
An attitudinal dam broke when President Bush last month grudgingly acknowledged he could swallow new taxes. There was a wave of relief that finally the country could control its towering fiscal deficits. But now the rush has worn off and the Congressional budget negotiators are finally getting down to the hard part: deciding how to raise revenues. 
Many Democrats want to raise the tax rate on the highest incomes. Others, especially Republicans, want to leave tax rates largely undisturbed but achieve more revenue by limiting deductions that mainly benefit the rich. If the budget negotiators don't lose sight of the need to raise revenues fairly, agreement could be in sight.
By limiting deductions, Congress could raise large amounts of revenues and protect the poor, all without unraveling the tax brackets negotiated as part of the 1986 tax reform. That would amount to a notable fiscal achievement.
Capping deductions would not be a necessary evil brought on by fiscal crisis. It would be no evil at all. Fringe benefits and itemized deductions have mushroomed into glaring tax dodges for upper-income families. About half of all itemized deductions are taken by families earning more than $50,000 a year. Limiting these deductions would target upper-income families. Meanwhile, the economy as a whole would be spared many of the negative effects of increasing tax rates on decisions to work and invest.
Congress could cap dozens of deductions. For example, individuals do not pay tax on the value of medical insurance paid for by employers. Even if Congress wishes to promote basic health insurance, why should taxpayers subsidize lavish policies for high-paid executives? A sensible policy would allow deductions for basic medical care, but require individuals to pay tax on anything more.
The same principle applies to mortgage interest. Whether Congress needs to subsidize home ownership at all is debatable. But current rules subsidize the purchase of fabulously expensive mansions and vacation homes. Further limiting the deduction would make the tax code fairer.
Why should the Federal tax code lessen the impact of state and local income taxes? After all, residents reap the advantage of these taxes in the form of improved schools and other public services. Capping just the deductions for mortgage interest and state and local income taxes could easily generate at least $1 billion a year.
To gain revenue from deduction caps rather than tax rate raises has another important advantage. Rate increases on high incomes would traduce the 1986 tax reform. If that deal is undone, it would clear the way for President Bush to pursue his misguided attempt to grant special tax treatment for capital gains.
Special treatment for capital gains is unwarranted. But Congress could use this opportunity to index capital gains, thereby offsetting the effect of inflation on future investments in stocks and bonds. That would tax capital gains and ordinary income alike, which is what the tax reform of 1986 promised. And because capital gains are primarily earned by wealthy families, indexation would take some of the sting out of capping deductions.
There is, in short, no good case to be made for raising rates now. There are powerful reasons, including fairness and progressivity, for limiting deductions. If Congress and the Administration can resist distracting arguments over rate raises, the negotiators can achieve a grand compromise, one that would do credit to both parties. In this rare case, everyone can win.

HEADLINE: Tax Would Hurt Electricity's Role in Reducing Global Warming

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''White House Gases'' (editorial, July 11) is on target in stating that ''sensible precautions'' can be taken now to address the global climate-change issue. But the editorial fails to mention a key component in the search for options to address this issue: electricity.
Electricity is moving our country toward greater energy efficiency and consequently is reducing energy-related emissions. From 1983 to 1989, overall energy demand increased 9 percent, while electricity use grew more than 50 percent. A study conducted for Edison Electric Institute found that electrification in the transportation and industrial sectors can reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly. In fact, electric applications can decrease CO#2 emissions in industrial processes and in the transportation sector by 17 percent and 8 percent, respectively. 
In addition, electric utilities are spending more than $1 billion annually on energy-efficiency programs. Demand-side management programs have resulted in an estimated deferral of 21,000 megawatts of new capacity (42 medium-size power plants), and will result in deferring a total of 45,000 megawatts by the year 2000. Energy-efficiency gains can also be achieved when generating electricity. These efficiencies are achieved not only through new technologies like clean coal plants, but also through retooling existing plants.
But energy taxes could dramatically change the efficiency story. These taxes could add $12 billion per year to the already high price tag footed by electricity consumers for environmental protection. There is no fairness in a tax that would hit low-income households the hardest, affect heavily industrialized states disproportionately, and severely hamper our economic competitiveness in world markets.
As a country we must continue to press for energy efficiency in the residential, industrial, commercial and transportation sectors. The environmental benefits of an energy tax, however, are questionable. As we grapple with options to address future environmental concerns, we should not be adding taxes that will keep electricity from being part of the solution.

HEADLINE: Pact Reached To Save Water In New York

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
New York City, threatened with a state ban on all new building in a third of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens because sewage treatment in those areas is inadequate, has agreed to enforce far-reaching water conservation measures.
Under the agreement, details of which are being negotiated, the city would be obligated to accelerate conservation measures like installing water meters and detecting groundwater leaks into storm sewers in the areas served by the Newtown Creek sewage treatment plant in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, the city's largest.
In the next few years, the water conservation measures would be extended to neighborhoods served by the city's 13 other sewage treatment plants, said Thomas C. Jorling, the state's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation. It would be the first time the city has legally committed itself to enforce widespread water conservation. 
Under the agreement, the measures will begin immediately in the area served by the Newtown Creek plant.
 
Cost Not Clear
It was not clear yesterday what the program would cost. The city was already planning to spend more than $300 million over the next 10 years to install water meters in all five boroughs.
The city acted because it faced a ban on new sewer hookups, which amounted to a ban on all new building, in the area served by the plant - the northern half of Brooklyn, bits of Queens, and all of Manhattan below below 14th Street on the West Side and below 72d on the East Side.
The state threatened the ban, which was due to go into effect a week from today, because the Newtown Creek plant has been accepting more sewage and waste water than allowed under its state permit, and has passed inadequately treated waste into local waterways. There are 1.1 million residents in the area served by the plant.
If homes and offices cut down their use of water, and leaks of groundwater from water mains are kept out of the storm sewers, less waste water enters the 23-year-old plant, which puts less strain on its equipment and allows it to treat sewage more thoroughly. The plant had been designed to accommodate 310 million gallons a day, but has been routinely exceeding that amount.
The threatened ban on sewer hookups had deeply worried city officials and the real-estate community. The city is already suffering an economic slump, and the ban could have disrupted planning for future developments. The state only recently lifted a 30-month moratorium on sewer hookups in 26 municipalities in Westchester County.
The agreement was disclosed yesterday by Mr. Jorling and Albert F. Appleton, the city's Commissioner of Environmental Protection. It has been worked out in the last month, and the two sides hope to complete it by the end of the week.
Also, the city has committed itself to accelerating a program for pressing industry to cut down on toxic discharges through the sewer system, Mr. Jorling said. The city has long been obligated to carry out such a program under the Federal Clean Water Act, but progress has been slow.
The city will also be obliged to reduce the amount of heavy metals like copper and lead that originate with city water pipes and are carried into sewage treatment plants. The plants are not equipped to removed toxic metals from waste water and as a result, release them into the city's rivers, where they are carried in the water and absorbed in bottom sediments.
If the city failed to comply with the agreement, it would face a ban on new sewer hookups in eight months, Mr. Jorling said.
Mr. Jorling and Mr. Appleton would not discuss specific provisions of the agreement because they were still being negotiated. But Mr. Jorling insisted that the pact would force the city to take actions that it had not contemplated doing.
 
Sensitive to Appearances
That is a sensitive point because state officials do not want to be seen as having backed down from a sewer hookup ban, which is a powerful instrument, in the face of city pressure. Instead, Mr. Jorling said the threat of the ban pressured city officials into agreeing to binding commitments.
In the past, environmental groups have criticized the state for letting the city get away with environmental violations. Katherine Kennedy, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said it was difficult to evaluate the accord without seeing specific provisions.
But she said her organization and others had long pressed for enforceable citywide water conservation goals. In the long term, an agreement that specified such goals would be beneficial, she said.
Ms. Kennedy added, however, that in the short term, the Newtown Creek plant would still continue to operate over capacity and pollute the East River.
 
Plant Expansion Planned
Ms. Kennedy put the average flow at Newtown Creek for the 12 months between April 1989 and March 1990 at more than 326 million gallons a day, 16 million over the design capacity. The chief engineer for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Joseph T. Miller, also estimated the flow in the 320-million-gallon range. The plant serves 1.1 million people.
The city is already planning a $1.2 billion, 50-million-gallon expansion of Newtown Creek that will take 10 years. The plant's treatment process will also be upgraded to comply with Federal pollution requirements.

HEADLINE: New York City Still Growing, Studies Assert

BYLINE: By THOMAS MORGAN

 BODY:
Economists, demographers and city planners say the population of New York City has continued to grow and is now larger than ever - 8 million - an assertion that challenges official estimates, demographic trends and conventional wisdom.
The figure, reached most recently in a new study by a New York University economist, is larger than estimates by the Census Bureau and highlights a long-running dispute between the Federal agency and urban officials. New York and other cities have contended that the Census has undercounted their populations, costing them Federal aid and seats in Congress.
The 8 million figure for New York exceeds the Government's estimate by about 700,000 people, more than the population of Boston, for example.
Researchers have also found that by the end of the 1980's New York City had not only grown but had become younger. The average age of its population had dropped partly because of the second-largest wave of immigration to the city in this century. The influx - chiefly from Asia, the Caribbean and South and Central America - has consisted of large numbers of children and young adults who have begun to change New York, much as the larger migration of Italians, Poles, Jews, Russians and Greeks did at the turn of the century. 
 
Wide Implications
Census Bureau figures for the 1980's do not show this growth in population. But statisticians and demographers in New York City's Department of Planning as well as economists who have conducted their own studies have said that the bureau's estimates for New York City are too low.
This view is supported by a study that is to be released soon by the Urban Research Center at the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at N.Y.U. The study uses the 1980 Census count for New York City as a base and then projects population growth to 1987 by using information about births, deaths, enrollments in public and private schools, Social Security recipients and various other demographic indicators.
The New York University study and others achieving similar results have striking implications for city planners, who must determine how to allocate precious city resources to serve a much younger, child-bearing population. New York City public school officials, who have started an extensive school rebuilding plan, estimate that next fall's student enrollment will be 946,438, the highest in a decade.
The N.Y.U. study, by Emmanuel Tobier, an economics professor at the Urban Research Center and a former chief economist for the Regional Plan Association, highlights population increases among immigrants as well as among teen-agers and young adults in the major racial and cultural groups.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said last week that if the conclusions of Mr. Tobier and other economists are correct, the undercount would have ''serious repercussions'' for the city. Mr. Tobier's study says the Census Bureau's 1988 estimate of the city's population fell short of the actual number by 700,000; if so, New York City residents would be entitled to significant additional representation in Congress and in the State Legislature and more money in state and Federal revenue-sharing grants.
 
Counting Is Difficult
Counting people in large cities, particularly those with many immigrants, has always been difficult for demographers. But several university economists who specialize in demographics, economists at the Regional Plan Association and demographers in the city's Planning Department say that the city's population is closer to 8 million than the 7,353,000 estimated by the Census Bureau in 1988.
Demographers say census figures show that the city's population hovered around 7.8 million people from 1950 to 1970, despite a large migration out of the city and a nationwide population shift from inner cities to the suburbs. In keeping New York's numbers relatively stable, immigrants made the difference, demographers say.
''In view of the possible difficulty in establishing the 1990 census, somebody ought be be ready with credible numbers to question the Census,'' Mr. Tobier said.
Mr. Tobier said he based his numbers on largely the same demographic variables employed by the Census Bureau but used different and more accurate mathematical formulas to interpret the data. Demographers say the methods he used are not unusual.
Mr. Tobier said the Census Bureau estimated that the city grew by 3.5 percent between 1980 to 1987, from 7,071,000 to 7,317,000. His projection found a growth rate of 10 percent during that period. That includes a 28 percent growth in the birth rate between 1980 and 1989, compared with a rate of 11 percent nationwide.
 
A Populous 15-to-44 Group
The fastest growing category, according to the N.Y.U. study, was that of 15- to 44-year-olds, the prime working and child-bearing group. Their numbers rose by 20 percent from 1980 to 1987. Young people in this group make up about 50 percent of the city's white, black and Hispanic residents. About 63 percent of New Yorkers of Asian background are also in this age group.
''The widespread image that the city is in the midst of a population downturn is not supported by the evidence of Tobier's study,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center .
Not everyone agrees with Mr. Tobier or the other researchers who have made similar projections.
Samuel H. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, relies on Census estimates for his projections of the region's labor force and unemployment. He said he has not seen statistics suggesting that the city's population is as large as Mr. Tobier and others say. #100,000 Immigrants a Year Those who have concluded that the population is growing have attributed the phenomenon to immigration. Regina B. Armstrong, an economist and consultant for the Regional Plan Association, said she estimates that 35 percent of the city population is foreign-born. ''All the growth comes from new arrivals, and there are more arrivals than there is net growth in the population,'' she said.
City demographers say that during the 1980's nearly 100,000 immigrants came to the city each year and that most of them stayed.
The studies show that New York City is more crowded than ever, and the effects can be seen in greater traffic congestion, a growing demand for low-cost housing and the doubling-up among low-income families.
Roy Metcalf, a spokesman for the city's Housing Authority, said that in 1989 more than 22,000 first-time applicants for public housing gave a home address indicating that they already lived in public housing, by doubling up with other families. He said almost 40,000 families are doubled-up in Housing Authority projects.
 
'Something Is Happening'
Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said automobile registrations in New York City increased by 24 percent between 1980 and 1988. But the Census Bureau reported that in the same period both the number of households and the population grew by only about 4 percent.
''Clearly something is happening,'' Ms. Scanlon said. ''The household figures come from the Census study, and I presume that either more people are driving, or the Census numbers are wrong.''
A population undercount can have profound implications for New York City's government and residents.
''The 1980 undercount has cost New York City one Congressional seat and as much as $900 million in Federal and state financial aid over the past decade,'' said Victor Kovner, New York City's Corporation Counsel. New York was among several cities two years ago that unsuccessfully challenged the Census Bureau's 1980 count, contending that it undercounted minorities, immigrants and the homeless. Mr. Kovner said the city would mount another challenge if it believed that the 1990 Census results were too low.
City officials also use population data to assist in allocating money for schools, parks, housing and hospitals, among other beneficiaries.
 
Impact on Industry
An undercount can also effect industry. Businesses use census data to select locations for supermarkets, retail stores and manufacturing plants as well as to market new products.
''The smart marketer today is recognizing that it is very important to develop marketing programs that address the population as a set of distinct and quite separate market segments,'' said Jackie Silver, executive vice president and director of research and planning for Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., the Manhattan advertising agency.
''When we don't get accurate demographic information, marketers and communications experts are not getting the information needed to make the right decisions about how to spend their advertising and product development money,'' Ms. Silver said. ''Ethnic groups are very responsive to promotional programs which tie into products they use heavily. If that group is not represented properly, it's a very serious problem for us.''

HEADLINE: Unions Prepare Boycott Against The Daily News

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Labor leaders at The Daily News announced yesterday that they would organize an ''all-fronts boycott'' against the newspaper.
With contract talks stalled after six months of negotiations, officials of the newspaper's 10 unions said they had concluded that a boycott by advertisers and readers - or at least the imminent threat of one - could help force management into what they called a responsible stance at the bargaining table.
Contracts at the 71-year-old newspaper, owned by the Tribune Company of Chicago, expired March 30.
 
Strategy Isn't Disclosed
''We're going after The Daily News and the Tribune Company,'' said George McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the unions' umbrella group. ''They're the enemy.'' 
However, saying they did not wish to disclose their strategy, the unions' representatives declined to set an actual starting date for the boycott or to say how the unions would try to convince advertisers and readers to stop supporting the paper.
''I don't mean to be flip, but there are some things we'd like to keep to ourselves,'' said Samuel C. McKnight, a Detroit labor lawyer hired last month by The News's 10 unions. He helped plan a successful boycott of a Detroit television station on behalf of a technicians' union three years ago. His principal adversary was Robert Ballow, a Nashville lawyer who is now The News's chief tactician.
A spokesman for The News, John T. Sloan, promptly accused the unions of trying ''to kill the hand that feeds them'' and said The News had already moved to counter any boycott with a stepped-up campaign of upbeat 60-second radio messages featuring testimonials from longtime advertisers.
''Our primary mission at The News is to save and improve thousands of jobs, which will be severely jeopardized if the Allied's counterproductive tactics are attempted,'' Mr. Sloan said. ''We are confident that New Yorkers will overwhelmingly reject this unfortunate and misguided attempt to disrupt and harm the operations of their hometown newspaper.''
Mr. McDonald and Mr. McKnight said the boycott would be aimed at mobilizing The News's display advertisers, classified advertisers, newsstand readers and subscribers.
Asked whether the boycott might eventually be expanded to include other properties of the Tribune Company, Mr. McKnight replied, ''The truthful answer is: We're not going to say.''
The unions' announcement yesterday came less than a week after they began mailing thousands of ''informational letters'' to advertisers alerting them to the possibility that they would be asked to join a boycott.
''Because you support The Daily News with your advertising, you are directly involved in the bitter labor dispute that now exists at the paper,'' the letter said.
Officials of the financially ailing newspaper, who have been spending an estimated $4 million a month preparing for a strike, have tied new contracts to the unions' acceptance of a ''management rights'' provision, which would would give the paper free rein to set hours and working conditions.
 
Doubts Among Unions
The unions have called the demand unacceptable but have vowed not to play into management's hands by walking off the job, which would free the newspaper to fill their jobs with replacement workers. More than 40 potential replacement workers, mostly drivers, have been hired in the last month.
Not everyone connected with the unions was comfortable with the decision to announce a boycott.
At least one union adviser was said to have argued strenuously that a union-led boycott was not advisable now, saying that any action aimed at weakening the paper's already shaky economic base could play into the hands of its Chicago owners, whom the unions have accused of planning either to sell or to close The News.
Others have privately expressed concern that a boycott, or at least a badly timed one, could hurt the unions' cause by alienating advertisers and readers over the summer, a period of slack advertising.
 
'They Can Just Do It'
Labor officials say they remain convinced that management is embarked on a strategy aimed at somehow provoking a strike during the summer, when it could most easily weather the potential advertising losses.
But Mr. McKnight rejected the notion that the boycott would be counterproductive.
''You don't need an excuse to close a business,'' the 45-year-old lawyer said. ''They can just do it.''
A boycott, he said, ''will get the unions closer to contracts by giving the employer an incentive to help develop a constructive solution to our disagreements, one that includes respectable collective bargaining agreements.''
 
Awaiting Word From State
But Mr. Sloan rejected this reasoning, renewing accusations that The News has been victimized by featherbedding and what he called other institutionalized labor abuses. He also accused the unions of deliberate foot-dragging in the contract talks.
The unions' announcement came as both sides awaited word on whether state officials would move ahead on appointment of a fact-finding panel to look into the issues of the dispute.
Some officials close to the proceedings said yesterday that vehement opposition by The News - including a threat to go to Federal court to block any inquiry - might have stirred doubts among high-ranking state officials about the wisdom of the idea.
But city officials, including Eric J. Schmertz, the Labor Relations Commissioner, have strongly backed creation of a state board of inquiry, saying it could help prevent a major labor explosion at The News.
Under a rarely invoked state law, the state labor commissioner is authorized to appoint a board of inquiry if the chairman of the State Mediation Board certifies that efforts to reach a settlement have failed.

On a Remote Soviet Island, Lessons in Capitalism

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 24

 BODY:
A Los Angeles business professor and a Soviet economist have announced that they are introducing the nuts and bolts of capitalism to the inhabitants of the remote Russian island of Sakhalin, north of Japan, in one of the latest free-market experiments in the Soviet Union.
The project, which will send American academics and business executives to help would-be entrepreneurs, is the creation of Valentin P. Fyodorov, who was elected head of the Sakhalin Island government in March.
Mr. Fyodorov, an economist who visited the United States two years ago as a guest of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, enlisted the help of W. F. Kiesner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at the school.
''Valentin's dream is to have a demonstration project on private enterprise and a market economy in a small and isolated area of the Soviet Union, where he can show Moscow that it can indeed work,'' said Mr. Kiesner, who has traveled to the Soviet Union five times in the last two years to lecture on American business practices. 
 
Import of Experiment
The Sakhalin experiment will be closely watched, he said in an interview after the announcement in late June, because there is great debate in the Soviet Union about the appropriate pace for revamping the Soviet economy without central planning.
Under the guidance of Mr. Kiesner, Loyola Marymount University will serve as a center for recruiting American professors and business leaders to serve as consultants to Sakhalin residents.
Mr. Fyodorov's plan differs from other private enterprise programs in the Soviet Union because it will have active official support, said Mr. Kiesner.
''The government in Sakhalin is now saying you can start any business you want, and they will encourage you and provide assistance,'' he said. ''They will cut the red tape and the tremendous bureaucratic opposition that entrepreneurs on the mainland face, which make it very, very difficult to actually start your own business.''
Sakhalin, the site of important Soviet military bases, made headlines in 1983 when a South Korean jetliner was shot down into the sea by a Soviet fighter after the jetliner flew over the southern end of the island.
The thin, 500-mile-long island is populated by 700,000 ethnic Russians, 95,000 members of indigenous tribes and 35,000 ethnic Koreans, who worked as laborers when Japan held the southern half of the island until 1945.
 
One-on-One Training
In addition to helping modify the island's timber, fishing and energy industries, Mr. Kiesner said he hoped to encourage enterpreneurs to open new small businesses on Sakhalin. One of the best ways to do this, he said, is to provide one-on-one training for all segments of the economy.
''The owner of a grocery store could go over there and improve and modify their ways of running food distribution and the grocery business,'' he said. ''In the same way, a dentist could show them the way you run a practice in the private enterprise system of medicine.''
If the island eventually aims to tap the export markets of the United States and Pacific Rim, for which it is geographically well suited, a major obstacle will be the Soviet ruble, which is nonconvertible.
''These problems seem insurmountable at this point, but I think in the next couple of years they can be solved,'' he said. Until then, exporters must develop ''countertrade'' plans, in the same way that Pepsico Inc. takes its profits from Soviet sales in the form of Russian vodka imports.
Another hurdle that American consultants may face is difficulty in teaching basic free-market concepts to Soviet business executives who have worked in a strict, centrally planned economy.
''The idea that the customer is always right might be hard to impart,'' Mr. Kiesner said. ''Up until now, their approach has been that you're awfully lucky if we sell you anything.''

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
English Theater Quick on Political Trigger

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
In the 1970's, during the heyday of the Joint Stock Company and other politically inclined theatrical organizations, English playwrights like Caryl Churchill, David Hare and Howard Brenton often reacted immediately to public issues. Faced with urgent political questions, the writers reached for their quill cudgels.
Except for the agitprop days of the Living Newspaper in the 1930's, playwrights in the United States have traditionally left such quick commentary in the hands of stand-up comics and monologuists. Although in the 1980's this kind of political theater was on the wane in London - possibly because theaters were worried about losing financial support - this summer in London there has been a reawakening of interest in what could be called Theater of the Moment.
As in previous years, the playwrights are led by Miss Churchill, whose new play, ''Mad Forest,'' is an insightful investigation of the revolution in Romania last December that toppled the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu and led to the execution of the Communist dictator and his wife. Simultaneously, the Royal Court Theater sponsored a six-week season of 15 issue-oriented dialogues, under the title ''May Days.'' 
Max Stafford-Clark, the company's artistic director, has explained the impetus for the dialogues: ''The swift course of events in Eastern Europe at the end of 1989 and the end of a decade of Thatcherism here in Britain prompted a wish for a kind of 'Royal Court Instant Response Unit,' able to give a theatrical platform to the immediate debate of political issues.''
The immediacy of the playwrights' response does not necessariy insure wide public attention. The Churchill play is performed on a small stage in the Embassy Theater in North London by students at the Central School of Speech and Drama - a long way from the customary venues of the author of such trans-Atlantic successes as ''Cloud Nine,'' ''Top Girls'' and ''Fen.'' The show is scheduled to conclude its run this weekend. The May Days series, which ended this month, played to embarrassingly small audiences, a fact that was variously attributed to a dearth of publicity, mixed notices and public apathy.
Nevertheless, the plays - in particular, ''Mad Forest'' and Doug Lucie's Royal Court one-act, ''Doing the Business'' - are provocative in the extreme.
Miss Churchill's play, commissioned by the Central School, is an incendiary piece of theater, which moves beyond reportage into a kind of historical analysis. As a play, it still has rough edges. Some scenes are either underdeveloped or overextended. But it has a visceral sense of events happening as the audience watches and a feeling of first-hand truthfulness.
Together with her director, Mark Wing-Davey, Ms. Churchill visited Bucharest in March, amassing information and images. Two months later, the playwright had finished writing the play and it was in production, without the delays found in the commercial and even the institutional theater.
Sitting on hard concrete blocks, theatergoers are uncomfortable witnesses to the Romanian revolution, as it detonates and then is eventually surrounded by questions. In the first act there are glimpses of the repressiveness of the Ceausescu regime and the economic and political deprivations suffered by Romanian citizens. The view is through the eyes of two families, one working class, one representing the intelligentsia - about to be united through marriage.
The second act offers a collage of snapshot reactions to the revolution. As in a mystery play, people with limited knowledge try to piece together what actually happened. In the third and most amorphous act, the playwright describes the seismic tremors that continue after the initial revolution. Especially in this final section, there are indications of Miss Churchill's more imaginative side, as she creates a sardonic encounter between a dapper Transylvanian vampire and a fleabitten dog, a stand-in for the bedeviled common man. Wisely, the playwright has refrained from sealing her play with a conclusion. Like the revolution itself, the play remains in progress.
The confused nature of the uprising, as Miss Churchill sees it, is reflected in the title. ''Mad Forest'' refers to the name of a forest outside Bucharest, considered to be ''impenetrable for the foreigner who did not know the paths.'' In other words, Miss Churchill believes one would have to be Romanian to understand the intricacies of the events of the last year, and even then the view might be obstructed. Guided by the playwright, we begin to understand the political and moral complexity. In one of many bitterly comic interludes, the play's Ceausescu explains why he is mightier than God. God created the sun, the moon, the stars and mankind ''out of chaos''; Ceausescu boasts, ''I created the chaos.''
The student actors are a closely allied ensemble, offering indications of their nascent theatrical talent. Similarly, there is a feeling of potential in the play - incomplete but far more evocative than the author's last effort (''Ice Cream,'' produced last season at the Public Theater in New York). With work, ''Mad Forest'' could become the Eastern European political equivalent of Miss Churchill's ''Fen,'' a play that far transcended its journalistic origins.
Coincidentally, at Miss Churchill's customary habitat, the Royal Court, there was the rotating repertory of one-act political dialogues, commissioned from a wide diversity of people, some of them playwrights, some of them public figures not previously involved in writing for the theater. The nonprofessional roster included one of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's advisers, a member of the Labor Party's shadow government, the Bishop of Durham and even a theater critic. Free to choose subjects, they focused on a diversity of contemporary issues.
The plays on one bill were ''The Wall-Dog,'' by Manfred Karge, a polemical conversation about German reunification; ''How Now Green Cow,'' a very funny assault on environmentalism by Julie Burchill, a newspaper columnist and pop novelist, and Mr. Lucie's ''Doing the Business,'' a comedy about the dangers inherent in private financing of the arts.
In the caustic Burchill comedy, a trendy woman (deftly played by Lesley Manville) committed to the self-indulgences of city life assails a liberal friend, who has retreated to the country and adopted a save-the-rain-forest missionary zeal. The author's anti-Green spokeswoman says, ''Nature is the biggest serial killer the world has ever seen.'' Theater of the Moment can, of course, derive from conservative as well as liberal hands.
The most incisive of the dialogues was ''Doing the Business.'' Mr. Lucie, the author of ''Progress'' and ''Fashion,'' is no latecomer in responding to public issues. But ''Doing the Business'' sets something of a record for a play hot off the presses. It was performed just as both England and the United States faced crises in financing of the arts. The crises outlasted the run of the play.
Those who are opposed to government support indicate that organizations and individual artists would be able to substitute private sponsorship for public support and this presumably would free them from restraints of censorship. With malevolent wit, Mr. Lucie concludes that the opposite is true. If anything, private financing, he says, will lead to more interference and a greater loss of artistic freedom.
The instruments for the author's debate are two former university classmates, a forward-looking theater director (Nick Dunning) and a fund raiser (Nicholas Woodeson) who brokers partnerships between art and business, something long in evidence in both countries. Mr. Woodeson, genial even as he is insidious, plays a diabolical dissembler who believes in ''creative funding'' - code words for censorship and sponsor control. In particular, the broker objects to two plays on the director's schedule, one by an Irishman (therefore, Mr. Woodeson concludes, he only writes ''Irish plays''), the other by a lesbian and dealing with child abuse. In the current English climate, the lesbian is more acceptable than the Irishman.
In order to guarantee jobs for members of his company, the director trims and rationalizes while trying to maintain his artistic conscience. Eager to please his own constituency, Mr. Woodeson dilutes the other's intentions through a series of guileful maneuvers, suggesting that he cast a famous ''alternative comedian'' in a leading role in a play to boost ticket sales. Art is sacrificed in the name of ''doing business'' and ''compromise is the language of progress.'' The sensibility is not too far removed from the crass commercialism of the movie executives in David Mamet's ''Speed-the-Plow.''
Mr. Lucie's short sharp satire has a particular resonance during a time when the National Endowment for the Arts is being subjected to heavy criticism. In this excoriating example of Theater of the Moment, audiences could be watching what may happen in the American arts if grants by the endowment are further restricted.

HEADLINE: Stalled Geneva Farm Talks Are Suspended for a Month

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
The United States and the European Community, failing to make progress at talks in Geneva in resolving a festering trade dispute over farm subsidies, suspended negotiations today for a month.
The delay raised worries among American officials and business executives about the prospects for a separate, broader effort, also under way in Geneva, to liberalize world trade. Nearly half of the 102 nations in those trade talks have indicated they will walk away from negotiations if Washington and Brussels cannot agree on measures to end protectionism in agricultural trade. They are working against a December deadline, when they are scheduled to present proposals to a ministerial meeting. 
The delay was also a setback for President Bush, who tried unsuccessfully to break the farm trade standoff in his conversations with heads of other major industrial countries in Houston earlier this month.
Administration officials voiced concern on the delay. ''Time has become our enemy,'' said the deputy United States trade representative, Julius L. Katz. ''The simple fact is that we are not as far advanced as we need to be at this time in the negotiations.''
But European Community officials expressed surprise that the Americans were disappointed. A senior European official in Washington, who asked not to be identified, said it was unrealistic to expect that a framework for agreement on agriculture could be reached so soon after the summit meeting.
''We still have four months to go,'' he said, ''and so no one should be terribly discouraged.''
William E. Brock 3d, who served as President Reagan's first trade chief, called for the renewed personal involvement of the industrial countries' leaders. ''It will now take an act of great political will for the round to become successful,'' he said. ''We just can't wait until the last minute to resolve this matter.''
Failure of the talks, many analysts believe, could result in protectionist trading blocks that could crimp global prosperity.
The Uruguay Round of talks, named after the site of the initial negotiating session at the Uruguayan beach resort of Punta del Este nearly four years ago, is currently meeting in Geneva under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international trade organization.
The talks seek to cut billions of dollars of farm subsidies, ending distortions that curb farm exports; open trade in textiles, which ranks along with agriculture among the most protected industries, and expand international trading rules to cover services, investment and intellectual property rights.
With agriculture blocking progress in the other sectors, world leaders meeting recently in Houston agreed that a future pact on agricultural should contain assurances that participants would reduce ''not only internal support but also export subsidies and import protection in a related way.'' But the European Community has been loath to eliminate export subsidies, which give its farmers bigger markets abroad.
A Dutch civil servant, Aaart de Zeeuw, had prepared a document on freeing trade in agricultural products that had been discussed as a possible peace formula at the summit meeting.
But this week, when it came to making necessary concessions, neither side budged. As a senior American trade official put it, ''There was no sign that the basic differences have been bridged.''
The fallback plan, American officials said, is to begin a new process of trying to resolve differences after governments have reconsidered their positions between now and Aug. 27, when the agricultural trade talks are to resume.
Mr. Katz, the United States trade official, said, ''Those of us who want the Uruguay Round to succeed will have to assure that our negotiators return to Geneva at the end of August with the mandate and flexibility to make the policy-specific commitments necessary - in all the areas of negotiation.''
American officials said that blockages existed not just in agriculture, but in all the major negotiating sectors. ''It's clear the chemistry isn't there,'' said one senior American official who asked not to be identified.
Many outside experts warned that the delay could be costly for the Congressional approval process.
C. Michael Aho, director for economic studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said it could mean that an agreement was ''inadequate from the U.S. viewpoint and the Administration will lose its constituency for winning Congressional backing.''
One indication of the domestic pressures against the Uruguay Round is the campaign of the textile industry to legislate restrictive quotas. These would reduce American trade negotiators' flexibility.
The Senate by 68 to 38 last week approved the quota bill, and the House is now expected to take up the legislation next week, just before the August recess. President Bush is virtually certain to veto the bill, and the veto is likely to be sustained.

HEADLINE: Few Heads Are Turned By Profits' Turnaround

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The selloff in the stock market on Monday, which many analysts attributed to weak profits, actually came at a time when company earnings seem to be rising again.
But the turnaround is hard to cheer about. Profits remain very weak, made so by the sluggish national economy. By one measure, they are nearly as low as they were in the 1982 recession. They are so weak, in fact, that a few disappointing earnings reports from blue-chip companies in the past week apparently helped touch off the 56.44-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average. 
''There is no question that profits are turning around,'' said Kenneth Petrick, a Commerce Department economist who compiles profits data. ''The problem is that they are not turning around as quickly or in as big a way as some people apparently thought they would.''
By many measures, the profit turnaround came in the first quarter, and some forecasters say that once all the earnings reports are in for the March-to-June period, the overall earnings of the nation's tens of thousands of corporations will be found to have risen another notch.
Nevertheless, profits are not returning to anywhere near the level they reached in 1988 and in the first half of last year, before the economy began to weaken.
The average per share earnings of the Standard & Poor's 500, a cross-section of publicly traded companies, for example, was $6.74 a share and $6.48 a share in the first and second quarters of 1989, respectively. The average then plunged to $4.88 a share in the third quarter and $4.83 in the fourth. It finally moved back up, to $5.17 a share, in the first quarter.
DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting and data-gathering service, estimates that the S.& P. 500 companies earned an average of $5.54 a share in the just-ended second quarter. Other forecasters are also offering relatively optimistic estimates, among them the Conference Board, a business organization, and two Wall Street investment houses, the First Boston Corporation and Goldman, Sachs & Company.
A widely watched Commerce Department measure also suggests an upturn. Before-tax profits adjusted for inventory earnings and equipment investment, to simulate earnings from current production, fell for four quarters to an annual rate of $285.9 billion in last year's fourth quarter. That measure then turned up to $289.7 billion in the first quarter.
 
Troubling Factors
But two troublesome characteristics stand out in this incipient turnaround. One is that the profits of American corporations, rebounding or not, represent today only about 5.4 percent of the gross national product, the broadest measure of the nation's wealth.
In 1982, during the worst months of the last recession, corporate earnings before taxes fell to about 4.5 percent of G.N.P., the lowest since World War II. But within a few months, earnings jumped to 7 percent of G.N.P., and as the recovery proceeded, they stayed near that level until last year, when the economy weakened and earnings plunged to the current 5.4 percent.
The second characteristic is that some industries are doing far better than others - and few seem to be doing as well as many analysts had expected. ''They thought that the sharp dip in the second half of last year was a fluke caused by various one-time write-offs and profits would come back to where they were in last year's first half,'' said David Wyss, a senior economist at DRI.
That profits were not coming back to their 1989 levels apparently dawned on Wall Street last week. Although I.B.M. had reported fairly strong second-quarter earnings, others in the computer industry failed to live up to expectations, among them Texas Instruments Inc. and Apple Computer Inc.
Several of the nation's money center banks also reported earnings declines, hurt mostly by real estate loan problems, and then last Friday, the McDonald's Corporation dashed many hopes. Although the fast-food company, said that second-quarter net income had risen by 10 percent, compared with the figure a year earlier, some investors had expected this bellwether company in the consumer services sector to be among the leaders of a return to healthier profits.
 
Expectaions 'Out of Line'
''Consumer spending on service increased substantially in the second quarter, so why a service company like McDonald's didn't meet people's expectations, I'm not sure,'' said Robert Giordano, co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs. ''Maybe the expectations are too out of line with reality.''
Whatever the expectations, many consumer-products companies reported improved second-quarter earnings in recent weeks. Petroleum companies, some large regional banks, machinery manufacturers and food companies also said that profits were up in the quarter. Many others have said in recent weeks that earnings were down, among them construction and building supply companies, some electronics companies, auto companies, military contractors and appliance companies.
Several themes run through the explanations of why profits are weak, the main one being that few companies, in a sluggish economy, can raise prices. McDonald's, for example, blamed price discounting at its fast-food outlets for its difficulties, and many other retailers report consumer resistance to price increases.
But there have been other inroads into profits. One is interest payments on corporate debt, which now use up 5.2 cents of each dollar collected by nonfinancial corporations from the sale of their goods and services. As the debt burden rose, so did the repayment drain on earnings. It went from less than 4 cents in the mid-1980's to 5.2 cents in last year's third quarter and remained at that level through March of this year - perhaps because companies have borrowed less in recent months.
Unit labor costs have also taken their toll, rising to 67.3 cents of every dollar in the first quarter, from 67.1 cents in the fourth quarter of 1989, mostly because of the rising cost of benefits. But labor costs have risen more slowly over the last six months than they did last year, and that has helped to stabilize profits, which represented 7.1 cents of each dollar from current output in the first quarter, down only slightly from 7.2 cents in 1989's fourth quarter., ''There is no great exuberance in the earnings reports,'' said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley, ''but no collapse either.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Sticky Traffic, Slick Fixes

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FRESH from their triumphs in Eastern Europe, free-market economists are pushing market solutions for problems closer to home. Markets are being touted as the most efficient way to save wildlife, improve public education and reduce acid rain. Could they also be used to tame the scourge of America's city-sprawls: the rush-hour traffic jam?
Influential citizen groups in California think so. And in the last few weeks they have made cautious converts of the regional pollution and transportation authorities, whose leaders are scrounging for politically acceptable ways to contain traffic-related smog. The big question now is whether they can sell a fresh approach to a motoring public that takes the ''free'' in freeway very, very seriously. 
Under the gun from both state and Federal authorities to prevent deterioration in air quality, Southern California stitched together a pollution-control plan last year that included regulation of everything from aerosol deodorants to barbecue grills. To reduce anticipated car use by 40 percent in the year 2010, the planners talked of rules that would induce one-third of commuters to forsake their own vehicles for car pools, mass transit or home computer terminals. Just how that ambitious goal might be met, however, was left up in the air.
The quick and dirty way to get Californians to drive less would be to ration car use or parking or gasoline consumption - or all three. But that would be a regulatory nightmare, not very different than the one faced every day in a thousand ways by Soviet planners. Would those with extra-long commuting trips get extra ration coupons? How about families with more or less children than average? And who would enforce the rules, which are likely to be greeted with as much enthusiasm as root canal surgery?
The less painful and less intrusive alternative, argued a panel drawn from the Environmental Defense Fund, the libertarian Claremont Institute, business interests, auto clubs and a number of local governments, would be to ration road use by price. By coincidence the Bay Area Economic Forum, a committee of local governments with close ties to both business and environmental groups, came up with similar findings at virtually the same time. And with little public fanfare, the recommendations of both groups were embraced in principle by local regulators of air quality.
High on the lists are congestion or emission taxes - fees for consuming scarce road space and scarcer clean air. Collecting fees at toll booths, the Bay Area Economic Forum acknowledges, would itself add to congestion and pollution. But the region could borrow an idea from Singapore, where rush-hour use of critical arteries is regulated with windshield stickers. Anyone caught on the wrong road at the wrong time without a sticker (purchasable at convenience stores) would be in for a stiff fine.
A more expensive but technologically feasible variation on the system would use road sensors and in-car computers to measure travel. Motorists could then be billed monthly, according to flexible pricing formulas for time-of-day use and miles driven. Revenues could be used to subsidize mass transit.
The trouble with congestion taxes high enough to alter commuter behavior is that they would cost a lot of angry people a lot of money. Michael Cameron, an analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland, believes that much the same results could be achieved with far less political hassle by giving everyone limited rights to commute by car, and then allowing those who need more (or merely want more) to buy rights from other motorists.
Car owners might, for example, be allowed to drive 200 miles a week on bottleneck roads at rush hour. Use would be measured with road sensors and on-board computers. Extra mileage allowances could be bought or sold from vending machines, the way modern mass transit systems now keep track of electronic fare cards. Prices might be recomputed frequently to balance changing supply and demand. Those who chose to trade in mileage allowances for cash would be paid by check, much the way tax refunds are paid today.
This may sound like a far too ambitious leap into the brave new world of managing cities by computer. But the technology, analysts argue, is no longer pie-in-the-sky. And once car-dependent commuters understand that the practical alternatives are poisonous air or bureaucratic controls on personal mobility, the brave new world may begin to look very good.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Emphasizes Fight Against Inflation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, provided little hope today to politicians who want to see interest rates lowered and bank regulations eased.
''We clearly have a sluggish economy,'' he told the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetry Policy. But he emphasized that the chances of a recession were ''low,'' that fighting inflation was his No. 1 priority and that the decision to lower a key interest rate two weeks ago was made solely to offset unusually tight credit policies by commercial banks.
More than in testimony to the Senate last week, Mr. Greenspan today stressed his desire to combat inflation. ''The inflation rate is higher currently than we would like,'' he said in answer to one question. ''It is very easy to accelerate from here.'' 
A Labor Department report today, in fact, showed that private industry wages, salaries and benefits had risen by 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended June 30, compared with a rise in the Consumer Price Index over the same period of 4.7 percent.
 
Good News for Workers
The report, which Mr. Greenspan was not asked to discuss, was good news for workers who saw their pay and benefits lag behind the rate of inflation for much of the 1980's. But compensation rose only by 4.5 percent in the previous 12 months, and economists said the rising cost to business recently was one reason why the inflation rate had accelerated this year.
Mr. Greenspan took issue with lawmakers who maintained that overzealous bank examiners had forced banks in their districts to restrict lending to creditworthy customers. Mainly what had happened, he said, was that lending practices had returned to normal after a decade of being dangerously lax.
This was the second stage of Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony on the state of the economy, testimony he is required by law to provide every six months to the Senate and the House. He presented today precisely the same statement he gave to the Senate Banking Committee last Wednesday and added little new in answer to questions.
 
Not Questioned on Stocks
Some experts on Wall Street attributed Monday's stock market slide to uncertainty about Mr. Greenspan's intentions on interest rates following his testimony last week. Although today's testimony was little different, the Dow Jones industrial average rose today by 17.82 points. Mr. Greenspan was not questioned directly about the market today.
At one point, Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, prefaced a question by suggesting that the Federal Reserve had lowered the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point two weeks ago as a signal to the budget negotiators from the White House and Congress that the central bank would cut interest rates if a deal was struck on reducing the budget deficit. The Federal funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans.
 
Link to Talks Denied
Mr. Greenspan, who is normally extraordinarily patient with lawmakers, interrupted Mr. Leach and said rather sharply that the only reason the rate had been reduced was because banks had become unnecessarily tight in their lending practices and that the action had nothing to do with the budget talks.
Several legislators told Mr. Greenspan that business owners in their districts were complaining that they could not get loans for which they were qualified and had been told by their banks that the reason was that bank examiners were cracking down.
Mr. Greenspan said he agreed that some banks had become too tight in their lending practices, but he attributed this to caution that was a rebound from previous lax practices and denied that regulatory policy was the cause.

HEADLINE: Overseas Investment Down in U.S.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Foreign investors shunned American stocks and Treasury securities in the first quarter of 1990, leaving the domestic markets with a net outflow of foreign investment in stocks and bonds for the first time since 1983.
Foreigners sold $3.3 billion more in stocks than they bought, according to figures released yesterday by the Securities Industry Association. In addition, foreigners had net sales of Treasury securities of $6.5 billion. 
At the same time, Americans cut back their purchases of foreign stocks in the first quarter as the Tokyo stock market plunged and other stock markets, while rising, were quite volatile.
David G. Strongin, the securities association's director of international finance, said the net sales by foreigners indicated it was getting harder for American markets to attract investment from abroad. ''The U.S. can't any longer count on an unending supply of foreign capital,'' he said. He said this could lead to higher interest rates and depress stock prices.
The decline in foreign buying in the United States is a reaction to the attractive opportunities in Europe because of the revolution in Eastern and Central Europe. For example, the West German stock market soared to new highs at the end of last year and again in the first quarter.
In addition, interest rates in West Germany and other European countries were rising, making their bond markets more attractive. And in the United States, the outlook for the stock market was not that positive during the first part of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average declined in the first three months.
The $3.3 billion of sales by foreigners in the first quarter followed net sales of $400 million in the last quarter of 1989.
Most investors selling American stocks were from Europe, where net sales totaled $1.3 billion in the last quarter of 1989 and $1.2 billion in the first quarter of this year.
The Japanese also sold stocks in the first quarter, resulting in net sales of $700 million. But the Japanese had been net buyers of $2 billion worth of American stocks in the last three months of 1989.
Americans cut their purchases of foreign stocks sharply. Net purchases totaled $355 million in the first quarter, down from $4 billion in the previous quarter.
The biggest net sales, $1.3 billion, were of Japanese stocks, which fell steeply from a record high on the last trading day of 1989. In addition, Americans were big sellers of French stocks in the first quarter, thereby missing part of the rally in the French market.
Most of the buying was done in the rest of Europe. In addition, Americans set a record for purchases in Australia - a total of $273 million, twice any previous quarter.

HEADLINE: Seger May Quit Fed's Board

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
President Bush may get a third chance to appoint a member of the Federal Reserve Board if Martha R. Seger resigns.
Ms. Seger, who is 58 years old, has been a governor on the seven-member board since 1984. She said in an interview published in The Wall Street Journal today that she might resign to care for her mother, who lives in Arizona and recently underwent hip surgery and suffered a stroke.
Ms. Seger, who has eight years remaining of her 14-year term, is the board's most outspoken advocate of an easy-money policy to keep economic growth vigorous. She is frequently at odds with other board members who favor higher interest rates to slow the economy and reduce inflation.
''I'll probably make a decision by the end of this year on whether or not I have to leave,'' she said in the interview. ''I'm going to play it by ear.''
Ms. Seger did not return several telephone messages seeking comment.
President Bush has already appointed David W. Mullins, a former Assistant Treasury Secretary, to fill one vacancy on the board. He is due to select a successor to Manuel H. Johnson, the Fed's vice chairman, who has announced that he plans to resign next month.

HEADLINE: Sallie Mae Shares Fall

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Shares of the Student Loan Marketing Association, were lower in heavy trading yesterday amid concern about the financial crisis at a key guarantor, analysts said.
Reassurances by the Secretary of Education helped to calm jitters only slightly after recent reports about trouble at the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the nation's largest guarantor of college student loans. 
Shares were down $1.75, to $48.125, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
Secretary Lauro Cavazos earlier said the foundation-guaranteed loans would remain Government guaranteed. Mr. Cavazos said the foundation's problems do not threaten the national student loan program.
A Sallie Mae spokesman declined to comment on the stock drop.
 
Edward Caso, an analyst at
Goldman, Sachs & Company said Sallie Mae remained a high-quality financial institution. He continues to recommend the stock, noting that its recent losses have pushed it down to a level that makes it even more attractive.
Administration officials said today that they had scrapped the idea of turning over the troubled portfolio of the foundation.
The officials said the Department of Education was exploring other options, including the possibility of finding another agency to take over the Higher Education Assistance Foundation.

HEADLINE: Pepsico's Profits Climbed by 10.4% in the Second Quarter

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Pepsico Inc., the world's second-largest soft-drink company and the nation's No. 2 operator of fast-food restaurants, said that earnings in the second quarter ended June 16 rose 10.4 percent, to $292.5 million, or $1.10 a share, from $264.9 million a year earlier, or $1.00 a share.
Showing strength across all of its businesses, including the previously lackluster Kentucky Fried Chicken chain, Pepsico said second-quarter sales rose 17 percent, to $4.2 billion, from $3.59 billion in the period last year.
Earnings in domestic soft drinks were hurt by a $4.5 million charge to write off receivables because of the bankruptcy of the Circle K Corporation, a convenience-store chain. The Circle K problems also hurt Pepsi's snack-foods business, principally Frito-Lay, with a $4.6 million write-off. 
''But Pepsi's earnings are outstanding,'' said Roy D. Burry, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody. ''They look like $1.10 a share versus a buck, but in reality, it's $1.12 a share versus 94 cents because of all of those nonrecurring items.''
Soft drinks, one of the most profitable consumer products, is Pepsico's largest division, making up about 38 percent of the quarterly revenue. But unlike the Coca-Cola Company, the world leader in soft drinks, Pepsi gets most of its business from the United States, where volume growth has been slow compared with international markets. Pepsi reported a 4 percent volume growth domestically, Coca-Cola 3 percent.
In the United States, Pepsico posted a 10 percent profit rise on a 5 percent rise in sales of soft drinks. Pepsi, unlike Coca-Cola, sells most of its beverages in supermarkets, where sales are still relatively strong. Coca-Cola sells much of its beverages through fountain outlets in restaurants, where customer traffic has reached a plateau because of too many restaurants and a slowing economy.
Pepsi's domestic soft-drink revenue totaled $1.24 billion compared with $1.18 billion in the period a year earlier. Profit, hurt by the $4.5 million Circle K write-off, rose 10 percent, to $192.7 million from $175.8 million.
By contrast, in its international business, Pepsi posted a 29 percent profit rise on a 23 percent rise in sales. That excludes the effects of a $32.5 million credit in 1989 resulting from a decision to keep a Japanese bottler previously scheduled for sale.
International soft-drink revenue totaled $354.3 million, compared with a $289 million a year ago. International profits totaled $40.5 million, compared with $63.8 million.
Pepsi's restaurants, the second-largest operator of fast-food outlets after McDonald's, posted a 35 percent profit gain, to $137.6 million, on a sales gain of 22 percent, to $1.43 billion.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vehicle Sales Down 13.2% in Mid-July Period

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 24

 BODY:
The market for new autos softened in mid-July, as sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks fell 13.2 percent compared with unusually strong sales in the period last year.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.9 million units, well off last year's pace of 7.7 million in mid-July, and below the selling rate of 7.4 million for the last 30 days. The annual selling rate for the last 60 days was 7.1 million.
But several analysts said that mid-July sales were slightly better than expected, and that car buyers were still active despite a rush by consumers to take advantage of cash rebates and financial incentives that were scheduled to end on July 9. After a strong initial 10-day selling period at the beginning of the month, the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company extended their rebate offers into the current period. 
 
'A Hard Act to Follow'
''We thought June was a hard act to follow,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, ''but July is doing it so far.''
''Auto sales have been on a plateau since February, and it looks like July will be a slight improvement,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst for Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco. ''But I need to see one more month of improved sales before I call it a trend.''
The Big Three all reported sizable sales declines for the mid-July period, and the sales of the Nissan Motor Company, which also makes cars in the United States, also fell. Four other Japanese car companies with plants in the United States reported increased sales, although the gains posted by Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Mitsubishi were not as large as they have been in recent months.
Last year, many car companies offered huge rebates as they tried to clear bloated inventories to make room for new models. The discounts drew buyers, but hurt the industry by pulling many prospective customers out of the market for new models.
 
Role of Incentives
Inventories are much smaller this year and analysts do not expect the same kind of price slashing as the model year draws to an end. But some auto executives believe that consumers have come to expect big discounts in the summer, and they worry that sales will suffer without incentives.
''People are holding off,'' said Joel Pitcoff, manager of research and analysis at Ford. ''I think people have been conditioned to expect that the best deals in terms of incentives come at end of model year.''
The economic factors that often stimulate auto sales - lower interest rates and higher personal income -have not been evident lately. But some analysts have suggested that people who bought cars five and six years ago are returning to the market to replace their old cars.
Manufacturers and dealers have anxiously awaited the return of such replacement buyers, who have been out of the market for an unusual length of time. Previously, they returned to replace their vehicles in cycles of about 48 months, the usual length of their car loans. But to stimulate sales in the 1980's, manufacturers and dealers offered loan repayment terms lasting up to five years, which reduced the monthly payments but extended the replacement cycle.
''There are so many people out there paying down old loans that they haven't been buying new cars,'' said David Healy, an analyst for Barclays Bank in New York. ''I think we are just beginning to grow out of that.''
 
Higher Prices Ahead
As usual, buyers holding off for the new models will find they are substantially more expensive. On Monday, Ford announced to its dealers price increases on its 1991 models ranging from four-tenths of 1 percent on its Topaz models to 7.4 percent on its Taurus model. Prices on all Ford models rose an average of 3.2 percent, the company said.
For the mid-July period, Ford's car sales fell 24.6 percent, to 50,803 units, as sales of the company's Escort and Taurus models declined far below last year's levels. Light-truck sales dropped 13.2 percent, to 42,381 units.
G.M. sold 91,235 cars in mid-July, down 13.4 percent. The company's light-truck sales declined 10.4 percent, to 47,789 units.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales declined 17.9 percent, to 20,052 units. Sales of Chrysler's light trucks, mini-vans and Jeeps also dropped 16.7 percent, to 25,295 units.

HEADLINE: 5 Years May Be Needed To Close Savings Cases

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, criticized for his sluggish response to the savings and loan crisis, told a Senate panel today that the Justice Department will need at least five years to prosecute the most serious cases of fraud at 100 institutions on its priority list.
''I have settled on a ballpark figure of about five years of sustained effort,'' said Mr. Thornburgh, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. ''By 1995, we should perhaps be winding down and transferring resources to other areas.'' 
Mr. Thornburgh's remarks today were his first public comments on how long it would take the department to make a significant impact on the huge backlog of investigations into criminal fraud that contributed to the nation's huge financial crisis.
He has been attacked by some Democrats in Congress for failing to move aggressively enough against savings and loan fraud, but he insisted today that the department was waging a ''relentless'' offensive against criminal wrongdoing in the industry.
 
Early Results
He said investigations of the 100 institutions selected by bank regulators, prosecutors and investigators had already produced results. To date, the department has indicted 51 people associated with these institutions and has convicted 39.
The successful prosecution of the 100 institutions would still leave more than 200 big savings and loans that are also considered likely targets for large-scale prosecution efforts. Investigative efforts against these institutions are also under way, but the priority cases will receive additional personnel and closer supervision by Justice Department officials in Washington.
Mr. Thornburgh acknowledged that the department's decision to concentrate efforts on large cases involving ''major rip-off artists who squandered billions of dollars'' would mean that many fraud cases involving small amounts might be turned over to local prosecutors, reduced to civil suits or in some cases never be prosecuted at all.
Mr. Thornburgh, whose testimony was cut short when the panel recessed for a vote on the Senate floor, did not deliver a portion of his prepared remarks commenting on legislation pending in Congress intended to enhance the department's prosecution efforts. In the undelivered part of his testimony, Mr. Thornburgh criticized a proposal in a bill pending before the House that would create a national commission on financial fraud.
 
Proposed Commission
The 12-member commission, with four members each appointed by the Administration, the House and the Senate, would be charged with investigating the roots of the crisis and would also be responsible for recommending solutions and new prosecution strategies.
''Apart from the constitutional problems brought about by the hybrid nature of the commission's membership, we think parallel investigations of S.&L. fraud, in which the same witnesses are sought and the same issues are investigated, raise dangers,'' he said in his prepared remarks. ''It would serve little benefit for a commission to track our activities.''
Mr. Thornburgh also criticized a proposal included in a House appropriations measure that would allow the Secret Service, an arm of the Treasury Department, to investigate financial fraud. The proposal has touched off a behind-the-scenes turf war with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which now has exclusive juridiction over investigations of savings and loan fraud.

HEADLINE: Sears Reports a 29% Drop In Earnings for 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 24

 BODY:
As it said it would several weeks ago, Sears, Roebuck & Company today reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, making already skeptical analysts even more concerned about the company's future.
Sears said earnings from continuing operations plunged 29 percent, to $237.9 million, or 69 cents a share, from $334.9 million, or 95 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues rose 4.3 percent, essentially no more than inflation, to $13.9 billion from $13.3 billion. 
Part of Sears's earnings problems come from its Allstate Insurance Group, which suffered an unexpectedly large buildup in claims after the recent fires in Southern California. Allstate's income from continuing operations fell to $142.2 million from $199.8 million.
But analysts considered Allstate's big payouts a one-time event. They focused instead on Sears's core retailing operations, where, they said, the results appeared far more troubling.
 
New Retail Strategy
Analysts said Sears's new merchandising strategy, announced with much fanfare in early 1989, does not appear to be working. One leg of that strategy was to introduce name brands - everything from General Electric appliances to Pirelli tires -into Sears stores and thereby to increase revenues. In the three months ended June 30, however, store revenues rose only 2.1 percent, to $7.88 billion from $7.71 billion.
Another leg of the Sears strategy was to convert to everyday low pricing. This was supposed to lower costs by reducing the special promotions and advertising that stores must do and by lowering inventory costs. In fact, though, merchandising costs have continued to advance, rising 3.8 percent, to $7.7 billion from $7.4 billion, in the second quarter alone. Sears executives told analysts that much of the increase could be traced to higher training costs associated with remodeled home-improvement departments and to higher advertising expenses that came with the opening of new electronics and automotive departments.
''They were particularly hopeful about increased television sales,'' said L. Wayne Hood of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
 
Unsuccessful Campaign
But the sales figures released today suggested that Sears's advertising was not particularly successful. Part of the problem may be that consumers over all are showing a skittishness about buying durable goods. But it may also be that there is little to distinguish Brand Central, Sears's remodeled electronics departments, from discount specialty stores like Silo or Circuit City, which offer more variety than Sears does.
The figures ''tell me that they did not get the sales lift they had hoped for,'' said Sidney Doolittle, an industry consultant. ''They spent all that money on advertising and the customers did not come in and buy.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Newspaper Company Profits Skid

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings dropped 44.7 percent from results a year ago that included a gain on a timberlands sale, while the Tribune Company said its profit fell 25 percent in the quarter.
Another large media company, Knight-Ridder Inc., said its net income skidded 64.8 percent for the second quarter from results last year that were inflated by gains on the sale of a newspaper and television stations.
The Washington Post Company said its quarterly earnings fell 7.6 percent, reflecting a weak advertising environment for newspapers and TV stations. 
 
Times Mirror
The publisher of The Los Angeles Times and six other newspapers said it earned $47 million, or 36 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $85 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. The 1989 results included a gain of 11 cents a share on the sale of timberlands.
Revenue for the quarter rose 5.3 percent, to $906.6 million from $861.3 million.
Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive, said weak economic conditions continued to adversely affect the company's newspaper and other advertising-driven businesses.
Times Mirror stock fell 12.5 cents, to $29.125 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Tribune Company
The Chicago-based Tribune Company said its earnings fell primarily because of operating losses at The Daily News in New York and a decline in newsprint operating profit.
The company said it earned $56.1 million, or 78 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $75.3 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue for the quarter rose 2 percent, to $656.2 million from $643.1 million, a year earlier.
The company said its operating profit from newspaper publishing fell 33 percent, mainly because of losses at The Daily News that reflected economic weakness in the New York area and costs of contract negotiations with the paper's labor unions.
Operating profit from the newsprint group fell 83 percent, to $3.1 million, because of lower newsprint selling prices and the adverse impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.
Tribune stock fell 87.5 cents, to $40.25 a share on the Big Board.
 
Knight-Ridder
The Miami-based newspaper and business information services company said it earned $44.6 million, or 88 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with $126.8 million, or $2.44 a share, a year earlier.
But the 1989 results were inflated because of gains on the sale of The Pasadena Star-News and television operations. Knight-Ridder said its net income rose 14.3 percent when compared with last year's earnings from ongoing operations.
Revenue was up 2.2 percent to $591.7 million, compared with $578.7 million a year earlier.
Its stock fell 25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, to $47.75 a share.
 
Washington Post
The owner of The Washington Post newspaper and Newsweek magazine said it earned $55.9 million, or $4.60 a share, for the second quarter compared with $60.5 million, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.
Second-quarter revenue edged up 1.4 percent, to $379.6 million, from $374.5 million a year earlier.
Newspaper division revenue was off 2 percent as ad volume fell 9 percent at The Washington Post. Newsweek revenue rose 6 percent, with one additional issue published in the second quarter this year.
Washington Post stock fell $3.50 on the Big Board, to $255 a share.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Fall Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell slightly and interest rates inched higher in light trading yesterday.
Dealers said that worries about how equity investors might react to Monday's steep slide in the stock market, as well as uncertainty about what the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, would say in Congressional testimony served to slow trading.
''There were a lot of good reasons to be on the sidelines,'' one government-bond trader said. ''But the market is pretty soft, and people are beginning to be concerned about upcoming supply.'' 
Today, traders will be asked to place bids on $11.5 billion of new two-year Treasury notes. And late yesterday, the Treasury said it would increase the size of its weekly auctions of three-month and six-month bills to a record $18.4 billion, from $18 billion.
Late yesterday, the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.11 percent.
 
Inflation Gauge Rises
With one eye on the stock market and the other on Capitol Hill yesterday, market participants shrugged off the release of data showing a rise in labor costs. The Government's employment cost index, an important inflation measure, rose at a 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
''It was not a number that makes people confident that inflation will fall below 4 percent in the next 12 months,'' said Joseph R. Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc.
Despite the employment-cost report and some tougher words on inflation from Mr. Greenspan in the second part of his semiannual testimony on monetary policy and the economy, Mr. Liro said that ''the expectation is that the Fed will have to ease policy again sometime in the fall, if not before. That helps short-term rates, but not bonds. The long end has problems with these inflation numbers.''
 
Remarks by Greenspan
In comments delivered to a House Banking subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed was still intent on achieving its goal of pushing inflationary pressures close to zero ''within a few years.''
His remarks were in response to a series of questions from Representative Stephen Deal, a North Carolina Democrat, who is sponsoring legislation that would require the Fed to pursue a goal of zero inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's comments were clearly aimed at restoring the Fed's credibility as an inflation fighter in the financial markets. However, many traders said they were not impressed.
''The fact is that the Fed has eased the funds rate to 8 percent, and is more apt to ease credit conditions from here than it is to tighten,'' a trader said. 30-Year Bonds Drop By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 25/32, down 11/32, to yield 8.58 percent.
Treasury note prices also dipped, but by not as much.
In late trading, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/4, down 9/32, to yield 8.52 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 18/32, down 7/32, to yield 8.47 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates, which dipped sharply Monday as stock prices fell, moved higher yesterday.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.56 percent late in the day, up 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.43 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.35 percent late yesterday, up 4 basis points.
Aside from an offering of $1.1 billion worth of short-term tax anticipation notes by New York City, activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was slow, dealers said.
Participants in the municipal bond market said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/8 point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues dipped by about 1/8 point, dealers said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens as Worries On Interest Rates Continue

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened yesterday against key foreign currencies in worldwide trading.
Currency dealers said continued concerns about interest rates helped push the dollar lower. However, technical factors, along with reports of an Iraqi troop buildup along the Kuwaiti border, helped temper its fall, they added. The dollar is often seen as a safe haven in times of political turmoil. 
The markets were paying particular attention yesterday to testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, before a House Banking subcommittee. He said a ''credible and enforceable'' budget deficit agreement could bring about lower interest rates in the financial markets. But he warned that the Fed would not move to accelerate a drop in rates unless it was assured that inflation was under control.
Lower interest rates tend to bring down the value of a currency.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar rose to a closing 148.70 Japanese yen, from 148.50 yen on Monday. It traded at 148.35 yen in London and at 148.40 yen in New York, up from 148.12 yen.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared with Monday. Sterling rose to $1.8250 from $1.8215 in London, and fell to $1.8140 from $1.8255 in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's levels, included: 1.62075 German marks, down from 1.62225; 1.3785 Swiss francs, down from 1.3815; 5.4365 French francs, down from 5.4410; 1.15655 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15545, and 1,186.00 Italian lire, down from 1,187.50.
In the precious metals market, gold prices ended lower after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $367.90 a troy ounce, off $1.20 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $367.25 an ounce, down 90 cents.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.25 an ounce, from $368.15 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $368.35 an ounce from $367.75.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose by $6.97 to close at $369.25 an ounce.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $$4.811 a troy ounce, down 7.1 cents from late Monday. Silver rose in London to $4.85 an ounce from $4.90.

HEADLINE: A Pop(ulist) Quiz;
This man is:
 (a) A designer of Nixon's 'Southern strategy'
 (b) The Democrats' next Presidential candidate
 (c) Kevin Phillips
 (d) All of the above

BYLINE: By Eric Alterman; Eric Alterman, a senior fellow of the World Policy Institute, is writing a book about Washington pundits.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Move over, Mario. Take a hike, Teddy. Amscray, Albert. The Democratic Party has found a new standard-bearer. He's young and a master of the nine-second sound bite.
What's more, he seems to have developed a deep understanding of and compassion for exactly that group of voters the party needs most: middle-class working men and women. The guy's new book is a cinch to take the party into the White House next time around. There's just one problem: he's a conservative Republican. 
Kevin Phillips, author of ''The Politics of Rich and Poor,'' is riding one of the periodic waves that hits Washington whenever everyone agrees to pretend they have read the same book. (My former professor, Paul Kennedy, author of ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' is now a millionaire owing to this phenomenon.) Known to Washington insiders as the diabolical political genius behind Richard Nixon's racially divisive ''Southern strategy'' in 1968, Mr. Phillips is enjoying a revival as the tribune of a racially inclusive economic populism. It is as if Niccolo Machiavelli had published a book on how to overthrow an unjust prince.
Mr. Phillips's book details the ravages inflicted upon honest working people during the Reagan years while fat cats yukked it up with their newly undertaxed incomes. This ''plutographic revolution,'' in Mr. Phillips's words, has led to ''so many Americans making so much money that the term 'millionaire' became meaningless.'' The rest of us saw our tax bites rise as our real income fell.
The author predicts a populist counter-revolution, if Democratic politicians are savvy enough to lead it. His tome quickly knocked George Will's out of the top slot of The Washington Post best-seller list, making its author a hot property on the talk show circuit. While the book has been favorably reviewed, none of its literary judges can hope to match the level of enthusiasm generated for it by the nation's top Democrats.
Governor Cuomo thinks ''every American should read this book.'' The House Democratic majority leader, Richard Gephardt, says, ''Mr. Phillips understands what the last 10 years have meant to working people.'' His colleague, Representative David Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, a leading populist voice, wistfully notes that Mr. Phillips has written ''the kind of book you'd expect to be written by a Democrat.''
In fact, it has. Liberal Democratic economists have been making the same argument for years, while having trouble getting arrested.
In October 1986, a labor-funded think-tank, the Economic Policy Institute, issued a report showing that ''the real income of the average American household had been stag-nant for a decade.'' In early 1988, the liberal economists Bennett Harrison and Barry Bluestone published a book-length study establishing that ''for every affluent 'yuppie' in an expensive big-city condominium . . . there are many more people whose wages have been falling and whose families are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet.''
The Harvard political scientist Robert Reich was whispering these phrases into Michael S. Dukakis's ear at virtually every campaign stop during the 1988 election. The candidate took the dimunitive Mr. Reich's advice only with regard to making ''short'' jokes.
During 1988, the media punditocracy deemed Representative Gephardt's campaign populism incredible owing to its utter lack of precedent in the candidate's career. The Rev. Jesse Jackson won millions of primary votes decrying the ''economic violence'' of the Reagan years, but party power brokers were so frightened by the Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater's new and improved version of Mr. Phillips's Southern strategy that they considered Mr. Jackson's success cause for alarm rather than encouragement.
Why, then, does the party suddenly seem open to ideas it has treated contemptuously for so long?
Part of the answer lies in Mr. Phillips's exquisite timing. As Americans face paying zillions of tax dollars for the fat cat orgy known as the savings and loan crisis, the blood pressure of the body politic rises precipitously. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the unmasking of the Soviet bogeyman have helped Americans assess the damage that the Reagan military build-up and soak-the-poor tax policies have inflicted on the country.
But more important is the complexion of the messenger. The original avatars of Democratic economic populism were exactly those elements of the party from which the hypercautious leadership sought to distance itself: organized labor, liberal activists and Mr. Jackson's ''Rainbow coalition.'' What the Democrats' belated embrace of Mr. Phillips's little-guy populist appeal illustrates is nothing so much as a party that is afraid of itself.
Back in 1981, Democratic strategists decided to compete with Reagan Republicans for corporate political-action committees and high-finance millionaires. As a result, when economic populism was presented by loyal members of the Democratic family, the party, like good Groucho Marxists, wanted nothing to do with anyone willing to be a member of it.
Excluding last year's capital gains fight, most Democrats have gingerly avoided raising the populist question of unfair taxation. They have refused to embrace Daniel Patrick Moynihan's initiative to reduce regressive Social Security taxes and they've disparaged Mr. Jackson's coalition-building efforts at every turn.
Above all, party leaders fear being accused by media pundits of waging ''class warfare.'' But the media do not elect Presidents, the American people do. And they are angry.
The only thing worse than fighting a class war in America is losing one without even fighting. Kevin Phillips has given the party a sword. Like the cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz, all it needs now is a little courage.

HEADLINE: 3 Detained Lawyers Released In Kenya but Not 3 Politicians

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, July 25

 BODY:
The Kenyan Government today released three lawyers detained without charges three weeks ago but kept in prison three politicians detained in the same crackdown on advocates of political pluralism.
Up to 10 other people, including former university lecturers and politicians, were detained two weeks ago and remain in jail.
The releases came as President Daniel arap Moi, an unrelenting opponent of a multiparty political system, seemed to be searching for a way to ease the political tensions inside the country and pressures from outside. 
Some Western donors, including the United States, have said aid money to Kenya will be in jeopardy unless detainees are released and movement is made toward opening up the one-party system. Congress has already frozen about $13 million of this year's aid allocation of $46 million to Kenya. #20 Killed in Riots Riots in Nairobi and rural centers over the detentions of the multiparty advocates killed 20 people, the Government has said. Church organizations say they believe the casualties were significantly higher.
Those released today were Gitobu Imanyara, editor in chief of The Nairobi Law Monthly, John Khaminwa and Mohammed Ibrahim, lawyers in private law firms in Nairobi.
Two former ministers in the Kenyan Government who have led the debate for a multiparty state, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, remain in detention. Raila Odinga, the son of Kenya's first Vice President, Oginga Odinga, was not released either.
One of the freed lawyers, Mr. Ibrahim, said he had been kept in isolation in the city jail after his arrest on July 5. In a telephone interview after his release, he said he was told on the night of his arrest that he had plotted with Mr. Matiba and Mr. Rubia to ''overthrow the Government and form another political party.''
''I was never involved in any such thing,'' he said. He had represented Mr. Rubia in a case involving the confiscation of the politician's passport, he said.
The United States Embassy, which has been outspoken in condemning the arrests, indicated it was pleased but not totally satisfied. ''We hope the cases of those remaining in custody can be resolved rapidly,'' the embassy said in a statement.
 
Moi Meets With Lawyer
In the first sign that Mr. Moi was seeking to ease tensions, he met on Tuesday with a prominent lawyer, Paul Muite, who had gone into hiding after the detentions three weeks ago. Mr. Muite represents the two leaders of the de facto opposition, Mr. Matiba and Mr. Rubia.
Mr. Muite told colleagues after the meeting with the President that Mr. Moi had told him there is ''no money in the country.'' This was apparently a reference to a serious shortage of foreign exchange in the last several months. Nearly one-third of Kenya's budget is made up of direct foreign aid, and cuts in that would have serious consequences in a weak economy.
Three days of rioting over the detentions in early July resulted in a slump in tourism, Kenya's largest foreign-exchange earner. The cancellation last week of the conference of the International Bar Association scheduled for September, on the grounds of the safety of its members and the political detentions, was another blow to tourism.

HEADLINE: Pessimism Over Budget Talks Grows

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
White House and Congressional negotiators worked separately to prepare deficit-cutting proposals today amid growing pessimism among many Democrats that an agreement on next year's Federal budget could be reached any time soon.
The negotiators are aiming for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit in that budget by $50 billion, to about $120 billion, not counting the cost of the savings and loan bailout. They also hope to agree on steps that would produce a balanced budget by 1995, two years later than the target now set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
But the proposals, which could be exchanged as early as Thursday, are expected to underscore sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans over how the spending cuts should be apportioned between military and domestic programs, and over the size and the nature of tax increases. 
 
'Some Final Conclusion'
''I don't expect that any of these packages that will come out in the next few days will be the ending point,'' Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, told reporters as he left a White House meeting with President Bush and other top Congressional leaders this morning. ''But they'll be specific ideas that could be moved over a period of time -and it doesn't have to be a long period of time - to some final conclusion.''
But Mr. Gephardt appeared to be far more optimistic than most of his Democratic colleagues. By the time Democratic negotiators had huddled for several hours on Capitol Hill to draft their plan, it was unclear whether they would even have one to offer.
''The only news coming out of this meeting is that Democrats have not agreed to a plan,'' said Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Mr. Sasser, in comments echoed by other Democratic negotiators, said his colleagues were hesitant to put forward an offer without knowing how serious a proposal would come from the Bush Administration and without some sense of whether the White House really wanted an agreement before the lawmakers leave town in August for a monthlong Congressional recess.
''My deep concern is that if you start and don't finish'' before the recess, ''you'll have every interest group out there pounding on us and the proposals,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee.
 
Opposition Is Aired
That fear appears to be well founded. Even as the Democratic negotiators were meeting - and while the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, was reviewing the Administration's ideas with Mr. Bush - lobbying groups and lawmakers from both parties were lining up to declare their opposition to some of the tax increases likely to be included in the proposal of one side or the other.
For instance, members of New York's Congressional delegation called a news conference to make clear that they could not support a package that included restrictions on the Federal deduction for state and local income taxes, and to assert that a tax on securities transactions would be devastating to Wall Street, New York City and the American economy. The proposals are on a list of tax options that Mr. Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have discussed with Mr. Bentsen and Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee.
When the possibility of eliminating or reducing the deduction for state and local income taxes was first disclosed last week, budget negotiators described it as a step that would apply only to upper-income taxpayers. But exactly which taxpayers would be deemed upper income has not been defined, and in attacking the proposal today the New York delegation held out the specter that the negotiators might allow it to apply to millions of people who consider themselves middle class.
The delegation, citing figures provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation, said that more than half the nation's taxpayers who claim the deduction for state and local income taxes earn less than $50,000 a year and that 88 percent earn less than $100,000 a year.
 
'President on Notice'
''We want to put the President on notice that if this is included as part of the solution, we will find it impossible to support,'' Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat, said of the proposal.
Representative Raymond J. McGrath, a Long Island Republican, said he had written to the White House Chief of Staff, John H. Sununu, to urge that any such idea be rejected. ''I cannot vote for any budget agreement that further restricts the few tax benefits available to average families,'' he said.
New York's Democratic Senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said restrictions on the deduction would have ''an altogether disproportionate impact on states that have chosen to get their revenues from a progressive tax.'' More than 40 percent of New York's revenue is derived from income taxes, and Mr. Moynihan said that other states that would be hard hit included California, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
New York's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. said: ''It's unconscionable to penalize taxpayers in communities who seek to provide a higher level of services to their citizens. The largest percentage of those taxes are paid to support education.''
Opponents of other tax changes that may be included in the deficit-reduction plans have also been gearing up their lobbying efforts. On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Manufacturers held a news conference to warn of dire consequences for American businesses if lawmakers choose the broad-based energy tax that has been suggested by the Administration.
The Anheuser Busch Company has been running television commercials aimed at drumming up public opposition to increases in excise taxes on beer. A rise in excise taxes for all types of alcohol and for cigarettes are widely expected to be included in the Administration's and Democrats' proposals.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Federal Reserve's Chairman Blends Eye for Politics With Fiscal Skills

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
An admiring colleague says Alan Greenspan at his desk, his coat off, hunched in front of his computer screen and pouring over economic data, resembles an archeologist studying the latest find in hieroglyphics or a mathematician proving a theorem.
Nowadays, the Federal Reserve Board chairman is paying equally close attention to political information. And his success, even his survival, as the most influential economic policy maker in the Government may hinge as much on his keen eye for politics as it does on his mastery of unemployment rates, housing starts and price indexes.
His four-year term as chairman is up next year. His two immediate predecessors lost their posts because of differences with the White House over whether to accelerate or brake the national economy. Mr. Greenspan, now 64 years old, will not say publicly whether he wants to be reappointed. But this is the job for which he trained for his entire career, and few people doubt he wants to keep it. 
The chairman has close ties with the Republicans, having worked in several Presidential campaigns over the last quarter century, although he says his fascination is with public policy, not partisan politics.
 
Avoiding the 'Sharp Edges'
''Even during political campaigns I was uncomfortable with the sharp edges of partisan politics,'' he said recently. ''I have always thought, perhaps ingenuously, that it is important that protagonists seek to reconcile their differences.''
Nonetheless, rare for a Wall Street economist, he has many close friends in politics. Every couple of weeks he has lunch with one of them: Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who may have more connections in Washington than the White House switchboard.
''He never says anything about his business,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''But he picks me dry for everything I know about mine.''
Mr. Strauss continued: ''Alan Greenspan is a great listener, and he exposes himself to people who know what's going on in this town, who are moving around the town, and he knows how to digest that information. His political antenna is always up. He's very sensitive to what's taking place politically on the Hill, in the executive branch, in the media, and that's a tremendous strength for a person in his position.''
 
Many Political Connections
Mr. Greenspan regularly picks the minds of other political figures as well: Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate Republican leader and White House chief of staff; William E. Brock 3d, another former Senator from Tennessee, who was Republican national chairman and served in the Reagan Cabinet as the United States trade representative and later as Secretary of Labor; Robert Teeter, President Bush's poll taker; Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, who is active in Democratic Party circles.
Mr. Greenspan plays golf with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and tennis with Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He has known Richard G. Darman, the budget director, since they worked together in the Ford Administration. And possibly most important, he has been close to Mr. Bush for years, although, by his own choice, he rarely sees the President one on one these days.
If Mr. Bush should decide not to reappoint Mr. Greenspan, he will be breaking a fundamental law of politics about rewarding one's friends. In 1980 he worked for Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, and shifted his allegiance to Ronald Reagan only after Mr. Bush dropped out.
''There is an Administration in Washington with a lot of people who are friends of his,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''He has friends in Congress, too. So he comes to the table with a network of communications that is very helpful to him. Certainly Paul Volcker didn't come to the table with that, and I'm not sure anyone else in their position ever has.''
 
Pressure to Ease Credit
Mr. Volcker was not reappointed chairman of the Federal Reserve by Mr. Reagan in 1987. Mr. Greenspan was appointed instead, because the White House believed Mr. Volcker would keep too heavy a foot on the economic brakes in the 1988 election campaign. Under Mr. Greenspan, the Reserve raised interest rates steadily from March to July 1988, but did not do so again until December.
In the last few months Mr. Greenspan has been under constant pressure from the Administration to ease credit, but he has hardly relented.
He agrees that his political connections are an advantage as he tries to navigate the perilous political course. ''I know all the people,'' he said recently. ''I know the Democrats as well. I have a lot of friends on both sides of the aisle.''
For more than 30 years, Mr. Greenspan owned a highly successful economic consulting firm on Wall Street. Many of the nation's leading business executives were his clients, and he maintans contacts with them today.
But he has been involved in official Washington off and on since 1968, when he directed domestic policy research for the Nixon Presidential campaign. In 1970 he became a consultant to the Council of Economic Advisers, and from 1974 to 1977, with Gerald R. Ford in the White House, he was the Council's chairman.
 
Panel on Social Security
At the 1980 Republican National Convention Mr. Greenspan was a Ford-Reagan emissary when there was talk about Mr. Ford becoming Mr. Reagan's running mate.
In 1982 and 1983 he was chairman of a bipartisan commission on Social Security named by President Reagan and Congressional leaders that performed what seemed like a miracle at the time, forging a political compromise that put the retirement system on a sound economic footing.
In many respects Mr. Greenspan has relied as much on his personality over the years as on his skill as an economist. He has the unusual capacity to seem both confident and modest, to be outgoing in social situations and yet appear disarmingly shy.
At least in Washington, Mr. Greenspan, a bachelor whose regular companion is Andrea Mitchell, the Congressional correspondent for NBC News, seems to have no enemies.
Unlike some other economists who have been chairman of the Federal Reserve, including Mr. Volcker and Arthur F. Burns, who served in the Nixon Administration, Mr. Greenspan seems to have limitless patience. In his Congressional testimony he responds evenhandedly to questions mindless or astute.
While Mr. Greenspan is one of the few top officials besides Supreme Court Justices who almost always refuse to grant on-the-record interviews, he is willing to spend hours with reporters explaining the fine points of economics and his own views so long as he is not quoted.
 
Comity and Collegiality
''He never talks down to anybody, and you rarely meet someone who's so very able who's like that,'' said James T. Lynn, chairman of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, who was budget director in the Ford Administration when Mr. Greenspan was head of the Council of Economic Advisers.
On the Federal Reserve Board Mr. Greenspan has restored a comity and collegiality in discussion that was absent for much of Mr. Volcker's tenure. The votes on raising or lowering interest rates since he became chairman have been close to unanimous. Regularly, he has postponed actions until nearly all his colleagues were ready to move in the direction he wanted.
Some Administration officials and economists call this style indecisive rather than merely cautious, but Mr. Greenspan disagrees. ''You can lead an organization through persuasion or formal edict,'' he said the other day. ''I have never found the arbitrary use of authority to control an organization either effective or, for that matter, personally interesting. If you cannot persuade your colleagues of the correctness of your position, it is probably worthwhile to rethink your own.''
Wayne D. Angell, one of the swing votes on the board, said the chairman's greatest strength was his ability to judge people. ''He had a book on Wayne Angell very quickly,'' Mr. Angell said. ''He knew where I was and what I deemed important.''
 
A Maestro of Harmony
Mr. Angell suggested that perhaps Mr. Greenspan learned this talent at the Juilliard School of Music where, as a budding clarinetist and saxophonist, he studied for two years before switching to New York University to study economics.
''Maybe he learned the role of the conductor,'' Mr. Angell said. ''It's almost as if he provides cues to people. There's a flow to the discussion, a flow to the debate, and he will guide it like an orchestra conductor in the direction he wants it to go in.''
Mr. Greenspan's political skills are rarely so much on display as when he goes before Congress, as he did this week and last. He bobbed and weaved, telling lawmakers who asked him about prospects for an economic downturn that he, too, feared the economy was too sluggish, and telling those more concerned about inflation that he still considered fighting inflation his No. 1 priority.
On the one hand, he sympathized with people who find it hard to get loans. On the other, he said he did not observe a ''credit crunch.''
After two days of testimony, no one, not the financial markets and least of all the politicians, could be sure what his real intentions are about raising or lowering interest rates.
Toward the end of his House hearing Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, realized that it was hopeless to try to pin the chairman down. ''You're getting very, very good,'' Mr. Schumer told him, ''at the art of walking all those little tightropes.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Lawmakers Balk at Budget and Re-examine Taxes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 25

 BODY:
Rebelling against the latest attempt to resolve the state's budget crisis, Massachusetts legislators refused to approve a $13.7 billion budget and moved to repeal central elements of a $1.8 billion tax increase that was signed into law last week.
On Tuesday legislators had been expected to pass a budget for the fiscal year 1991, which began July 1. Instead the House proposed another increase in the income tax because, despite last week's increase, the proposed budget remained at least $300 million short of projected revenue. 
State officials said today that Governor Michael S. Dukakis, who has been calling for new taxes since last January, had agreed on Tuesday to reopen debate on the tax revisions because of the Legislature's paralysis on the budget.
To break the stalemate, legislative leaders met today to discuss the possibility of repealing major parts of the tax law, which included the largest increase in the state's history. The new law raised income and gasoline taxes, while extending the sales tax to 594 services that had not been taxed before, like legal and accounting transactions. Business executives have particularly objected to the sales tax expansion, arguing that it would only worsen the state's economic slump.
 
Even Higher Income Taxes
With the support of the Governor, House members proposed to repeal most of the service taxes covered under the new law, with a revenue loss of $174 million. The House proposal would more than compensate for the loss by increasing the income tax rate.
Under the law signed last week, the flat tax on earned income rose to 5.95 percent, from 5.75 percent. Today's House proposal would raise it further, to 6.25 percent this year and 6.5 percent in 1991. Massachusetts income taxes are already among the highest in the country.
After a decade of spectacular economic growth, the state's politicians are struggling to manage as recession has spread in New England. With rising unemployment and slower wage growth, tax collections in Massachusetts fell 3.3 percent last year, the first decrease since 1975.
But political leaders have consistently failed to agree on how to balance the budget. Massachusetts finished the 1990 fiscal year with a $1.2 billion deficit, but has yet to issue bonds to pay for it because of the political stalemate.
In June, Standard and Poor's, the credit-rating agency, warned that the state's rating would fall if the disarray continues. The rating is already the lowest of any state in the country, and one notch away from junk bond status.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua's Economic Slide Led to Strike

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Sandinista Democrats Please Stand Up'' (editorial, July 14), charging that ''If the Sandinistas think their influence in Nicaragua's army, police and unions entitles them to force the elected Government of President Violeta Chamorro to share power, they don't understand what democratic politics is all about,'' shows lack of understanding of Nicaragua and democratic politics.
The Nicaraguan general strike of the last few weeks was a popular reaction against worsening economic conditions since Mrs. Chamorro's installation and her attempts to initiate economic and social policies favoring the wealthy classes over the poor. Many of the poor, made miserable, not by Sandinista ''failed economic policies,'' but by 10 years of United States military and economic aggression, had voted for Mrs. Chamorro in the hope of relief. Disappointed, they acted. Not surprisingly, the Sandinistas, who do understand what democratic politics are about, supported them and made political capital from doing so. 
Chastened, the Chamorro Government - a deeply divided coalition put together with United States money for last year's election - has had to recognize reality. It will have to cease its efforts to govern by extraconstitutional decree and resort, as you recommend, to the National Assembly, where the Sandinistas hold the largest single bloc of seats as a result of that same election.
The Sandinista commitment to the democratic political process stands in contrast to that of many of their now-ruling political opponents. These resorted to a rule-or-ruin policy of noncooperation with either the provisional or elected Sandinista Governments of 1979 to 1990. They collaborated actively with the United States aggression that cost the lives of more than 30,000 of their fellow Nicaraguans and caused immeasurable economic destruction.
The Sandinistas, by their behavior in this strike, as during their years of rebellion against the dictatorship of Gen. Anastasio Somoza and while in power, have given a lesson in courage, commitment to principle and democracy.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Let 'Em Eat Cake

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
''In the war on poverty,'' Ronald Reagan often said, ''poverty won.'' That used to be just Reaganite overstatement; but under President Bush, poverty can hardly lose.
Earlier this month, Mr. Bush's Domestic Policy Council decided that he should embark on no new programs or strategies to reduce poverty in America. Instead, a White House official remarked jovially, the Administration would ''keep playing with the same toys. But let's paint them a little shinier.'' 
The council really wanted to help, another compassionate staff man said, but concluded that ''there were no obvious things we should be doing that we weren't doing that would work.''
Nothing obvious? When across the street from the White House the homeless are sleeping in Lafayette Square - and when in most American cities they're clogging the nighttime streets? When in the shadow of the Capitol dome, the poor rummage through garbage cans for something to eat?
Nothing they should be doing? When 32 million Americans are living in poverty? When 39 percent of them are children under 18, white, black and other?
Nothing that would work? When the life expectancy of black men in Harlem is lower than that of men in Bangladesh? When black family income in 1987 was only 56 percent of whites', the biggest gap since the 1960's?
Mr. Bush's council did have before it a few programs (mostly developed by outside experts, of course) that less responsible men might have considered worth trying - for instance, an expanded tax credit for the working poor. And since five million American women are supposed to receive child support payments, but only half of them ever receive the full amount, the council mercifully considered a national standard of child support, with Federal supplements to payments by absent parents.
But the outcome of such misplaced concern was foreordained. As an Administration official remarked: ''We realized we didn't have any cash. . . . It was fun to think about these things but for the time being we concluded that we don't want to do anything new, that we should just make things work better.''
Oh, what fun they must have had, indeed, before settling down patriotically to the grim reality of the bankruptcy and helplessness of Government in a nation barely able to afford $404,566 average annual family income for the richest 1 percent of the population in 1988.
The council did decide to shine up one of President Reagan's toys of that year, a reform he wisely designed to encourage welfare recipients to find jobs. The council did not say what jobs, nor specify other Reagan initiatives that might be polished - for instance, those that resulted in 19.7 percent of American children under 18 living in poverty in 1988.
Don't think the council was merely callous. Officials were well aware, they said, that a major ''investment in children'' would have a big payoff in the long run. The trouble was that such an investment - unlike, say, money spent on the Strategic Defense Initiative - was ''not likely to show an immediate reward.'' And though the family planning clinics that the council thought about proposing might well have reduced teen-age pregnancies, they would also ''cost money'' and might be seen as ''encouraging promiscuity.'' Not on George Bush's watch!
Perhaps among things to be made to ''work better'' are the farsighted Reagan-Bush policies that have led to astonishing changes in U.S. family income. Why tamper with a system that caused the average family income of the poorest 10 percent of Americans to fall 10.5 percent between 1977 and 1987, while the average family income of the wealthiest 1 percent rose 74.2 percent in the same years? Mr. Bush's Domestic Council knows a good thing when it sees it.
But no ''glitzy, splashy, high-profile'' new programs, like Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, need apply. After all, that high-profile approach only reduced the infant mortality rate by 33 percent between 1965 and 1975, and among blacks from 40.3 percent to 24.2 percent. Scarcely worth doing.
And where one in five Americans once had endured poverty, by 1980 all Johnson's glitzy efforts (many of them continued by Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter) had reduced that figure to only 1 in 15. Only 44 percent of poor households -less than half - had been raised above the poverty line by 1972.
Clearly, Mr. Bush and his men believe, another such victory and we are undone.

Risks to Cuomo If the Opposition Lacks Credibility

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Despite his self-confidence and his apparent lead in public opinion polls, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo arguably cannot afford to debate his Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret.
It is not that the Governor has been given much reason so far to fear Mr. Rinfret. Rather, the only thing Mr. Cuomo may have to fear is himself. Mr. Rinfret might prove to be such a pushover that the Governor, by going on the offensive, would be branded as a bully.
The usual reasons for avoiding debates apply, too. No incumbent likes to give an underfinanced and unknown challenger more exposure than necessary. In this case, though, the more exposure Mr. Rinfret gets, some contend, the better the Governor might do in November. 
This would be bad for the New York Republican Party, which chose Mr. Rinfret after 19 other potential candidates were approached by party leaders but declined. One measure of Mr. Rinfret's growing self-confidence, or perhaps his gullibility, is his insistence that he was really higher on the list than 19th.
Mr. Rinfret's failure to mount a credible campaign could deny the Governor a grilling that would better prepare him for a Presidential campaign. It could deny the voters an overdue comparison between Mr. Cuomo's lofty oratory and his record, which has been more down to earth.
Mr. Rinfret, an economic consultant, is not New York's first gubernatorial candidate who is not a professional politician. The last to run was Lewis E. Lehrman, whom Mr. Cuomo narrowly defeated in 1982. The last to win was Nelson A. Rockefeller, who was first elected in 1958.
Mr. Rinfret's criticism of Mr. Cuomo's spending priorities faintly echoes the Democrats' criticism of Mr. Rockefeller.
What, Mr. Rinfret was asked in an interview, was the difference between the two Governors? ''Rockefeller was a Republican,'' Mr. Rinfret quipped.
When pressed as to which government functions he might shed to close projected budget gaps, he suggested only that registering of motor vehicles and testing of civil servants be spun off to private companies. He said existing departments could perform more efficiently, but he declined to recommend that the total state budget be cut.
Mr. Rinfret insisted that he was not being evasive. As evidence, he suggested that the same question be posed to the Governor. ''I'll bet you get the same answers,'' Mr. Rinfret said.
He prefers, if he is to be compared to other aspirants who appear to have come out of nowhere, to be considered in the same category as Ronald Reagan, who metamorphosed from ''a grade B movie actor,'' in Mr. Rinfret's words, to Governor of California, and Donald H. Souter, the New Hampshire judge who is President Bush's choice for the Supreme Court.
Mr. Rinfret is not the first inexperienced candidate to say that business and politics are largely interchangeable, which is consistent with his philosophy of trying to capitalize on a perceived liability.
But he acknowledged that the political arena may be more partisan than the private sector. Moreover, he has already learned that in politics and government there is more emotion, with more people looking over your shoulder and less attention to the future.
Last year, Rudolph W. Giuliani, another political neophyte, had several months to bone up on municipal government before he declared his candidacy for mayor of New York City. Mr. Rinfret's tutorial began only eight weeks ago after he had already been designated by the Republican State Committee.
It shows. He answers many questions vaguely. There are others to which he acknowledges, in what further distinguishes him from professional candidates, that he does not know the answer or has not yet made up his mind. Refreshingly, he is also unfettered by many traditional boundaries of campaign discourse. He was cautious enough, in complaining that offensive behavior had gone unchecked at an annual ethnic parade in New York City, not to say which one.
But Mr. Rinfret complained that when he questions the way government is run, ''everybody's got an answer as to why you can't ask a question.''
Mr. Rinfret hopes to pose those questions directly to Mr. Cuomo. If the Governor insists, Mr. Rinfret would agree to debates that also include the Conservative and Right to Life Party nominees, although he dismisses their candidacies as not viable.
''We're going to beat him,'' Mr. Rinfret said of Mr. Cuomo. ''Watch.''
Some surveys have hinted that Mr. Cuomo could be vulnerable to a challenge by a viable opponent. Whether he will have one by November is debatable.

HEADLINE: For Dinkins, Ballroom's Fate Is Emotional and Sensitive Issue

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Blocks from the apartment where he raised his children, a somber hulk of a building, rich with history and once stained with blood, haunts Mayor David N. Dinkins these days. It embodies a hero of his past and his hopes for his old neighborhood's future, challenging him to balance the two.
Of course, that is not how Mr. Dinkins or most others saw it when New York City and Columbia University made plans to build a $25 million commercial biomedical laboratory on the site of the Audubon Theater and Ballroom in Washington Heights, where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965. The building is across Broadway from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, site of the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
 
Focus of Controversy
But the ballroom has become the focus of a controversy that illuminates the special difficulties of a mayor who is a self-professed expert in the politics of conciliation and consensus, and it has been cited by disparate groups as a test of everything from his policy on development to his loyalty to his race. 
From the beginning, the new building was to include a memorial to the slain civil rights leader, whose reputation has risen since his death with some who were uneasy about him while he was alive. One early plan would have preserved the 1912 structure, which also happens to be where William Fox began building the empire that became 20th Century Fox. Columbia eventually deemed that idea too costly and moved to tear the old building down.
As Manhattan Borough President, Mr. Dinkins backed the plan, which had evoked no great outcry and was sponsored by Mayor Edward I. Koch.
 
A Storm of Criticism
But as he took office as Mayor, and the project moved closer to approval, Mr. Dinkins met a storm of criticism over the future of the Audubon, where once crowds danced to the music of Latin orchestras, where Mike Quill held early organizing meetings for the Transport Workers Union, a ballroom that has even been the site for boxing bouts.
Last month, the Dinkins administration agreed to preserve about 40 percent of the ballroom, including the stage where the Muslim leader was shot.
Now, a month before the city's Board of Estimate is to take final action on the project before the board is eliminated under the new City Charter, a debate pitting the city, Columbia and some of Mr. Dinkins's political supporters against each other is still raging. At one extreme are those who say preserving anything less than all of the ballroom would amount to desecration, while others say forcing more changes now could unravel the entire project.
''It's an issue of peculiar political sensitivity for this Mayor,'' said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, Mr. Dinkins's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development.
''The issue for us is how do we strike a compromise as it relates to architecture and to Malcolm,'' said another senior mayoral aide.
 
A Blurred Debate
In fact, the debate is blurred, with preservation groups and civil rights advocates in an unusual alliance in which each occasionally uses the arguments of the other to buttress its claims. The local community board and the local City Councilman, Stanley E. Michels, back the project, which would employ 500 construction workers and 300 permanent employees.
In the middle of the argument is Richard D. Emery, a Manhattan civil rights lawyer who represents the Sugar Hill Historical Society, which wants the building preserved. Mr. Emery brought the lawsuit that led the United States Supreme Court to declare the Board of Estimate's voting structure unconstitutional last year, and he is now in the position of lobbying the body he helped to doom.
Mr. Emery's clients back a proposal crafted under the aegis of the Municipal Art Society in late spring that would preserve the entire ballroom and the distinctive terra-cotta facade of the building on Broadway between West 165th and 166th Streets. But mayoral aides and Columbia officials say this option would be too costly and not practical at this stage.
 
'Just Ludicrous'
Charles A. Platt, an architect and former member of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission who drafted the Art Society proposal, said the city's current plan to save a jutting portion of the ballroom building, and build the new laboratory around it to the north, was ''just ludicrous.''
''It's being mutilated rather than being saved,'' he said, adding that it would also be costly to shore up the old building while one piece was saved.
Michael Henry Adams, a preservation consultant who works for City Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields of neighboring Harlem, said her goal was to preserve enough of the Audubon to enable it to be designated a landmark. He said that the city's plan was ''laughable'' and that what would be left of the Audubon could not merit landmark designation.
''It's perhaps the most important African-American landmark in the city that isn't designated,'' he said. ''She absolutely believes it's worthy of designation and ought to be.''
Kent L. Barwick, a former chairman of the Landmarks Commission who is now president of the Art Society, said the commission's staff had discussed the building's importance in the early 1980's but never scheduled a hearing on it because city officials assured him that it would be preserved as part of any new development.
Driving the debate is the Board of Estimate's impending demise. Columbia, which began the project eight years ago, was eager to have it approved before the board went out of business. While Columbia has reached agreement in principle with the city on preserving part of the ballroom, and while city officials say they expect the university to contribute, it is still unsettled who will pay the extra costs involved, estimated at between $3 million and $5 million.
 
Money From Public Agencies
Public agencies are already contributing the bulk of the cost, with the city's Public Development Corporation committing $10 million, the State Urban Development Corporation, $8 million, and Columbia, $4.5 million in equity and $2.2 million in borrowing.
A pivotal figure is Mr. Dinkins's successor as Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger. She supports the plan's economic development goals, in which Columbia would lease space in the new six-story building to companies doing research in such fields as molecular biophysics, genetics, immunology and cancer.
But Ms. Messinger is also concerned about preservation and dissatisfied with the current compromise, and she does not want to contribute capital funds at her disposal to help finance it, as the city would like. She said she generally prefers the Art Society's alternative but is not ''slavishly wedded to it.''
Ms. Messinger also holds something of a bargaining chip since $8 million from the Urban Development Corporation is to be passed on from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As Borough President, she has until Aug. 4 to exercise veto power over such plans.
But city officials and her own aides concede that Ms. Messinger hopes to avoid that possibility by crafting a new compromise.
''My feeling is it will get resolved,'' Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said. H. Bernhard Haeckel, director of project development for Columbia, said even obtaining detailed cost estimates for the Art Society proposal would take two more years of study. The society's proposal would also shift the new building to the southeast corner of the site, where Columbia hopes to build another building eventually.
 
'An Important Point'
''That is an important point because the enormous effort that is being put into this for this relatively small building of 100,000 square feet can only be justified, if and when that building proves to be successful, if there's a possibility to expand,'' Mr. Haeckel said.
Hanging over the dispute, some city officials acknowlegded, is lingering bitterness in Harlem over Columbia's unsuccessful attempt two decades ago to build a gymnasium in Morningside Park. But other officials said Columbia has tried to compromise this time, pledging to double an existing $250,000 Malcolm X scholarship as a living memorial and winning the wary support of Malcolm's widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz.
Mr. Dinkins himself has tried to stay above the fray lately, though he did exchange sharp words with a young woman and her friend who questioned him about the project after an appearance at Columbia in May.
''Remember you are an African,'' the woman said, prompting the Mayor to whirl and retort, ''Listen, I was black before you two were born!''
Last week he said the problem was finding a way to pay to save even part of the ballroom. But he said of Malcolm X, whose speeches he often quotes, ''I think it is important that generations to come understand the contributions that he made.''

HEADLINE: June Orders For Durables Fell by 3.2%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
A large drop in demand for military goods like tanks and aircraft lowered orders for durable goods sharply in June in a new sign of economic weakness, the Commerce Department said today.
Orders for durable goods, which are designed to last at least three years, fell by 3.2 percent, or by about $4.1 billion, last month to a seasonally adjusted total of $124.7 billion, nearly wiping out a revised 4.2 percent gain in May orders.
 
Economists Caught Off Guard
The decline was a surprise for economists, who had predicted a slight pickup in orders of four-tenths of a percent. Durables orders are monitored closely because they can affect job opportunities and industrial production in the future. 
''This decline is worrisome, but I wouldn't make it into a recession without seeing a few more numbers,'' said Kathryn Kobe, an economist with Joel Popkin & Company, a Washington forecasting firm. ''
Military orders fell by 21 percent, to $7.99 billion in June, from $10.08 billion in May, after gaining 20 percent in May. That accounted for half of the overall drop in last month's orders, the department said.
The news helped spur a rally in bond prices because of the belief that the new sign of economic weakness would increase the chances for lower interest rates.
Jerry Jordan, the chief economist for the First Interstate Corporation in Los Angeles, said the durables report could have a positive effect by reinforcing the view that interest rates should come down.
The difficulty recently has been that easing rates by the Federal Reserve Board might appear that the central bank is giving up the fight to control inflation, Mr. Jordan noted.
 
Greenspan Reaffirms Stance
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress on Tuesday that the commitment to curb inflation remained strong and that recent moves to lower interest rates moderately did not mean a shift in policy.
Military orders are typically volatile because of the large dollar volume and long lead times required for completing production. But this sector has come under increased pressure with the reduction of international military tensions, leading to cutbacks in Federal spending plans.
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, for example, intends to lay off as many as 17,000 employees, or 13 percent of its work force, by the end of the year because of military cuts.
A reduction in durables orders was recorded in nearly every primary category of goods last month, the Commerce Department said.
Transportation orders, which make up 8 percent of total orders, were down by 4.8 percent last month, after a 10.2 percent climb in May. That was a surprise because the Federal Reserve reported last week that industrial production rose by four-tenths of a percent in June after gaining six-tenths of a percent in May, as automobile production increased each month.
 
Drop Despite Boeing's Gains
Most of the decline in transportation orders, the department said, occurred because of lower aircraft orders, which was also unexpected because the Boeing Company, the Seattle-based airplane maker, has been receiving large orders.
Boeing received orders for 67 civilian aircraft in January, 22 in February, 2 in March, 23 in April, 73 in May and 32 in June.
But Boeing also said recently that it would cut 5,600 jobs this year because of a downturn in its military business.
Excluding transportation, durables orders still fell by 2.6 percent in June, after gaining 2.1 percent in May.
The exception was nonmilitary orders for capital goods, which gained three-tenths of a percent last month after falling by 1.4 percent in May.
Analysts said today that the rise reflected strong overseas demand for American-made machinery and other products, a bright spot for the economy that is expected to cut the nation's deficit on trade in goods and services despite weak economic conditions at home.

HEADLINE: Bankers Set to Extend Trump Loan Deadline

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Bankers are preparing to extend the deadline on the bridge loan that saved Donald J. Trump from bankruptcy as they continue to prepare the documentation for a permanent loan package, bankers involved in the deal said yesterday.
The extension is routine, simply allowing more time for the larger loan package to be completed.
The $20 million, 30-day bridge loan, which is set to expire today, was made to the developer last month to help him meet principal and interest payments on the high-yield ''junk bonds'' that financed one of his casinos. The bridge loan was made because paperwork for a larger loan package could not be completed by the deadline. Failure to make the payment could have thrown the developer into bankruptcy. 
The bridge loan is backed by an array of the personal properties of Mr. Trump, including his interest in the Trump Tower retail complex, his private plane, and residential units he owns in another New York condominium building, the Trump Parc. Earlier this month Mr. Trump announced that he had leased the Trump Tower retail space once occupied by Bonwit Teller to Galeries Lafayette, France's largest retailer.
 
Little Surprise
There was little surprise among the lawyers and bankers working to complete the voluminous documentation for the more complete rescue package that more time would be needed to put all the legal pieces in place. The larger package is a five-year loan arrangement that includes $65 million in new money and deferred payments on about $850 million of the developer's $2 billion of bank debt. The $20 million bridge loan will automatically be paid off once the deal is completed.
The loan package, which was hammered out over several weeks by some of the nation's largest banks, including Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers Hanover, is intended to encourage Mr. Trump to reduce his enormous debt burden by selling some assets. It is structured to reward Mr. Trump with interest-rate discounts if he sells the assets quickly.
While the vast majority of the foreign and domestic banks that own pieces of large Trump loans approved the long-term financing package last month, Dresdner Bank A.G., one of Germany's largest commercial banks, has refused. Bankers said yesterday that the loan package would go through without Dresdner's approval.
 
Search for a Financial Officer
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is engaged in trying to find a chief financial officer who will help oversee the Trump Organization, the developer's main corporate vehicle. Bringing in such an officer was one condition of the loan package, but one banker involved in the negotiations said the search for a qualified financial executive willing to join the Trump Organization was an arduous one.
The banks are seeking a candidate with a traditional corporate background, and any candidate is subject to approval by both the bankers and Mr. Trump. The banker noted that because of the troubles of the Trump empire and the lack of perquisites like stock options at the Trump Organization, recruiting qualified executives was proving difficult.
Mr. Trump is also engaged in settlement negotiations with a Resorts International bondholders group that has filed a fraudulent conveyance suit against the developer. The Resorts bondholders charge that Mr. Trump's sale of Resorts to Merv Griffin in 1988 left the gambling and hotel company insolvent and that Mr. Trump did not pay enough for the Resorts assets he got as part of the same deal, including the then-unfinished Taj Mahal hotel and casino.

HEADLINE: Sun to Sell Its Computer Work Stations in Stores

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 25

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems Inc., in a direct challenge to personal computer manufacturers, announced today that it would sell its engineering work stations through computer retailers.
The move by Sun, which also introduced a new computer, is aimed at expanding the market for its machines beyond engineers and programmers to a broad range of office workers.
''This is Sun breaking out of the technical ghetto and beginning to walk down Main Street,'' said Mark D. Stahlman, computer analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons in New York. 
Also, the Tandy Corporation introduced a new home computer that comes with software for tasks like family financial planning, balancing a checkbook, storing recipes and organizing grocery lists. The move is expected to help Tandy head off a challenge from the International Business Machines Corporation, which re-entered the home computer business in June with the introduction of its PS/1 computers.
 
Retail Stores Named
Sun, based in Mountain View, Calif., said that selected dealers in three chains would begin selling its personal computers. The chains are Microage Inc. in Tempe, Ariz., Intelligent Electronics in Exton, Pa., and stores run by the Nynex Corporation in New York. The company said it hoped to have 200 dealers carrying its machines in a year.
The announcement is yet another sign of the blurring of the markets for work stations and personal computers. Work stations, which have been used primarily for science and engineering work, were once more powerful, more expensive and more difficult to use than personal computers. But they have been dropping in price below $10,000 and becoming easier to use while personal computers have become more powerful.
Sun until now has been selling its machines directly to customers, to other computer companies for resale or to specialized value-added resellers.
 
Machine With Color Images
Sun also introduced a new computer, the Sparcstation IPC, which will display color images. The machine, which can execute 15.8 million instructions a second, will sell for $9,000 without a disk drive and for $10,000 with a 207 megabyte hard disk.
Tandy's new computer, the 1000 RL, ranges in price from $750 for a machine with a floppy disk drive and monochrome monitor to $1,300 for the version with a hard disk drive and color monitor.
The machine replaces the 1000 HX, which was previously the low end of the Tandy 1000 line and sold for about $100 more. I.B.M.'s PS/1, by contrast, starts at $1,000 but has a built-in modem for communicating over telephone lines.
What is new in the 1000 RL, Tandy said, are the 24 built-in programs designed for home functions, including cataloguing collections and calculating interest rates and payments.

HEADLINE: USAir Loses $75 Million

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The parent of USAir said it lost $75 million in the most recent three-month period, attributing the drop to weakness in the nation's economy. America West Airlines said it registered second-quarter profits of more than $6 million, double its earnings from the comparable period last year. 
USAir Group Inc., based in Arlington, Va., said its quarterly loss was in contrast to profits of $101 million, or $2.29 a share, in the second quarter of 1989. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 was $1.71 billion, down slightly from $1.73 billion a year earlier. USAir Group chairman, Edwin I. Colodny, said that industrywide domestic capacity was growing faster than traffic, and widespread promotional fare cuts on both coasts had reduced per-passenger yields.
America West posted second-quarter earnings of $6.14 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with $3.03 million, or 14 cents a share, during the second quarter of 1989. Revenue rose 37 percent, to $326 million from $239 million.
The results reflect a major improvement over the first quarter of the year, when the airline reported a net loss of $2.6 million.
Al Frei, senior vice president of finance, said much of the improvement was a result of a substantial drop in fuel costs.
Phoenix-based America West reported a 49.9 percent increase in passenger miles in the second quarter over the comparable period last year, Mr. Frei said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New President in Line To Be Southeast Chief

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Douglas E. Ebert, who left the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in the spring after 22 years, has been named president and chief operating officer of the Miami-based Southeast Bank N.A. and is scheduled to become the bank's next chief executive.
Mr. Ebert, 44 years old, said yesterday of his appointment last week that he ''wanted to be in a position to be chief executive of a meaningful financial institution,'' and that was not how things were shaping up at Manufacturers Hanover.
In May, the New York bank reorganized its business into four major groups, and Mr. Ebert, who had wanted to head one of the groups, resigned when he was offered another job instead. 
At Southeast Bank, which has assets of $15.8 billion and 225 locations, Mr. Ebert replaces John E. Porta, who resigned in March. He will be working under Charles J. Zwick, 64, chairman and chief executive, who plans to retire in July 1993. ''It is the intent that I will be the successor,'' Mr. Ebert said. ''The reins will be passed over a period of time.''
Southeast Bank is not in the best of shape these days. It has suffered two quarterly losses this year and, although it expects improvement, still sees a loss for the full year. The Comptroller of the Currency has taken steps to strengthen the bank's procedures on real estate lending, credit review and establishing reserves.
''It's not a problem,'' Mr. Ebert said of the agreement with the Federal agency. ''It's a series of things they want us to do from a policy, procedural and monitoring point of view.'' He also said the bank would have no trouble meeting certain capital requirements sought by the Government by the end of the year.
Southeast Bank, Mr. Ebert said, ''has an extremely strong franchise built on a corporate and commercial business base.'' Florida's economy is strong, relative to what it has been in the last five years, he added, and most analysts expect Florida to continue its growth.
''This is not a New England, I can assure you of that,'' Mr. Ebert said.
Mr. Ebert, a graduate of Williams College, joined Manufacturers Hanover after college and worked in every major unit of the institution, from retail to international. In the last five years, he set up and ran Manufacturers Hanover's investment banking department.
Mr. Ebert said colleagues had told him that he would find a slower business pace in Miami than in New York. ''So far, I haven't found that at all,'' he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Electronic Data Systems And G.M.A.C. in Profit Rise

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 25

 BODY:
The General Motors Acceptance Corporation and the Electronic Data Systems Corporation posted solid second-quarter earnings gains, but profits slipped 21.3 percent at the GM Hughes Electronics Corporation, which includes Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics.
Taken together, the General Motors Corporation's three non-automotive subsidiaries posted combined earnings of $616.4 million, approximately equal to last year's $614 million.
G.M.'s consolidated financial results will be announced on Thursday. 
 
GM Hughes
GM Hughes said today that second-quarter profit was $189 million on revenue of $3 billion, compared with profit of $240 million on revenue of $2.9 billion in the period last year. Profit attributable to G.M. class H stock, which represents a right to share in the dividend of the G.M. subsidiary, was 47 cents a share, compared with 60 cents last year.
For the six months, GM Hughes earned $372.3 million on revenue of $5.85 billion, compared with earnings of $450.4 million on revenue of $5.89 billion last year.
Robert J. Schultz, chairman of GM Hughes Electronics, said the increase in the unit's revenue came because of a 16 percent increase in the electronic content in G.M. vehicles and increased sales at three groups at Hughes Aircraft. Profit was hurt, he said, because overall North American vehicle production was down from last year, because of development costs for future spacecraft products and because the effective tax rate increased compared with last year, when several nonrecurring tax credits were claimed.
 
G.M.A.C.
General Motors Acceptance, the finance unit, earned $302 million for the period ended June 30, compared with $269 million for the period last year. For the six-month period, it earned $638 million, compared with $625 million last year.
The increase in profit from financing operations, which make up the majority of General Motors Acceptance's business, was mostly because of borrowing costs in the United States, the company said. The average interest rate on United States borrowings was 8.6 percent during the period, compared with 9.28 percent last year.
The company said it financed 541,000 new cars and trucks in the United States during the quarter, compared with 711,000 vehicles last year. Overseas, it financed 173,000 vehicles, compared with 192,000 last year.
 
E.D.S.
Electronic Data Systems said profit rose 19 percent in the quarter, to $125.3 million, on revenue of $1.46 billion, compared with profit of $104.9 million on revenue of $1.38 billion. Profit attributable to E.D.S. stock, which represents a right to share in the dividend of the G.M.-owned subsidiary, increased to 52 cents a share for the second quarter from 44 cents a share last year.
For the six months E.D.S. earned $235.1 million on $2.87 billion in revenue, compared with $204.9 million on revenue of $2.66 billion a year ago.
Electronic Data Systems noted two information processing agreements signed during the quarter. One was a 10-year agreement to handle all data processing and communications operations for the Westmoreland Coal Company. Another was a five-year contract to operate an information system for the Westar Transmission Company, a unit of the American Oil and Gas Corporation. E.D.S. did not disclose the value of the contracts.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Down Only a Bit

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report continued to decline in the week ended yesterday. The declines, however, were not significant.
''We haven't as yet seen a significant decline in yields, perhaps because the bond market has yet to enthusiastically follow the Federal Reserve's lead in cutting interest rates,'' said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's. ''Should Washington come up with a feasible budget, we believe participants in the fixed-income market will become believers and then yields will decline further.'' 
Mr. Frank said he expected the yields on money market funds to decline before there is any major change in the interest rate structure in the fixed-income market.
 
Outlook for Tax-Exempt Sector
As for the tax-exempt sector, the yield outlook will also depend on what, if any, changes in the structure of personal income tax result from the budget negotiations now under way in Washington.
Meanwhile, the average number of days that managers of tax-exempt funds held securities in their portfolios was unchanged, at 51 days, in the latest week. But the assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $136 million, to $78.8 billion, with the average seven-day compounded yield down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.21 percent, while the 30-day average yield fell 6 basis points, to 5.31 percent.
For investors in the 28 percent bracket the equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield would be 7.24 percent, while it would be 7.78 percent for those in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Market Fund again topped the list, with a yield of 6.27 percent. The Strong fund is distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc., Milwaukee.
 
Rise in Taxable Fund Assets
The assets of taxable funds increased by $2.4 billion, to a total of $384.8 billion. Those of institutional funds rose by $600 million, to $82.6 billion. The gains were again attributed to a widening of the yield spreads between certificates of deposit and money market funds.
The average number of days to maturity of taxable securities held in managers' portfolios was unchanged, at 44 days, in the latest week.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund dropped 7 basis points, to 7.88 percent, while the 30-day average slipped a basis point, to 7.94 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 8.42, to 2,930.94; Investors Cautious

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices continued to recover yesterday from Monday's huge selloff, but trading volume weakened and investors remained exceptionally cautious in an uncertain market.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.42 points to close at 2,930.94. With Tuesday's 17.82-point gain, it has now picked up almost half of Monday's 56-point loss.
Volume fell to 163.5 million shares, from 181.9 million the day before. Advances outpaced declines, 895 to 583, although 57 stocks set new lows. 
 
'Not Just a Malaise'
Remarking on the current attitude of investors, Hugh Johnson, head strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said, ''It's not just a malaise; it's an edginess, a lack of confidence, concern that we'll get blind-sided by some earnings disappointment or disappointment emerging from the current budget negotiations.''
Some traders said they had heard talk in Washington that members of Congress, who supposedly could leave town early for the summer recess, were being asked not to make nonrefundable plane reservations before Aug. 10.
Although the rumor does not appear to be widespread, traders who had heard it and others who were asked about it said it sounded plausible. They reasoned that if legislators were being asked to stay in Washington, a good explanation might be that strong progress was being made on a budget compromise - which would help both the stock and bond markets.
Part of the reason for the market selloff on Monday, traders said, was that sentiment had spread rapidly that negotiations on cutting the budget had bogged down and that nothing would happen until after the recess. Now that may change.
 
Effect of Durable-Goods Data
Mr. Johnson of First Albany said that while orders for durable goods fell 3.2 percent in June, or less than expected, the market barometer is so unpredictable and volatile that traders do not give it much credit. Even so, he said, it could have helped and, when combined with the ''reasonably successful'' auction of two-year Treasury notes, could account for the improvement in the bond market. That, he said, ''could explain why stocks did well.''
Other traders said that comments before the House Banking Committee on Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped because he made it clear he wanted to control inflation.
Market performance, however, was mixed, with technology stocks advancing and energy stocks declining.
''Confidence has been shaken in earnings,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Investors are extremely tentative, and that's reflected in the low volume.''
 
Oil Stocks Fall Slightly
Oil stocks, which jumped Tuesday in the wake of new tensions in the Middle East, fell slightly after swift peace talks between Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were undertaken by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Of the three oil stocks among the Dow industrials, Chevron fell 1, to 77 3/4; Texaco fell 1/4, to 62 1/4, but had dropped to 61 7/8, and Exxon fell 3/8, to 49 5/8.
In the biggest drop among the Big Board's 10-most-active stocks, L.A. Gear, the athletic-shoe producer, fell 2 1/8, to 23, also hitting a new low of 21 7/8, after reporting a decline in second-quarter profits. Nike, a competitor, fell 1/4, to 88, but had fallen to 85 1/4.
Johnson & Johnson, which has reported a strong rise in profits, climbed 1 1/4 to 73 1/4.
On the Nasdaq, Cellular Communications, a cellular phone company, fell 2 1/4, to 33, on 2.8 million shares, after it agreed with Pacific Telesis to combine cellular interests in Ohio and Michigan. Dennis Leibowitz of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation said the stock was now ''unattractive.''
Among the technology stocks on the Nasdaq, Microsoft rose 2, to 71 1/2; Novell rose 1 1/2, to 49 1/4; AST Research rose 2 1/4, to 22 5/8; Sun Microsystems rose 1 5/8, to 33 1/2, and Conner Peripherals rose 1 1/4, to 27 7/8.
Motorola rose 2 1/8, to 79 3/4; Compaq Computer rose 2, to 59 3/8, and I.B.M. remained unchanged, at 114 3/4.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bond Prices Are Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose and long-term interest rates fell yesterday on evidence of further weakness in the economy and an indication that at least one key member of the Federal Reserve Board opposes the central bank's current stance on monetary policy.
A 3.2 percent decline in durable goods orders in June helped to push prices up initially. Most analysts had expected to learn that orders rose slightly last month.
Later in the day, bond prices moved higher again after a Fed governor, Wayne Angell, told an audience in Boston that any further easing of monetary policy would confuse world financial markets and cause long-term interest rates to rise. In his remarks, Mr. Angell seemed to suggest the Fed should remain more concerned about taming inflation than in using monetary policy as a tool to avoid recession. Over the last two weeks, market participants have become increasingly concerned that the Fed has shifted its priorities from dampening inflation to preventing a recession. 
 
Sale of New 2-Year Notes
The Fed governor's comments appeared on trading screens shortly after 1 P.M., when dealers placed bids on an $11.5 billion sale of new two-year notes. His remarks came scarcely 24 hours after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, completed two days of extensive testimony to Congress that outlined the reasons why the Fed had moved to ease monetary policy earlier this month.
''The bottom line is that Angell was articulating a view that is his own, one that reflects a difference of opinion between himself and the consensus at the Fed,'' said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
''But at this point I think the Fed would agree that a further easing in policy would be unwise. It has to wait for the market to see more evidence of economic weakness or of a substantive reduction in the Federal budget deficit before it moves again.''
The durable goods numbers, although notoriously volatile on a monthly basis, did little to dispel the notion that conditions in the manufacturing sector remain very soft.
''The data leave new orders at the low end of the range they have been stuck in since late 1988,'' Robert T. McGee, senior vice president and economist at the Tokai Bank Ltd. said in a written commentary.
''The numbers confirm that the slight pickup in manufacturing this year is modest at best and unlikely to gather much additional momentum.''
The orders numbers, which were released during early morning trading, provided the backdrop for bidding at the two-year note auction.
 
Securities Demand Strong
Demand for the new securities was strong, and bids submitted produced an average yield of 8.07 percent, the lowest yield so far this year, and well under the 8.41 percent average yield at the last two-year note auction on June 26.
Despite Mr. Angell's remarks, which helped bond prices more than shorter-term securities, the two-year notes were trading on a when-issued basis late yesterday at the same price level at which they were auctioned earlier in the day.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 1/4 late yesterday, up 13/32, to yield 8.53 percent. Late Tuesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.58 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 5/8, up 9/32, to yield 8.47 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 26/32, up 5/32, to yield 8.28 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.54 percent, down two basis points, or hundredths of a point. But six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.44 percent.
A number of new corporate debt issues were priced yesterday, including a $50 million 10-year note offering from Arvin Industries.
The 10 percent notes, which mature Aug. 1, 2000, were priced at $99.132, to yield 10.14 percent, 1.65 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are noncallable for life.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was light, dealers said. Prices of most actively quoted intermediate- and long-term issues rose by about 1/4 point, while prices of short-term issues were largely unchanged.
Meanwhile, in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, market participants said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed, With Gains Against Yen and Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in foreign exchange trading, rising against the Japanese yen and the British pound but losing ground against other key currencies.
Linda McLaughlin, a currency trader with Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the dollar's movement was largely affected by technical factors. She said the currency benefited indirectly from the yen's weakness against the German mark. 
Marketwide sentiment that the Bank of Japan will not be raising interest rates anytime soon has been putting pressure on the yen, while the mark has been supported by comparably higher interest rates in West Germany, traders said.
 
Effect of Tensions in Persian Gulf
The dollar has also been helped against the yen by jitters over rising tensions in the Persian Gulf between Iraq and Kuwait, which also lifted world oil prices. The situation has undermined some confidence in the Japanese economy, which is dependent on oil imports, traders said.
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar fell to a closing 149.13 Japanese yen, from 148.70 yen at Tuesday's close. It traded at 148.75 yen in London and at 148.80 yen in New York, up from 148.40 yen Tuesday.
The dollar was stronger against the British pound, which cost $1.8125 in London, down from $1.8250, and $1.8125 in New York, down from $1.8140.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6170 German marks, down from 1.62075; 1.3715 Swiss francs, down fromm 1.3785; 5.4170 French francs, down from 5.4365; 1,183.625 Italian lire, down from 1,186.00, and 1.15175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15655.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's, included: 1.6170 German marks, down from 1.6185; 1.3715 Swiss francs, down from 1.3750; 5.4185 French francs, down from 5.4275; 1.8215 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8230; 1,183.62 Italian lire, down from 1,184.75, and 1.1518 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1557.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. FAVORS LIMIT ON TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR LOCAL LEVIES

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and senior Congressional Republicans have agreed on a budget proposal that would limit the amount of state and local income taxes that taxpayers could deduct on their Federal returns, Congressional officials said today.
The officials said that under the Republican proposal, this Federal deduction, which is now unlimited for all taxpayers who itemize deductions, would be capped at $10,000.
The effect would be higher Federal taxes for large numbers of upper-income Americans, particularly those paying high state or local income taxes.
 
Democrats Cautious
The deductibility provision was part of a larger White House package of deficit-cutting proposals whose elements were disclosed by officials on Capitol Hill. The Administration made no public comment. 
The new approach reflected an effort by President Bush's representatives in the budget negotiations with Congress to take the steam out of Democratic attempts to raise the Federal income tax rate for the most affluent taxpayers above the current level, 28 percent.
Democrats reacted cautiously to the Administration's idea, saying study would be needed to see whether it was truly aimed at the wealthy and would not place a burden on middle-income taxpayers. They also expressed concern that the proposal might have an unfair effect on residents of states like California and New York, where state taxes are relatively high. $3 Billion a Year Participants in the budget talks said the Administration estimated that its proposal would generate $3 billion a year for the Federal Treasury. In addition, they said, the larger Administration plan envisions an increase, long expected, in the Federal excise tax on wine, beer and spirits, a step that budget experts said would raise $7.2 billion.
Mr. Bush abandoned his 1988 campaign pledge of ''no new taxes'' last month. The two current proposals, taken together, are the first concrete steps signaling the President's willingness to raise taxes in an effort to reach a budget deal with Democrats.
 
Local Officials Angered
But the deductibility proposal seems certain to provoke a fight with state and local officials, many of whom view it as a threat to their ability to maintain revenues in the face of an increased burden on individual taxpayers.
Today several such officials -Democrats and Republicans from around the country, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and New York City's Mayor, David N. Dinkins -were in Washington, where they held a news conference urging lawmakers involved in the negotiations to reject the idea.
Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes was discussed in negotiations leading to the overhaul of the Federal tax code in 1986. But although the deduction for state sales taxes was ended then, dropping the income-tax deduction was rejected because of fierce opposition from state and local officials like that shown today.
 
Impact on Taxpayers
Democratic budget negotiators said today that they had not had time to calculate the impact of the new Republican proposal on individual taxpayers.
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said 94 percent of those who would be affected by the restriction earned more than $100,000 a year. But some Congressional budget experts said later that Senator Packwood had apparently been referring to the total income of working couples and not that of individuals.
Warren Shine, a partner in the accounting firm of Ernst & Young, calculated that under the proposal, a New York City couple who had combined adjusted gross income of $100,000 and whose tax bracket was 28 percent would have paid $65 more in Federal taxes last year. The proposal would have cost a single person in the same circumstances $163, Mr. Shine said.
 
The Aim of the Talks
The negotiators from the White House and Congress are looking for ways to cut $50 billion from a 1991 Federal budget deficit that is now estimated at almost $170 billion, not counting the cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry. Participants in the talks long ago ruled out a deeper cut, fearing that it might tip the economy into a recession and realizing that in any case, combined tax increases and budget cuts of such a magnitude were politically unachievable.
Lawmakers said the Administration's new budget proposal, which, as expected, also calls for deep spending cuts in Federal benefit programs other than Social Security, was presented to Republican negotiators on Wednesday night by the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, and was agreed to by ''the bulk of the group.''
Mr. Darman had intended to put the full proposal to the Democratic negotiators today, but that move was delayed until Friday at the earliest because they were still working on proposals of their own.
''We're sorry to hear they are having difficulty, but we're ready any time,'' said John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
The Democratic negotiators, who met for several hours today after details of the Administration proposal began to seep out on Capitol Hill, said they now believed it would be impossible to conclude a budget agreement with the White House before Congress adjourns for a monthlong summer recess in early August. As a result, they said, they may not advance a competing proposal at all until early September.
Part of their concern is that if politically sensitive proposals for spending cuts and tax increases are made public before Congress leaves town, members will be subjected to enormous pressure from lobbying groups and constituents during the recess, perhaps causing the talks to collapse.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, suggested that the negotiators might try to hold bargaining sessions during the recess in hopes of reaching a compromise before the rest of Congress returns to Washington.
Quite apart from the tax issues, the two sides remain divided over how to apportion spending cuts between the Pentagon and domestic programs. The Administration proposal, said officials familiar with it, would cut $16 billion from programs like Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits and farm subsidies, but would not touch Social Security.
The Administration would also cut nearly $7 billion from the Pentagon budget next year, about twice as much as President Bush proposed in the budget he sent Congress in January. Democratic negotiators, however, want the bulk of the spending cuts to come from the Pentagon rather than domestic programs and are looking to cut the military budget by at least $14 billion, while taking only $7 billion to $8 billion out of benefit programs.
 
The Deductibility Debate
Limits on the deduction for state and local income taxes would have a major impact on New York and other states that rely heavily on those taxes to finance a wide array of programs and services. New York's Congressional delegation has already mounted a lobbying campaign to block any changes in the Federal deduction, and by their presence today Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins hoped to dramatize their view that the limitation would be devastating to the state.
They were joined at the news conference by officials from Indiana, Pennsylvania and Michigan, who also inveighed against the plan as an effort to solve the Federal deficit problem on the backs of local government.
Restricting the deduction would, for many taxpayers, effectively raise the cost of paying for state and local government. Opponents of the plan say that it would amount to ''double taxation'' because money that has been paid in local taxes would be taxed again by the Federal Government as income.
At the core of the objections is a concern that upper-income taxpayers in high-tax states or cities who can no longer deduct the full amount will flee over time to areas where taxes are lower. The result would be an erosion of the tax base on which states like New York, California, Massachusetts and New Jersey rely to finance operations.
Increases in alcohol taxes, another part of the Administration plan, are regarded in both parties as the least politically painful of tax increase options. Although Democrats tend to argue that such taxes are regressive, many lawmakers concede privately that the new health consciousness among consumers makes a rise in alcohol taxes more acceptable than it might otherwise be to the public.
Beer, wine and spirits are currently taxed at different rates, and industry sources familiar with the Administration proposal said the Administration was seeking to raise and adjust those rates so that all of them would be based on alcohol content. The increase would raise the current 16-cent Federal tax on a six-pack of beer to 81 cents, the current 3-cent tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of wine to 70 cents, and the current $1.98 tax on a 750-milliliter bottle of liquor to $2.54.
These changes would raise an estimated $7.2 billion in the next fiscal year, budget officials said. The taxes on beer and wine have not been increased since 1951. Taxes on distilled spirits, last raised in 1985, are now $12.50 per proof gallon.

HEADLINE: Castro Assails Spain for Standoff

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, July 26

 BODY:
In a speech marking the 37th anniversary of a guerrilla attack that began the Cuban revolution, President Fidel Castro bitterly criticized Spain today for the standoff involving refugees seeking asylum in its embassy here.
Mr. Castro described the recent flight of Cubans to European diplomatic missions here as ''the latest act of the U.S. against Cuba,'' and he accused Spain of acting as an accomplice to ''Yankee aggression.'' Eighteen Cubans have taken shelter in the Spanish Embassy and four have sought refuge at the Italian ambassador's residence. 
In a rhetorical challenge, Mr. Castro said he would be willing to set up offices so that ''progressive Europeans'' could receive Cuban emigres. If the United States is concerned about asylum seekers, he gibed, ''Let them send boats and visas.''
 
Laments Decline of Socialism
As for the $2.5 million aid program that Spain has suspended because of the dispute, the Cuban President said, ''We renounce it.''
With Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the former President of Nicaragua, and Julius Nyerere, the former Tanzanian President, as his guests of honor, Mr. Castro lamented the demise of socialism in much of the world.
He said that trade between Cuba and some of the countries that formerly were in the Eastern bloc ''has practically disappeared.''
Mr. Castro said that Moscow was ''making maximal efforts'' to help his country, but that even if the Soviet Union ''disintegrated or even disappeared,'' Cuba would ''continue to build socialism.''
Amid wide speculation about how Cuba will get by next year, when Soviet subsidies are expected to decline sharply, the President provided few details on his economic plans.
''If we must sacrifice on social projects, we must be ready to sacrifice them,'' he said. ''What we must not sacrifice is our development.''
Referring to the refugee crisis before Mr. Castro's speech, a Spanish diplomat, Fidel Sendagorta, said, ''We are awaiting events, trying to emphasize that tension should be reduced so that we can have serious discussions.''
Spain has refused to expel the Cubans, and Havana has said they should not be given refuge because they are not being sought by the Cuban authorities.

HEADLINE: OPEC Moves Closer to a Pact on Production

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 26

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries moved closer today to an agreement that would set a ceiling on its 13 members' production of 22.5 million barrels a day and raise oil prices to at least $20 a barrel.
''We are going to have an agreement in this conference,'' said Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, the Oil Minister of Iraq, whose tough position has significantly raised its stature as the new ''policeman of OPEC,'' as some delegates here put it.
Last week, Iraq warned Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to stop cheating on OPEC quotas, and over the weekend moved troops to its border with Kuwait in a show of force.
Kuwait and the Emirates backed down, and reports circulating here today said that Iraq has pulled back some of the troops it had sent to the Kuwaiti border. Officials of the Kuwaiti and Emirates delegations seemed resigned today to accept their production quotas of 1.5 million barrels a day each. 
 
Irritation Over Quota Cheats
Kuwait and the Emirates had been producing about 1.9 million barrels a day and 2.1 million barrels a day, respectively, before the Iraqi warning first issued on July 17.
Many OPEC delegates said they were relieved that Iraq got its way without pushing its confrontation beyond the point of troop movements and tough oratory. Many OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, a traditional ally of Kuwait and the Emirates, had expressed irritation with the chronic refusal of those two countries to abide by OPEC quotas.
The impact of their overproduction on prices cut into the revenues of all oil-exporting nations, including such non-OPEC countries as the Soviet Union, Egypt and Mexico.
The pricing and production accord, which is expected to be made final within two days, would reduce the amount of oil being pumped into world oil markets by about a million barrels.
 
'A New Minimum Price'
Despite the expectation among commodities traders that the OPEC agreement would eventually raise prices, trading today showed little effect. Saudi light crude oil, for example, sold for $15.85 a barrel, unchanged from Wednesday's price, while West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude oil, dropped 8 cents a barrel, to $20.30.
''We will have a new minimum price,'' Sadek Boussena, Algeria's Oil Minister and the OPEC conference president, told reporters today. ''There are several positions but all of them are in favor of higher prices.''
A senior Iraqi official, who insisted on not being identified, said that the price range under discussion was ''a minimum of $20 and a maximum of $25 a barrel.''
Today, Iraq proposed that the so-called minimum reference price, in effect a target price, be raised to $25 a barrel immediately. The current reference price is $18.
 
Iran Offers a Compromise
Saudi Arabia, which is also in favor of higher oil prices, has argued that setting too high a price for oil may not be realistic given the current glut in the market, largely due to the sustained overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates over the last few months. Saudi officials said they would favor a price a little lower than Iraq's proposal.
Iran, the other member of the troika that seems to be running the cartel nowadays, suggested a compromise, with a price of $20 a barrel coupled with a statement asserting OPEC's intention to push its prices upward over the next two years or so.
The Iranian proposal seemed most likely to be accepted, although some delegates said the price may be set a little higher at $21 or $22 a barrel to satisfy Iraq, Libya, Ecuador, and Nigeria, which are all backing higher prices.
Analysts said today that regardless of the price set, the cartel seems bent on a course for a steady but controlled rise in oil prices.
''There are not going to be any sudden shocks, but we all recognize that the price of oil today is far too low given inflation and the growing demand for OPEC oil worldwide,'' the Iraqi official said.
There was also a sense of confidence that OPEC's chronic inability to stick to its own agreements has been changed by the Iraqi military threat against any Arab oil producer who cheats.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Sanctions on Iraq Over Baghdad's Oil-Dispute Tactics

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has started a wide-ranging review of American policy toward Iraq and will consider new economic sanctions and export controls as a result of Iraq's threats against two oil-producing neighbors on the Persian Gulf, Administration officials said today.
They said the State Department and the Pentagon were alarmed by the tactics of President Saddam Hussein, who this month threatened Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with military action to force them to reduce oil production.
''What's gone on in the last several days has reaffirmed the need for a good, intensive look at Iraq,'' a State Department official said. ''We still think it's important to have a relationship - we need to be able to talk to Iraq - but at the same time there may be some specific areas where we'll want to be tougher with them.'' 
While the United States maintained official neutrality during the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, its policy gradually tilted toward Iraq and, apparently in response, President Hussein moderated his behavior toward the United States and his Arab neighbors in the Persian Gulf.
 
Policy Review Quickened
Administration officials said their review of American-Iraqi relations began earlier this year as a result of evidence that Iraq was expanding its efforts to develop chemical and nuclear weapons.
The examination was stepped up last week, when President Hussein threatened military action against Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates if they continued to flout oil production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Officials said the review would continue even though tensions eased Wednesday when Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates apparently agreed in Geneva to a new production accord proposed by OPEC.
From 1979 to 1982, Iraq was on the State Department's official list of states that sponsor international terrorism, meaning that it faced trade sanctions at that time. Even today, there are some products that cannot be sold to Iraq, including chemicals that might be used to make nerve gas.
Reports that the State Department might seek new economic sanctions against Iraq have circulated on Capitol Hill this week, delighting lawmakers who in the past have criticized the Bush Administration for failing to act decisively to protest human-rights and military abuses by the Iraqi Government.
 
Limited U.S. Leverage
''Our policy in the past has been totally inexplicable,'' said Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat. ''During Iraq's war with Iran, our Government agreed to look the other way at Iraq's support for terrorism, its involvement in weapons proliferation and even its use of nerve gas.''
''We can't afford to look the other way,'' he said, ''I think Saddam Hussein is now making the best case imaginable for why the United States must make a dramatic alteration in its policies.''
Administration officials warned today that the United States has only limited economic leverage over Iraq, and that additional sanctions would not have a dramatic effect on the Iraqi economy. There is only about $2 billion in annual trade between the United States and Iraq, most of it agricultural.
Late tonight the Senate debated a farm bill amendment that would restrict agricultural export credits to Iraq. But it postponed action until Friday, when the House is also expected to take up the farm bill.
Lawmakers have insisted that new sanctions would still have an important symbolic value. There was widespread indignation on Capitol Hill last month when the Bush Administration publicly urged lawmakers to resist growing sentiment to punish Iraq economically after President Hussein's recent threat to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
This month the Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved legislation that would deny agricultural credits to Iraq and would bar the sale of technology with potential military applications.
Haitham al-Najjar, first secretary of the Iraqi Embassy here, said in an interview that new sanctions ''would hurt Americans much more than Iraqis.'' ''It would hurt American farmers who are now getting the benefit of Iraqi imports, because Iraq could find many other markets to get what it needs,'' he continued.
He said, too, that Iraq considered its dispute with Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates over oil production to be an Arab issue. ''This is an Arab matter and will be settled as soon as possible,'' he said.
While President Hussein had moderated his policies during the war, when it ended he resumed actions that seemed intended to promote Iraqi domination of the region. In speeches and other comments in recent months, the Iraqi President has attacked the United States. Last week he accused the Bush Administration of conspiring with Kuwait to steal Iraqi oil reserves.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, today reiterated the Bush Administration's condemnation of President Hussein's recent threats.

HEADLINE: Battle for Family Leave Will Be Fought in States

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Groups that favor giving workers unpaid leave to care for newborn babies and ailing relatives are preparing to lobby individual states for legislation to do what a Federal bill vetoed by President Bush would have done.
Those who favor such legislation say some states delayed taking action while the Federal bill was making its way through Congress. The House sustained the veto on Wednesday.
''Most state legislatures are out of session now, but when they come back, this is going to be a big issue,'' said Donna Lenhoff, the legal director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, a lobby that is mapping strategy for state legislation.
Fifteen states have adopted some form of job protection for workers who need time off for family purposes, and 30 other states have considered similar bills in the last year alone. 
Some of these measures are more generous, than the vetoed Family and Medical Leave Act, while others are less generous. The Federal legislation would have provided up to three months of unpaid leave for workers with new babies or those seeking to take care of immediate family members. It would have applied to employers with at least 50 people.
 
Government Intrusion Charged
Mr. Bush said he thought the measure would have been an unwarranted intrusion of government into business affairs.
Business groups argue that requiring employers to provide family leave might have the unintended effect of discouraging employers from hiring women of child-bearing age, as well as men with burdensome family obligations.
Some opponents also maintain that since the legislation generally mandates continued medical benefits -even though the leave itself is unpaid - employers would be burdened with substantial costs.
''We oppose mandates,'' said Christine Russell, a spokeswoman for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''That's our reason: No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. We haven't estimated how much it would cost because we don't know if it's a receptionist or an office maanger taking the leave, or if the business is going to use a temp or pay overtime. There are too many variables to estimate the cost.''
 
Battle Anticipated
Angela Jones, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Indepedent Businesses, another group that opposed the Federal legislation, said she expected a fight in states that consider mandating family-leave provisions. She said that family-leave bills had already been introduced in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and that similar bills were ''more than likely'' to be debated in others.
''If there is a push on the state level,'' she said, ''we will have to fight it on the state level.''
But labor groups, women's groups and advocates for the elderly have pushed for such legislation, noting that most other industrialized nations have long offered family leaves, with pay.
The laws already on the books range from Iowa's 1987 statute giving women up to eight weeks of pregnancy disability time to a Connecticut statute that went into effect July 1 giving men and women up to 12 weeks off to care for a newborn or newly adopted baby, a sick parent, spouse or child, or to recuperate from an illness of their own.
And just last Friday, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. of Washington signed the broadest family and medical leave law to date, requiring most employers in the District of Columbia, except the Federal Government, to provide up to four months of unpaid leave to workers who need time off to be with babies or ill family members.
 
Gay Partners Included
Several states, including New York, have legislation requiring leave for those who have a pregnancy-related disability. But they do not require that a job be held for them.
The Washington law is the first in the nation that defines family members to include gay partners or any others with whom the worker lives ''in the context of a committed relationship.'' The leave can be used to take care of a newborn, newly adopted baby or foster child, or an ill child, parent, relative or lover.
The current spate of family and medical-leave legislation comes in response to vastly changed demographics in the workplace. More than 70 percent of all American women 20 to 54 years old now work outside the home, making it far more difficult for them to provide traditional care.
 
Stories of Lost Jobs
For working men and women alike, the lack of a leave policy can create impossible binds. Indeed, the Women's Legal Defense Fund has compiled the stories of dozens of men and women from all walks of life who needed to be out of work temporarily in times of personal crisis - and lost their jobs because their employers did not offer adequate leave time.
Jim Censullo, for example, was working as a manager for a large New Hampshire video company in November 1989, when his wife, Kathy, gave birth to their second child. Two days later, the Censullos discovered that their new son's heart had only one working chamber, that he needed emergency surgery, and might die at any time.
Although Mr. Censullo had kept his office advised of the baby's condition, his supervisor called him at the hospital eight days later, demanding to know when he would return to work. Mr. Censullo said that, given his son's precarious hold on life, he could not say exactly when he would return. Later that day, with his 10-day old son facing an uncertain future, and enormous medical bills, Mr. Censullo received a mailgram telling him he was fired. He was invited back only after the story appeared in New England newspapers; he instead took a job elsewhere at an $11,000 annual pay cut. His son, Anthony, needs further surgery, and the family is struggling to make ends meet.
 
Most Workers Unprotected
Despite the proliferation of state leave legislation, most American workers still do not have the right to return to their jobs if they take substantial time off for family or medical reasons.
Indeed, while many states offer some job protection in such circumstances, only Connecticut, Maine and Wisconsin guarantee leave for employees who adopt children, need to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, or have serious health problems themselves. A bill recently passed by the Illinois Legislature, but not yet signed by the Governor, would provide similar benefits.
Most of the other state laws are considerably narrower, although the coverage varies widely from state to state. The length of the leave varies, too, with most of the laws offering from six weeks to six months.
Many of the laws deal only with the right to take time off for pregnancy disability, but even those laws differ substantially. For example, Hawaii requires all employers to offer pregnancy disability leave, but Tennessee's law covers only those with at least 100 employees, and North Carolina's covers only state agencies.
''While many of the laws that have been on the books for a while are pregnancy disability laws applying only to women, the new laws now being considered tend to be gender-neutral, recognizing that men and women equally can have family or medical problems,'' Ms. Norton said.
 
Medical Leave Is Rare
The right to take extended time off for an employee's own medical problems is still relatively rare. In most states, even employees of long standing may lose their jobs when they develop a serious health problem.
The Women's Legal Defense Fund also cites the case of Florence McKeever, a Washington women who had spent 14 years as a housekeeper for a large apartment-management company when she broke a bone in her foot on March 20, 1988. Her doctor said she needed twelve weeks to recuperate, but she did not have that much sick leave. On May 23, Mrs. McKeever received a letter from her employer stating that her job was no longer available, and offering her a part-time job without the steady hours and without her previous benefits. Mrs. McKeever, then 56, found it difficult to find another job, and was forced to apply for unemployment benefits.
Under the new Washington legislation, Mrs. McKeever would not have lost her job. The new law, which still faces a review by the Congressional committees concerned with District affairs, would cover private employers with at least 50 workers and all city agencies. After three years, the coverage would be extended to firms with at least 20 employees.
To take advantage of the law, employees who have held their job for at least a year would be entitled to 16 weeks of family or medical leave every two years.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 27 about laws requiring businesses to grant leave for workers who need to care for ill family members or newborn babies referred incorrectly to the status of legislation in New Jersey. New Jersey's family-leave law, among the broadest in the nation, went into effect in May, giving employees at businesses with at least 100 workers the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave every two years to care for a new baby or an ill family member.

HEADLINE: Silber Taps Public's Anger to Run a Strong Race in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 26

 BODY:
Despite waging an unusual, provocative campaign that has broken many of the rules of politics and offended some women, blacks and the elderly, John R. Silber is running more strongly than expected in the Massachusetts race for governor and could be in position to win the Democratic nomination in September.
''I'd say Silber is now the person to beat,'' said Tom Kiley, a political consultant in Boston who is not affiliated with any of the candidates.
If Dr. Silber, the 63-year-old president of Boston University, does win the Democratic primary election in September, it could put him in a commanding position to capture the governor's office in November in a state with a weak Republican Party, whose two candidates so far have turned in lackluster performances, Mr. Kiley said.
Mr. Kiley and others acknowledged that Dr. Silber could still undermine his chances in the September primary with more of the kind of candid comments that have become his trademark. 
 
Shakespeare Line Flops
In the past week alone, for example, Dr. Silber antagonized many elderly voters by proposing that medical care for the aged be rationed to save the state's deficit-ridden budget. After saying he would not let the state pay for a heart transplant for an 80-year-old, Dr. Silber added: ''I want to remind the voters of Massachusetts that Shakespeare was right when he said 'Ripeness is all.' When you've had a long life and you're ripe, then it's time to go.'' The citation was from ''King Lear.''
Similarly, Dr. Silber outraged some feminists when he said at a forum on women's issues last week that he would not appoint someone like Gloria Steinem to be a judge. ''I would want to make sure that the judge was not so taken up in a cause, either the cause of women or the cause of minorities, that that judge could not act fairly if a male came before that judge,'' Dr. Silber said.
But Dr. Silber, a native of Texas and a former dean of the University of Texas, seems to have turned his candor into a weapon, capturing the popular anger in Massachusetts over a faltering economy, an endless state budget crisis and rising taxes.
''I think because the voters are mad and because he is the meanest dude to come along in a long time, people have elevated John Silber into a status where he is judged by a different standard,'' Mr. Kiley said. ''He has tapped into their alienation, and if he wants to tip the whole thing over, that's fine.''
 
Grabbing the Headlines
Ralph Whitehead, a professor of journalism at the University of Massachusetts, said Dr. Silber had broken one of the standard rules of politics by ''making himself into the issue in the campaign.''
''Normally, that is dangerous,'' Mr. Whitehead said. ''But Silber has managed to use it to dominate the campaign,'' he said, and has largely obscured his Democratic opponents, Francis X. Bellotti, a former State Attorney General, and Lieut. Gov. Evelyn Murphy. The headlines each day in Boston's papers and the local television news are constantly devoted to what have come to be called ''Silber shockers.''
In the most recent poll on the gubernatorial contest, published by the Boston Globe on June 19, Dr. Silber and Mr. Bellotti were tied with 32 percent each, with Ms. Murphy at 27 percent. The margin of sampling error in the poll was plus or minus five percentage points. Although the poll showed the three candidates virtually tied, that represented a huge gain for Dr. Silber, who began the campaign last winter with well under a 10 percent rating.
Lieutenant Governor Murphy has depicted herself as the only liberal in the race, willing to raise taxes to resolve the state's budget crisis and press forward with the expensive cleanup of Boston Harbor. But she has been hurt by her close ties to the now widely disliked Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who has been blamed for failing to halt the budget mess.
 
Not a Fresh Face
Mr. Bellotti has tried to claim the political center, appealing to traditional blue-collar Democratic voters. But he is 66 years old and has been burdened by his image as an old political warhorse - he first ran for Governor in 1963 - at a time of voter discontent with politicians.
Daniel Payne, another political consultant in Boston not connected to any of the candidates, said Dr. Silber might have injured himself by his comment on rationing medical care for the elderly. Some of Dr. Silber's earlier remarks, including one about the City of Lowell's becoming a welfare magnet for Cambodian refugees and his suggestion that welfare benefits be cut off for teen-age mothers who have a second child, were aimed at people who do not vote, Mr. Payne noted.
''But with the elderly, Silber put his tongue on the third rail of Massachusetts politics,'' Mr. Payne said. ''Silber finally picked on a group that can fight back.''
Nevertheless, Mr. Payne said, ''Silber sounds attractive to a lot of people because he hasn't learned the cautious vocabulary of politicians,'' adding, ''He is fresh and naturally different.''
 
A Hybrid of Sorts
Another of Dr. Silber's appeals is that he is a curious hybrid of liberal and conservative, as he illustrated in a televised debate last week. He once again stated his view that teen-age mothers who have a second child should be stripped of welfare benefits, but he also came out firmly against the death penalty and said he favored strict control on all types of guns.
''Silber is willing to take on the really tough issues,'' said John Cogswell, a retired treasurer of the New England Telephone Company in Boston. ''Too many politicians aren't willing to take on those issues. They're too willing to use platitudes.''
''The way Dr. Silber says things, his choice of analogies and flamboyant phrases, tends to get people to overreact,'' said Mr. Cogswell, who is a member of a special commission appointed by the Massachusetts Legislature to study a universal health care plan for the state. ''But it's part of a constructive dialogue, and he's getting people to think he might be able to change the aspects of government that appear out of control.''
In all the disputes over Dr. Silber, the two Republican candidates for governor, Steven Pierce, the House minority leader, and William F. Weld, a patrician former United States Attorney in Boston, have received far less notice. The Republicans, who make up only 13 percent of the state's registered voters, have not won the governor's office since 1970.
Mr. Pierce, a conservative who has made opposition to tax increases into an angry crusade, won the Republican state convention endorsement and appears well ahead of Mr. Weld.
But in a general election between Dr. Silber and Mr. Pierce, Mr. Kiley said, ''I think people will vote for the real thing,'' the really angry man, Dr. Silber.

HEADLINE: A Cyprus Solution - Long Overdue

BYLINE: By Michael D. Barnes; Michael D. Barnes, a lawyer and ex-Representative, lobbies on behalf of Greek-American organizations that support Greek Cypriots.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A ranking United Nations official familiar with the U.N.-sponsored negotiations on Cyprus's future recently told me that, in his view, of all the world's intractable problems the Cyprus situation is one that is clearly solvable. He said that progress depended on outside pressure on Turkey, especially by the U.S., to remove its troops from the island nation, and on insuring that the Greek and Turkish Governments fully participate in any agreement on Cyprus's future political structure.
With all the dramatic changes taking place in the world, the time is ripe for strong U.S. steps to end the Turkish military's longstanding occupation of the island. 
Just over 16 years ago, 40,000 Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus. Thousands of Greek Cypriots were forced to flee to the south, leaving behind homes, friends and family.
The island continues to be separated, divided by the so-called green line, an artificial border that is patrolled 24 hours a day, just as the Berlin Wall divided Germany from 1961 until 1989. To this day, 35,000 troops and 65,000 colonists from Turkey remain in northern Cyprus.
The U.S. should play a central role in resolving this conflict. We are the only country with sufficient leverage to force Turkey to re-examine its military presence in Cyprus. For the last 10 years, the Turkish Government has received billions of dollars of U.S. military assistance; last year alone, we sent $500 million in foreign aid.
This level of military aid can no longer be justified as protecting U.S. interests from Soviet expansionism.
It is particularly ironic that one of the most significant effects of our aid is that it enables Turkey to continue financing its occupation of Cyprus.
If a primary goal of our foreign aid program is to promote freedom and self-determination, we are partly frustrating that goal.
For more than a decade and a half, the U.N. has tried to further negotiations by encouraging increased dialogue between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. This approach has not worked.
The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who controls the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, has no incentive to compromise. As long as he enjoys the military and political support of Ankara, Cyprus will continue to be divided, even though Turkey is the only country that considers the Denktash government legitimate.
In order to play a constructive role in breaking the impasse, the U.S. should place the following conditions on any future military and economic aid to Turkey: Its troops and colonists must be removed from Cyprus; Ankara must rescind its recognition of an independent state in northern Cyprus, and significant progress must be made toward establishing a constitutional democracy based on majority rule, the rule of law and the protection of minority rights.

HEADLINE: Municipal Services Shrinking in Suburbs

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Cities and towns across the New York metropolitan region are reducing services, sometimes drastically, under pressure from the slowing economy, declining state aid and a populace tired of ever-rising property taxes.
Many communities say they are struggling to keep essential services intact. In affluent towns where essentials are not yet the issue, what is being lost are the extras -cultural events, recreation programs, even door-to-door garbage collection - that helped define the communities and attract many of their residents.
''People expect their tax dollar to pay for more than police, fire and education,'' said Kevin T. Maloney, a spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. ''There's a sense that if you can't go to the library at night, or there are cuts in senior citizens' programs, some people will see this as real quality-of-life issues.'' 
In Windsor, Conn., a suburb of Hartford where taxpayers cut $4 million from the budget this spring, a library branch is closing, some street lights have been turned off and the school system is eliminating 33 jobs.
Savings also show up in scores of smaller ways. In Long Beach, L.I., members of all-star sports teams are receiving commemorative certificates instead of trophies this year. In Middletown, N.J., residents discarding old refrigerators and sofas now must take them to the dump, instead of having them picked up.
As communities re-examine the level of services they can provide, officials say they are caught between two opposing forces. On the one hand, there is a decline in revenue. Federal revenue sharing ended several years ago; state aid has slowed or decreased, and as the economy worsens, towns are encountering slower growth in their tax bases and more people failing to pay property taxes.
On the other hand, residents increasingly oppose large increases in property-tax rates, even as towns must rely on property taxes to finance a growing portion of their budgets.
''The tax burden has merely shifted to the municipal level,'' said Toni Anderson, the finance director of Windsor. ''The Federal Government cut out all its support, and the state government is in the process of cutting out its support while leaving in its mandates. We're the ones who are last in line.''
''It's going to be bad next year,'' said Richard P. Devine, the commissioner of finance for New Rochelle, a city of 72,000 in Westchester County. ''It's either that the tax rate is intolerably high, or we're going to do away with equipment and services that have always been there.''
 
'Room to Scale Back'
Mr. Devine said New Rochelle is affluent and can absorb more budget cuts. ''We have a lot of robust services here, and there is room to scale back some,'' he said.
Yet he said the city is facing the worst of both worlds in its 1991 budget: a tax increase of more than 10 percent, plus the elimination of some services that many residents take for granted.
Red Bank, a town of 12,000 in Monmouth County., N.J., is an example of a town that offers few extras to begin with.
''We really don't have that much leeway to reduce services,'' said Michael Arnone, a dentist who is the town's mayor. ''There aren't really a lot of things you can cut back on. So we cope in the only way we can cope, and that is by raising taxes.''
Because of cuts in state assistance, including general revenue sharing and money for health programs, Red Bank had to raise an additional $1.4 million this year to meet a shortfall in its $7.9 million 1990 budget. The owner of a house valued at $140,000 will see a $500 increase in property taxes, Dr. Arnone said.
Some towns are seeing alarmingly high numbers of people who are not paying their property taxes. Milford, Conn., collected about $1 million in taxes less than it expected in the current tax levy, because only 96.8 percent of the people paid, said Ruth M. Levine, the city's finance director. The town had anticipated 97.5 percent.
''In a budget that is 75 percent funded by property taxes, it's a problem,'' she said.
While many residents said that they do not want taxes raised any more, many also do not want services cut. In Windsor, where school budget cuts eliminated some extracurricular programs and intramural sports and 33 full-time employees, some parents are furious.
''The cuts were a knee-jerk reaction by a certain segment of the town,'' said John L. Reizian, who belongs to a group concerned about the effect of the budget cuts on education.
In New York State, revenue sharing for municipalities has been reduced for next year, but the decrease is being offset by a saving in the money the cities and towns are required to contribute to employee retirement funds. As a result, local government officials say, New York's municipalities are not in as much trouble as those in Connecticut and New Jersey.
 
'Remaining Status Quo'
In Islip, L.I., the Supervisor, Frank R. Jones, said the downturn in financing is being felt in relatively small ways so far. Over the last two years, the town has cut $50,000 from its programs for the aging. In the last year, the price of a meal for elderly people in the town nutrition program was raised to $1.50 from $1.00.
''In general, the programs we would normally expand and improve are remaining status quo, which means we are really falling behind,'' Mr. Jones said. ''We are spending more than we did just to keep the services.''
In New Jersey, cuts in state aid include the state's general revenue sharing program. It was reduced from $50 million to $20 million last year; it was eliminated altogether this year. In addition, the Legislature recently enacted tax increases and a new school-financing system that are intended to provide relief to a majority of the state's towns and cities, but are likely to raise property taxes sharply in many.
Jon R. Moran, senior legislative analyst for the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said that most towns and cities in the state were making cuts in their capital programs, postponing roadwork and other repairs.
In Newtown, N.J., a town of 8,000, taxes were raised an average of $550 a homeowner this year, said Camille Furgieule, the town manager. Still, the town had to reduce hours and cut several positions from its 65-person municipal staff. For the first time, the town will charge for its summer program for children. And the fall clean-up program in which residents could leave bulk trash for the town to pick up has been eliminated.
''The economy isn't as active as it has been, and it has a snowballing effect - it comes down to services in the municipality,'' Mrs. Furgieule said. Even with the cuts and tax increase, she said, for the first time Newton will have to borrow money against taxes it expects to receive in August and November to pay expenses through September.
In Connecticut, municipalities have seen a steady slowing in the growth of their tax bases - the growth was 3.1 percent last year, below the inflation rate - and in state aid. State aid grew 3.6 percent last year, the lowest rise in nine years, said Mr. Maloney of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. As a result, property tax increases this year averaged 8.2 percent.
The decline in state aid to West Hartford suggest what is happening around Connecticut. The suburb of 61,000 lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in state aid for non-educational services to private schools; it must pay those costs itself. It lost about $400,000 for special education. Altogether, it lost more than $1 million.
As a result, said Andrew F. Urban, the city's director of financial services, all-day kindergarten has been eliminated except in three schools with needy children; the hours at the public swimming pools and parks have been cut; plans to buy new equipment for the police and fire departments have been postponed, and the summer arts-and-crafts program has been dropped.
The small garbage ''scooters'' used to collect trash no longer go up driveways for door-to-door service, and next year the scooters, a symbol of West Hartford's high level of services, will be eliminated altogether.
Not many people like these budget cuts. And because property taxes are going up everywhere anyway, it is unclear whether residents feel that they are getting any benefit from this year's budgets at all.
''The citizens are not happy,'' Mrs. Furgiuele of Newton, N.J., said. ''They'll come in to my office and they'll sit there and I'll give them the facts. But they don't want to hear the facts. They just want you to fix the bottom line, and you can't do that.''

HEADLINE: State Enters Labor Dispute At Daily New

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Calling the labor dispute at The Daily News an explosive situation that could harm the regional economy, New York State's Labor Commissioner announced yesterday that he had appointed a fact-finding panel to help the two sides reach an accord on new contracts.
Hours later, a spokesman for The News denounced the decision as ''an unnecessary intrusion on a private labor matter,'' and hinted that management might try to use the state's entry into the smoldering dispute to impose new working conditions on its 10 unions without further bargaining.
The action by the Labor Commissioner, Thomas F. Hartnett, came shortly after Hezekiah Brown, chairman of the State Mediation Board, certified that despite more than 100 negotiating sessions over six months, efforts toward a voluntary settlement have not been successful. Can You Say 'Impasse'? Mr. Brown and other state officials have generally avoided using the term ''impasse,'' which has a specific application under Federal labor law. Under Federal statutes, management has the right to declare an impasse and impose new working conditions if it concludes that talks are stalling despite good-faith bargaining. 
But The News's spokesman, John T. Sloan, said that management considered Mr. Brown's assessment to be ''a certification by the unions that the talks have reached an impasse.''
Mr. Sloan declined to say whether The News was itself declaring an impasse, and when - or if - management might move to force the issue against the unions.
Mr. Sloan said the only statement he was prepared to make is that, ''We are not going to post conditions this weekend.''
State officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that the creation of a board of inquiry, allowed under a statute that has been used only nine times in 49 years, does not involve the declaration of an impasse, but merely a finding that settlement efforts so far have proved unsuccessful.
The Commissioner's decision, which he said was backed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, was hailed by union leaders as well as by Mayor David N. Dinkins, who said a board of inquiry ''is a sensible way to help resolve this dispute.''
Commissioner Hartnett said he would not be surprised if the panel, composed of three professional labor arbitrators, would ask The News and its unions to observe a cooling-off period during its 60-day inquiry period. Such a step, if honored by both sides, could eliminate the possibility of a strike or lockout before the end of the summer.
But the board has no legal authority to compel actions by either side, although it has broad power to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence as part of its inquiry.
 
Six Disputed Areas
Labor leaders have asserted that the financially troubled paper, owned by the Tribune Company of Chicago, has been maneuvering to try to break the unions by provoking a strike by declaring an impasse and hiring replacement workers.
Mr. Hartnett, flanked by Mr. Brown at a midafternoon news conference at Labor Department headquarters in lower Manhattan, said he had directed the panel to begin work ''as soon as possible,'' concentrating on six important areas of the dispute.
Foremost among these are The News's insistence on a ''management rights'' provision that would allow it to make sweeping reductions in staffing and other changes without prior bargaining with the unions; the issue of what staffing levels are appropriate, and whether ''the denial of management's overall proposals'' would lead to ''the inevitable shutdown of The Daily News.''
Mr. Sloan dismissed the board of inquiry as ''a blatant intrusion on the collective bargaining process'' and ''a diversionary tactic'' by the unions, whose members have been working without contracts since March 30.
 
'A Fresh Look'
But Mr. Hartnett said he had been persuaded that management and the unions could benefit from ''a fresh look at the issues'' by a team of impartial professionals.
''I believe a board of inquiry may be one of the only tools at our disposal to help avoid a strike and secure the future of The Daily News and its employees,'' Mr. Hartnett said. ''I can't imagine why anyone would oppose this.''
The panel members, all appointed by the Labor Commissioner, are the chairman, Martin F. Scheinman of Manhasset, L.I., a lawyer who has seved as an arbitrator in over 1,750 labor disputes around the country; Fred L. Denson of Webster, N.Y., also an lawyer-arbitrator, and Thomas F. Carey of Jericho, L.I., a professor emeritus of collective bargaining at the City College of New York.
On Monday, Mr. Sloan said that The News was prepared to try to block any inquiry by appealing to State Attorney General Robert Abrams, the National Labor Relations Board and, if necessary, the Federal courts.
Yesterday, the spokesman, complaining that the publisher of The News, James Hoge, had been informed of the creation of the board of inquiry only 20 minutes before it was announced to reporters, said management would have to study Mr. Hartnett's decision before deciding on its next step.
Mr. Scheinman, reached by telephone, added: ''Obviously we hope that management are going to be full participants. We see our role not as intruders but as assisters.''
Mr. Hartnett's announcement came two days after the Allied Printing Trades Council, the unions' umbrella group, announced plans to persuade advertisers and readers to begin boycotting The News. On Wednesday, the Tribune Company reported that quarterly operating profits from its newspaper division had plunged $27.1 million ''primarily due to operating losses at The Daily News.''

HEADLINE: Rinfret Urges Freeze On Spending by State

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
In a broad presentation of his fiscal policies if elected New York's governor, Pierre A. Rinfret says he would balance the state budget by freezing spending at its current level but would avoid sweeping cuts in state personnel and programs.
The 66-year-old Republican candidate spelled out his positions in an interview with The New York Times, the most extensive in the two months since he emerged from political obscurity to become a candidate for governor.
 
Colorful Language
The interview, conducted on Tuesday, reinforced Mr. Rinfret's image as an unorthodox politician. For example, to help solve the protracted problems in public housing, he said he favored selling housing units to tenants. who would receive a state subsidy for the purchase. At another point he disagreed with many party regulars by saying he would support Medicaid financing of abortions and having universal health insurance at the national level. 
In the interview, Mr. Rinfret frequently resorted to colorful language not often used by candidates. At one point, he described Ronald Reagan as ''a great B movie actor;'' at another, he said he favored a marketplace in Harlem because ''they like being out in the open.'' Still later, saying that remarks he had made criticizing The Times were misunderstood, he added, ''I was fooling around, like a moron.''
On another question, whether he would address New York City's contention that the state was shortchanging it on education aid, Mr. Rinfret said: ''You want the rest of the state to kill me? They feel this city is ripping them off.''
Detailing his fiscal solutions, he said that if elected, he would impose a spending freeze and try to have private industry take over some of the smaller functions the state is now performing, like Civil Service testing, registering motor vehicles and overseeing the semiautonomous Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
In addition, the candidate, who is an economic forecaster, said he expected an upturn in the state economy that would produce enough revenue for the state to ''grow out'' of its budget difficulties. He also predicted ''a real bonanza'' in 1992 as the Bush adminstration ''gooses'' the economy in anticipation of the Presidential election.
Mr. Rinfret, who often responded frankly by saying he did not know the answer to a question, conceded that he was still learning about government and politics as well as the unwelcome discipline of ''sound bites'' as he tries to topple one of the leading Democrats in the country, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The state's fiscal problems dominated the one-hour-and-40-minute interview as Mr. Rinfret proposed solutions that were at least unorthodox for a Republican and sometimes seemed inconsistent and contradictory.
Along with a spending freeze, he called for restoring the income tax cut deferred this year by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature. But he acknowledged a gap of at least $2 billion in next year's budget because of one-time revenues in the current budget. He added that he could not provide all the details of his budget-balancing plans until after the election, when, if elected, he could study the budget more closely.
Asked about what cuts he would make in the budget to close the gap, he balked. ''I don't want to cut the budget,'' he said. ''I'm having trouble with the word 'cuts.' I'm terrified that you're going to say that I was talking about cutting the budget.''
 
'Pork Barrel' Spending
But he did talk about one politically sensitive cut - legislators' member items, money they can allocate to various groups in their districts. He called it ''pork barrel'' spending, costing $120 million annually, that he would veto.
He talked of improving efficiency in government, saying it could save 5 percent of the budget, but did not specify how. He said Medicaid costs could be cut by $400,000 by encouraging people to use clinics rather than hospitals.
He said New York has far more state workers per its population than any other state and yet he demurred at calling for layoffs or the elimination of programs. ''I don't believe in throwing people out of work,'' he said.
Of the bistate Port Authority, he said, ''I'd offer it to Florio.'' Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey shares responsibility for the agency with Governor Cuomo. Mr. Rinfret said that if the authority were sold to private interests as a cost-saving measure, he would insist on a toll freeze for 10 years.
 
'No Different'
He expressed confidence that he could convince New York voters that ''political experience is no different than economic experience.''
The candidate, seated across a table from three Times reporters, appeared relaxed in the interview. By his side was his campaign manager, Assemblyman John Faso of Kinderhook.
The candidate's exuberance sometimes gave way to annoyance as he challenged the basis of a question and denied some statements attributed to him by reporters and politicians. ''I'm shocked by the amount of material that is made up about me,'' he said. He declined to be more specific.
On other matters, he said he would put a college campus in Harlem as well as an open-air market to encourage neighborhood development.
He said he favored the death penalty but opposed Mr. Cuomo's alternative of life without parole because ''a new governor gets in and decides that 20 years is enough'' and gets the law amended.
Mr. Rinfret departed from many New York Republicans in supporting legalized abortion and from virtually all of them in supporting Medicaid financing of abortions for poor women. But he was more of a mainstream Republican in supporting a bill requiring parental consent for abortions for women under 18.
Of universal health insurance, he said, ''I'd like to see it nationally.'' But he opposed such a program at the state level because it would become a ''magnet'' for the sick from other states.
In opposing a state moratorium on Adirondack Preserve private development, he said, ''In simple form, it's creating an elitist environment.''
 
'That's News to Me'
Confronting questions about his credibility, he steadfastly maintained that he had not tried to persuade Herbert London, now the Conservative Party candidate for governor, to be his lieutenant-governor running mate, that he had not sought the Conservative endorsement in a meeting with its leader, Michael Long, and had not told Republican leaders, as they have said, that he was willing to spend $500,000 of his own money for the campaign.
''That's news to me,'' he said of the London offer. Of the meeting with Mr. Long, he said, ''On my word of honor, I never sought his party's nomination.''
As for the money commitment, Mr. Rinfret was emphatic. ''May the Lord strike me dead; I never promised $500,000,'' he said. Asked about the $540,000 he has contributed to his campaign, he replied, ''Everybody said I was going to do it, so I said what the hell, I might as well do it.''
Was that commitment a major factor in his selection? ''My answer is very simple,'' Mr. Rinfret said. ''It smacks of buying and I ain't going to buy nothing.''

HEADLINE: Starrett City Withdraws Proposal To Offer Apartments to Soviet Jews

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The owners of the Starrett City housing complex in southeast Brooklyn yesterday withdrew a plan to make apartments available to Soviet Jewish emigres.
The proposal was criticized by housing advocates as an attempt to evade a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that the complex had used racial quotas to discriminate against black and Hispanic families on its waiting list.
Harvey Rudman, the president and chief operating officer of Starrett City Associates, said yesterday that the company had dropped its inquiry to the Department of Justice about whether the emigre plan would violate a consent decree that Starrett had signed in May 1989. 
The company signed the decree after a November 1988 Court decision outlawed quotas at Starrett that favored whites over minority families.
 
'Viewed as Divisive'
A Starrett spokeswoman, Devorah L. Fong, said the emigre plan was dropped after City Council members and representatives of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins ''expressed concern that it might be viewed as divisive.''
''We didn't want to contribute to the mounting tensions in the city,'' she said.
The plan became known this week, after Starrett officials acknowledged it in response to questions from The New York Times.
The complex - which opened in 1974 and whose motto is ''Where harmony is a way of life'' - has 46 buildings with nearly 6,000 apartments. About 55 percent of its residents are white, and its waiting list includes about 8,000 families.
Ms. Fong said the inquiry was not meant to create a certain ethnic mix but as a way to increase Starrett's ''economic diversity.''
The idea, which developed after Mr. Rudman was approached by organizations representing Soviet emigres, was to provide housing assistance of up to $2,000 over two years. ''But it was never a formal proposal,'' Ms. Fong said. ''It was just an inquiry as to whether this kind of thing would be permissible.''
Critics said the plan was meant to increase Starrett's white population to enhance market value if the owners converted the complex to a cooperative, as would be possible after 1994. They also charged that hundreds of apartments were held vacant for higher-income people who could pay market rates.
Ms. Fong said that apartments were not being held vacant, that 95 percent of Starrett's newest residents are black, and that the idea would not have allowed Soviet emigres to circumvent the waiting list.

HEADLINE: Man Tells of Stealing 13 Buses, Police Say

 BODY:
A 25-year-old from Queens who was arrested on Wednesday in the theft of a bus for a joy ride has confessed to taking 13 of the 22 buses that have been stolen in the last year, the transit police said yesterday.
The suspect, Darius McCollum of 107-35 Fern Place in Jamaica, told officers of the surface-crime unit, which has been investigating the thefts, that he stole 13 buses from Transit Authority depots, a spokesman for the transit police, Albert O'Leary, said. 
Officers who interviewed Mr. McCollum, who drives trucks in the winter and is now unemployed, described him as a ''bus buff'' who is familiar with bus jargon and operations, as well as the procedures of the unit that tracked him. He told one officer what duty the officer had been assigned to years ago.
Mr. McCollum was wearing a bus driver's uniform when he was seized driving a stolen bus. Officer Michael Minero said, ''It's clear from the way he talks that he's been around bus drivers for some time.''
The officers said Mr. McCollum apparently stole the buses ''for the fun of it and usually parked them near depots, so they could be recovered.''

HEADLINE: On Stage

BYLINE: By Enid Nemy

 BODY:

Short Stories in Song
''Heart's Desire'' had a developmental workout at Purchase, N.Y., for three weeks in January, and it's having another at one of the small theaters at Vassar College beginning Sunday. Even at this early stage, said Glen Roven, who conceived the musical, the film rights have been optioned by the producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters. In the fall there will be a production at the Cleveland Playhouse, and if everything works out as planned, a $3.5 million production of the show will be on Broadway in February.
Mr. Roven, who began his theatrical career as a rehearsal pianist while still in college, said the show was inspired by the power and the current popularity of short stories, and the thought that it would be interesting to transfer this idea to musical theater. He began by asking four writers to work on individual segments of a theme, taking in ''people's relationships and how to cope in these difficult times,'' using a different age group, from the teens to the 40's, in each segment. The individual but thematically related episodes were written first as short stories and then adapted for the stage by Stuart Dybek, Beverly Lowry, Armistead Maupin and Treva Silverman. The settings are Chicago, Texas, San Francisco and New York. 
The show, which will star Peter Gallagher and Alyson Reed, will be directed by Jack Hofsiss. A. Joseph Tandet, Michael Frazier and Mary Nelon are producing. Mr. Roven has written the music and lyrics.
 
Proposing Through Playbill
Christine Catti and Michael Schwendemann have known each other for five years, ever since they were at Queens College. Earlier this month, they went to see ''Aspects of Love.'' As Miss Catti was leafing through the Playbill before the show began, she saw her friend's name at the bottom of a letter. ''Wow,'' she said, ''what's this?'' Mr. Schwendemann, who knew what was there, replied, ''Read it, you dope.''
This is what she read: ''Dear Playbill: I am interested in spending the rest of my life with Christine Catti, production assistant at the Roundabout Theater Company, but I don't know if she will accept this proposal from a currently unemployed actor such as myself. What do you think?''
Playbill, which apparently had never had a marriage proposal in its letters column, said she should accept.
Miss Catti said she was ''totally shocked and amazed'' at the letter, but she pulled herself together enough to accept. Mr. Schwendemann then extracted a ring from his pocket and put it on her finger. ''And after that, I was supposed to watch the show!'' Miss Catti said.
Mr. Schwendemann is no longer unemployed. He now has a part in ''Social Security,'' opening in Port Jefferson, L.I., next month. The wedding is scheduled to take place in the fall of 1991 because, Miss Catti said, ''we have to afford it.''
 
Bless This Musical
It could be a first, but in theater one never knows. At noon today, ''Shogun,'' the James Clavell musical scheduled to open in November, will be blessed at a Shinto ceremony to be conducted by Haruki Kadokawa, who, in addition to being one of the musical's producers and a film producer and director in Japan, is also a High Shinto priest. Mr. Kadokawa will be assisted by four other Shinto priests who traveled to New York City from Japan, with ceremonial garments, especially for the blessing. The ceremony, incidentally, is not only for the musical, but also for the cast, creators, production staff and theater - the Marquis - where the show will be performed.
 
Sinise on Celebrity
''This business is so difficult; it's like, who is the flavor of the day?'' said Gary Sinise, who plays Tom Joad in the Steppenwolf Theater Company's production of ''The Grapes of Wrath.'' ''Television and Hollywood have done that; it's all about the moment and not the long haul.''
As for himself, said Mr. Sinise, a founder of Steppenwolf who has worked in motion pictures, on television and on stage, ''momentary celebrity is not that interesting.''
''Longevity is the important thing,'' he said. ''I see having a very long career and doing a lot of different things: acting, directing and even writing.''
Mr. Sinise, who as an adolescent was ''a very bad, mixed-up kid with a lot of problems,'' said his life turned around when he tried out for a high-school production of ''West Side Story.''
''Me and a bunch of other rotten kids went to audition,'' he said. ''We thought that beating up the kids on stage would be a lot of fun.'' He was amazed, he said, when the drama teacher, Barbara Patterson, ''cast the bunch of us.'' He credits Miss Patterson and Jeff Perry, a co-founder of Steppenwolf and a fellow cast member in ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' with introducing him to a ''whole new world and turning my life around.''
''It's a gypsy life, but that's the way it is being an actor,'' he said, ''changing face to be another person and changing locale. But you're fortunate to be working enough to be a gypsy.''
 
Improvements for the Lortel
Work began this month on a $250,000 renovation of the Lucille Lortel Theater, the original home (when it was called Theater de Lys) of shows like ''The Threepenny Opera,'' ''Brecht on Brecht'' and ''Cloud 9.'' Among the improvements, expected to be completed by early September, will be new seating, new air conditioning and facilities for the handicapped, including a chair lift to the mezzanine. Cattle Call? Not Quite. So maybe you'll never make it to Broadway, but if your dog is a terrier, there's a possibility that he or she will. A canine open audition is coming up Aug. 14 for the role of Asta, the dog that is almost as memorable as William Powell and Myrna Loy in the ''Thin Man'' movies. ''Nick and Nora,'' the stage show based on the characters in the novel by Dashiell Hammett, is scheduled to open on Broadway in February with Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason playing the Charleses. Roseland, 239 West 52d Street, is the place to go. Information: 768-3826.

HEADLINE: New Faces: Adrienne Shelly and Robert Burke;
2 Performers Who've Lived Their Roles

BYLINE: By KAREN SCHOEMER

 BODY:
Although 24-year-old Adrienne Shelly and 29-year-old Robert Burke are making their screen debuts in Hal Hartley's film ''The Unbelievable Truth,'' both actors seem to have known their characters inside out before even reading the script.
When Ms. Shelly was a teen-ager, she made a deal with her parents. She agreed to go to college and earn a sensible degree in something other than theater so that she would have something to fall back on if her acting career did not work out. But midway through her junior year as a communications major, Ms. Shelly lost patience with student life and asked her parents to let her out of the bargain. She moved to Manhattan, found a small apartment in Chelsea and began working in the theater. 
Like Audry, the character she plays in Mr. Hartley's critically acclaimed film, Ms. Shelly realized that deals can be a hindrance instead of help in achieving goals. Audry is a disaffected, hardhearted high-school senior who arranges elaborate deals with her father to combat the ennui she feels in her sleepy hometown on Long Island. She is convinced that the world is going to end, so she agrees to attend Harvard only if her father donates money to a coalition for nuclear disarmament. When a fast-talking fashion photographer boasts that he can make Audry a wealthy model, her father renegotiates the college deal out of greed. Then Audry falls for Josh (Mr. Burke), a black-garbed stranger with a shadowy past, who is returning home after several years in prison.
 
Cynical yet Vulnerable
''Josh is the only person in the whole film who doesn't let Audry get away with her behavior, and I think that's what attracts her to him,'' Ms. Shelly said in a recent interview at a Manhattan coffee shop. ''The way I see it is that love can put an end to this bureaucracy people go through in their relationships. But it can't blind you to the fact that maybe there are bombs, there are problems and the ozone layer is depleting.''
Ms. Shelly, who like Audry grew up on Long Island, lends her character the brash, overconfident grandeur of a cynical teen-ager yet reveals a stark vulnerability as the film progresses. In a long confrontation scene with Josh, Audry confesses her feelings without knowing she has a giant smear of lipstick across her cheek. ''That's my favorite scene in the movie,'' Ms. Shelly said with a laugh. ''It's very like me to have something like that happen.''
Although Ms. Shelly has been offered other film work, she said she chose ''The Unbelievable Truth'' as her feature debut partly out of empathy with Audry's sense of displacement. ''I did a lot of acting when I was a child,'' she said. ''I was very shy - the kind of kid who ran into a corner and cried on parents' visiting day.''
While growing up, she attended several performing-arts camps, then moved into professional stock theater when she was 15. Between her work on ''The Unbelievable Truth'' and a starring role in Mr. Hartley's second film, ''Trust'' (to be released next year), she founded her own theater company, Missing Children, whose premiere production will open next month at the Perry Street Theater in the West Village. ''Theater represents to me this phenomenon in juxtaposition to real life, where there are all these imposed guidelines,'' she said. ''Ever since I was little, it never seemed fair that I had to live by these rules. Why did I have to go to sleep just because it was dark? I never liked those guidelines. In theater you don't have to live by them.''
 
Acting and Life
Mr. Burke shares Ms. Shelly's disrespect for doing things the conventional way. Although he said he has appeared in ''thousands of performances'' throughout high school and college and was regarded as one of the most promising actors in his class at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., he left acting for several years after graduating from college. His departure was partly motivated by the death of his father, to whom he was very close. ''I was meeting people and they were, like, 'He's so brooding; he's so angry,' '' he said. ''And I was angry. I was sad.'' But Mr. Burke was also disenchanted with the pressures and personal economics of professional acting. ''I just always wanted to take my time with this whole nonsense,'' he said recently. ''I saw other people slamming themselves against a wall. I respect them for their tenacity and resilience, but I'm not in the big rush.''
He taught in an experimental education program for three and a half years, then took up carpentry. The break from acting helped him, he said. ''It got rid of the acting voice and the acting speech. It gave me a life and life experiences.''
A first-generation Irish-American who grew up in Manhattan and on Long Island, Mr. Burke had nearly given up on the idea of returning to acting when he received a call from Mr. Hartley about the role of Josh. ''I knew the character would give me the debt, and now he's returning to the only place he knows. He's a character who has been rehabilitated. Josh doesn't blow up. He doesn't have any catharsis. He won't get angry because perhaps he'll skip right to rage.''
In the film, every move Mr. Burke makes is cautious, restrained, contained by the stigma of being an ex-convict. Even when he doesn't move a muscle, his face is thoughtful, grim. ''The interiority of the character -there is that interiority in me,'' he said. ''It was easy in one respect to play that part after taking years off of acting. It was like a little self-imposed exile. And Josh coming out of prison and everything - I say sometimes that my exile was completely transferable to the charcter.''
''I'm a lot more cautious now, a lot quieter,'' he said. ''I didn't want Josh to be sentimental. I wanted him to be above that. There is a transcending quality in the acceptance of someone's life.''

Skip the Pen, Forget the Paper; Just Send Videos

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
CBS is having a promising run with original programming this summer. At 10 P.M. on Thursdays, the network is doing very nicely indeed with ''Northern Exposure,'' a show about a doctor from New York who moves to Alaska. And at 9:30 P.M. on Fridays, there is ''Wish You Were Here,'' the second episode of which can be seen this evening.
''Wish You Were Here'' was developed by Those Guys International, a new outfit of three men in their early 30's. Robert Altman and Steve Bawol, who grew up together in Greenwich, Conn., produced the 1988 syndicated series ''The Street.'' Taped with hand-held videocams, its 40 half-hour episodes told slice-of-life stories about police officers in Newark. Skip Lane, who grew up in Greenwich Village, was their agent at the William Morris Agency and set up the 1988 project. 
For ''Wish You Were Here,'' the three men are almost entirely sticking with videocam technology, using the Sony Hi-8-millimeter format for taping with local actors on locations that include New York, France, Hungary, Spain and Morocco. The economic angle is obvious. Episodes are brought in for about half the normal cost of a prime-time network series. More to the point, however, ''Wish You Were Here'' adds up to fresh, offbeat and imaginative television.
Our hero is Donny Cogswell, and he is played by Lew Schneider, a comedian who not only looks but also acts like Tom Hanks. With perfect timing, Donny decides to leave the rat race of Wall Street. He is more interested in his new video camera, which he sees as the perfect instrument for capturing ''all my special moments.'' His boss is not far off the mark when he says Donny's problem is attitude. It seems to be unfocused. Donny cheerfully agrees, and decides to travel around the world, sending back videotapes as postcards. Voila, the concept!
Last week, Donny wound up in Paris after leaving the choice of destination up to an airline clerk. ''If I choose, something terrible will happen,'' Donny said. ''They'll serve lasagna.'' On the banks of the Seine, Donny interviewed surly flower vendors and passionately kissing lovers, all in an effort to win back his former girlfriend in New York, who was watching the video postcard while trying to tell her new boyfriend not to be jealous. (''Is that Tom Hanks?'' asked the beau. ''What's he do to his hair?'') The plot mechanics can be as dizzying as the characters.
For the show tonight, Donny has sent a video to his family ''somewhere near Cleveland.'' The tape chronicles his visit to Hungary, birthplace of his crusty Grandpa Ziggy (Sandor Szabo). Celebrating Grandpa's birthday, the family sits watching the tape with understandable trepidation. Grandpa is furious with Donny for quitting his job. Donny begins the tape by fondly recalling how he loved listening to Grandpa's millions of stories about growing up poor, or was it, Donny suddenly wonders, the same story told a million times.
Leaving Budapest, Donny heads for Grandpa's village, thrilled at the prospect of exploring his roots. (''Just call me Kunta Cogswell,'' he narrates.) Along the way, however, he runs into inexplicable hostility whenever he mentions the family name. One man throws him out of his car, driving off with the puzzling advice: ''Don't vorry. Be heppy.'' When the many misunderstandings are finally resolved, Donny and Grandpa will, of course, discover how much alike they really are.
''Wish You Were Here'' is somewhat messy and not entirely convincing. The camera work is too professional to have been recorded entirely by an amateur, no matter how enthusiastic. But the combination of travelogue and sitcom has a goofy charm of its own. And it certainly is original.
 
WISH YOU WERE HERE

HEADLINE: Japanese Lessor Thrives Under Loose Regulation

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
In the staid world of Japanese finance, the Orix Corporation is like a jazz musician. It can improvise across the spectrum of financial markets more freely than securities houses and insurance companies here because, as a leasing company, it operates under a separate and more liberal regulatory system.
As a result, the vibrant mix of businesses the company has assembled is providing some of the first clear notes of something Japan says it wants but still fears - a deregulated financial system.
Orix, which until two years ago was known as Oriental Leasing and is Japan's largest leasing company, has been more aggressive than most in experimenting with its regulatory freedom. It owns a professional baseball team, trades securities, and recently bought a fleet of commercial aircraft from bankrupt Braniff Airlines Inc. Such expansion is taking Orix increasingly into the United States. 
''We've been fortunate that when we see an opportunity, we can try it,'' said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, Orix's chief executive, a gregarious man who holds a master's degree in business from the University of Washington. ''But beyond that wall,'' he added, referring to regulated financial businesses, ''it's hard to even breathe.''
While banks and securities brokers are overseen by the strict bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance, leasing companies like Orix, whose traditional role was financing purchases of equipment for industrial concerns, report to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. The trade ministry has generally permitted leasing companies to wander across the financial spectrum with few constraints.
These regulatory inequalities have drawn much attention recently, as the move toward financial liberalization has become bogged down in bickering between banks and securities companies over the extent to which each should be allowed in the other's businesses.
In the meantime, Orix continues to pursue a bewildering number of businesses, although not with the approval of all. Moody's Investors Service, the financial rating agency, lowered Orix's debt rating in April.
''This is about the most complicated financial company to follow in Japan,'' said James Russell, an analyst here with Merrill Lynch & Company. ''What you learn from them really doesn't apply to anyone else.''
Orix trades financial futures and sells shares in commodity funds to individuals; it finances merchant ships and operates its own fleet; it is a leader in computer leasing, consumer finance and mortgage lending; it operates Budget Rent A Car in Japan, owns a small Japanese securities company and runs a London merchant bank.
 
Surprising Move in Jets
In a move that surprised many here, Orix paid $62 million last month to Braniff for the right to acquire 74 Airbus Industrie jets. It was the first time a Japanese financial concern had taken the risk not just of financing aircraft but of owning them outright. Mr. Miyauchi said that the jets would be sold or leased to airlines.
It was the sort of bold move for which Orix is known. ''What Orix has achieved has generally been by taking a lot of chances that others won't,'' said Roger Gough, an analyst here with Baring Securities.
But Orix's push into so many different fields has not been without substantial risks and criticism. For instance, the company was stuck with a $10 million debt from the bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert, most of which it has written off, and a $5 million loan to the wobbly Trump Organization in New York.
Those are decidedly modest sums for a company with total operating assets of 4.13 trillion yen, or about $28 billion. In the fiscal year that ended March 31, Orix also reported net income of 19.3 billion yen, or $130 million at current exchange rates. Too Far Afield? But as Stuart Matthews, an analyst here with Barclays deZoete Wedd, a British securities firm, commented, ''The big worry is that they are too aggressive, that they move too far afield.''
Mr. Miyauchi insists that such concerns will not slow him down. The company already has a sizable presence in the United States and is likely to become better known there. Late last year, it acquired the Commercial Alliance Leasing Company, a basic-equipment lessor, from the First Interstate Bank. It also owns 30 percent of the Commodities Corporation in Princeton, N.J., and 39 percent of Rubloff Inc., a big Chicago real estate concern.
Orix has also been shopping for more than a year for a Wall Street securities firm. ''We have tried to acquire several investment banks in the past but we stopped the negotiations because of price,'' said Sachio Hata, senior managing director and head of Orix's international operations. ''But we haven't given up.''
 
A Simple Strategy
One of the key criticisms of the company is that its disparate parts do not seem bound together by a coherent vision. Mr. Miyauchi acknowledged that Orix had followed a strategy of simply moving from each of its core businesses into related fields without much long-term planning.
''After you do that for a while, you find that what is happening at the right hand has nothing to do with the left hand,'' he said. ''But we feel these are businesses we know.''
The company contends that it has a basic conceptual framework. As explained by Mr. Hata, the aim is to become more like a traditional British merchant bank, acting as both an investor and an arranger of complex deals, collecting fees for its work. It is trying to become a giant financial intermediary, putting together borrowers and lenders from around the world.
Orix is diversifying, Mr. Hata added, to create a broader base of contacts and customers. ''Information is a very valuable asset for us,'' he said. ''That is the main asset we want to develop.''
Orix is also seeking new opportunities to sell portions of its investments to generate fee income. For a long time, it has syndicated portions of its large commercial loans and leases, and more recently has been doing the same with real estate developments in the United States, selling partnership interests to Japanese investors and keeping a piece of the financing for its own portfolio.
 
Clear Sign of Worries
The clearest sign of the worries this approach has created was the Moody's downgrading in April of Orix's debt rating to Baa2, from A3. Moody's cited three reasons for its shift: concern that the steep upswing in Japanese interest rates over the last year had increased Orix's costs faster than the company's ability to pass on those costs to customers; the heavy lendings to the Japanese real estate sector, which has boomed over the last five years but which some believe may be in for a fall, and the company's relatively weak capital base. Orix has 189.7 billion yen, or about $1.28 billion, in shareholder equity - equal to 4.6 percent of its operating assets.
Mr. Miyauchi insisted that the concerns were overblown. He maintained that Orix had locked in long-term borrowings at relatively low fixed rates and that it started this process before interest rates spurted upward.
As of March 31, Orix's long-term borrowings of 2.33 trillion yen were greater than the short-term debt of 1.886 trillion yen. That is a reversal from the year earlier, when riskier short-term debt outweighed long-term debt by 1.73 trillion yen to 1.2 trillion yen.
''You can't earn any profits without risk,'' Mr. Hata said. ''My personal feeling is that we are always walking towards the edge of a cliff and that we must have the skill not to go over.''
 
Close Call in Ships
Orix has extricated itself from deep trouble before. It dived heavily into ship financing in the 1970's and early 1980's and struggled to stay viable during the shipping industry depression that started in 1982.
Orix's profits, however, continued to grow, if slowly, because of a diverse earnings base. Mr. Miyauchi said it was not until two years ago that the company began to turn a profit from some of its older ships.
Orix's sudden interest in baseball is an example of how the company has grown. A couple of years ago it began to move into consumer financing and mortgage lending. However, its name was little known to the public. Mr. Miyauchi said that upon learning that a baseball team was for sale, a rare event in Japan, he jumped at the opportunity as a way to gain better name recognition even though the club, now called the Orix Braves, loses money.
''These opportunities do not come up very often in Japan,'' Mr. Miyauchi said. ''When we heard about it, we decided it made sense for us. You have to be willing to do that in our business.''

HEADLINE: Earnings Plunge at G.M., Ford

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 26

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company yesterday reported sharply lower second-quarter profits. Both auto makers cited difficult market conditions in North America, and both were hit by economic disruption in Brazil that virtually stopped vehicle production there.
The results from the nation's two biggest auto makers, however, were in line with forecasts of analysts, who have noted falling United States production and the high cost of rebates and other incentives.
On the New York Stock Exchange, G.M. shares slipped 37.5 cents, to $47.25, and Ford also fell 37.5 cents, closing at $41.875. 
 
Costly Incentives
Scott Merlis, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, said, ''Earnings were depressed but not as depressed as they could have been, considering that factory production was at recessionary levels and incentives were at a record high levels.''
Auto makers calculate revenue and profit on the basis of factory sales to dealers, not retail sales to consumers. G.M.'s non-automotive subsidiaries reported profits of $616.4 million, about equal to those in the period last year. The Chrysler Corporation, which analysts also expect to report lower earnings, said it would release financial results on Tuesday.
G.M. said profit for the second quarter was $900 million, or $1.32 a share, down 38 percent from $1.45 billion, or $2.23 a share, in the period last year. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up slightly from $33.5 billion in the 1989 quarter. The six-month profit was $1.61 billion, or $2.34 a share, on revenue of $64.1 billion, compared with a profit of $3 billion, or $4.60 a share, on revenue of $66.8 billion in the first half of last year.
 
Hurt by Brazil
In a statement, G.M. said, ''Second-quarter earnings reflected the adverse impact of higher sales incentives on G.M.'s North American automotive operations.'' But the company added that overseas profits, excluding results from Brazil, were at a record level.
The economic overhaul in Brazil in the first half of the year resulted in a temporary closing of the banks and the stoppage of most manufacturing. G.M. and Ford make and sell far fewer vehicles in South America than in North America, but the complete shutdown of operations had a significant negative impact both auto makers' income. Both companies said Brazilian vehicle production has resumed in the third quarter and is beginning to approach normal levels.
G.M., the nation's No. 1 auto maker, produced more than 1.5 million cars and trucks in North America in the quarter, a drop of 3.1 percent from the period last year. Overseas production rose to 630,000, from 622,000, during the quarter, an increase of 1.3 percent.
For the last year auto makers have faced relatively soft demand for vehicles in North America, forcing them to cut production. But they have also had to prop up sales with discounts, which they refer to as incentives. G.M. declined to say how much it spent in incentives during the quarter, but a spokesman said the amount was roughly equal to a figure made public by Ford: $1,050 for every car and truck sold. Ford said the average second-quarter incentive compared with an average incentive of about $1,000 during the first quarter and $600 during the second quarter of last year.
 
Ford
Ford said second-quarter profit was $770.7 million, or $1.67 a share, off 45 percent from $1.41 billion, or $3 a share, in the 1989 period. Revenues for the quarter were up 3.9 percent, to $26.9 billion, from $25.9 billion. Six-month profit was $1.28 billion, or $2.77 a share, on revenue of $50.5 billion, compared with $3.04 billion, or $6.45 a share, on revenue of $51.8 billion last year.
Ford's vehicle production in the United States for the quarter was 975,000, a 7.6 percent decline from 1.1 million a year ago. Elsewhere, Ford's factory production was 711,000, down 6.3 percent from a year ago.
Ford had other problems overseas during the quarter: labor stoppages in Britain and Belgium.
The No. 2 United States auto maker's capital spending increased by $83 million during the period, to $1.7 billion. David N. McCammon, Ford's treasurer, said corporate borrowings have been heavier partly because of heavier outlays for product development and other capital projects. Mr. McCammon said Ford's debt to equity ratio had risen to 27 percent in the latest period, from 17 percent in the first quarter and 10 percent in the period last year.

Who Is No. 1? It's Hard to Say

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHICH country has the strongest economy in the world?
The question has assumed growing importance at a time when economic strength is perceived as the cardinal component in national power and when the industrial world may be dividing into three regions centered on the United States, Japan and a united Germany. Finding an answer involves complex issues of concept and measurement.
As measured by gross domestic product - the total volume of goods and services produced by a nation, within its borders - the United States still has the largest economy by far. United States G.D.P. in 1989 was $5.17 trillion, compared with Japan's $2.82 trillion and a united Germany's $1.5 trillion, at current exchange rates between the dollar, the yen and the mark. 
But much of the difference is attributed to population size. With the American population nearly twice as large as Japan's and more than three times Germany's, America's per capita gross domestic product was $20,766 last year, less than Japan's $22,855 but ahead of united Germany's $19,230. These comparisons are misleading, however, because they are measured at current exchange rates, which have swung widely and are a poor indicator of the real value of money spent in one's own country. For instance, Japan is expensive for Americans earning dollars and the United States is cheap for Japanese earning yen.
To correct this distortion, three University of Pennsylvania economists - Irving Kravis, Robert Summers and Alan Heston - have developed measures of international output and income based not on exchange rates but on so-called purchasing power parities, which are conversion rates that equalize price levels among countries.
The Kravis-Summers-Heston data, prepared for the United Nations International Comparison Project, which compares income and output of various countries, show that Japan's per capita domestic product was only 75 percent as large as that of the United States in 1987, on a purchasing power basis. Commenting on that large gap, Herbert Stein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, says, ''There is already so much paranoia about Japan in the United States that it seems to me important to get this comparison right.''
But measures of economic strength should be dynamic, and Japan has been steadily narrowing the gap with the United States. From 1980 through 1989, Japan's real gross domestic product, measured in purchasing power parities, grew at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent, compared with the United States' 2.6 percent. If those disparate growth rates continue, Japan's per capita gross domestic product in the year 2000 would equal 95 percent of that in the United States, and Japan would pass the United States by the year 2004.
In an article, ''Capital Investment: Key to Competitiveness and Growth,'' in the current Brookings Review, Ralph Landau of Stanford University examines the reasons why productivity has been lagging in the United States. He finds a high correlation between national growth rates of capital per worker and labor productivity. Japan had a growth rate of capital per worker of more than 8 percent and a growth rate of labor productivity of nearly 5 percent from 1964 through 1985, while United States gross capital per worker rose less than 2 percent a year and labor productivity less than 1 percent a year.
The Council on Competitiveness, a group of economists, executives and union officials, reports that in absolute terms Japan has overtaken the United States, with investment in new factories and equipment at $549 billion in 1989, compared with $513 billion by the United States.
Without basic changes in United States policy, Professor Landau concludes, ''The high cost of capital, greater uncertainty, inadequate savings and investment, increasing reliance on foreign capital in an open world capital market, and short time horizons by corporate managers and public policy makers will continue to gnaw away at the American standard of living.''
Further concern on that score emerges from the 1990 Human Development Report of the United Nations. A Human Development Index prepared by a group of economists ranks 130 nations according to life expectancy at birth, adult literacy and real gross domestic product per capita, measured on a purchasing power parities basis. The United States was 17th on the list - tied with Austria and Ireland - with a life expectancy at birth of 76 years, an adult literacy rate of 96 percent and a per capita G.D.P. of $17,615. The index rated Japan first, with life expectancy of 78 years, adult literacy of 100 percent and per capita G.D.P. of $13,135.
The low United States savings rate and chronic budget and trade deficits inhibit the strength of the United States in dealing with foreign and domestic problems and issues, compared with Germany and Japan. This may be no cause for paranoia but it certainly calls for a lot of soul searching.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 10.15 Points, To 2,920.79

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices weakened yesterday in sluggish trading, with investors continuing to show nervousness over disappointing earnings.
Tobacco stocks were hit especially hard in the wake of a landmark court ruling in New Jersey.
Last week the Dow Jones industrial average twice stood within a quarter point of 3,000, but the blue-chip index closed yesterday at 2,920.79, down 10.15 and nearly 80 points away from that supposedly magic mark of 3,000.
Volume slowed to 155 million shares, from 163.5 million the day before. Declines outnumbered advances, 778 to 701, and, in a sign that suggested further weakness, 72 stocks set new lows. 
''Corporate earnings are still a factor,'' Kenneth P. Ducey, senior vice president of S. G. Warburg & Company, said of yesterday's downturn. ''And a lot of people are focusing on the G.N.P. numbers'' due out today. ''They feel the economy is slowing down more than anticipated.''
A report by a Prudential-Bache analyst, Melissa R. Brown, showed that of 410 companies surveyed, 18.5 percent reported stronger-than-expected profits but 24.6 percent reported weaker-than-expected earnings. Moreover, she said, she expected that as earnings continued to come in they ''will probably stay skewed toward disappointments.''
 
Over-The-Counter Trading
In over-the-counter trading, low earnings or forecasts of weak profits sank Wholesale Club 5 5/8, to 18 1/2, and Microsoft 2 3/4, to 68 3/4. On the Big Board, weak earnings news toppled Raychem 1 7/8, to 26 3/8; Delta Air Lines 1 1/2, to 65 7/8; Compaq Computer 1 1/2, to 57 7/8, and Goodyear Tire 7/8, to 27 1/4. UAL rose 3 1/4, to 163 after a rise in second-quarter profits.
Tobacco stocks tumbled in the wake of a suit against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, American Brands and the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation in which the Supreme Court of New Jersey, in a landmark decision, ruled that warnings on cigarette packages do not protect manufacturers from liability suits. The ruling will almost certainly be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
American Brands, which makes Pall Mall, Tareyton and Lucky Strikes, fell 3 3/8, to 66 1/4. Philip Morris, which produces Marlboro, Benson & Hedges and other makes, fell 1 3/4, to 47 1/4, and Loews, whose Lorillard unit makes Kent, Newport and other brands, fell 2 1/4, to 105 1/2.
Value Line, the investment survey, said in a report on Loews that despite increasing risks, ''it will be years before tobacco profits are permanently impaired.'' Even so, tobacco is so important to Philip Morris that 3.2 million shares changed hands yesterday, making it the second-most-active stock on the Big Board.
 
RJR Nabisco Refinancing
The New Jersey ruling also shook investors interested in RJR Nabisco's huge new refinancing, which coincidentally came to market yesterday. Of particular concern was the position long-term bank lenders would take towards the surprise court finding.
Litigation also hit Eli Lilly, the drug company, which produces the antidepressant Prozac, the company's best seller. Lilly fell 4 3/8, to 79 5/8, in heavy trading after three widows sued Lilly and others in Kentucky on charges that a printer who had used the drug killed their husbands in a shooting rampage that took nine lives. The stock fell sharply a week ago after a New York woman charged that the drug made her attempt suicide.
As it has almost regularly, program trading played a big role in shaping the market's movements. Birinyi Associates, which tracks such activity, said that the net impact of four selling programs and two buying programs was to lop nearly 19 points of the Dow. One nine-minute series of selling programs around 3:15 pushed the Dow down 11 points alone, it said.
With the Dow industrials down only 10.15, changes among the 30 stocks were small. Except for the 1 3/4 drop in Philip Morris, I.B.M., which fell 1 5/8, to 113 1/8, was the only decline of a point or more. DuPont rose 1 1/2, to 40 7/8, after joining with Merck in a 50-50 deal that will open Merck's foreign markets to DuPont and give Merck access to DuPont's drug technology.
Among the Nasdaq technology stocks, Novell fell 1 3/8, to 47 7/8 and Lotus Development fell 1 1/4, to 21 3/4. On the Big Board, Motorola rose 1, to 80 3/4 and Compaq Computer fell 1 1/2, to 57 7/8. On the Amex, Amdahl fell 1 1/4, to 15 1/2.
The S. & P. 500 fell 1.18, to 355.91; the Nasdaq composite fell 0.02, to 445.43 and the Amex market value index fell 0.62, to 356.33.

HEADLINE: Goodyear, Citing Costs, Reports Loss

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the world's second-largest tire producer, yesterday reported a second-quarter loss of $9.4 million, reflecting costs associated with belt-tightening and reorganization.
The company took a $21.4 million charge against second-quarter earnings, a result of a realignment of operations in North America, the laying off of 1,100 workers and closing of a plant in Massachusetts.
Goodyear, based in Akron, Ohio, announced last month that it would take a charge against earnings because of competitive pressures in the tire industry and the reorganizaiton. Goodyear's last quarterly loss was in the first period of 1986, primarily because of a write-off. 
 
Realignment of Offices
In the second quarter of last year, Goodyear reported net income of $27.1 million, or 47 cents a share. Sales for the second quarter of this year were $2.87 billion, up from $2.81 billion in the period last year.
The company said the layoffs would come from the ranks of its 50,000 North American workers. Goodyear said last month that it would realign its operations in North America into 28 regional offices reporting directly to headquarters in Akron, rather than the previous structure, under which 43 district offices reported to five regional divisions, which in turn reported to headquarters.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Goodyear shares were down 87.5 cents yesterday, closing at $27.25.
Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said that the results were affected by ''severe price competition in North America and Europe in both tires and general products,'' as well as higher costs, a prolonged strike at the company's plants in Turkey and the impact of economic revision in Brazil.
 
Auto Output Cited
Goodyear, the second-largest tire company after Groupe Michelin of France, has been burdened in recent years by sluggishness in North American automobile production, higher operating expenses and losses related to its All-American Pipeline, which runs from California to Texas.Brazil, where Goodyear has production operations, has also contributed to company problems.
The company said that its operating income in its tires and related products segment fell 46.1 percent, to $108.9 million in the quarter.

HEADLINE: Profits Off 26% At Whirlpool

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BENTON HARBOR, Mich., July 26

 BODY:
The Whirlpool Corporation said today that its second-quarter profit tumbled 26 percent despite a 4.3 percent increase in revenue. The company cited economic troubles affecting its Brazilian operations. 
The manufacturer of major home appliances said its net income sagged to $37 million, or 54 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $50 million, or 72 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1989.
Revenue rose to $1.71 billion, from $1.64 billion in the 1989 period.
Whirlpool said that if the results of its Brazilian appliance-making and marketing affiliates were excluded, net earnings for the quarter would have been up 18 percent.
David R. Whitwam, the company's chairman, said results in North America were strong, because of higher shipments, effective material cost controls, productivity improvement and aggressive marketing efforts.
Shares of Whirlpool rose 37.5 cents today, to $28, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds were little changed in sluggish trading yesterday, as dealers watched the progress of budget negotiations in Washington and waited for a preliminary report this morning on how much the economy grew in the second quarter.
Although participants in the budget talks were far from upbeat in their assessment, traders said that many credit market participants were assuming that the outlines of a compromise package that would cut the deficit by $50 billion would be agreed upon before early next month, when Congress adjourns for its summer recess.
''The Street is long securities and seem likely to stay that way on the bet that we will have a budget deal by the time Congress goes on vacation,'' one government bond trader said.
But private analysts said that the pessimistic comments coming from Washington were closer to the mark, even though there were indications late yesterday that Congress might delay its Aug. 3 recess by a week or more to come up with a budget package. 
''It is clear that some people are ready to buy bonds if Congress comes up with an agreement, but it seems very unlikely that will happen by early August,'' said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates Inc., an economic consulting firm.
 
Second Quarter Economic Data
The release this morning of second-quarter economic data, which will be accompanied by three years worth of revised numbers on the gross national product, was another reason to be cautious yesterday, dealers said.
In advance of the report, most economists are estimating that the economy expanded at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of around 1.5 percent in the second quarter, slightly below the 1.9 percent rate recorded during the first three months of the year.
Yesterday dealers also had to contend with the Treasury's monthly auction of one-year bills.
The $10.5 billion issue attracted bids that produced an average yield of 7.34 percent, the lowest since the one-year bill sale in January, and well below the average 7.52 percent yield at the last one-year bill sale on June 28.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, bills, notes and bonds traded in very narrow ranges throughout the session.
By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 9/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.53 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 102 19/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.42 percent. And the 8 percent two-year notes that were auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.08 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.56 percent, up two basis points, or hundreths of a point. Six-month bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.45 percent.
 
Corporated Bond Market
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, the BankAmerica Corporation offered $100 million of ten-year subordinated notes.
The 9.70 percent notes, which mature Aug. 1, 2000, were priced at $99.502 to yield 9.78 percent, 1.30 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A-3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In addition, the Ohio Power Company offered $50 million worth of 30-year bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Lehman Brothers won the securities, which were reoffered to investors with a 9 7/8 percent coupon priced at $100, 1.33 percentage points over the prevailing yield on Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020.
The securities, which are nonrefundable for five years, are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-1 by Standard & Poor's.
A ruling by a New Jersey court, which refused to apply changes to the state's liability law that retroactively protect tobacco companies, pushed the price of RJR Nabisco bonds down sharply in the high-yield ''junk bond'' market.
After the ruling, prices of the company's payment-in-kind bonds fell by two points or more.
The impact on outstanding issues of the Philip Morris Companies, an investment-grade corporate issuer, was more modest.
Late yesterday, the company's 8 3/4 percent securities of 1996 were offered at a price to yield about 9.30 percent. Before the ruling was announced, the bonds were trading at a price to yield 9.25 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported late yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended July 16.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of $10.5 billion worth of new one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen As Gold Ends Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but finished mixed against most other primary currencies in seesaw trading yesterday.
Gold prices ended mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.30 an ounce, down $2.70 from late Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $368.80 an ounce, $2.20 lower. 
The dollar rose initially in Tokyo when traders began selling yen, which lost ground across the board. Analysts said investors remained concerned about recent swings in the Tokyo stock market, as well as the uncertainty over whether the Bank of Japan will move to raise interest rates.
Higher interest rates in Japan would tend to support the yen by making yen-denominated investments more attractive.
Bob Morrissey, the senior trader at the Bank of Boston in New York, said rumors circulated that the United States Federal Reserve Board had entered the market to sell dollars and buy yen to stem the dollar's rise. But the rumors were not confirmed.
Trading was active. The dollar finished mixed in Europe and moved higher when dealings shifted to the United States. But profit taking late in the American session left the dollar lower against all currencies but the yen at the close.
Mr. Morrissey said some position-squaring occurred before today's release of the United States' second-quarter data on the gross national product. The figures might provide an impetus for the Fed to trim interest rates to stimulate the economy.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose by 0.98 yen, to a closing of 150.11 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 150.10 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 150.35 yen, up from a close of 149.83 yen on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the dollar had climbed by nearly a yen and a half, trading late in the afternoon at 148.80 yen before ending the day at 149.83, up from 148.40 on Tuesday.
In London, the pound rose to $1.8133, from $1.8125 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.8145 to buy a pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.8120.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Wednesday, included: 1.6230 West German marks, down from 1.6245; 1.3773 Swiss francs, down from 1.3800; 5.4360 French francs, down from 5.4445; 1,187.50 Italian lire, down from 1,188.75, and 1.1527 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1536.
Also in London, gold fell to a late bid of $368.65 an ounce, from $373.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $368.50 an ounce, from $372.50 late Wednesday. Gold rose $2.11 in Hong Kong to close at $369.94 an ounce.
On the Comex in New York, silver finished mixed.

HEADLINE: OPEC IN AGREEMENT TO RAISE OIL PRICE BY CUTTING OUTPUT

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 27

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an accord today calling for higher oil prices. This time Iraq, which has emerged as a powerful enforcer, will try to make the increase take hold.
If OPEC members do go along by limiting production, the agreement will raise energy costs modestly for American consumers, bankers said.
On numerous occasions over the last decade OPEC has tried to set price and production targets for its members, but the efforts have usually faltered because of a lack of discipline. But oil analysts see today's agreement as a credible one. 
 
Tough Talk From Iraq
This is primarily because Iraq has clearly threatened to use force against those who weaken the accord by overproducing - a threat directed mainly at the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, which together have been exceeding their quotas by about a million barrels a day. And Saudi Arabia, by far the largest producer in OPEC, appears to be content to have Iraq play this role.
Many nations dislike Iraq's overall aggressiveness. In Washington today, the House and the Senate defied the Bush Administration and voted to impose economic sanctions on Iraq, citing what lawmakers viewed as human rights violations and bellicose policies. [Page 5.] Today's accord in Geneva calls for a target price of $21 a barrel until the end of the year, up from $18 now, and fixes OPEC's production ceiling for all 13 members at 22.5 million barrels a day.
 
Former Enemies Cooperate
The agreement is a triumph for Iraq and Iran. After fighting a bitter war from 1980 to 1988, both desperately need greater revenues and can obtain them only through oil exports. Western nations, which consider them to have extremist policies, refuse to lend them money.
The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran said in interviews that they were confident the agreement is solidly based on a new political alliance that brings together OPEC's three major producers and power brokers.
OPEC's new strength, though, could last only as long as that political alliance holds. Any of the three nations is capable of scuttling it.
But today officials of those nations were optimistic. ''I think you may call it a historic accord,'' Hisham M. Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said in an interview here. ''I feel very confident it will achieve its objectives.''
Oil analysts agreed. Bahman Karbassiou, a Vienna-based oil consultant and former OPEC official, said, ''This is probably the only time in the past seven years that you are going to see very strict adherence by all OPEC members to their assigned quotas.''
The United States has become increasingly dependent on foreign oil in the last five years. Through April, the nation imported an average of 8.3 million barrels a day, with more than half that purchased from OPEC. In 1985, imports amounted to 5.1 million barrels a day, with OPEC contributing more than a third.
 
The Biggest Suppliers
The largest OPEC supplier is Saudi Arabia, which sold an average of 1.3 million barrels a day to the United States in the four months through April. Government policy bans Iranian oil imports. After Saudi Arabia, the leading OPEC suppliers to the United States are Venezuela, at 980,000 barrels, and Nigeria, at 923,000.
Among non-OPEC producers, Canada is the largest exporter to the United States, at 900,000 barrels a day, followed by Mexico, at 698,000.
Edwin Rothschild, director of the Citizen/Labor Energy Coalition, an energy research group, said gasoline prices could rise 2 or 3 cents a gallon if OPEC nations honor the accord.
George F. Friesen, oil analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital in New York, said oil prices were likely to soften in coming months, with West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark, declining to as low as $17 a barrel because worldwide inventories remain high. But he said prices should rebound to about $21 a barrel by the end of the year.
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, the September contract for West Texas Intermediate settled with a loss of 26 cents, to $20.04 for a 42-gallon barrel.
 
Coordinated Pressure
Senior OPEC officials said it became clear early in these talks, which started about two weeks ago, that Iran and Iraq were coordinating their pressure on the rest of OPEC, with the willing cooperation of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's production giant.
It is evident, however, that Iraq's threat to use force was the prime factor that shook OPEC into action and remains the principal deterrent to further infractions of discipline.
When this conference began on Thursday, Iraq came pounding on the OPEC table, demanding three things:
* Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates must stop flouting their quotas and weakening prices by dumping too much oil in world markets.
* OPEC must embark on a course to raise oil prices in general.
* The organization's future course should be largely charted by its three biggest producers: Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.
The Iraqis achieved all of their objectives with the tacit - but energetic - cooperation of Iran.
For its part, Saudi Arabia realized its principal objective: a gradual rise in prices only in response to genuine market demand, so as not to repeat the shocks dealt to the world economy in the 70's and 80's when OPEC kept on pushing prices up without regard to the ability of consumers to absorb the increases.
''We will not repeat the mistakes of the past,'' said Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, in an interview. ''The price rise will be gradual.'' Asked if he was sure that production quotas would be adhered to this time, Mr. Aghazadeh said, ''This time I am 100 percent sure''.
 
Original Target Is Lowered
Iraq, which had insisted on a $25 price, abandoned that demand in return for having achieved most of its other objectives, OPEC officials said.
Senior OPEC officials, who asked not to be identified, said that Iraq's demand for a $25 price was deliberately balanced by Iran's suggesting $20, with the two squeezing the others to come up with a number in between.
OPEC's target price refers to a hypothetical barrel that represents a mix of grades from different oilfields.
As it happened, Saudi Arabia joined the power play by working into the agreement a stipulation that prices would rise only if studies proved that the increases could be absorbed by consumers without pushing them toward alternative energy sources.
 
A Million-Barrel Reduction
The accord removes about a million barrels a day of OPEC oil from world markets, easing the pressure in a glutted market.
The impact of the accord will not be clear until September, since many oil companies have been stocking oil and may now decide to use their stocks before buying new OPEC oil. [Flying from Washington to his vacation home in Maine, President Bush said there is ''not a thing'' he could do about the OPEC price decision. He said market forces will determine oil prices, not the Geneva agreement.] Oil analysts said that even if prices rose to $21, European and Japanese consumers would not feel the impact because of the steep fall in the dollar's value this year against major currencies. But American consumers may see their energy bills climbing, although not by much.
''The Europeans and the Japanese will shrug their shoulders, with the dollar having lost 10 percent of its value since the start of the year,'' said Christian Weyer, a banker and oil economist with Banque Indosuez.
 
Iranian Leader's Comments
In a speech today, Iran's President strongly supported Iraq's denunciation of quota violators. President Hashemi Rafsanjani said in Teheran that ''two or three countries in the Persian Gulf have committed a great treason due to their dependence on the West,'' in an obvious reference to the Emirates and Kuwait. Iraq has used similar language in denouncing the two countries, accusing them of carrying out American dicatates.
Oil economists said the price increase was balanced by the fact that inflation in the last 10 years has greatly reduced the real value of oil to exporters by diminishing the purchasing power of the dollars they get for their exports.
''In real terms, the price of oil now is the lowest it has been since 1972,'' said Jack Wilkinson, a senior oil economist at the Sun Company in Philadelphia who was here to observe the OPEC meeting.

HEADLINE: Congress Backs Curbs Against Iraq

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
The House and the Senate defied the Bush Administration today and voted to impose economic sanctions on Iraq, citing what lawmakers viewed as the human rights violations and increasingly bellicose policies of President Saddam Hussein's Government.
The Senate took the stronger action, voting 80 to 16 to cut off $700 million in United States loan guarantees that the Baghdad Government uses to purchase American wheat, rice, lumber and cattle as well as commercial goods like tires and machinery.
''We shall not give to the Iraqis the kind of special treatment you reserve for friends, for allies,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who drafted the measure approved by the Senate. ''We've waited for Hussein to take a more humane course and it has not been done. He is a butcher, a torturer, a manipulator.'' 
The House, by a vote of 234 to 175, first approved a similar measure restricting loan guarantees to Iraq. But, after the pleas of representatives from rural districts, the House voted 208 to 191 to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to waive the sanctions if he determines they cause more harm to American farmers than they do to the Hussein Government.
 
Criticized by Texan
Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Democrat who opposed the bill, said that the proposal was ''like responding to a bully by pulling out a gun, putting it to your head and saying if you keep threatening me I'll shoot myself.''
While conceding that the elimination of loan guarantees would harm farmers in her state, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, countered that some principles go beyond economic interests.
''There comes a time when we have to stand up and be counted,'' she said. ''I can't believe any farmer in this nation would want to send his products, under subsidized sales, to a country that has used chemical weapons and a country that has tortured and executed its children.''
In recent days Mr. Hussein had threatened to use military force against members of OPEC he felt had been exceeding their production quotas and thereby keeping the price low. He massed troops on the border with Kuwait, creating a crisis atmosphere, which has yet to dissipate fully.
 
Bush Favors Guarantees
The Bush Administration had opposed the ending of the loan guarantees, arguing that it would harm American farmers, worsen the country's trade deficit, and not hurt the Iraqis, who could purchase agricultural products from countries like France and Taiwan.
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that the Administration did not believe that proposals like Mr. D'Amato's would help ''in achieving the goals we want to achieve in our relationship with Iraq.''
Mr. Boucher said that as a result of a review of Iraq trade relations being conducted by the Administration in recent months, the Commerce Department is developing new regulations that will tighten controls on exports of some items, like industrial equipment, that could be used for the production of nuclear or chemical weapons.
Although there are many restrictions already in place, the new rules would clamp down more firmly because of special concerns about proliferation of nonconventional weapons.
 
Agricultural Credits Reviewed
The Administration's review is also examining whether agricultural credits should be restricted, he said, but the Agriculture Department has not reached any conclusions in that regard. The review had been in progress before the sudden heightening of tensions between Iraq and Kuwait in the last two weeks, and has been intensified since then.
The sanctions recommended by Congress would not take effect until final enactment of the farm bill, which was passed by the Senate today but awaits further action by the House. The two chambers would then have to reconcile their differences before sending the measure to President Bush for his signature.
The Congressional votes to impose sanctions came on the same day the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed at their meeting in Geneva to raise the target price for oil to $21 a barrel, from $18 a barrel. The OPEC oil ministers also agreed to limit production to 22.5 million barrels a day, slightly higher than the current ceiling on output, but lower than what the members of the cartel have been actually producing.
 
Lobbying by Iraq
Iraq had been strongly lobbying for the price increase, which comes at a time of a continued glut of crude oil on the world market. That glut had kept oil prices depressed, severely hindering Iraq's ability to repay its foreign debt, estimated to be between $70 billion and $100 billion.
Abdul Rahman Jamil, press attache of the Iraqi Embassy in Washington, could not be reached for comment on the Congressional action. Telephone calls to a number where embassy staff said Mr. Jamil could be reached went unanswered.
Today's votes in Congress represent another step in the worsening relations between Washington and Baghdad that had begun to warm in the 1980's. While Iraq was engaged in war with Iran, Washington developed a decided tilt toward Baghdad, several experts on Iraq say.
During the war with Iran, Washington restored diplomatic relations with Baghdad, which also enjoyed closer relations with Kuwait, as Kuwait heavily financed Iraq's weapons purchases.

HEADLINE: Baker Hints at Direct Contact With Phnom Penh

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 27

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that Washington might further modify its Indochina policy by opening direct diplomatic contacts with the Communist Government of Cambodia.
His suggestion that the United States might drop its 11-year isolation of Phnom Penh came as part of a blunt retort to the steady criticism of recent American policies on Indochina and refugees. Several governments represented here at the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, have attacked the United States policy.
During the previous three days, several Southeast Asian foreign ministers said the Bush Administration's withdrawal of diplomatic support for a Cambodian guerrilla coalition including the Communist Khmer Rouge would only encourage the Khmer Rouge to step up efforts on the battlefield. The United States policy change included the opening of talks with Vietnam on Cambodia. 
Indonesia and Singapore have been particularly harsh in their comments. The other Asean nations -the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Brunei - have generally followed suit.
 
'Dialogue of Death' Condemned
Mr. Baker responded to the criticism today by saying, ''Continued support for the coalition at the United Nations is only providing the Khmer Rouge diplomatic cover for its military maneuvers.'' He added that other nations must show ''no tolerance for the Khmer Rouge's dialogue of death.''
The Khmer Rouge are responsible for the killing or starvation of at least one million people from 1975 to 1979. They were overthrown in January 1979 after the Vietnamese invaded in December 1978. The Vietnamese later installed Hun Sen, a Khmer Rouge defector, as Prime Minister.
Mr. Baker suggested that international diplomatic efforts between the Hun Sen Government and the guerrilla coalition to settle the 11-year Cambodian conflict could be wasted by ''a failure to recognize the steady, threatening movement'' of the Khmer Rouge, who are gaining in a rainy season offensive.
Further reverses on the battlefield can be averted, he said, only by stepping up diplomatic exchanges with China, the Soviet Union and Vietnam to set up an interim government and United Nations-supervised elections.
Mr. Baker said that to ''advance our election goals, we are also considering contacts with the Phnom Penh regime.''
 
First Such Statement by Baker
While lower-level State Department officials had previously suggested that the Administration was considering a move to improve relations with Cambodia, this was the first time that Mr. Baker had publicly brought up the possibility.
State Department officials who favor further modifications of Cambodia policy say that if Mr. Baker can overcome Asean concerns here, he could increase efforts to improve relations with Phnom Penh and Hanoi and eventually cut all military aid to the two non-Communist rebel groups aligned with the Khmer Rouge. Such a realignment, these officials say, has been blocked so far by the National Security Council.
In his 20-minute address to the Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Mr. Baker also tried to narrow differences on how to deal with the continuing emigration of Vietnamese refugees.
The Southeast Asian nations urged in a communique this week that the United States agree to their proposal for involuntary return of boat people who leave Vietnam for economic rather than political reasons. Otherwise, they warn, they may have to stop accepting thousands of people who land on their shores every year.
The United States, which cooperates with Southeast Asian countries in dealing with refugee resettlement, has argued that no one should be forced to return to a country as repressive as Vietnam.
 
U.N. Compromise Urged
Mr. Baker reiterated that position, but he asked that the Southeast Asian group join the United States in accepting a compromise proposal offered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
That proposal designates a new category of refugees - ''those who do not object.'' Such people are to be convinced through screening and counseling that a voluntary return to Vietnam is preferable to living for years in a wretched refugee camp with little hope of finding permanent resettlement.
The Asean delegates appeared unwilling to criticize Mr. Baker directly, but they did not seem impressed with his speech either.
''We're not interested in finger-pointing,'' said Datuk A. Kamil Jaafar, Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ''but we can't understand the choices the United States has made recently.'' He was particularly critical of Mr. Baker's position on the Vietnamese refugees, saying they were no different from the Haitians, Mexicans and Central Americans that the United States has forcibly returned to their homes.

HEADLINE: Social Security Panel Opposes Moynihan Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
A bipartisan Federal advisory panel said today that it opposed Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security payroll taxes.
The New York Democrat stirred a political storm here earlier this year with his proposal, which seeks to reduce the growing surplus in the Social Security trust fund. Mr. Moynihan says the trust fund surplus masks the true size of the Federal budget deficit and has been used for Government costs unrelated to Social Security.
But the Advisory Council on Social Security, a 13-member panel appointed in June 1989 by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, said the surplus should be allowed to continue growing because it would be needed when members of the baby boom generation retire. The generation is commonly defined as Americans born from 1946 to 1964. 
The panel said Mr. Moynihan's proposal for ''pay-as-you-go'' financing of Social Security was unwise because it would require steep increases in payroll taxes in the years from 2010 to 2030, when people in the baby boom generation retire.
 
Moynihan Undeterred
Mr. Moynihan introduced his proposal as a bill in January and plans to offer it again within two weeks as an amendment to a separate bill raising the Federal debt ceiling.
The council's report appears to reduce the likelihood that Congress will approve a Social Security tax cut. Nevertheless, Mr. Moynihan said in an interview tonight that he fully intended to press for approval of his proposal.
He took comfort from the fact that two council members representing organized labor supported his proposal. The two, Karen M. Ignagni of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, issued a separate statement recommending a return to the pay-as-you-go method of financing Social Security.
The 13-member advisory panel is headed by a former Reagan Administration official, Deborah Steelman, who worked at the Office of Management and Budget. It includes liberal Democrats like Robert M. Ball, who was Commissioner of Social Security from 1962 to 1973, as well as business executives like Philip Briggs, vice chairman of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminum Company of America.
 
Increasing Productivity
The Social Security tax paid by both employer and employee is currently 6.2 percent of the first $51,300 of earnings. Mr. Moynihan's proposal would reduce the rate to 5.1 percent for the years 1991 through 2011, then would gradually increase it to 8.1 percent in 2045.
Senator Moynihan said the payroll tax was regressive, hitting poor people harder than the well-off, and he asserted that a tax cut was justified because ''Social Security trust fund reserves have been growing at a much faster pace than anticipated: a billion dollars a week.'' At the end of 1989, the trust fund had assets of $163 billion, representing 64 percent of outlays projected for 1990.
In its report today to Dr. Sullivan, the advisory council recommended that ''no action now be taken to reduce revenues'' to the Social Security trust fund. It said the growing surplus provides ''an opportunity to increase national saving, which can enhance the future productive capacity of the economy.''
 
'Blue Smoke and Mirrors'
The panel said Congress should eliminate the Federal budget deficit to enhance prospects for ''a strong economy when the large baby boom generation retires.'' It said Social Security should be removed from the calculation of deficit reduction targets under a budget-balancing law adopted in 1985.
The law takes account of the Social Security surplus when computing the overall budget deficit. As a result, the deficit seems smaller than it would otherwise be.
The Comptroller General of the United States, Charles A. Bowsher, has said, ''The use of growing Social Security surpluses to mask the deficit in Federal operations amounts to blue smoke and mirrors.'' He says the deficit is larger today than in 1985 if trust funds are excluded from the calculations.
The advisory council said that ''Social Security is projected to have enough income to meet benefit payments for about the next 50 years.'' The panel said the amount in the trust fund would peak at $9 trillion in the year 2027 and would be depleted 16 years later if Congress took no action.

HEADLINE: Republicans Demand a Budget From Democrats

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans, angry that a White House budget proposal calling for higher taxes has become public without a companion proposal from Democrats, demanded today that the Democrats produce one before Congress adjourns for its August recess.
''The President has taken his hit on revenue's being part of the discussion, then we come up with some options, it's all over the press and we haven't seen anything from the other side,'' said Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader. ''We're at the point where it's absolutely essential that our Democratic colleagues ante up. We've got to see something up here on the table from the other side before we break.'' 
But the Democrats appeared in no hurry to oblige, saying that while there were press reports of an Administration proposal, no such plan had ever been formally presented at the negotiating table. Despite pledges that Congressional negotiators would try to work through part of the recess, it was clear from both sides that there would be no budget deal before September at the earliest.
Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, said he felt no obligation to put forward a proposal until the Democrats actually saw the Administration's plan.
 
Limit on Tax Deductions
The Administration proposal, agreed to with some reluctance by Republican Congressional leaders on Wednesday night, would raise Federal excise taxes on beer, wine and liquor and limit deductions for state and local income taxes to $10,000. The proposal is part of a plan to cut $50 billion from a 1991 budget deficit that is now estimated at nearly $170 billion, not counting the cost of the savings and loan bailout, Republicans say the limit would primarily affect wealthier taxpayers, an approach they hope will derail Democratic efforts to raise the Federal income tax rate for the most affluent taxpayers above the current level, 28 percent.
The proposal also calls for $23 billion in spending cuts - $7 billion from military programs and $16 billion from programs like Medicaid, Medicare, farm subsidies, veterans' benefits and Federal retirement benefits. Social Security would not be affected.
 
G.O.P. in Awkward Straits
Many of the benefit cuts were suggested by President Bush in the budget he sent to Congress in January, a budget that was rejected by House Republicans at that time as politically impossible. Most of the Republican negotiators were prepared to accept the new version of the Administration's plan as a bargaining tool, but its premature disclosure has clearly left them in awkward political straits.
''I'm very frustrated and discouraged,'' said Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who is part of the budget negotiating group. ''The only person who's shown any political courage or sacrifice in this is George Bush.''
Mr. Bush met with senior Congressional leaders of both parties before leaving for a weekend at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Me. He told reporters on Air Force One that White House and Congressional negotiators had narrowed some of their differences, but that the progress had not been dramatic. He turned aside any questions on details of the Administration proposal, saying only that he was ''not locked locked in to any specific proposal.''
Democratic strategists said that while proposals for limiting deductions for the wealthy would theoretically accomplish the same thing as raising the top income tax rate for the most affluent taxpayers, the rate increase remained the most economically efficient and politically achievable approach.

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:
On Praying for a Son There are few things that connoisseurs of antiquity enjoy more than a modern discovery that confirms the wisdom of the past. So, in recent weeks several students of the Talmud, the authoritative body of Jewish law completed in the sixth century, took pleasure in a report in the journal Nature about the discovery of a gene that determines maleness. The gene, the researchers report, begins its work in the seventh week of pregnancy, somewhere from the 43d to the 49th day.
The Talmudists cited page 60a in the tractate B'rachot in which the ancient rabbis question whether it is worthwhile for the husband of a pregnant woman to pray for a son. The rabbis determine that such prayers are worthwhile up to the 40th day of pregnancy, but after that point the supplication is a ''vain prayer'' since the sex is already determined. 
The modern Talmudists were not fazed by the fact that they differed from the modern scientists by a few days. ''The scientists came pretty close to the truth,'' said Yanke Shulman, who teaches an early-morning class in the Talmud in Brooklyn before commuting to his job as a systems analyst in Manhattan.
 
A Fight on Parking Rules
John Bozzella knew he was fighting a losing battle. Even his Irish Catholic mother was against him. But he fought the good fight and lost.
Mr. Bozzella is New York City's chief lobbyist in Albany, and it was his assignment to try to stop the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo from approving a bill that would add Holy Thursday and Orthodox Holy Thursday to the roster of religious holidays when alternate -side parking rules are suspended.
Holy Thursday, three days before Easter, marks the last supper of Jesus and His disciples. In the Orthodox calendar it often falls on a different day.
The lobbyist had a host of arguments against Holy Thursday. He argued from logistics (it would disrupt traffic), economics (about $100,000 would be lost in parking fines) and theology (Holy Thursday is not, he said, a day when Catholics are obligated to attend Mass).
In addition, Mr. Bozzella warned that approval would encourage Muslims, Buddhists and others to renew their requests for parking exemptions on their holy days. ''As a result, the number of days on which alternate side of the street parking is suspended will grow significantly,'' he wrote in a memorandum in opposition to the bill.
The bill breezed through the Senate and the Assembly, and was signed by Governor Cuomo on July 17.
''I never really thought I could stop this bill,'' Mr. Bozzella said afterward. ''I guess it was just impossible for a legislator to vote against Holy Thursday.''
In addition to the the Holy Thursday observances, the alternate-side regulations are waived on these days: Christmas, Yom Kippur, Rosh ha-Shanah, Good Friday and Orthodox Good Friday, Ascension Thursday, the first two days of Succoth, Shimini Atzareth, the Feast of the Assumption, the Feast of All Saints, Simchat Torah, Shabuoth, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and the first two and last two days of Passover.
 
Excommunication Issue
Three Roman Catholics in Corpus Christi, Tex., were warned by the head of the local diocese in recent months that they risked excommunication because of their work in abortion clinics. Two of them, a clinic director and a doctor, eventually received formal decrees of excommunication, but the third, Elva Bustamante, the director of a second clinic, has yet to get the final word from Bishop Rene H. Gracida.
Earlier this month Mrs. Bustamante took a step that her two excommunicated colleagues did not. She responded to the Bishop's warning with a pointed defense of her position.
''As a Catholic,'' Mrs. Bustamante wrote in a letter dated July 17, ''I take your warning very seriously, and have prayed, studied and reflected on my work at New Women's Clinic. I have concluded that you are incorrect in applying this penalty to me.''
In his letter of March 12 Bishop Gracida wrote, ''Your cooperation in procuring abortions is a sin against God and humanity and against the laws of the Roman Catholic Church.'' He said that under the canons of the church Mrs. Bustamante had excommunicated herself and that once he formalized this in a written decree, she would be officially barred from the sacraments of the church and from Christian burial.
Mrs. Bustamante argued with the Bishop's application of church laws. She wrote that automatic excommunication did not apply to her, but only to the woman involved in the abortion ''and those who directly participate in a specific, successful abortion procedure,'' such as the operating physician.
''After my prayer and reflection, I genuinely do not believe I am guilty of any sin in the work I do,'' she added. ''In order to be excommunicated I must willfully and culpably sin. I make no claims to perfection, but in this instance my actions are neither sinful nor undertaken in an attitude of defiance. I am simply following my conscience. I ask you to respect my conscience, even though you may disagree with it.''
Bishop Gracida's office had no immediate comment, but Mrs. Bustamante's letter clearly did not give the Bishop what he had asked. ''My hope,'' he had written in his warning, ''is that you will see the evil of this practice and return to reconciliation with God and Father and the Roman Catholic Church.''
 
Dueling Poll Results
By a margin of nearly 2 to 1, churchgoers in the San Francisco Bay area oppose hiring homosexuals as clergy, a recent survey in The San Francisco Chronicle says.
In a random telephone poll of 600 residents conducted in March, 50 percent of those who attend church once a week or more were opposed to hiring homosexuals as clergy, while 28 percent were in favor. The results had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
But when both churchgoers and nonchurchgoers were asked, the results were significantly different. Forty-eight percent said they were in favor and 29 percent said they were opposed.
In analyzing the results Mark Baldassare, director of polls for The Chronicle, said: ''Regular churchgoers, who represent 30 percent of bay area residents, have the greatest influence over church policy. There is a solid core of people who will continue to resist efforts to ordain homosexuals.''

HEADLINE: Groups in Northeast Protest Plan to Cap Deductions for Taxes

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 27

 BODY:
Predicting devastating consequences for state and local governments throughout the Northeast, school boards, business groups and municipal officials in New York and neighboring states began a spontaneous protest today against a Bush Administration proposal to restrict the deductions for state and local taxes on Federal income-tax returns.
The proposal, whose details were disclosed on Thursday in Washington, would impose a disproportionately heavy burden on residents of New York and other high-tax Northeastern states, experts said. Residents of those states are most likely to be affected by the restrictions.
''This appears to be another way to take more New York taxes and send them to other places,'' the director of the New York State School Boards Association, Lou Grumet, said. ''What it means is that if you educate your children substantially, like we do in New York, if you pay a lot for your schools, you're now going to pay even higher taxes. It's like putting a sin tax on education.'' 
Most Northeastern states rely heavily on property taxes to finance their public schools.
 
Cap at $10,000
Under the restrictions proposed by the Bush Administration and senior Congressional Republicans on Thursday, the amount of state and local taxes that could be deducted on Federal returns would be capped at $10,000.
Many officials argue that the cap would lead to ''double taxation,'' because some of the money that has been paid to states and localities would be taxed again by the Federal Government as income.
If adopted, the limits would not directly affect state and local revenues. But because higher taxes would, for many taxpayers, no longer be deductible, the resistance to new local taxes would inevitably increase.
''It's going to make it much more difficult for high-tax states to raise taxes in the future,'' Ronald Alt, a senior researcher at the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington, said. ''And this comes at a time when many states are already experiencing financial trouble.''
Figures compiled by the federation show that in New York the average Federal deduction for state and local taxes is the highest of any state, totaling $5,435. In Massachusetts, the average deduction is $4,099. In Maine it is $4,208. In New Jersey the figure is $3,598, and in Connecticut, which has no state income tax, the average deduction for taxes is $3,056. The national average is $3,207.
Only taxpayers who itemize deductions can take one for the taxes.
There are no reliable figures on how many taxpayers in each state take deductions of more than $10,000. The New York City Budget Director, Philip Michael, estimated that as much as one-third of the estimated $3 billion that the cap on deductions would generate for the Federal Government would come from New York State taxpayers.
 
'All the More Onerous'
''It would be very damaging to our economic development and to our retention of upper-middle-class residents,'' Mr. Michael said. ''It would make the tax burden here all the more onerous, and it's already thought to be quite steep.''
In Washington, Republican officials like Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon called the proposed cap a ''tax on the rich'' and said it would largely affect taxpayers with family incomes of more than $100,000.
Officials in the New York metropolitan region conceded that the emphasis on affluent taxpayers would make the limits more difficult to object to politically. But they disputed the contention that the restrictions would only affect the wealthy, saying those hardest hit would be citizens paying the most in property taxes, and not necessarily those with the highest incomes.
''They would have a significant impact on middle-income people who make $40,000 or $50,000,'' the County Executive of Bergen County, N.J., William McDowell, said. ''They unquestionably would hurt our ability to raise money for local programs.''
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said the Federal Government should simply raise the income-tax rates for the richest Americans ''several points.''
 
Issue of Regional Strains
Across the Northeast politicians voiced resentment about the proposal, saying it would force hard-pressed state and local governments to pick up another part of the Federal deficit. ''Traditionally the Federal Government did not interfere with our sources of revenue,'' Mayor Joe Dadonna of Allentown, Pa., said. ''Now they're even interfering with that.''
Because the Northeast is apt to be so hard hit by any limit on deductibility and the Southwest and other low-tax regions would remain relatively unaffected, the issue raises many of the regional strains that characterize American politics. In New York and neighboring states the restrictions could add yet another disincentive to doing business in the area.
''It simply would make New York less competitive,'' the president of the New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Ron Schelp, said.
Even when the talk of limiting the deductibility of the taxes was little more than rumor, opposition to the idea was intense. On Wednesday members of the New York Congressional delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, met to denounce the plan. On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins, together with union leaders and municipal officials from as far away as Indiana and Michigan, held a news conference in Washington to pledge their opposition to the proposal.
A proposal to eliminate the deductibility of local taxes was defeated in 1986 by a broad coalition of unions, school groups and local officials.
Today several politicians predicted that a cap would be the first step toward ending deductibility entirely.
''It's the foot in the door,'' Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin said. ''Their real agenda is to eliminate deductibility.''

Status of India's Women Offers Hope and Despair

May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons
A Journey Among the Women of India
By Elisabeth Bumiller
Illustrated. 306 pages. Random House.
$19.95.
A believer in the Indian concept of rebirth would surmise that Elisabeth Bumiller had indeed been an Indian woman in her previous birth, so deep is her empathy with India and so pervasive the humanity that emerges from her book on India's women. Yet she never glosses over harsh realities; she makes no excuses for the disheartening events she reports. 
Her title, ''May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons,'' is well chosen. Ms. Bumiller eventually came to regard this blessing, conferred on Hindu women at the time of their wedding, as a curse and the cause of much that is wrong with the status of India's women. In a series of essays with eye-catching yet accurate titles (''Wedding First, Love Later: Arranged Marriages Among the Educated Classes''), she explores various aspects of women's lives in India. This is a profoundly moving book, one that plunges the reader into despair and yet gives glimpses of hope.
The attempt to give an overall picture of the 400 million women of India is a formidable undertaking. Over half the book is concerned with issues that affect women of the middle class, a term used in India to describe the top 10 percent of the population, 80 million people. The remaining essays concern the 75 percent who live in the villages; Ms. Bumiller spent time in an Indian village as the guest of a farmer's wife.
India is a country of paradoxes, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the status of women. India has no trouble conceiving of the divine as feminine; men and women, wealthy and poor, worship powerful goddesses like Durga and Kali. Yet this same India has caught the attention of the West with its infamous ''bride burnings'' or ''dowry deaths.'' The two extremes coexist. In Indira Gandhi, India had a woman as the leader of the nation, and today women account for 10 percent of the Indian Parliament (compared with 5 percent in the United States Congress). But as Ms. Bumiller writes, ''For every woman who sits in Parliament or has done a Ph.D. or goes to the Supreme Court to argue a case, you have thousands in the villages who don't even know about their basic rights and that they are equal citizens.''
From ancient times and for a multitude of reasons, Indian women have never had equality with men. Certainly one reason for the oppression was the paramount importance placed on preserving caste distinctions and lineage purity. Women have been glorified in Indian literature and in sculpture and painting, but the reality seems to have been otherwise.
In modern times, the complacency that arose from having a woman in the highest office of the land was shattered by the 1974 Government report on the status of India's women. The report, ''Toward Equality,'' revealed that in many ways conditions for women had actually regressed since independence. It was the catalyst for an Indian women's movement, which, like the feminist movement in the United States, was founded by the elite. Few Indian women, however, would call themselves feminists, a label regarded with suspicion. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the first woman to be President of the United Nations General Assembly, would deny being a feminist, yet she was intensely aware of equal rights. Asked by a reporter after her election to describe the sari she was wearing, she promptly countered, ''Did you ask my predecessor to describe his suit?''
Ms. Bumiller's insightful study of arranged marriages illustrates her problems in coming to terms with the Indian woman's easy acceptance of such a system. She ultimately rationalizes that modern arranged marriages are, in fact, not much unlike America's dating services. Her essay ''Flames: A Bride Burning and a Sati'' includes potentially explosive material: Statistics indicate that the annual number of dowry deaths is higher than the deaths from terrorist activity in the Punjab. Ms. Bumiller suggests that the consumer boom of the last two decades, spurring the greed for economic status symbols, is in large measure at the root of the problem. Investigating female infanticide in ''No More Little Girls,'' she views the practice ''not as the act of monsters in a barbarian society but as the last resort of impoverished, uneducated women driven to do what they thought was best for themselves and their families.''
The essay entitled ''Indira Is India, and India Is Indira'' raises the question why Mrs. Gandhi largely ignored those of her own sex. Ms. Bumiller says the Prime Minister made no special effort to promote other women and comments that she ''transcended sexual categories''; but she never tries to answer the question.
The final essay, on the failure of population control in India, lays the blame largely on the debased status of women and a family's overwhelming desire for sons. The only success story is in the southern state of Kerala, where 70 percent of women are literate (three times the national average); they have a partnership role in marriage and a voice in deciding the number of children they will bear. Overpopulation aggravates every major problem India faces, and Ms. Bumiller concludes that the status of women must be improved because ''the future of India'' depends on it.

HEADLINE: Diversionary Tactic on S.& L.'s

 BODY:
Several members of Congress propose creating a nonpartisan commission to dig out the full story of the savings and loan scandal. They make it sound like a serious attempt to rise above politics. It smells more like a refuge for politicians. 
Special commissions can serve useful purposes. The Rogers commission on the Challenger shuttle explosion in 1986, for example, conducted a highly professional, technical investigation into a subject of widest interest. The Warren commission, headed by a Chief Justice with impeccable credentials, helped calm the nation after the assassination of President Kennedy. The Greenspan commission on Social Security reform brokered a deal between warring Democrats and Republicans in 1983 that arguably saved the system.
But none of those special needs exist in the S.& L. scandal. The public is certainly entitled to the complete truth about what and who caused this historic bust. And it would be useful to pull all the facts together in one place. But the proposed commission would also be authorized to second-guess the Administration's current efforts to untangle the mess, adding yet another layer to an already top-heavy structure of administrators and investigators. It would also be useful to uncover all the meddling and conniving by key members of Congress and the Reagan Administration. But many of those players are gone from Washington already; it seems much more likely that a commission would only provide cover for sitting politicians who are embarrassed by their negligence, if not complicity. Representatives and senators could duck the issue during this fall's re-election campaign by saying ''we've appointed a commission.''
When it came time for the commission to report, how boldly would it confront the roles that Congress and the Administration played? And would its charter permit comment on the political system that elects and appoints irresponsible officials? A recommendation to curb political contributions would be welcome from any quarter, but that's not the kind of advice Congress is looking for.
The causes of the savings and loan scandal are no mystery - high interest rates, careless deregulation, lax and possibly corrupt Federal supervision and, in the industry, incompetence, greed and outright looting. Who needs a commission to confirm that? Only politicians who want to appear to be doing something.

Brazil's Small Share of the Greenhouse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Preaching to Brazil From Hawaii'' (editorial, July 24) gives credence to the ill-founded rumors that ''Brazil is the world's third-largest creator of greenhouse gases, after the United States and the Soviet Union.'' Such rumors originated in a recent report from the World Resources Institute. Its figures regarding Brazil are plainly wrong. 
Recent data obtained by the Space Research Institute of Brazil, independently confirmed by NASA studies, indicate that:
* Deforestation in the Amazon has been progressing at a near-constant rate since 1974 and not exponentially as predicted by the World Bank.
* Average rate of deforestation from 1978 to 1989 is 21,800 square kilometers a year (2.2 million hectares). This rate of deforestation is four times less than the numbers used by the World Resources Institute report.
* Total deforested area until 1989 was 394,000 square kilometers (93,000 early this century).
* Deforestation in Rondonia and Para has declined considerably.
* The contribution of deforestation in the Amazon to carbon dioxide emissions is estimated as 0.25 gigatons per year, about 3.7 percent (not 10.5 percent) of all CO#2 emissions.
The Brazilian Government recognizes that the deforestation rate of Amazon forest is still too high, and is trying successfully to curtail it. The subsidies, tax incentives and special credits conducive to forest destruction have been stopped. However, millions of people live there who burn parts of the forest to convert it into subsistence agriculture land.
Relocation of populations might be a future way to attract such people to other areas of the country, but Brazilians don't want to use the same argument used by some developed countries that such actions are not cost-effective. They are already acting, and a reforestation project in denuded areas in Carajas has been started.
These efforts alone will not ''stabilize greenhouse gas emissions,'' as recommended by the Group of Seven in Houston. Deforestation in the Amazon contributes less than 4 percent to worldwide CO#2 emissions. Industrialized countries need to act too, e.g., by reducing fossil-fuel burning, which is responsible for some 60 percent of all CO#2 emissions. Only a concerted effort of industrialized and developing countries in this matter will lead to a solution.

Soviet Alternatives

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: LENINGRAD

 BODY:
This is the Soviet Union's second city and none too pleased about it. People claim that Leningrad, with a population of some five million, sends 80 billion rubles a year to Moscow, and gets 20 billion back. The center deliberately puts Leningrad down and holds it back, they say, and they are just as aggrieved as people in minority Soviet republics.
For two centuries this city was Russia's capital, founded on Baltic marshland by Peter the Great to open his country to Europe and force reforms and modernization. Lined with canals and lavish old palaces, it used to be called the Venice of the North, and it has a lively, defiant spirit. 
But the mood is bleak now. Everything gets worse and worse, people tell you on the street, and they see no better prospects. They don't believe perestroika will work. They are angry and frustrated.
Still, there are current heroes, three of them. First is the new Mayor, Anatoly Sobchak; then Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Republic, and Gavriil Popov, the new Mayor of Moscow. All three recently quit the Communist Party. The only good words I heard about Mikhail Gorbachev in a week here were from delegates to the Dartmouth Conference, a Soviet-American discussion group founded 30 years ago and sponsored by the Kettering Foundation.
Like the neighboring Baltic republics, Leningrad wants to make its own plans. There are to be negotiations with Estonia, where food supplies are considerably better, and there is a fuzzy project for a free economic zone to attract foreign investment. Mayor Sobchak talks about rivaling some of Spain's tourist income, and indeed, the old parts of the city and the birch-groved countryside are superb.
But the city also contains a disproportionate share of what's wrong with the country. Eighty percent of its industry produces for the military, and one in every four workers is employed by these industries. ''Even in the cold war we didn't need all that,'' said Aleksandr Fursenko, vice chairman of the local branch of the Academy of Sciences. Local demand is trying to block further construction of a huge dam in the Gulf of Finland across the mouth of the Neva. It was a flood control measure, but it has already built up pollution to the point where swimming is forbidden. As happened in Budapest with protests against a Danube dam, ecology is channeling a whole spectrum of grass-roots disgust into a political force.
There are already several hundred citizens' associations, not coalesced into any effective parties but providing a base for ferment. Leningrad is a prime example of momentum for fundamental change in the Soviet Union coming no longer from the top and the center but from the bottom up, from the regions and the provinces.
Asked who's to blame for what he called the intolerable, hopeless state of affairs, a young man who works in the port said it was the Communists and the Jews. ''Well, I don't know, maybe it's not the Jews' fault, but they make the good deals.''
He was lounging on the street at midday, reading one of the new independent papers, clearly well informed. ''There are three things I like in life,'' he volunteered. ''My ex-wife, whom I divorced, beer and cigarettes.'' He asked for a cigarette, and said, ''I'd be willing to work 12 or 14 hours a day for a normal living, but it's impossible. It humiliates me to beg for a cigarette.''
He wasn't like the idle, disaffected young on American streets. He spoke with contempt of dishonest people and his own lack of direction, and he was articulate. But he saw nothing he could do to make things better.
Mayor Sobchak is one of the scarce optimists. He is a blue-eyed, 51-year-old law professor, brimming with energy and convictions about changing the system. Unknown until he ran for the Supreme Soviet, he is a product of TV, through which his bold and forceful oratory made a huge impact.
He only joined the Communist Party in 1988, because then the only possibility for change was from the inside. He said he had quit because it was the way to speed the development of a multiparty system. He plans to appeal abroad for a fund for the revival of Petersburg-Leningrad (the city was formerly St. Petersburg), which he assures will again be as sparkling as a fresh American city.
He represents the new alternatives opening up to President Gorbachev's leadership - dispersed but very popular, finished with the ideas of gradual change and of clinging to the center. Despite the power game in Moscow, legitimacy is shifting ground.

HEADLINE: New York City Schools Face $62.3 Million Budget Cut

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York City school officials announced plans yesterday to cut $62.3 million in planned spending for the coming school year, a figure that they said is likely to reduce the teaching force in some places and further tighten the central bureaucracy by as many as 350 positions.
The cuts, which they said were the largest since the city's fiscal crisis ended around 1981, will mean more crowded classrooms in some schools and a variety of smaller cutbacks.
These, officials said, will include reductions in intramural sports in junior high schools, new fingerprinting fees for aspiring teachers, elimination of a summer camp program, fewer cars for bureaucrats and less use of consultants.
''It's all going to be difficult and it's all going to be painful,'' said Stanley S. Litow, the Deputy Chancellor for Operations as he briefed reporters before informing the 32 local school districts of the cuts that they will have to absorb. 
Yesterday's numbers were the first specific figures offered since the economically embattled city government told the Board of Education that it would have to achieve cuts of $89.4 million to reach a budget for the year that began July 1 of $6.49 billion. School officials managed to make up a portion of that sum by persuading state officials to take on financing of certain programs. Last year's budget was about the same, $6.49 billion, and Mr. Fernandez requested $6.87 billion for this year to cover increases such contractural costs as salaries and to account for inflation.
The city's budget of $28 billion, adopted earlier this month, called for more than $800 million in new or higher taxes and cutbacks for most city services. Other agencies are also in the process of pinpointing their cuts.
Mr. Litow could not say how many school jobs would be eliminated because districts and principals would have to decide where to cut. Of the total reduction, $26.8 million was identified as cuts in instructional expenses - $6.8 million for the high schools run by the central board and $20 million for the elementary and junior high schools run by the local boards.
That works out to roughly one starting teacher's salary for each of the city's 984 schools, but districts could decide to cut paraprofessionals, guidance counselors or secretaries instead, or they could reduce spending for books, supplies and programs.
A district of average size would have to cut about $625,000.
''It will mean hundreds of fewer positions,'' said Robin Willner, the board's executive director for strategic planning. Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, expressed doubt yesterday that experienced teachers would be laid off.
Rather, she said, administrators are likely to leave unfilled the jobs of teachers who retired or quit in June. The board had planned to hire 5,000 new teachers for September. Ms. Feldman said that any cuts in teaching positions would affect that group rather than returning teachers.
''I don't see widespread layoffs,'' she said.
Other cuts announced yesterday will mean as many as 350 fewer workers at the board's headquarters centered at 110 Livingston Street. The board has already lost more than 400 positions since Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez took office Jan. 1 and is now down to a staff of 4,500.
 
'Less Service'
The city's superintendents examined the new figures yesterday afternoon and many could not predict what shape their cuts would take.
''The clear thing is that we're going to provide less service to children for the next year,'' said Anthony Alvarado, superintendent of District 2, in Manhattan.
Mr. Alvarado's district has a budget of $55 million, and 90 percent of that is for salaries. ''Some of it will have to come from personnel,'' he said.
The superintendent of District 11, in the Bronx, Frank Arricale 2d, said he would probably have to eliminate ''teacher trainers'' assigned to each of his 31 schools. These are experienced teachers who help both novice and veteran teachers improve their instructional and disciplinary skills. Most, he said, would return to the classroom and fill some of the more than 90 teaching vacancies that the district expects in September. But the loss would hurt, he said.
 
A $140 Million Problem
School officials said yesterday that poorer districts that more readily qualify for Federal funds would find it easier to make up the cutbacks than districts that are relatively well off..
Mr. Litow said that even accounting for inflation the magnitude of the cuts were similar to those in the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, when, he said, 14,000 teachers lost their jobs. But nothing like that epidemic of layoffs is on the horizon, he said, because officials have had far more time to plan and have been willing to take cuts of $15.8 million in the central bureaucracy's budget. During the fiscal crisis, he said, no central board jobs were cut.
The scope of the problem that school officials had to wrestle with this year, Mr. Litow said, was actually $140 million, the combined result of an underestimate of teacher salaries and an overestimate in student population. But the city restored $32 million, and the state agreed to finance the city's Project Giant Step program for 4-year-olds and to pick up several other costs.
Of the $15.8 million in administrative cuts at the central board, $2.5 million will come through savings achieved by the State Legislature's abolition of the Board of Examiners effective Dec. 31; $1.5 million in savings for consultants; $500,000 in reductions of official cars; $3 million in supplies, and $5.6 million in job cuts through both attrition and layoffs.
For the first time in several years, the vast majority of teaching candidates will have to pay $104 in fingerprinting and other application fees in addition to new charges of roughly $40 for drug testing. The fingerprinting fees had been waived in an effort to encourage applicants for a system that is short of teachers.
The board will also pare money for several centrally financed programs, including eliminating a $400,000 program for student ''diplomats'' who visit other cities and canceling a new program that would have provided $1.1 million for the identification of teaching prospects in college.

HEADLINE: Eastern L.I. Spots a Dreaded Foe: The Brown Tide Surfaces Again

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMPTON BAYS, L.I. July 27

 BODY:
After a two-year absence, a mysterious algal bloom that devastated the bay scallop industry in eastern Long Island has reappeared.
Suffolk County officials this week reported high concentrations of the algae, a species of microscopic plankton, in Shinnecock and Moriches Bay on the South Shore and in West Neck Bay at Shelter Island.
The algae is measured in cells per millileter and turns the water brown when concentrations reach 200,000 - thus its popular name, brown tide. The latest reading, on July 12, showed a count of 800,000 in western Shinnecock Bay. 
But concentrations elsewhere have been smaller, and unlike five years ago, when the algae blanketed the open water and cell counts reached 2 million, the problem this summer appears far less pervasive.
 
Facing the Unknown
The large Peconic Bay system, for example, which separates the North and South Forks, has been largely free of the brown tide. Officials believe the outbreak will remain spotty across the East End of Long Island and have seen signs of its decline. Even a modest scallop harvest is expected at the end of the summer.
But though less severe this year, the problem has nevertheless refocused attention on the search for answers to one of the biggest environmental threats in eastern Long Island, where the open water plays such an important recreational and economic role.
In addition, the rise and fall of brown tide here has implications for much of the East Coast, where sheltered bays behind barrier beach islands are the typical geography.
Despite substantial study in the last five years, no one still knows why the brown tide developed in 1985, why it receded the last two summers and why it has now made a comeback.
''We don't have an answer to the brown tide, but we do have clues,'' said Elizabeth Cosper, a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook who is researching the phenomenon. She spoke at a conference here today to discuss early results of a two-year study of brown tide.
The return of the algae this year is particularly disconcerting because much money has been spent to revive bay scalloping. But so far the blooms have spared reseeded scalloping areas.
The algae crippled the scallop and shellfish industries in the summers of 1985, 1986 and 1987. In the worst year, 1985, scallop harvests plummeted in value from an annual total of $1.5 million before the brown tide appeared to $1,000. Many other fish and shellfish populations suffered.
Scientists were astounded by the size of the 1986 bloom. It covered the Peconic Bay system, from Flanders Bay on the west to Gardiners Island on the east. And it extended south to the Shinnecock, Moriches and Great South Bays.
''I have never seen a bloom that widespread and composed of one single organism,'' said Dr. Bob Nuzzi, chief of the Bureau of Marine Resources of the Suffolk County Department of Health Services. In 1985, brown tide also swept across Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and Barnegat Bay in southern New Jersey.
 
Reseeded Areas Safe, So Far
The problem is less serious this year. In the one part of the Peconic Bay system that has been tainted by the algae - the small West Neck Bay at Shelter Island - concentrations rose to nearly 600,000 cells per milliliter in early July. But the number has since fallen to 7,000, Dr. Nuzzi said today. In eastern Moriches Bay, concentrations were recorded at 360,000 last Tuesday.
Speakers at today's conference said it was a good sign that concentrations had declined dramatically in some areas and that the outbreaks were limited geographically.
''While I'm concerned about where concentrations are getting high, I'm buoyed by the fact the brown tide hasn't hit the reseeded areas'' for scallops, Dr. Nuzzi said.
Four years of work by Long Island's baymen have been involved in the reseeding. After 1985 there was ''really little hope for the future,'' said Chris Smith, a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent who has helped the baymen reintroduce scallops.
 
Indigestible Menace
Scallops are hurt by brown tides because they apparently cannot digest this plankton species, Aureococcus anophagefferens. In addition, eel grass, a habitat for scallop larvae, can be devastated when the surface is covered by brown tide and no light can penetrate for photosynthesis.
As a result of reseeding, millions of tiny scallops rest at the bottom of Great Peconic Bay, not a lot by normal standards but far more than anyone could have hoped several years ago, Mr. Smith said. A limited scallop harvest is possible this September and commercial-size harvests in coming years.
This assumes the brown tide remains quiescent. Results of the two-year brown-tide study, led by the Suffolk County Health Department, are expected in the fall and may offer conclusions about causes of the algae blooms and how they can be avoided.
 
Thriving in Stagnant Bays
So far, research points to a combination of circumstances that foster brown tide. An increase in water salinity brought on by drought may be a precondition; this occurred during the last three blooms. Also, bays that are blocked from ocean currents and thus rarely flushed may be particularly vulnerable. Flanders Bay is one of these.
The nutrients can come from many sources: effluent from sewage treatment plants or duck farms; fertilizer from farms, homes and golf courses, and other stormwater runoff. Nutrients in acid rain might also be a factor.
The study is expected to discuss ways to control such nutrients and prevent them from fouling the waters.
Peconic Bay is ''one of the most pristine estuaries in the Northeast,'' said Patrick G. Halpin, the Suffolk County Executive. ''The test for us is whether the next generation will be able to say the same thing.''

HEADLINE: St. Vincent's Discovers a Financial Cure

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
A week after Margaret Broughal was brought by ambulance to St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, her left side immobilized by a stroke, physical therapists began helping her exercise her weakened body.
This early intervention was intended to speed Mrs. Broughal's recovery and make room for other patients. It was a small step in a campaign by the 141-year-old hospital to salvage its faltering financial standing.
When hospitals in New York State have been complaining of rising financial losses and lobbying for increased payments from state regulators, St. Vincent's has turned in its best financial performance in years: a $4.8 million profit.
Its success is due in part to shorter hospital stays, which allow St. Vincent's to treat more patients using fewer beds. 
This success also raises the question, state health officials say, of whether better management at the state's 260 hospitals could have better controlled costs when they were seeking financial relief.
If Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signs reimbursement legislation now on his desk, hospitals will receive $1 billion more in 1991 than they will this year in payments from patients covered by private insurance or Medicaid. The increase, totaling 13 percent, would be paid through taxes and higher health insurance premiums.
At St. Vincent's an unexpected $11.5 million loss in 1988 stunned the hospital staff and convinced it to try new remedies.
Chastened by the deficit, trustees, administrators and doctors at the hospital, on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village, set about systematically cutting costs and increasing revenues, mainly by reducing the number of days that patients like Mrs. Broughal spend in the hospital.
They ended the year with a $4.8 million gain, and doctors there say there is no evidence that patient care suffered as a result.
After coming close to bankruptcy in 1980, St. Vincent's had managed to just about break even each successive year, losing about $4 million a year from operating expenses, but making most of it up through contributions and income from its endowment.
Then in 1988 the losses rose. The hospital could not hire enough staff nurses and spent $6 million on per diem nurses. Supplies were more than $1 million over budget. The hospital spent more than its reimbursments for treating AIDS patients and for increasingly complicated and expensive cardiac surgery.
 
From 'Crisis,' A Cost Savings
 ''Sometimes a crisis can lead to a good ending,'' said Roger G. Weaving, the hospital's chief financial officer. ''The physicians said, 'Hey, we really got a problem here.' ''
St. Vincent's improved financial performance came as other hospitals reported increased losses.
The latest State Health Department figures show losses of $83 million in New York City in 1989, even after $151 million in income from endowments and charitable contributions were included. In 1988 the hospitals reported $34 million in losses.
While 19 hospitals reported some losses, large losses at a few hospitals accounted for much of the total. Of every $10 in hospital losses in New York City last year, $4 was attributed to Presbyterian Hospital in upper Manhattan.
The hospital attributed much of its $33 million loss to the cost of opening a new hospital pavilion in Washington Heights and the cost of running outpatient clinics.
Ronald B. Dreskin, vice president for finance at Presbyterian, said the hospital, which just hired its third chief executive officer in two years, has been reorganizing its management with an eye toward cutting costs. But he said cost controls are difficult when the medical staff also serves as a teaching staff.
''It is hard to run a hospital as a business,'' Mr. Dreskin said, ''but it is that much harder when you have 600 residents running around whose function is to learn.''
New York Hospital in Manhattan showed a $4 million loss. But that was a sharp improvement over the $20 million loss reported the year before. Dr. David B. Skinner, the hospital's president, attributed the change to tightened management.
Dr. Skinner said his institution reduced the average length of patient stays and serves the same number of patients as it did several years ago, while temporarily closing 60 beds.
At St. Vincent's the sudden crisis in 1988 stirred the trustees, who commissioned a consultant to review the hospital's finances, and propelled the medical staff to focus on longstanding problems.
The consultant, Price Waterhouse, confirmed what Mr. Weaving said he had been saying all along: The hospital had to reduce the average length of stay for patients, which was high even for hospitals in New York City. For every tenth-of-a-day reduction in the average length of stay, Price Waterhouse said, the hospital could save $1 million.
To convince the medical staff, the hospital circulated graphs comparing average lengths of stay at St. Vincent's with those at leading institutions in New York and across the country. Dr. Lawrence N. King, the medical director, quietly wrote to the 40 doctors whose patients had the longest stays.
The hospital also tried to reduce the number of patients waiting for nursing-home beds, which have been in short supply in New York for years. It offered financial guarantees to nursing homes that agreed to accept patients before applications for Medicaid payments were completed.
Since nonemergency patients sometimes waited several days for CAT scans, the hospital intalled a second CAT scan system.
Nowhere is the campaign to improve performance at St. Vincent's more evident, hospital officials say, than in neurology service, where Mrs. Broughal was a patient.
Dr. Joseph C. Masdeu, the neurology chief and Mrs. Broughal's doctor, has transformed the service since he arrived in 1985 - when its residency program was on probation by an accrediting agency.
The department won back full accreditation and stepped up the pace of its operations. It cut the average length of stay to 9.5 days in 1989 from 19.6 in 1984. As a result, it is able to treat one-third more patients using one-third fewer beds.
Dr. Masdeu said that neurologists are now trained to schedule a series of diagnostic tests as soon as patients are admitted, rather than ordering them one at a time as results come in. Planning for discharge begins, he said, almost as soon as patients arrive.
 
A Brisk Pace Toward Recovery
 For Mrs. Broughal, who is 58 years old and schedules booths at conventions for the American Bible Society, this meant a brisk schedule almost from the time she woke up one morning earlier this month and found that she could not get out of bed.
Soon after her condition was stabilized with medicine, a specialist in rehabilitation medicine visited her and began planning her move to the rehabilitation ward, which took place a week later.
''These physical terrorists put me on a mat and shove me around,'' she said with a laugh.
In the past, Dr. Masdeu said, patients did not begin physical therapy until they had regained more strength, but the earlier intervention is now thought to be helpful.
And, he noted that the sooner a patient can be moved from the neurology service to the rehabilitation service, the greater the savings to the hospital. Hospitals are paid a fixed fee for each stroke victim they treat, but can bill by the day for each day of recovery in the rehabilitation unit.
Soon after Mrs. Broughal arrived at the ward, social workers arranged for help to care for her husband, who is 76 and was incapacitated by a stroke some years ago. They also began preparing for her return home.
In the bed next to Mrs. Broughal, Pam Anzelone of Union, N.J., was receiving anti-inflammatory medication through an intravenous tube. Mrs. Anzelone sought help after she began having double vision and problems with her balance.
After administering a series of tests, doctors diagnosed her condition as multiple sclerosis. But except for two days when she was hospitalized while medicine was administered, Mrs. Anzelone was treated as an outpatient. In the past, Dr. Masdeu said, she would have likely been hospitalized during the testing.
As a result of the hospital's efforts, the average stay for acute-care patients was cut to 8.8 days in 1989 from 9.7 days in 1988. This made it possible for the hospital to admit more patients, for a savings of $9 million.
Costs were also carefully controlled and a new state system of computing payments for AIDS cases was begun. As nursing salaries rose, the hospital was able to recruit more full-time nurses and save money on payments to temporaries.
For the first time in years, the hospital broke even on direct operating revenue and showed a $4.8 million gain when contributions and endowment income were added. At the same time, said Dr. King, the medical director, the hospital's quality reviews reported no increase in patient problems, despite the shorter stays.
 
Bill Criticized By Insurers
 While some health experts raise the question of whether some hospitals are releasing patients before they ready, Dr. King said, ''We are not pushing things to the limits.''
''The difference between the length of stay in New York City and the rest of the country is enormous,'' he said. ''We are merely getting down to the national levels.''
The reimbursement bill on Governor Cuomo's desk would provide $420 million in increased payments to hospitals. Other adjustments already included in state law - for inflation and contruction costs - would bring the total to more than $1 billion.
Insurance companies, business groups and some union officials say that the legislation will have a disastrous effect on private health insurance rates. They say it does not direct the money to the hospitals and services that need it most.
But hospital officials say the large increase is justified because the system has been systematically starved of cash during the last decade and hospitals have been forced to defer maintenance and trim several thousand employees.
''We are as strung out as any hospital system in the country,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents private hospitals. ''We are as lean as can be. Now is the time to reinvest wisely.''
J. Rock Tonkel, who was recently appointed as the first lay president of St. Vincent's Hospital, which is operated by the Archdiocese of New York and the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, said that even with its recent profitability the hospital is not awash in money and needs a higher reimbursement rate as much as the next hospital.
''If you look at the reimbursement,'' he said, ''there is no way this or any other hospital is able to get the cash flow it needs to replace its equipment.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Sees AIDS Toll Surging Among Women and Infants

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
At least three million women and children will die of AIDS in the 1990's, more than six times the number in the 1980's, the World Health Organization said in a report being published today.
In addition, several million children who are not infected with the AIDS virus are destined to become orphans in the 1990's after the deaths of their parents from AIDS, said the report in The Lancet, a leading medical journal published in London.
In New York and other major cities of the Americas, Western Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS is now the leading cause of death for women from 20 to 40 years old, the report said. In these cities, AIDS could raise the deaths among infants and children by up to 30 percent, said the author, Dr. James Chin, who heads the forecasting unit of the health organization's global AIDS program. 
 
Infections of Heterosexuals Rise
Until now, Dr. Chin said, ''the social, economic, and demographic impacts on women and children have been largely neglected.'' The major reason for the neglect was that during the 1980's most AIDS cases were in young and middle-aged men, Dr. Chin said.
But as the AIDS infections among homosexual and bisexual men have slowed in most areas of the world, there has been a slow but steady increase in HIV infections among heterosexual populations, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Dr. Chin's report did not give figures for men. Another official of the Geneva-based health organization, Dr. David Heyman, said in a telephone interview that an even greater number of men were expected to die of AIDS in the 1990's.
The data from the Lancet article and specific numbers about deaths in men and other details are to be released at a meeting on AIDS in Asia next week in Canberra, Australia, said Marjory Dam, a spokeswoman for W. H. O. in Washington. However, the Lancet report appeared earlier than expected and her office at the Pan American Health Organization had not received the new data from the AIDS program in Geneva, Ms. Dam said.
 
African and Caribbean Impact
Tom Netter, a spokesman for W. H. O. in Geneva, said the projection of three million deaths of women and children was one million higher than earlier estimates from W. H. O. Mr. Netter said the W. H. O. had revised upward, to 8 million to 10 million, earlier estimates of the number of people infected with the AIDS virus in the world. The previous figures were 6 million to 8 million, Mr. Netter said.
The estimates for the 1990's are based on more precise evaluations of surveys and health statistics by W.H.O., which is a unit of the United Nations. Dr. Chin said the new projections should be viewed as very conservative.
The chief impact is in sub-Saharan Africa and some parts of the Caribbean. Up to 40 percent of women from 30 to 34 years old were found to be infected with the AIDS virus in some central African cities, the report said.
 
'Death Within a Year'
The proportion of pregnant women infected with the AIDS virus ranges from 10 to 20 percent in several central African cities, Dr. Chin said, and over the next five years most African countries below the Sahara can expect surging death rates in children under the age of 5 and adults in the 20-to-49-year age group from the viral disease.
AIDS could become the leading killer in the most severely affected sub-Saharan African cities in the next few years, the report said.
''As for most AIDS patients in Africa, the diagnosis of the disease in women and children in this continent will be followed by death within a year unless substantial improvements can be achieved with newer treatments,'' Dr. Chin wrote.
By the end of 1992, about four million infants will have been born to women who are infected with the AIDS virus, the report said. The AIDS virus is also called HIV, for human immunodeficiency virus. Nearly a million of the babies will themselves be HIV-infected, Dr. Chin said.
''Results from several HIV infection/AIDS models suggest that during the next few decades, life expectancy at birth in many sub-Saharan African cities may fall by about six years. Infant and child mortality could be as much as 30 percent greater than would otherwise have been expected,'' the study said.

HEADLINE: 'Junk Bond' Deal Joined By Investor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 27

 BODY:
A Hong Kong businessman, Li Ka-shing, plans to spend $150 million for a half-interest in an investment group that has agreed to buy $3 billion in ''junk bonds'' from the troubled Columbia Savings and Loan Association in California, it was announced today.
Cheung Kong Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., two leading Hong Kong companies controlled by Mr. Li, along with a third company he controls privately, said they would buy half of a partnership assembled by the Gordon Investment Corporation, a merchant bank based in New York and Toronto.
The partnership, Gordon America L.P., said earlier this week that it had agreed to pay $300 million down for the portfolio of Columbia junk bonds and preferred stock along with a note for the remaining $2.7 billion at a 10.5 percent interest rate. 
 
A Troubled Savings and Loan
Regulatory changes in last year's savings industry bailout legislation forced Columbia to write down the value of its junk bonds by $1 billion, and it needs to improve its capital position if it hopes to escape being seized by regulators. Columbia is based in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Richard Li, the managing director of Hutchison's corporate fund management committee and the son of Li Ka-shing, said the purchase was part of the group's efforts to diversify its investments beyond Hong Kong.
''We look at this investment as a window into corporate America and into further investment opportunities,'' he said.
While the announcement of Li Ka-shing's involvement in the acquisition of Columbia's portfolio was disclosed only today, Mr. Li and Gordon had struck their deal before the sale was announced on Wednesday. In fact, Mr. Li and Gordon have a longstanding relationship. Mr. Li's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. is an investment partner in Gordon Investment.
Li Ka-shing's investment career has been built largely on real estate, not stocks and bonds, but the move fits a strategy he discussed in a newspaper interview in November in which he said he wanted to reduce his exposure in Hong Kong, where 90 percent of his assets are based.
 
Changes Coming in 1997
Many people in Hong Kong are afraid that China will break its promise to maintain the economic and political system for 50 years after Beijing takes control of Hong Kong in 1997.
Numerous Hong Kong-based companies are moving assets abroad. The huge trading house Jardine Matheson has moved its base to Bermuda, while other companies have bought property in the United States, Canada and Australia.
In 1987, Mr. Li's business empire purchased a 43 percent stake in Husky Oil Ltd., Canada's largest oil and gas company.
In the Columbia deal, Cheung Kong, a real-estate giant, and Hutchison, a big trading house, will each own 20 percent of Gordon America L.P. A company owned by Mr. Li's family will hold 10 percent, with the remainder held by Gordon Investment.
Under the terms of the Gordon-Columbia deal, Gordon America agreed to pay $3 billion for the junk bonds, but with 90 percent financing on a non-recourse basis. That means the partnership could drop the portfolio if its losses exceeded 10 percent and Columbia would have to take it back.

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Climb

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of all Treasury securities climbed and yields fell yesterday amid new signs that the economy is closer to a recession than data had previously indicated.
Several analysts suggested that the new evidence of economic slippage might be enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates.
The latest indication of weakness was reported by the Commerce Department, which said that the second-quarter gross national product grew at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent, compared with 1.7 percent in the first quarter. The department also revised downward the growth rates for the first quarter of this year, the fourth quarter of last year and the annual figure for 1989. 
 
Drop for Sales Component
Perhaps more important, the data showed that the ''real final sales'' component for the latest quarter registered its first decline since the recession year of 1982. Real final sales are the change in total G.N.P. minus the change in inventories.
While the report benefited the bond market, which thrives on negative economic news, it eroded the value of the dollar against all major foreign currencies. Any sign of economic weakness usually benefits investors in Treasury and other fixed-income securities because it tends to lessen inflation pressures and suggests interest rates may decline to help stimulate economic growth.
''The trend in the G.N.P. data tells us to expect a recession by the fourth quarter,'' said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo. ''The Federal Reserve's soft-landing scenario is turning into a crash landing. The Fed will now have to ease credit and ease aggressively.''
The Fed took steps exactly two weeks ago that lowered interest rates, a day after the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, suggested lower rates might be needed to stimulate the economy and alleviate a tightening of credit by major banks. But since then Mr. Greenspan has indicated he did not see an immediate need for further easing.
Mr. Braverman stressed that the decline in real final sales was of particular concern. ''The G.N.P. report said second-quarter real final sales were down 1.5 percent,'' he said. ''But they would have been down 2.2 percent if the sales of crops to the Government were taken out. By comparison, real final sales were up 3.8 percent in the first quarter.''
Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank, said, ''The real final sales factor galvanized the fixed-income market.'' He added, ''Normally, the Fed does not immediately respond to G.N.P. data, but it will have to because the revised data for the previous two quarters and all of 1989 do not look good.''
One of the few positive aspects of the latest G.N.P. data is that they are expected to attract greater participation at the Treasury's next refunding auctions, the terms of which will be announced Wednesday. Mr. Chandross said the quarterly refunding auctions the next week are expected to consist of $11 billion of 3-year notes, $10.25 billion of 10-year notes and $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds.
In late trading, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were offered at 102 31/32, up 22/32, as the yield fell to 8.47 percent, from 8.53 percent Thursday and a week earlier.
The long notes, the 8 7/8's of the year 2000, added 14/32, at 103 1/32, for a yield of 8.41 percent, down from 8.47 percent a week earlier. By comparison, the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds soared to 7.56 percent from 7.38 percent, while the yield on the 10-year West German bonds dropped to 8.13 percent from 8.39 percent.
Among other representative Treasury issues in the secondary market, the new 8 percent notes of 1992 rose 5/32, to 100, for a yield of 8 percent; the new 8.5's of 1997 added 11/32, at 100 14/32, to yield 8.35 percent.
 
Bill Discount Rates Ease
Dealers said a continuing flight to quality from the stock market caused discount rates on Treasury bills to ease. The rate on the 90-day bills fell four basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.54 percent; six-month bills declined five basis points, at 7.42 percent, and the one-year bills lost six basis points, at 7.28 percent.
The key Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans traded at 8 percent virtually all day.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plummets as Traders Expect Interest Rates to Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday as traders, with evidence of a further weakening in the economy, grew convinced that the Federal Reserve would push United States interest rates lower.
Gold prices slipped despite the weakened dollar.
The dollar was hit hard by a Commerce Department report that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent in the second quarter. 
The G.N.P., which measures the country's total output of goods and services, was supported solely by a big buildup in business inventories. Other important components of the economy, including consumer spending, business investment and housing construction, declined.
The poor showing followed a meager 1.7 percent increase in the first quarter and an even more paltry advance of three-tenths of a percent in the final quarter of 1989.
''The overwhelming majority of the market believes we're in a recession; it's heard too many things to suggest otherwise,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer with Bank of New York.
The financial markets believe that with the economy continuing to slump, the Fed will have to let interest rates fall to help stimulate growth. But such a move would come at the expense of the dollar. Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in United States yields makes the dollar less competitive.
That was evident yesterday as the British pound surged more than 2 cents against the dollar. Sterling rose to $1.8375 in New York from late Thursday's $1.8145. In London earlier, the British pound rose to $1.8350 from $1.8133.
It was also down against the West German currency, falling to 1.6120 marks, from 1.6230 late Thursday.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell more than a yen, to 149.10 yen in New York, from 150.35 late Thursday. In Tokyo earlier, the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a closing 150.75 yen and it was quoted in London at 149.70 yen.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.3620 Swiss francs, down from 1.3773; 5.3990 French francs, down from 5.4360; 1,180.00 Italian lire, down from 1,187.50, and 1.15195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15265.
Gold often benefits from a decline in the dollar, but technical factors carried it lower yesterday.
Gold fell $1.50 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $367.80 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $367.30, down $1.50 from Thursday.
Silver prices also declined. Silver slipped 1.9 cents, to $4.831 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange, and it fell in London to a late bid of $4.80 an ounce, from $4.85 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Speaker-Shopping in New York's Bazaar

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
If visitors from outer space landed in midtown Manhattan, they could conclude from shop windows that the object of life on earth was to consume stereo cassette players, compact disk players, video cameras, television sets, radios, telephones, calculators, fax machines, hand-held computers and other electronic gadgets nestled among signs saying ''Sale!'' and ''Discount!''
The concentration of stores, some of which advertise nationally through newspapers and catalogues, has made New York the nation's capital for electronics sales. But how good is it for consumers?
 
A Good Price Is Hard to Find
 Experts say you would have to be from Mars to take the stores at face value. ''The customer has a very difficult time nailing down 'What should I pay for it?' '' said Louise Boundas, the editor of the trade magazine Stereo Review.
At another trade publication, This Week in Consumer Electronics, Bob Gerson, the editor, said, ''There's no way I know of that the average guy can work this out.'' 
Even when he goes shopping for himself, Mr. Gerson said, he cannot determine what adds up to a good price for many products.
''Price'' is a relative concept in New York, harkening back to economists' definition of fair price: what a willing buyer will pay and a willing seller will accept. Electronic products are sold all over the United States, of course, in stores and through catalogues, but generally not at competitive prices.
Several New York stores have become national retailers through catalogue sales and large advertisements in major newspapers, complete with toll-free numbers for taking orders. Visitors from around the country and around the world come to New York to shop for these products.
They find a market that is nothing if not confusing. Consider, for example, shopping for a pair of speakers designed to operate from a portable cassette or CD player, without amplifier, in lieu of headphones.
The Sony SRS-55 model speaker - 7 inches high, 5 inches deep and 3 inches wide, is suitable for a desktop, a dresser or other places where full-size stereo equipment is not practical. Most stores have the SRS-55.
At Camera Electronics, in Herald Square, the salesman first asks a customer how many speakers he wants - apparently intending to sell them individually. ''One pair,'' the customer says. ''One hundred and twenty dollars,'' the salesman says. But, the customer says, at 47th Street Photo the catalogue lists them for $69.95. The customer turns to leave; the salesman says with a shrug, ''O.K., give me $69.''
In that immediate area, Camera Barn wants $79, and Sixth Avenue Electronics wants $89. At the Wiz, the price is $99.99 and the salesman does not offer to beat or equal another store's price.
At Tower Camera and Video, which opened a few weeks ago on the corner of 43d Street and Broadway, near the heart of the Times Square tourist district, the sticker says $259.95 but a salesman says $109.
 
The Best, Only the Best!
Just down the street at USA Electronics, the salesman says $75, but when a shopper resists, he says, ''What's your best price?'' Pursuing the shopper toward the door, the salesman exclaims, ''I'll give you the best price, I'll give you the best price!''
At Grand Central Camera, on Lexington Avenue at 44th Street, a salesman asks a price-shopper, ''Why don't you want the better one?'' and points to a different brand. When the customer insists on the Sony, the salesman says $65. The customer turns to leave, saying he wants to do more shopping. ''How about $49.95?'' asks the salesman, and the two agree. The salesman writes out the sales slip and adds the tax. But a clerk sent to the stockroom announces that there are none left: the salesman pushes his other models.
On Canal Street, Uncle Steve Inc. is selling the SRS-55 for $59, cash only. A salesman there offered a shopper an AC adapter for $18 but the shopper bought one at a shop next door for $5.
There are other ways. A consumer with a computer and a modem can shop through the General Electric Information Services Company and order merchandise by credit card. The SRS-55 is $79.95. And there are catalogues.
What should electronic goods really cost? a shopper might ask. ''All we do is set the list price,'' said Shari Haber, a spokeswoman for the Sony Corporation of America. In this case, it's $99.95. ''It's up to the store what they sell it for,'' she said. By law, manufacturers cannot dictate sales prices. Ms. Haber said Sony's recommendations were generally followed only when a product was brand-new, in demand and hard to find.
''It's like a third-world economy, a flea market,'' said Mark Green, the New York City Consumer Protection Commissioner. A week ago his office revoked the license of one of the larger electronics shops, Camera World and Sound. It is illegal, said Mr. Green, to offer merchandise for sale without a price tag. ''If there is no tag and someone walks in speaking a foreign language, they may pay $450 for a $150 pair of binoculars,'' he said.
Mr. Green added that it is also illegal to charge more than the manufacturer's suggested price without telling the customer. That may be one reason list prices are kept high. ''You cannot disparage an advertised sale item in order to bait and switch the consumer to a more expensive item,'' he said - the charge against Camera World.
But charging what the traffic will bear is accepted practice. ''The reason there are so many electronics stores in midtown is that there are so many gullible tourists in midtown,'' he said. ''If a store grossly overcharges, you might find someone from Pennsylvania or Poland who will gobble it up.''
It sounds like the old joke: Why did God create tourists? Because somebody has to pay full retail price. Mr. Gerson, whose trade journal is known by its acronym, Twice, says that stores like Radio Shack often get a higher price, ''but when a customer walks into Radio Shack and walks out with a receiver, he knows the price he paid for it is the price of a Radio Shack receiver.''
At another store, he said, ''You don't know the price of, say, a Technics receiver, or whether it's this year's model or last year's model or next year's model.'' Some national chains, he said, can stay in business because customers are confident that while they are not getting a bargain, they are not being taken.
Comparison shopping is probably the only key to a reasonably priced purchase. Katie Hafner, an author, now recounts with chagrin the electronic database wristwatch with the $198 price tag that the salesman at a store on Fifth Avenue sold her for $98, along with a $169 camera. The salesman even threw in some free film.
Later Ms. Hafner saw the watch for $25 and the camera for $69. ''I will never be able to face another electronics store without burning with shame,'' she said.
 
FERRETING OUT A FAIR PRICE
How do you buy electronic equipment at a fair price?
First, try to settle on the make and model by talking to people who have bought something you like. That done, check a reputable independent source, like Consumer Reports, and then be prepared to shop hard.
Here are some things to remember. On items that should sell for under $100, it is not unusual for the first price quoted to be double what the retailer will settle for.
The dollar amount on a price tag means nothing in many stores. A letter or number code on the price instantly tells the salesman what the actual price is.
Larger electronics products, like television sets or videocassette recorders, generally have a markup of about 28 percent, said Bob Gerson, editor of This Week in Consumer Electronics. Smaller ''accessory'' items, like independently powered speakers, usually have list prices that may be double the wholesale cost, or more.
When you decide, make sure the box is sealed, the model number on the item matches the one on the box and the device is new. Otherwise, in a world of rapidly changing products, you may get this year's wrapper and last year's model.

HEADLINE: Bush Will Let Japanese Buy Hercules Unit

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 27

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would not block the sale of Semi-Gas Systems Inc. to a Japanese bidder even though the California company has a central role in the semiconductor industry's effort to overtake its Japanese rivals. Semi-Gas Systems is a primary supplier of gas distribution and control systems to American chip makers.
Under terms first disclosed in April, Nippon Sanso of Japan intends to acquire Semi-Gas Systems for $23 million from Hercules Inc., a large chemical producer in Wilmington, Del. Hercules acquired Semi-Gas three years ago for an investment of about $5 million, industry officials said. 
Officials at Sematech, the Government-industry alliance to bolster the nation's chip-making technology, renewed their threats to cancel its contract with Semi-Gas after the decision was announced from Mr. Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Me.
''If the acquisition goes through, we would more than likely remove Semi-Gas as a supplier to the consortium,'' Peter H. Mills, Sematech's senior vice president and chief administrative officer, said in an interview.
''They have been an intimate partner to Sematech almost since we began two years ago,'' he added. ''They have an intimate knowledge of our fabrication facility. You couldn't choose a better way to do industrial espionage.''
The Semi-Gas purchase also has opposition in Congress. Representative Mel Levine, the California Democrat, said after the President's decision today that the endorsement of Nippon Sanso's bid was ''an unconscionable abandonment'' of the President's responsibilities on national security.
''Does the President care who controls American's strategic industries and our economic future?'' Mr. Levine asked. ''Mr. Bush has sold off a critical piece of American's economic pie to the Japanese without blinking an eye.''
 
National Security Issue
President Bush is authorized by Congress to block the purchases of American companies by foreign buyers in any case where issues of national security are raised. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, had recommended approval of Nippon Sanso's bid for Semi-Gas Systems.
An Administration official said Sematech secrets would be protected from use by Nippon Sanso under a confidentiality pact Nippon Sanso has said it will accept. He added that Nippon Sanso had agreed to sell to American chip makers a different gas-purifying system preferred by many Japanese chip makers because of it reduces defects in the chip-making process. Setback for Sematech Removing Semi-Gas equipment would be a major setback for Sematech, which has been pressing to improve the technology and equipment for producing computer chips with increasingly narrow circuit widths by next year. Mr. Mills said replacing Semi-Gas with another domestic supplier would force a shut down of Sematech's research laboratory for at least six months.
Sematech's annual budget is about $230 million, with $100 million contributed by taxpayers and the balance from 14 companies in the domestic chip-making and computer industry, including the International Business Machines Corporation, the Intel Corporation, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Motorola Inc. It was formed in 1988, with headquarters in Austin, Tex.
 
Alliance on Course
Before his death last month, Robert N. Noyce, Sematech's president and chief executive, said the alliance was on course to reclaim the lead from their Japanese rivals by the mid-1990's.
Semi-Gas controls 46 percent of the market for gas distribition and control technology for the chip-making industry in the United States. Its purchase by Nippon Sanso, a major supplier of similar equipment in Japan, must still pass antitrust reviews by the Justice Department.
The prospect of another Japanese purchase of an American supplier to domestic chip makers was scuttled earlier this year after angry protests by some members of Congress. Japan's Nikon considered bidding for a unit of the Perkin-Elmer Corporation that produces photolithography equipment, but never made a formal offer. The Perkin-Elmer unit was later acquired by the Silicon Valley Group, in San Jose, Calif.
''We found that there is no credible evidence'' that Nippon Sanso's acquisition of Semi-Gas Systems would threaten national security or the nation's chip-making industry, said an Administration official familiar with the Semi-Gas analysis by the Brady panel.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate Up Just 1.2% In 2d Period

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: July 31, 1990
In its latest figures on the health of the American economy, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that the United States was much closer to a recession than Government statistics had recognized until now.
The new figures showed that the gross national product, measuring the total value of the nation's goods and services, grew by a very weak 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. That was about half-a-percentage point or so below the forecasts.
The dollar tumbled and Treasury securities rose sharply in price and yields fell, the usual reaction to news that a recession may be more likely because interest rates move lower in recessions. [Pages 32 and 37.] Closer to Recession Still, the slow economic growth during the April-to-June period was not a great surprise, given that economists refer constantly to the economy as sluggish. The big surprise came in the Commerce Department's annual revision of earlier G.N.P. figures. Instead of a slowdown that seemed to have started last September, the department said the sluggishness actually began in March 1989, indicating that for more than a year the economy was moving closer to a recession than many economists realized. 
''The basic story is that the economy had a lot less momentum than we thought because income was less than we thought and for that reason people aren't spending as much as we thought they were,'' said David Wyss, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service.
 
Revised Downward
Until yesterday, Government data showed the G.N.P to be growing at a healthy annual rate of 2.6 percent in last year's second quarter and 3 percent in the third period. The revised G.N.P. numbers for these two quarters, however, were 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. Similar revisions for last year's fourth quarter reduced growth to a meager three-tenths of one percent from the previously reported 1.1 percent. The first quarter of 1990 was reduced to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent.
A recession is formally defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction in the G.N.P.
The Bush Administration put the best face on the numbers. Michael Darby, the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, said the best way to look at the G.N.P. numbers was to average the first and second quarter, rather than think of the first quarter as 1.7 percent growth and the second as 1.2 percent. He described the average, an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the first half, as modest.
Mr. Darby also insisted at a news conference yesterday that despite the latest numbers, the G.N.P. would still grow by 2.2 percent in 1990, with most of the catch-up growth coming in the fourth quarter. If the goal is not met, the budget deficit is likely to be higher than the current estimates. That is because sluggish economic growth usually reduces tax revenue and raises outlays for unemployment insurance and other programs.
 
Many Sectors Off
The sluggishness in the second quarter appeared in many sectors. Net exports declined from the first quarter. So did business investment, consumer spending and personal income. Only Government purchases rose. As a result, final sales - the broadest measure of demand for American goods and services - fell by an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, after having risen by 3.8 percent in the first quarter.
Personal consumption, in fact, fell by three-tenths of a percent, at an annual rate, in the second quarter, and by eight-tenths of a percent in last year's fourth quarter, according to the revised figures. That is still well above the 2.2 percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1981, in the opening months of the last recession, which lasted a year and was the most severe since World War II.
Personal income, on the other hand, is not falling as quickly as spending. Income from all sources dropped five-tenths of a percent, adjusted for inflation, after having risen by 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. About one-third of the drop was in Federal subsidies paid to farmers. Wages, commissions and fees paid to stockbrokers and others in financial services also declined from first-quarter levels, the Commerce Department said.
Some economists, among them Richard Rahn, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The central bank has been reducing rates in spread-out steps since March 1989, but many economists consider mortgage and consumer lending rates of 10 percent or more as still too high to encourage purchases on credit that would stimulate the economy.
 
Fear of Inflation
Out of concern that the inflation rate might rise, the Federal Reserve is often reluctant to reduce interest rates and thus encourage too much demand and upward pressure on prices. But the new G.N.P. data showed that the fixed-weight price index, a broad measure of inflation, had declined in the second quarter to an annual rate of 3.9 percent from 6.6 percent in the first period.
What growth there was in the second quarter came from a buildup in inventories, mostly in the warehouses of wholesalers and retailers, but not manufacturers. Recessions have frequently begun in the past when businesses, concerned about their unsold stockpiles of goods, canceled factory orders en masse, resulting in widespread layoffs. Government data indicate that so far these cancellations have not occurred.
The G.N.P. figures seemed to indicate a sharp rise in auto inventories. But Mr. Donahoe noted that this was not the case. Auto inventories actually declined in the second quarter, but by a much smaller amount than in the first quarter, and G.N.P. accounting makes this seem like a buildup in auto inventories. The major buildup, however, was in retailing and machinery, the later probably a reflection of the decline in capital spending and the drop in net exports.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

HEADLINE: Trinidad Rebels Threaten to Kill Premier and 11 Other Hostages

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, July 28

 BODY:
Representatives of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago were negotiating tonight with Muslim coup plotters who said they had wired the Prime Minister and 11 other hostages with explosives and would blow them up if loyal forces tried to free them.
The Government-controlled radio reported progress in the negotiations, although details were sketchy. The Caribbean News Agency quoted a police official as saying that the rebels had requested safe passage to Libya, which the Trinidad Government says is backing the group.
A Roman Catholic Church official, Archbishop Anthony Pantin, said earlier that the leader of the Muslim group, which has been holding Prime Minister Arthur N. R. Robinson and members of his Cabinet in the Parliament since Friday evening, had told him that the hostages would die if any attempts were made to storm the building to free them. 
 
Threat by Rebel Leader
''He said he has them wired up and will fire them,'' the Archbishop said after meeting with the rebel leader, Abu Bakr.
Archbishop Pantin termed the situation ''very grim'' and said Mr. Abu Bakr and his group appeared to be losing patience with the standoff.
But the Government radio announcer said later that the Archbishop and another church official had headed to the national television station, which was occupied by the rebels, in the expectation of a breakthrough.
About 22 people were reported killed in scattered fighting in the capital of this two-island nation [In Washington, the White House expressed support for Mr. Robinson's Government. A Bush Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that ''the possibility exists to dispatch a team for an advisory role'' but that there were ''no plans for military activity'' to aid the Trinidad Government.] Earlier today, Government troops surrounded the Parliament building, where the rebel organization, Jamaat al-Muslimeen, started its coup attempt. The group's name is Arabic for Group of Muslims.
Witnesses said that looters ran through the streets, parts of the capital were ablaze and that sporadic firing was going on between forces loyal to the Government and supporters of the Muslim group. The international airport was closed shortly after the start of the coup attempt.
The Caribbean News Agency reported that hospital officials had said about 22 people, including several police officers, had been killed in gunfights between the two sides since the the coup attempt began.
 
Many Victims in Hospitals
The state-run radio said there were ''lots of wounded'' and appealed for doctors and nurses to go to hospitals to cope with the influx of victims.
Mr. Abu Bakr (whose name is pronounced AH-boo BAH-kuhr) said in a morning television broadcast that he had overthrown Mr. Robinson's Government and that charges were to be brought against the Prime Minister and members of his Cabinet.
At least three people were reported to have been killed when the rebel group stormed into Parliament while lawmakers were in session about 6 P.M. Friday and seized 20 officials. No officials are known to have been hurt.
The rebels, whom the Government estimates to number between 250 and 500, were armed with AK-47 rifles. They were holding their captives in the ornate parliamentary chamber and had also taken up barricaded positions on the street outside.
The Acting President of Trinidad, Emanuel Carter, declared in a radio broadcast early today that the Government was in control. His statement came well before Archbishop Patin's first meeting with Ali Bakr and his report that the hostages had been wired with explosives.
 
President Vacationing Overseas
Mr. Carter, filling in while President Noor Hassanali is on vacation in Britain, declared a state of emergency and an indefinite curfew.
The rebel group released 8 of the 20 captives before dawn today after mediation by an Anglican priest. Those freed included two Government ministers.
A spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran described the situation early today as ''a mass kidnapping.''
''We are victims at this time of extremists, particularly backed by Libya and other international hoodlums,'' Mr. Dookeran's spokesman said in an appeal for international help.
Emeka Anyaoku, the Secretary General of the British Commonwealth, which lists Trinidad and Tobago among its 50 members, condemned the coup attempt, telling the British Broadcasting Corporation, ''There is no way the region as a whole and the Commonwealth in general can accept a situation where democracy can be turned over in that way.''
The police headquarters in Port of Spain, set on fire early in the coup attempt, was destroyed. At dawn, many fires were visible for miles under towering plumes of black smoke. Gunfire sounded sporadically in the streets of the capital, a city of 60,000. [The State Department described the Muslim rebels as a ''fringe extremist group with no popular support.'' The department's statement said that the group had direct ties to Libya and that some members had been trained there. Americans in Trinidad were asked to stay indoors, and travelers were warned against heading there.] Television Station Seized Mr. Abu Bakr seized control of Trinidad's state-run television station at about 6:30 P.M. on Friday. He went on television several times during the night with statements that railed against the Government.
When the group seized Parliament, Steve Maurice, chief of security for the Prime Minister, tried to shield Mr. Robinson from the rebels with his body but was forced at gunpoint to move away, a newspaper report said. Mr. Robinson and 19 other ministers and officials were ordered to lie on the floor, and were later taken to another room inside the building.
Mr. Abu Bakr, a former policeman in his mid-40's who founded the rebel organization about six years ago, said in an early-morning broadcast that the Government was responsible for a wave of corruption, rape, incest, robbery and drugs sweeping the country.
Trinidad and Tobago, an oil-producing republic off Venezuela, has been hit hard by a fall in the price of oil, and unemployment has reached 20 percent. Mr. Robinson has imposed unpopular austerity measures to halt economic decline.
Mr. Robinson, whose full name is Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson and who is 63 years old, came to power in a landslide victory on Dec. 16, 1986, ending 30 years of rule by the People's National Movement. Mr. Robinson pledged that in his five-year term he would restore growth to the economy and end racial divisions.

HEADLINE: A Tax Debate Revived

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
The Bush Administration opened old political wounds this week when it proposed to limit the amount of state and local income taxes that taxpayers could deduct on their Federal returns.
The proposal raised anew the question of the best way to make the wealthy pay more taxes. It stirred once again conflict between states with high income taxes and those that rely on sales taxes. And it led governors and mayors to complain that this Administration, like the previous one, would inhibit their ability to raise money at the very time they were being required to shoulder a greater share of the burden of dealing with social problems.
Today, it is still unclear whether the Administration intends to push for enactment of the plan or whether it was made as a bargaining chip to emphasize that there were ways to raise taxes on many high-income taxpayers without increasing tax rates. 
 
Bush Not 'Locked In'
On his way to Maine for the weekend, President Bush told reporters he was not ''locked in to any specific proposal.''
The brunt of the new tax proposal would be felt in states like New York, Massachusetts and California, where state and often city income taxes are steep.
These are the states with the most ambitious social programs and state services. Although there are exceptions, as a rule the states with the highest income taxes tend to be Democratic strongholds.
Residents of states like Texas, Florida and Connecticut who pay little if any income tax would not be affected by the plan. Many lawmakers from such states argue that since sales taxes, from which they derive most of their revenue, are no longer deductible, it is only fair to drop the deduction for income taxes.
 
Plan Outlined Privately
One important lawmaker who might be expected to take that position is Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, a Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee. But Senator Bentsen may still be interested in running on a national ticket and may therefore be reluctant to alienate residents of large states with high taxes that would be important to him politically.
The plan was outlined by Richard G. Darman, the budget director, at a private meeting with Republican leaders Wednesday evening. No full description has been made public, but officials familiar with the proposal said on Thursday that it would place a $10,000 limit on the amount of state and local income taxes that could be deducted by a married couple from their Federal income taxes. The officials said they were not sure how single taxpayers would be affected, but presumably the limit would be somewhat lower. The deductibility of property taxes would not be affected.
Deductions are subtracted from total income before taxes are calculated. For example, a taxpayer who earns $50,000 and has deductions of $15,000 has a taxable income of $35,000.
 
Effects in New York
Nicholas A. Nesi, a tax partner in the New York headquarters of BDO Seidman, the accounting firm, calculated that a $10,000 ceiling would affect couples in New York City with incomes above $107,000. Elsewhere in the state where there is no local income tax, it takes a higher income before the state tax by itself reaches $10,000. Those affected in such areas would be couples with incomes above about $145,000. The top tax rate is 7.875 percent in New York State, and the top city rate is an additional 3.5 percent.
Mr. Nesi figured that a couple living outside New York City and earning $150,000 would owe about $1,600 more in Federal taxes each year if the plan became law.
In New Jersey, the top tax rate has just been increased to 7 percent from 3.5 percent, effective next January.
Congressional statisticians estimate that if the new rule were to go into effect next January, it would raise less than $3 billion in the 1991 fiscal, which begins Oct. 1. But over the following four years, it would raise about $7 billion a year, a sizable downpayment toward reducing the Federal deficit.
Mr. Darman is familiar with the political pitfalls of such a proposal. He was Deputy Treasury Secretary and the chief tax negotiator in 1985, when Ronald Reagan proposed abolishing all deductions for state and local taxes.
 
Reagan Proposal Was Disputed
It was one of the most hotly disputed parts of the Reagan tax plan, and it threatened to wreck the Reagan plan until it was watered down. In the end, Congress agreed to eliminate deductions for state and local sales taxes, but income and property taxes were left fully deductible.
The Reagan proposal on state and local tax deductions was part of an overall plan to reduce tax rates and eliminate tax breaks. The Bush proposal, in contrast, is intended to raise revenue as a step toward lowering the Federal deficit.
In putting forth the plan this week, the Bush Administration may have made a political miscalculation. Mr. Darman apparently intended for it to become public simultaneously with a Democratic tax offer.
But when word of the proposal leaked out Thursday morning. Democrats decided to withhold their offer and let the Republicans take the political heat on taxes for a change.
From the Administration's perspective, the most attractive feature of the new proposal is that the taxpayers affected would be mostly the well-heeled. Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, said that 97.4 percent of those affected would have annual incomes of more than $100,000 and that 86 percent would have incomes above $200,000.
 
States and Localities Benefit
That allows the Administration to oppose the Democrats' favorite tax change, which is to raise the top rate paid by the highest-income taxpayers to 33 percent from 28 percent, and still rebut Democratic arguments that the Administration supports only those taxes that spare the rich. Many high-income taxpayers below the level of the wealthiest are now paying a marginal rate - that is, the rate paid on the last dollars earned - of 33 percent, although no taxpayers pay a rate of 33 percent on their entire income.
Politicians in states like New York say they are able to keep their taxes high in part because residents can deduct the cost from their Federal taxes. In effect, the Federal Government reimburses taxpayers for a portion of their state and local taxes.
Mayor David N. Dinkins was one of several politicians from New York State and City who came to Washington to work against the plan even before it became public. Mr. Dinkins said at a news conference that he had balanced the city's budget by raising local taxes and added, ''one of the reasons we did so is because of the deductibility of those taxes.''
Some executives fear that if individual income taxes are not deductible, states will shift the tax burden to businesses, a step they say would stifle economic growth.
In the past, Mr. Darman has vigorously advocated eliminating the deductibility of local property taxes. He has argued that it is not fair for residents of one community with high taxes to deduct the money that goes for fancy schools and parks, while residents of another community with lower taxes and services cannot deduct what they pay for private schools or clubs.
But the issue has not come up this year, apparently for two reasons. First, much property tax money is used for schools, and President Bush does not want to be seen as working against better education. Second, one of the states hardest hit by the abolition of the property tax deduction would be New Hampshire, which has no sales or income tax. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is the former Governor of New Hampshire.

HEADLINE: Transit Agency's Plan: Tokens Outside Subway

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Tired of waiting in long lines in the subway to buy tokens?
Rather wait at your bank? Your check-cashing outlet? Or your museum?
Transit officials are experimenting with ways to trim the long lines in subway stations, but they say they are having little success because most riders are not aware how many off-site places to buy tokens there are.
They plan to conduct a publicity campaign to tell the public about the experiment. 
Transit officials are also negotiating with fast-food restaurants like McDonald's and consumer-products companies to give discounts and free products to riders who buy tokens in bulk. Under one such plan, buyers of packages of 10 tokens would use the plastic wrapper as a coupon to obtain a discount or a free product, like fries at McDonald's.
 
Where to Buy Tokens
There are 410 businesses and public agencies in New York City that sell tokens for the Transit Authority. These include 80 Manufacturers Hanover branches, 40 Chemical Bank offices, 9 Bank of New York branches, the Whitney Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and some Thriftway and Rite Check Cashing outlets.
In addition, about 230 employers in New York City buy tokens directly from the transit agency and make them available to their employees. These employers include messenger services; credit unions; brokerage houses like Shearson Lehman Hutton, Goldman, Sachs & Company and Bear, Stearns & Company; large companies like Colgate-Palmolive, and large accounting firms like Arthur Young.
''Selling tokens allows banks and check-cashing centers to provide their customers with another value-added service,'' said Michael Alvich, the Transit Authority's director of corporate services, who is recruiting businesses to participate in the program. ''For retailers, it gets more people in the store browsing and looking at their merchandise.''
''On the corporate side, many businesses do it as an employee benefit, and it also cuts down on people being late because they missed the train while waiting to buy tokens,'' he said.
 
Token-Vending Machines
About 42 million tokens, or 4 percent of all tokens, are sold through businesses and public agencies each year.
The Transit Authority also plans to increase the number of token-vending machines in subway stations. There are now three such machines in the Parsons Boulevard station in Queens, four in Grand Central Terminal, two at Lexington Avenue and 86th Street, two at 72d and Broadway, and three in Penn Station. The agency plans to place groups of five or six machines at stations in the future.
The token-vending machines accept $10 bills and dispense eight tokens and change or $5 bills and dispense four tokens and change.
Mr. Alvich said the response to the new vending machines was outstanding, with some machines running out of tokens and change faster than the agency could fill them.
 
'D Minus' for the Agency's Effort
Still, some transit-agency critics say the Transit Authority has not done enough to reduce the wait to buy tokens. ''I'd give their efforts to relieve token booth lines a D minus,'' said Gene Russianoff, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for New York subway riders.
''The Transit Authority is behind its stated goals for off-site sales of tokens and there is absolutely no advertising or information to let people know that they can buy tokens at other places aside from token booths,'' he said.
Mr. Alvich said the number of businesses selling subway tokens was much lower than expected because of the low commission that the Transit Authority offered. Currently, the agency offers a 1 percent commission to businesses that buy 100,000 to 399,000 tokens, a 1.5 percent commission for 400,000 to 799,000 tokens and a 2 percent commission for 800,000 or more tokens.
Mr. Alvich expects the number of sellers to grow quickly under a plan by the agency to offer a higher commission to independent token sellers.
 
Tokens on the Newsstands
''Our objective is to come up with a program that both lowers the number of tokens that needs to be purchased to qualify for a commission and raises the commission, while making it economically feasible for the agency,'' he said.
Although the Transit Authority has no agreements with newsstands, bodegas and candy stores to sell tokens, Mr. Alvich said many of these businesses sold tokens on their own accord and accepted tokens for payment.
Lines at token booths have grown longer since the Transit Authority raised the subway and bus fare to $1.15 from $1 on Jan. 1, increasing the number of coins that token booth clerks must handle. Waits of 10 minutes at rush hour are not uncommon at some subway-station token booths.
Over all, subway and bus riders can reduce the amount of time they wait at token booths by buying tokens in bulk at their home stations instead of purchasing a few tokens at a time at busy stations, transit officials said.
To obtain information on off-site places to buy tokens, riders can call the Transit Authority travel information bureau at 718-330-1234, which is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or the transit consumer-service department at 718-330-3322, which is open Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.

HEADLINE: Testimony Begins in Lawsuit Over Effort to Aid Contras

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 28

 BODY:
Testimony has begun in the Federal trial of a civil suit pitting Eugene Hasenfus, the only survivor of a plane crash that helped to expose the Iran-contra affair, against Richard V. Secord, a leading figure in the scandal.
Mr. Hasenfus, a cargo handler, filed the Federal lawsuit in 1988 along with the family of the plane's co-pilot, Wallace B. Sawyer Jr., who was among three people killed in the Sandinista rocket attack on the rebel supply plane in Nicaragua. They seek a preliminary estimate of $3.4 million in damages, including expenses caused by the crash and lost income.
The downing of the C-123 cargo plane on Oct. 5, 1986, led to the discovery of an extensive United States contra supply operation that was based in El Salvador and financed by the profits from the American sale of arms to Iran. 
After the crash, President Ronald Reagan denied that there was any Government connection to the flight. But Mr. Hasenfus, and documents in the wreckage of the plane, linked the crew to Government involvement.
The suit by Mr. Hasenfus and Mr. Sawyer's family is not only against Mr. Secord, a retired Air Force general, but also against Southern Air Transport, a Miami-based company that was owned by the Central Intelligence Agency until 1973. It alleges that they misled the crew and negligently used aircraft without adequate safety equipment.
Mr. Secord and Southern Air deny they were legally responsible for Mr. Hasenfus and Mr. Sawyer. They also contend that the two men knew the risks they were taking in ferrying supplies to rebels fighting the Nicaraguan Government.
Mr. Hasenfus managed to parachute out of the plane after it was hit. He was captured, convicted of terrorism and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The Sandinista Government released him after he served three months, and he is now a construction worker in Marinette, Wis.
 
Contract for Services
Mr. Hasenfus, 49 years old, testified Thursday that he worked for the C.I.A.-owned airline Air America in the Vietnam War. When hostilities in Central America heated up in July 1986, he said, he was contacted by William B. Cooper, with whom he used to work in Southeast Asia, and was offered a job similar to the work they had done there. Mr. Cooper was flying the plane that was shot down in Nicaragua.
After talking to Mr. Cooper, Mr. Hasenfus said, he was taken to the Southern Air headquarters at Miami International Airport, where he signed a contract with Corporate Air Services. He said, however, he understood that Corporate Air was a front for Southern Air, which was paying his expenses.
Mr. Hasenfus said the crews complained that there was no safety equipment like parachutes or survival gear in the plane, and that the navigation radios did not work properly. But he said he accepted the defects, thinking that the supply operation was a patriotic, shoestring effort to fight communists in Central America.
Only when the Iran-contra affair became public, he said, did he become aware that Oliver L. North, Mr. Secord and Southern Air were running the supply effort as a profit-making enterprise.
 
Effort to Conceal Operation
Richard Gadd, who helped Mr. North, Mr. Secord and Southern Air set up the supply operation, said in written testimony on Friday that the use of Corporate Air and other companies was designed to hide who was behind the supply effort.
Southern Air continued to do contract work for the United States Government even after he was no longer owned by the C.I.A., Mr. Gadd said.
Mr. Gadd and the president of Southern Air, William Langton, decided that the effort ''should be treated as a clandestine or covert activity (so the) media could not attempt to trace it back to the owners and the United States Government,'' the deposition said.
Mr. Gadd said Mr. Secord directed the money and made policy decisions in the enterprise, a major point for Mr. Hasenfus, who is trying to prove that Mr. Secord, an officer in Corporate Air, was his real employer.
 
Name on Tax Returns
On cross-examination, the lawyer for Southern Air, Robert Beckman, focused on the role of Corporate Air, forcing Mr. Hasenfus to show that his pay drafts, tax returns and unemployment compensation claim all reflected that company's name, not Southern Air.
Mr. Beckman also sought to show that Mr. Hasenfus had violated a secrecy agreement he signed with Corporate Air. Mr. Hasenfus said the case ''was already blown by Congress'' when he later sold the rights to his story for $10,000 to CBS. The account has never been made public, he said.
Mr. Secord's lawyers have said their client never had any legal relationship with Mr. Hasenfus and Mr. Sawyer, and indeed had never met them.
Mr. Secord pleaded guilty on Nov. 8, 1989, to lying to Congressional investigators when he said he was not aware of any money that went to Mr. North's benefit from the maze of companies he used in the Iran-contra affair. He was sentenced to two years' probation.

HEADLINE: Omaha Grand Jury Sees Hoax in Lurid Tales

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 28

 BODY:
Lurid reports of child sex abuse, drug trafficking, pornography and political intrigue that have held Omaha enthralled for nearly two years were a ''carefully crafted hoax,'' a county grand jury in Nebraska has concluded. But two other inquiries are continuing, and the Nebraska State Senator who heads one of them has raised questions about the grand jury's conclusions.
The report this week said the hoax, involving allegations against some of Omaha's more prominent citizens, was ''scripted by a person or persons with considerable knowledge of the people and institutions of Omaha.'' 
The grand jury did not identify those suspected of engineering the hoax. But it did indict two witnesses who it said had given perjured accounts in the tangled case, involving a failed credit union formed to help the poor that was headed by a nationally prominent Republican.
 
'A Strange Document'
State and Federal inquiries into some of the same matters are continuing, and the Nebraska Senator who heads the state's investigation, Loran Schmit, labeled the grand jury's report ''a strange document.''
''That is the kindest thing I can say about it,'' he said.
An Assistant United States Attorney, Thomas Talken, who heads the Federal inquiry, said it would continue to examine some of the same matters studied by the county panel.
The rumors about child sex abuse, drug trafficking and other offenses began to circulate in late 1988 shortly after the failure of the Franklin Community Federal Credit Union, which was headed by Lawrence E. King Jr., a former vice chairman of the National Black Republican Council, an affiliate of the Republican Party, who has entertained generously at Republican national conventions. He has been indicted on charges of embezzling money from the credit union, which closed in November 1988, but a Federal magistrate has ruled that he is not mentally competent to stand trial at this time.
The rumors gained further attention last year after a former State Senator, John De Camp, wrote a memorandum naming five prominent individuals as ''central figures'' in the state's investigation.
The grand jury exonerated the five, saying, ''We found no credible evidence of child sexual abuse, interstate transportaion of minors, drug trafficking or participation in a pornography ring.''
The grand jury quoted Shakespeare's King Henry IV: ''Rumor is a pipe, blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures and of so easy and so plain a stop that the blunt monster with uncounted heads, the still discordant wavering multitudes, can play upon it.''
 
'Rumor and Innuendo'
Though it made no formal accusation, the grand jury said it suspected that a state investigator looking into the sexual allegations had been duped by a executive who had been dismissed by Boys Town, the home for troubled young people in Omaha. It said the unemployed executive, identified as Michael Casey, might have ''fueled the fire of rumor and innuendo'' because of personal grudges.
Among the rumors swirling around the affair was one that Mr. King had abused young people from Boys Town. At least some of the five prominent people named by Mr. De Camp had either supported the cause of Mr. King's credit union or attended some of the lavish parties he frequently gave.
The two witnesses who were charged with perjury were a young man and a young woman who had said they were victims of abuse when they were teen-agers. They were indicted after two other witnesses, who had supported their accounts, recanted. The two who were indicted are now serving jail terms for unrelated offenses. They were identified as Alisha Owen, 21 years old, and Paul A. Bonacci, 22.

HEADLINE: Revisions Sought in U.S. Food-Aid Program

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Each year the United States sends so much grain to Egypt that the farmers feed loaves of bread to their cows.
In Indonesia, officials appealed to the United States Ambassador to stop the shipment of 70,000 tons of American grain that would have put their farmers out of business.
And every year, tons of food rots on foreign docks because aid shipments are sent without regard to local harvesting and milling schedules.
Frustrated over waste and mismanagement in the $1.5 billion Food for Peace program, lawmakers, commodity and private aid groups are trying to push through Congress the most sweeping changes in 25 years in the humanitarian food program. 
The versions of the bill that have been approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee would reorganize the bureaucracy that distributes the food and would allocate more money to grants, rather than loans.
American aid officials say what began as a well-intentioned foreign-aid effort to distribute surplus grain has been stymied by mismanagement and political interests. Bureaucratic infighting and agency turf battles paralyze food delivery, they say. And because food is used as a foreign-policy weapon, they say, it is channeled away from the neediest countries to the politically important ones.
''The present Food for Peace program has so many bureaucratic and political players that it usually serves the political ends before it works to end hunger,'' said Representative Tony P. Hall, Democrat of Ohio, who heads the House Select Committee on Hunger.
''What we are trying to do is to streamline the decision-making process and basically, if possible, take as much politics out of it as we can,'' Mr. Hall said. He is working with Senators on a bipartisan bill that would reorganize the bureaucracy of five agencies that administer the program.
''It's used as a slush fund of the State Department to meet political requirements around the world,'' said Owen Cylke, former acting director of Food for Peace, who retired last year.
According to Congressional testimony, a third of American food aid goes to countries that do not have food shortages. Morocco, which has one of the highest per capita calorie rates, received $70 million in food aid last year, while Angola, a country where there is severe malnutrition, received less than $3 million.
The United States has provided covert support to rebels fighting the Angolan Government.
Mr. Cylke said the program lends the world's poorest nations the money to buy American grain and processed foods, which worsens their debt crisis. Meanwhile, countries that are relatively well off receive gifts of food.
Those leading the revision efforts say most of the problems stem from wrangling among the five agencies involved: the Agency for International Development, the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments of State, Agriculture and Treasury.
 
Expertise Seen as Lacking
Each agency must agree to every aid package, said a staff member on the House Select Committee on Hunger. And except for A.I.D., not one of the agencies has the expertise or manpower in the field, he said.
Under the Senate legislation, co-written by chairman Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and the ranking Republican member, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the Agency for International Development would have sole authority to make food gifts to the least-developed countries. Grants would be allocated according to per capita income, caloric intake and the mortality rate among children under 5 years of age.
The Department of Agriculture would be responsible for the credit-sales program, which provides low-interest loans to countries that are poor but not facing starvation.
The President would also have a $100 million discretionary fund to assist newly emerging democracies.
The bill was approved by a unanimous vote in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 11. It moves next to the the House floor as part of the 1990 Farm Bill. Debate by the House and the Senate is expected in late summer.

HEADLINE: Kenyan Human-Rights Lawyer Urges Economic Sanctions by U.S.

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
A prominent Kenyan human rights lawyer has called on the United States to press for democratic changes in Kenya by imposing economic sanctions similar to those in effect against South Africa.
The lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, who took refuge in the United States Embassy in Nairobi during a political crackdown three weeks ago, has come to this country to pursue his quest for multiparty democracy in Kenya.
Mr. Kuria said the United States should use its foreign policy to encourage the emergence of democracy in Kenya and other African countries.
''From my understanding of the situation in Kenya and much of Africa, the dictators are not going to respond to reason,'' he said. ''Therefore the United States and other Western governments should impose the kind of economic sanctions which forced South Africa to take the first steps toward democracy.'' 
Mr. Kuria specifically urged Washington to suspend next year's $53 million aid program to Kenya ''until fundamental democratic changes are introduced.'' Congress recently suspended about $13 million of this year's $45 million allocation to Kenya.
He also called on American tourists to postpone visits to Kenya, saying their presence and money ''props up the oppressive regime.'' Tourism is Kenya's leading source of foreign exchange.
A recipient of the 1988 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, Mr. Kuria criticized Western nations for their apparent reluctance to intervene on human rights questions in Africa out of ''some kind of colonial guilt complex.''
He was even critical of Nelson Mandela, who in a recent visit with President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said the West had no moral standing to press African countries to make democratic reforms. ''By playing to the white guilt complex, Mandela appeared to support dictators in general and Moi in particular,'' the lawyer said.
Mr. Kuria was interviewed on Thursday in the mid-Manhattan office of Africa Watch, a private human-rights monitoring organization that has reported serious rights violations in Kenya. He was accompanied by his law partner, Kiraitu Murungi, who also went into exile during the crackdown.
 
Plans to Study and Teach
Until government changes in Kenya enable him to return, Mr. Kuria plans to spend six months teaching and studying at Harvard and six months at Yale. ''I want to identify the reasons why Kenya's 1963 democratic Constitution permitted the emergence of a dictatorship and how human rights can be protected in a reformed constitution,'' he said.
Mr. Kuria, who has angered the Kenyan authorities by his attacks on the one-party system in The Nairobi Law Monthly, said the failure of one-party rule in Eastern Europe has accelerated the movement for political pluralism in Africa. Algeria, Somalia, Ethiopia, Benin, Gabon, Zaire, Angola and Tanzania have accepted the principle of pluralism, he said.
He said African nationalists in the 1960's had been fascinated with the Eastern European political model and had imported it, calling it African socialism. ''Proponents of the system have made great economic gains and will not give up their vested interests easily,'' he added.
He rejected the arguments of many African leaders that multiparty systems would fuel tribalism. Kenya has more than 40 tribes, he said, and any leader aspiring to power ''must appeal to interests beyond the tribe.''
He urged the Nairobi Government to free all political detainees, including the two former Cabinet ministers, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, who have led the campaign for multiparty democracy.
Mr. Kuria, a stocky 43-year-old, said he went into hiding after the arrest of the two ministers, who had been his clients. On July 7, when he learned that officers of the Special Branch security police were waiting for him at his office, at his home and at the courthouse, he decided to seek protection in the United States Embassy.
 
U.S. 'Most Understanding'
American officials, who have had their own problems with President Moi's Government recently, were ''most understanding,'' Mr. Kuria said. He said negotiations for his departure were rapid because both sides felt that a prolonged stay would ''heighten the strain in relations'' between the two countries. He arrived in this country with a United States travel document, good for one year, with humanitarian parole status.
Mr. Kuria has been active in human rights since 1982, when his law firm began defending dissidents. In that year, the Constitution was amended to make Kenya a one-party state and since then, he said, there has been a progressive erosion of the rule of law.
In 1987, he was detained for 10 months after he sued the Government on behalf of three political prisoners who he said had been tortured and illegally detained. He was released only after an international campaign on his behalf, but could not come to the United States to accept the Kennedy award because his passport had been confiscated.
In his latest feud with the authorities, Mr. Kuria contends that the Government rigged elections in the influential Law Society of Kenya.

Across New York Bay, A Place With No Future

 BODY:
Standing in his workshop amid leather hides and metal hand tools, a man in a white linen shirt, worn blue work pants and hand-made shoes explains how he earns his daily bread: ''There are mostly farmers on Staten Island, not like the rich folks in Manhattan, so I make mostly farm shoes.'' He says he has never heard of refinements like left shoes and right shoes.
Of course he has, but scenes like that are frequent at Richmondtown Restoration, where 18th- and 19th-century life on Staten Island is recreated. It is a historic village with 30 buildings, some on their original sites, some transported to the village, and all are meant to preserve and display three centuries of Staten Island history. 
At Richmondtown Restoration, visitors wander through the village exploring the buildings (half are being restored and not yet open to the public) and are greeted by people in period costume describing how they live and work.
 
Petticoats to Queen Anne's Cake
A woman in petticoats shows the quilt and needlepoint she is working on. A tinsmith creates pitchers, plates, lamps, pails and other common 18th-century household items. A young man demonstrates the process of carding to spinning to reeling yarn, while another uses the heat of a fireplace and a reflective oven to make Queen Anne's cake.
The restoration is run jointly by the Staten Island Historical Society and New York City, and the society began the project in 1939. What became Richmondtown itself was established by the Dutch as Cocclestown, a farmers' center, in the 1690's. By the 1730's it was Staten Island's main village and political center, and the seat of the Richmond government until 1898. The Third County Courthouse, built in the Greek Revival style, houses the visitors' center. The oldest building on the site is Voorlezer's House, dated 1695, a Reformed Dutch Church elementary school, church and minister's home.
The County Clerk's and Surrogate's office now houses a historical museum offering exhibitions of Staten Island economic and social life from the first settlers till today. Special activities abound, like the 19th-century feast today for those who have reserved a place.
 
Meeting Farm Animals
On Wednesday afternoons in July and August, children 5 to 12 years of age can take part in the ''Little Folks Program'' with their parents. They'll learn how to make toys, churn butter and shuck corn, and meet farm animals from the Staten Island Zoo. The admission fee is $4 per child per session, or $14 for a four-part series. The adults are admitted free.
A Trades and Talents series, Saturdays and Sundays Aug. 4-19, presents candlemaking, shoemaking and dressmaking. Admission to the demonstrations is included in the entrance fee.
Visitors will find sandwiches and soft drinks sold on the restoration grounds, or they can use picnic tables near the visitors' parking area. A museum store sells quilts and tinware made by the Richmondtown craftspeople.
The restoration is open Monday through Friday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and on Saturday and Sunday from 1 to 5 P.M. Admission is $4 for adults, $2.50 for students and those in their 60's, children and young people 6 to 18 years of age. Children under 6 are admitted free. There are memberships available which provide free admission. For information and reservations call (718) 351-9414.
 
Getting There
For bus riders: After taking the Staten Island Ferry from lower Manhattan, take the S74 to Richmond Road and Court Place in the middle of the Restoration area. Up the hill is the Courthouse Visitors Center.
For motorists: Turn left out of the ferry terminal into Bay Street. Follow Bay Street about two miles, and make a right turn into Vanderbilt Avenue. At the fourth traffic light, bear left onto Richmond Road. After about five miles, turn left into St. Patrick's Place and follow the signs to the Richmond Restoration.
From the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge: Follow the New Jersey West Route to the Richmond Road/Clove Road Exit. Exit, proceed to the second light and turn left on St. Patrick Place. Follow the signs to the Richmond Restoration.
From the Bayonne Bridge: Exit at Goethals Bridge sign. Keep right and take the first exit, Richmond Avenue, and stay on it to Arthur Kill Road, where you turn left. At the fourth traffic light, turn right into Clarke Avenue and follow the signs to the Richmond Restoration.
From the Goethals Bridge: Take the Staten Island Expressway to Richmond Avenue, exit and turn left at stop sign, then right at light onto Richmond Avenue. Stay on it to Arthur Kill Road and at the fourth traffic light, turn right into Clarke Avenue and from there follow the signs to the Richmond Restoration.
From the Outerbridge Crossing: Take Richmond Parkway to the Richmond Ave. North exit. Turn right at the first light onto Arthur Kill Road, proceed to the fifth traffic light and turn right onto Clarke Ave. Follow signs to the Richmond Restoration.
 
AND SOMETHING EVER NEW
The 11th annual Richmond County Fair will be held at the restoration Sept. 1 and 2 from 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. The fair (which is not in the 19th-century tradition) draws than 20,000 people a year.
Special activities will include a judging of flowers and vegetables and a contest for baked goods, all brought by fairgoers. Entertainment will include a freckle contest, a dog race and a turtle race.
Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for those in their mid-60's and older, and $2 for children.

Opening in Poland: Observation Post For Researchers

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich.

 BODY:
While the recent upheavals in Eastern Europe have been watched with close attention here, most American academics are studying the transformations only from a distance. To help make first-hand observation easier, the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan is opening a branch office in Warsaw, in conjunction with the Polish Government and the University of Warsaw.
The project is the first such cooperative venture in the social and behavioral sciences between an American university and an Eastern European country, university officials said. 
 
Eastern European Base
''There have been collaborative ventures before, but this is unique in that it is the true joining of two institutions,'' said William Zimmerman, professor of political science at the University of Michigan and director of the institute's Internal Peace and Security Program.
The venture, to be called the Center for Social Research, will be housed on the University of Warsaw campus in a building donated by the Polish Ministry of National Education. The director of the Institute for Social Research, Robert B. Zajonc, said the center would be a base for studying social, political and economic change throughout Eastern Europe.
Other universities in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are expected to participate, Mr. Zimmerman said, adding that he was negotiating with the Institute of Sociological Research of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow regarding the possibility of the Soviet Union's joining in.
Samuel Barnes, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, said that while in Budapest recently talking with Hungarian professors interested in the project, he also spoke with academics from Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Poland about their desire to work with the center. Some Romanian scholars have also expressed interest in participating, he said.
Mr. Zimmerman said he expected about 15 scholars to initially work at the center, most of them Polish. Eventually, he said, an equal number of Polish and American social scientists could pursue research there.
Officials at the institute in Ann Arbor said they expected the Warsaw branch to open by October.
Mr. Zajonc, who left Poland in 1940, said he first discussed the idea of a social science center in March with a longtime friend, Janusz Grzelak, Poland's Deputy Minister of Education.
''Several factors came together to make this happen so quickly,'' Mr. Zajonc said. ''One, I was born in Poland. Two, I am director of I.S.R. and, three, I wanted to immediately exploit this unique opportunity to observe Poland as it actually changes.''
Several University of Michigan researchers already have projects in Poland, which will be continued under the new center's auspices. Among these are an analysis of intergenerational value shifts conducted by Prof. Ronald F. Inglehart, and a study of varying concepts of justice by a sociology professor, Duane F. Alwin.
Mr. Zimmerman said the development of entrepreneurial activity in Poland was a topic of particular interest, as well as the country's weak past environmental policies and pollution problems, and the Poles' response to new governmental institutions.
He added, ''Having our own office in Poland will expedite grant proposals and data analysis.'' Besides, he said, ''it is hard to conduct academic studies by fax machine.''

When Black Feminism Faces The Music, and the Music Is Rap

BYLINE: By MICHELE WALLACE; Michele Wallace is the author of ''Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman'' (Verso). Her book ''Invisibility Blues: From Pop to Theory'' will be published this year.

 BODY:
Like many black feminists, I look on sexism in rap as a necessary evil. In a society plagued by poverty and illiteracy, where young black men are as likely to be in prison as in college, rap is a welcome articulation of the economic and social frustrations of black youth.
In response to disappointments faced by poor urban blacks negotiating their future, rap offers the release of creative expression and historical continuity: it draws on precedents as diverse as jazz, reggae, calypso, Afro-Cuban, African and heavy-metal, and its lyrics include rudimentary forms of political, economic and social analysis.
But with the failure of our urban public schools, rappers have taken education into their own hands; these are oral lessons (reading and writing being low priorities). And it should come as no surprise that the end result emphasizes innovations in style and rhythm over ethics and morality. Although there are exceptions, like raps advocating world peace (the W.I.S.E. Guyz's ''Time for Peace'') and opposing drug use (Ice-T's ''I'm Your Pusher''), rap lyrics can be brutal, raw and, where women are the subject, glaringly sexist. 
Given the genre's current crossover popularity and success in the marketplace, including television commercials, rap's impact on young people is growing. A large part of the appeal of pop culture is that it can offer symbolic resolutions to life's contradictions. But when it comes to gender, rap has not resolved a thing.
Though styles vary - from that of the X-rated Ice-T to the sybaritic Kwanee to the hyperpolitics of Public Enemy - what seems universal is how little male rappers respect sexual intimacy and how little regard they have for the humanity of the black woman. Witness the striking contrast within rap videos: for men, standard attire is baggy outsize pants; for women, spike heels and short skirts. Videos often feature the ostentatious and fetishistic display of women's bodies. In Kool Moe Dee's ''How Ya Like Me Now,'' women gyrate in tight leather with large revealing holes. In Digital Underground's video ''Doowutchyalike,'' set poolside at what looks like a fraternity house party, a rapper in a clown costume pretends to bite the backside of a woman in a bikini.
As Trisha Rose, a black feminist studying rap, puts it, ''Rap is basically a locker room with a beat.''
The recent banning of the sale of 2 Live Crew's album ''As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' by local governments in Florida and elsewhere has publicized rap's treatment of women as sex objects, but it also made a hit of a record that contains some of the bawdiest lyrics in rap. Though such sexual explicitness in lyrics is rare, the assumptions about women - that they manipulate men with their bodies - are typical.
In an era when the idea that women want to be raped should be obsolete, rap lyrics and videos presuppose that women always desire sex, whether they know it or not. In Bell Biv DeVoe's rap-influenced pop hit single ''Poison,'' for instance, a beautiful girl is considered poison because she does not respond affirmatively and automatically to a sexual proposition.
Bell Hooks, author of ''Yearning: Race, Gender, Cultural Politics'' (Southend, 1990), sees the roots of rap as a youth rebellion against all attempts to control black masculinity, both in the streets and in the home. ''That rap would be anti-domesticity and in the process anti-female should come as no surprise,'' Ms. Hooks says.
At present there is only a small platform for black women to address the problems of sexism in rap and in their community. Feminist criticism, like many other forms of social analysis, is widely considered part of a hostile white culture. For a black feminist to chastise misogyny in rap publicly would be viewed as divisive and counterproductive. There is a widespread perception in the black community that public criticism of black men constitutes collaborating with a racist society.
The charge is hardly new. Such a reaction greeted Ntozake Shange's play ''For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf,'' my own essays, ''Black Macho and the Myth of the Superwoman,'' and Alice Walker's novel ''The Color Purple,'' all of which were perceived as critical of black men. After the release of the film version of ''The Color Purple,'' feminists were lambasted in the press for their supposed lack of support for black men; such critical analysis by black women has all but disappeared. In its place is ''A Black Man's Guide to the Black Woman,'' a vanity-press book by Shahrazad Ali, which has sold more than 80,000 copies by insisting that black women are neurotic, insecure and competitive with black men.
Though misogynist lyrics seem to represent the opposite of Ms. Ali's world view, these are, in fact, just two extremes on the same theme: Ms. Ali's prescription for what ails the black community is that women should not question men about their sexual philandering, and should be firmly slapped across the mouth when they do. Rap lyrics suggest just about the same: women should be silent and prone.
There are those who have wrongly advocated censorship of rap's more sexually explicit lyrics, and those who have excused the misogyny because of its basis in black oral traditions.
Rap is rooted not only in the blaxploitation films of the 60's but also in an equally sexist tradition of black comedy. In the use of four-letter words and explicit sexual references, both Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, who themselves drew upon the earlier examples of Redd Foxx, Pigmeat Markham and Moms Mabley, are conscious reference points for the 2 Live Crew. Black comedy, in turn, draws on an oral tradition in which black men trade ''toasts,'' stories in which dangerous bagmen and trickster figures like Stackolee and Dolomite sexually exploit women and promote violence among men. The popular rapper Ice Cube, in the album ''Amerikkka's Most Wanted,'' is Stackolee come to life. In ''The Nigga Ya Love to Hate,'' he projects an image of himself as a criminal as dangerous to women as to the straight white world.
Rap remains almost completely dominated by black males and this mind-set. Although women have been involved in rap since at least the mid-80's, record companies have only recently begun to promote them. And aswomen rapperslike Salt-n-Pepa, Monie Love, M. C. Lyte, L. A. Star and Queen Latifah slowly gain more visibility, rap's sexism may emerge as a subject for scrutiny. Indeed, the answer may lie with women, expressing in lyrics and videos the tensions between the sexes in the black community.
Today's women rappers range from a high ground that doesn't challenge male rap on its own level (Queen Latifah) to those who subscribe to the same sexual high jinks as male rappers (Oaktown's 3.5.7). M. C. Hammer launched Oaktown's 3.5.7., made up of his former backup dancers. These female rappers manifest the worst-case scenario: their skimpy, skintight leopard costumes in the video of ''Wild and Loose (We Like It)'' suggest an exotic animalistic sexuality. Their clothes fall to their ankles. They take bubble baths. Clearly, their bodies are more important than rapping. And in a field in which writing one's own rap is crucial, their lyrics are written by their former boss, M. C. Hammer.
Most women rappers constitute the middle ground: they talk of romance, narcissism and parties. On the other hand, Salt-n-Pepa on ''Shake Your Thang'' uses the structure of the 1969 Isley Brothers song ''It's Your Thing'' to insert a protofeminist rap response: ''Don't try to tell me how to party. It's my dance and it's my body.'' M. C. Lyte, in a dialogue with Positive K on ''I'm Not Havin' It,'' comes down hard on the notion that women can't say no and criticizes the shallowness of the male rap.
Queen Latifah introduces her video, ''Ladies First,'' performed with the English rapper Monie Love, with photographs of black political heroines like Winnie Mandela, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman and Angela Davis. With a sound that resembles scat as much as rap, Queen Latifah chants ''Stereotypes they got to go'' against a backdrop of newsreel footage of the apartheid struggle in South Africa. The politically sophisticated Queen Latifah seems worlds apart from the adolescent, buffoonish sex orientation of most rap. In general, women rappers seem so much more grown up. Can they inspire a more beneficent attitude toward sex in rap? What won't subvert rap's sexism is the actions of men; what will is women speaking in their own voice, not just in artificial female ghettos, but with and to men.
 
'LADIES FIRST'
 This excerpt is from the single ''Ladies First'' by the rap singer Queen Latifah.
 
Believe me when I say being a woman is great you see
 I know that all the fellas out there will agree with me
 Not for being one but for being with one
 Cause when it's time for loving it's the woman that gives some
 Strong stepping strutting moving on
 Rhyming cutting but not forgetting
 We are the ones to give birth
 To the new generation of prophets
 Cause it's ladies first
 I break into lyrical freestyle
 Grab the mike, look at the crowd and see smiles
 Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
 Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
 Some think that we can't flow can't flow!
 Stereotypes they got to go got to go!
 I'm gonna mess around and flip the scene into reverse
 With what
 With a little touch of ladies first
 Oh ladies first, ladies first

'WILD AND LOOSE'
 Here is an excerpt from the single ''Wild and Loose (We Like It)'' by the rap group Oaktown's 3.5.7.
 
 Step. You got to step.
 C'mon and grease with ease and make your body melt.
 Till it's felt that you've dealt all you had to deal.
 Get wild, get loose, break it down, do you feel, do you feel?
 I feel like I just got a boost cause the rhythm is funky and the bass is gettin' loose.
 Turn it up, burn it up, make your body twitch.
 It's time to get loose, how you know? I got that itch.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Spike Lee and the 'Slavery' of the Blues

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman, the author of ''Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students, and Their High School'' (Harper & Row), is writing a book about a black church in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
In one of the earliest sequences of ''Mo' Better Blues,'' Spike Lee's new film about jazz, the camera lingers almost lecherously over the womanly curves of a trumpet and saxophone. As simple as the shot seems at that moment, over the course of the movie it becomes a powerful and shifting metaphor, as Mr. Lee's concerns travel from romance to creativity to commerce and from satire to genuine tragedy.
At its most apparent level, ''Mo' Better Blues,'' opening Friday, is the story of a jazz musician so committed to his art that he drives away not one but two lovers. And from a haircut modeled on John Coltrane's to a style indebted to Miles Davis's, Bleek Gilliam (Denzel Washington) makes no secret of where his desire and devotion reside. ''I know what I want - my music,'' he puts it bluntly. ''Everything else is secondary.'' In its very creation as well as its plot, ''Mo' Better Blues'' amounts to a celebration of black talent by a director who has fostered and nurtured a great deal of it himself. But given Mr. Lee's characteristic astringence and social conscience, this is a celebration with a decidedly cautious subtext. Bleek seeks not simply musical expression but control over that expression and the livelihood it brings. His battles with bandmates, an ineffectual black manager and especially two cunning white club owners serve as a reminder that for much of America's history, its most brilliant black musicians have themselves been played like instruments by a predominantly white recording industry. 
''Musicians are low-priced slaves, whereas athletes and entertainers are high-priced slaves,'' Mr. Lee said in a recent interview in Brooklyn, his home and the setting for most of his films. ''It's their music, but it's not their nightclub, it's not their record company. They have an understanding only of the music, not of the business, so they get treated any old way. A lot of money can be made off black artists, and a lot of what racism is about is financial gain.''
Some black artists, like Count Basie, signed away publishing rights to compositions that ultimately earned millions of dollars in royalties. Some, like Bo Diddley and Big Joe Turner, found their signature sounds copied, slightly diluted, and finally repackaged as lucrative ''product'' for the rock-and-roll market. Mr. Lee saw the struggle embodied by his own father, Bill Lee, a bassist and composer in jazz, folk and classical settings.
''Even a musical genius like Bird would have to go out on tour without a band,'' Bill Lee wrote of Charlie Parker in an essay included with the published screenplay and production notes for ''Mo' Better Blues.'' ''Headliners had to pick up musicians in every city where they were booked. This cut down costs for their management and club owners. Ultimately it was a form of exploitation and disrespect. You couldn't perform at your best if you didn't know the cats you were playing with.''
Nor was Bill Lee himself immune from the fiscal gravity of jazz. An acoustic bass purist, he virtually lost his profession in the 1970's when the electric Fender became the instrument of choice in jazz ensembles, less for any musical reason than because its thumping tone suited the commercial sounds of jazz-rock fusion. It fell to his wife, Jacquelyn Shelton Lee, to take a teaching job to support their five children.
An early draft of ''Mo' Better Blues,'' in fact, contained a scene in which Bleek turns down a high-paying recording session with the singer Sade because he cannot accommodate his jazz classicism with her pop style. One scene that does appear in the finished film has Bleek Gilliam surveying the Japanese and German tourists in a nightclub and complaining: ''I'm sick and tired of playing for everybody but my own people. They don't come out. We don't support our own. If I had to rely on niggers to eat, I'd starve to death. Jazz is our music, but we don't support it. It's sad but true.''
''Everything I know about jazz, I got from my father,'' Spike Lee said. ''I saw his integrity, how he was not going to play just any kind of music, no matter how much money he could make.'' On the other hand, he went on, ''I couldn't agree with my father when he said, 'Money's not the question; I could have it or not have it.' An artist has to be a businessman today. Money means a lot. It equals power. If my films did not make the money they make, I couldn't make the demands I make. A studio knows I'll have final cut, I won't use John Williams for the soundtrack.''
For that matter, Mr. Lee said he had to resist pressures from CBS Records, which is releasing the soundtrack album of ''Mo' Better Blues,'' to mix a softened and sweetened version of the song ''Harlem Blues'' for mainstream radio airplay. The stakes have often been much larger. He publicly accused Columbia Pictures of promoting ''School Daze,'' his satire of a black college, only feebly, and the film became Columbia's largest-grossing release of 1988. He moved ''Do the Right Thing'' from Paramount to Universal rather than comply with demands that he change its climactic scenes of a racial killing and an ensuing riot. ''They wanted Sal and Mookie,'' he said of the Italian pizzeria owner and black delivery man who were the film's antagonists, ''to hug each other and sing 'We Are the World.' ''
The single-minded Bleek Gilliam, then, recalls Spike Lee and his peers in the jazz world like Wynton and Branford Marsalis as much he does Bill Lee and the earlier generations of jazz musicians. Bleek stands even farther apart from the jazz musicians portrayed in recent films written and directed by whites. Far from being the dependent, pathetic savants of Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's ''Bird'' and Dale Turner in Bertrand Tavernier's ''Round Midnight,'' Bleek shows that artistic creation derives from rigor and discipline. His sole flaw, albeit a pivotal one in the film's plot, is his allegiance to the childhood friend, played by Mr. Lee, who is his manager.
''You didn't see the genius of the musicians in 'Bird' and 'Round Midnight,' '' Mr. Lee said. ''Not the way you saw it in 'Amadeus,' much of a jerk as Mozart seemed to be. So I wanted to show a man who could make decisions, who had a family life, who wasn't a drug addict or an alcoholic. And I wanted to show these guys practicing. Wynton Marsalis practices six hours a day. It's not just a natural ability.''
Mr. Lee has brought a similar efficiency and craft to his own genre of film making. Within four years, he has released as many feature films, writing, directing and acting in each. And the first three - ''She's Gotta Have It,'' ''School Daze'' and ''Do the Right Thing'' - have not only won largely positive reviews but have reaped sizable profits. With a budget of $9.9 million, ''Mo' Better Blues'' represents Mr. Lee's most costly effort, but one well within Hollywood's bargain basement.
Besides economy and success, the films share an evolving ensemble on both sides of the camera. Mr. Lee is quick to dispute the idea that personal loyalty figures largely in his selection of cast and crew, even to the point of dropping the term ''tyrant'' and telling a pink-slip anecdote or two. Yet when he talks about the New York Knickerbockers 1970 championship team as the model of selflessness and stability, it is clear what a premium he places on those values.
Three of the supporting players in ''Mo' Better Blues'' - Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn and Joie Lee - have appeared in Mr. Lee's earlier films and even a few of his student projects, first at Morehouse College in Atlanta and then in New York University's graduate program. Mr. Lee's co-producer, Monty Ross, first met him as a fellow freshman at Morehouse 15 years ago. Among the other crew members whom Mr. Lee calls the ''key cogs'' are Ernest Dickerson, the director of photography; Wynn Thomas, the production designer; Robi Reed, the casting director, and John Kilik, the line producer. ''Mo' Better Blues'' also provides a high-profile debut for Cynda Williams, who plays the aspiring jazz vocalist romantically involved with Bleek Gilliam.
''Spike's approach is to treat us like family, not employees,'' Mr. Ross said, ''and each of us is a professional because of this family. You get a chance to really expand on your craft with Spike. Even if you work on a Scorsese movie or a De Palma movie, you'll learn some things, but as a young black you'll work as a third or a fourth. Here, you'll be a first. You'll be in charge. You'll be responsible to Spike as a production head. Here, Ernest Dickerson is a director of photography. Without 40 Acres and a Mule,'' he said, referring to Mr. Lee's production company, he'd be hustling to be a camera operator.''
For actors, Mr. Lee has offered deep and varied roles. Bill Nunn, for instance, has gone in three films from a college jock in ''School Daze'' to the malevolent Radio Raheem in ''Do the Right Thing'' to the gentle bass player Bottom Hammer in ''Mo' Better Blues.'' Over those same three films, Mr. Esposito has successively donned the characters of fraternity nabob, streetcorner radical and affected pianist, with the latter role written specifically for him.
''What's good about working with people you've been with before,'' Mr. Esposito said, ''is that you have a camaraderie instead of a competition. In the real - or maybe it's unreal - world of film, actors are worried about how many lines they have, where they fit into the film. On Spike's films, we're concerned about the film as a whole.''
More than opportunity or even friendship binds Mr. Lee's longtime collaborators. Mr. Esposito recalls that when he first met Mr. Lee in the early 1980's, and the future director was cleaning films at a distributorship, ''You could see he had a vision.'' Joie Lee, tied to Mr. Lee as both actress and sister, used the adjective ''focused.'' That vision has been focused upon the abundant black life that exists between the Cosby show and the crack house, the sort of life that rarely merits headlines, much less feature films.
''The pride comes in retrospect,'' Joie Lee said. ''When you're making the film, you're living in the moment. But when I look back at the body of work, the thing is that Spike's not just making films; he's creating history. Besides breaking down the doors for black film makers and artists, he's shown the world a new perspective on black life. He's given stories and slices of life; he's addressed issues that have been unaddressed or ignored. The people on the street see themselves in these films.''
 
SUCCESS STORY
Last July, a 24-year-old restaurant hostess named Cynda Williams, a picture and resume tucked in her bag, walked into a Manhattan studio for her first feature film audition. Four weeks later, Robi Reed, the casting director of ''Mo' Better Blues,'' and the film maker Spike Lee watched Ms. Williams make her final effort as a candidate.
Welcoming the end of an exhausting month, she left the studio quickly and returned to her apartment. Just as she entered, the phone rang. Mr. Lee, sounding a little exasperated, urged her to come back to the studio. Denzel Washington met her at the door with what he called good news and bad news. The bad news, said Mr. Washington with a laugh, was that her feet were too big; the good news was that Ms. Williams had won the role of Clarke Bentancourt, an aspiring jazz singer from the Midwest.
Ms. Williams was raised on the South Side of Chicago, where, in school and church choirs, she established herself as a singer. Ten years ago, after her family moved to Muncie, Ind., she took an interest in acting. Encouraged by a drama teacher, she began playing roles like Nancy in ''Oliver'' and the title role of ''Evita.''
Next she earned a theater degree at Ball State University in Muncie, and also appeared in nightclubs before her graduation in 1988, when she moved to New York.
Now that her film career has been launched, she says, ''I want to have longevity. I don't want to just disappear.'' - Shawn von Schreiber

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS;
Manchester's Pop Music: Escapism Without Escape

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Blobby light-show shapes flicker and wobble on a screen. Musicians, scruffy in blue jeans or gaudy in flower-patterned shirts, play their instruments and shamble around the stage. Onstage and off, people flail the air in hippie dances. But amid all the appearances of a festive 1960's revival, the lyrics (if any) are often grim, while the beat is likely to be pumped out by a drum machine.
Those are the contradictory signals coming out of the industrial city of Manchester, England, the center of a late-1980's British pop phenomenon. At a club called the Hacienda, opened in 1982 by Tony Wilson (whose company, Factory Records, brought Manchester's Joy Division and New Order to the world a decade ago), thousands of people turn out for all-night dance parties, known as ''raves,'' often fueled by the drug Ecstasy, an amphetamine variant. Disk jockeys, live bands and half-canned electronic hybrids keep people in motion amid the accouterments of a 1960's happening, from strobe lights to bell-bottom pants. ''Raves'' have spread across Britain and Europe. 
Some Manchester bands - particularly Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, which both released debut albums in the United States in 1989 - have become nationwide hit makers in the United Kingdom (so much so that Britain's hipper-than-thou music papers are starting to declare that the Manchester scene has peaked). The obvious next step is to export the music across the Atlantic.
American listeners can now sample Manchester bands on new recordings: 808 State's ''United State 90'' (Tommy Boy 1033; all three formats), A Guy Called Gerald's ''Automanikk'' (Columbia 46770; all three formats), Adamski's ''Liveandirect'' (MCA 6454; all three formats) and Inspiral Carpets' EP, ''Cool As'' (Mute/Rough Trade DUNG 9; all three formats), and album, ''Life'' (Cow/Mute British import DUNG 8; all three formats; with a planned fall release in the United States). There are also two recent releases by Happy Mondays, ''Hallelujah,'' an EP of four new songs and three remixes (Elektra 60945; CD and cassette only), and a 12-inch single, ''Step On'' (Elektra ED 5469).
When music arises from a small local scene, there's no guarantee that it will travel well, or that it will mean the same things elsewhere. Onstage in New York this month at the Sound Factory, Happy Mondays didn't translate: Shaun Ryder's flat, offhand vocals, Mark Day's watery guitar vamps, the pounding riffs of Paul Ryder on bass and Gaz Whelan (plus a machine) on drums, and the floppy-limbed, glassy-eyed dancing of Bez (a full-fledged band member) seem as alien to an American observer as they seem welcoming and homey to regular Manchester fans. The music is more sullen than celebratory. Manchester's music speaks to local conditions in a rainy, decaying factory city with a large blue-collar population. On ''Life,'' Inspiral Carpets, who revive the organ-driven garage rock of the Seeds, aim for working-class realism: ''He prays each night that his family's all right and he's got work.'' In ''Clap Your Hands'' on Happy Mondays' ''Hallelujah'' EP, Mr. Ryder sings about getting ''a small raise,'' while ''Hallelujah'' itself is a manifesto of lowered expectations: ''just here to raise your feet from the maze.'' ''Step On,'' based on John Kongos's 1970 song ''He's Gonna Step on You Again,'' twangs and chants a message of paranoia and oppression.
At the end of the 1970's, Manchester bands like the Fall, Throbbing Gristle and especially Joy Division developed music with a brutal, static beat and a sense of hopelessness; New Order, formed by members of Joy Division after the band's lead singer committed suicide, keeps its despair at a slightly ironic remove behind deadpan vocals and music that's both surging and sinister. New Order has found international popularity; there's no shortage of alienated, cultish listeners. Where basic punk black is the wardrobe for New Order and its followers, the new Manchester music arrives in an explosion of flower patterns and Day-Glo colors; its trappings evoke every hedonistic pop style from psychedelia to disco. The open drug use - ''marijuana keeps that smile upon my face,'' sings Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays - is another kind of escapism (and one that might not migrate to the United States in the just-say-no era). While Stone Roses, who stand slightly apart from the rest of the Manchester bands, write concise folk-rock songs, the other groups depend on the trippy combination of a drone and an unstoppable beat, whether they rely on post-disco synthesizers (808 State, Adamski, A Guy Called Gerald) or guitar (Happy Mondays) or organ (Inspiral Carpets).
But the new Manchester music offers escapism without escape, a euphoria that comes to a bleak end on Monday morning. The psychedelia of the 60's was music of rebellious hope, convinced that a new world was in the making. Manchester's music arrived in the same costumes, but it can hope for nothing more than a few hours of forgetfulness. It's psychedelia turned dystopian; no wonder Happy Mondays' 1989 album is called ''Bummed.'' The rock bands sing depressive tidings, too pessimistic to hope that protest would do any good; the synthesizer bands' drum-machine beat is not simply propulsive but ominous, mechanical, relentless, even more so than the disco music of the late 1970's.
Inspiral Carpets are Manchester's truest 1960's revivalists. Their riffs are ground out on what sounds like a cheap 1960's-style combo organ; the drums are pounded by hand. Although the band members cite influences like Sonic Youth and rap music, a listener would never know it; the band re-creates the old-fashioned momentum of a garage band, as if it were playing songs the Seeds or Question Mark and the Mysterians never got around to recording. ''Cool As'' includes four short singles (''Out of Time'' is best) about romantic and existential frustration and a 16-minute workout on ''Planecrash'' that could have been recorded at the Fillmore.
A Guy Called Gerald, led by Gerald Simpson, and Adamski both crank out tapocketa-pocketa rhythm tracks that club disk jockeys will find useful. Adamski favors buzzing, pogo-stick keyboard riffs, while A Guy Called Gerald features a vocalist, Viv, who suggests a latter-day Donna Summer. She sings about being powerless - against the beat, against emotions, against undefined forces.
The clear standout among Manchester's electronic bands is the primarily instrumental 808 State. Most of its songs use the deep, piston rhythms of house music and top them with Manchester's most imaginative sonic vocabulary - not just electronic plinks and zingers, but cool pop-jazz melodies, exotic-sounding bells and flutes and layer upon layer of riffs and cross-rhythms, floating and stomping. Where the other bands dress psychedelic and play disco, 808 State combines them into an aural fantasy that can survive if it's removed from the dance floor.
Manchester bands are going to have to make their ways individually in the United States. There is no scene here to support them, since dance clubs concentrate on house and rap music, and working-class fans prefer more conventional rock. But the dedication of Manchester fans and the spread of their music show that even in hard times people will find reason to dance. Right now, from across the Atlantic, Manchester's music sounds peculiar; an American recession could make it sound prophetic.

HEADLINE: The Rocky Road to HDTV

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Lure of Digital Television'' (June 24) hinges on the idea that ''the technology could set the stage for the evolution of HDTV from passive television to an interactive medium.'' Indeed, technological innovation has been and will continue to be an essential element in the successful development of a widely used interactive medium. However, it is not technology but economics that has delayed the acceptance of interactive television and home data services.
Interactive television via analog cable television and interactive data via the telephone network were introduced more than a decade ago. Today, homeowners spend substantial sums for entertainment like movies and sports); but home banking, home ticketing and other such interactive services have never been financially successful. Unless technology provides people with valued services at a fair price, a more elegant and rugged digital delivery system will not alter consumer acceptance.

HEADLINE: How Many Bosses Does It Take . . . To Mange One Worker?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree with Professor Richard Rosecrance that there are too many chiefs in American organizations and with his suggestion that Japanese companies are doing better than American companies because the percentage of managers is lower in Japan than in the United States.
One important point should be added to the discussion about American businesses. In America, the basic attitude toward work is negative. Most white- and blue-collar workers do not view work as pleasurable. Work is simply a means to obtain more toys to use in leisure time. In general, Japanese workers are extremely dedicated to their companies and find work more desirable than leisure time. In fact, some workers are so averse to taking vacations that companies must actually force them to take a week or two off from work.
In addition, the normal working day for a Japanese is 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. Some even work on Saturdays. American workers, however, have the 9-to-5 mindset. Those who are the exceptions reach the upper echelons of management in a short period of time.
Just consider the Leviathan task it would be to change the mindset and work week of the American worker. But that is what it would take to have a ''long-term economic resurgence.''

HEADLINE: The Networks' New Advertising Dance

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Viewers of the new television series ''Northern Exposure'' on CBS Thursday evening could hardly miss the striking scenery and the quirky mooseburger meals depicted in the saga of a young New York doctor acclimating to a rugged Alaskan town.
Only a brand-name whiz, though, would have realized that half the parade of commercials - Crest, Downy, Head & Shoulders, Folgers, Pringle's Potato Chips, Tide, Oil of Olay, Pepto-Bismol - came from one source: the Procter & Gamble Company. That was no coincidence.
In a deal struck with CBS, Procter & Gamble had agreed to foot part of the production expenses and buy half the commercials in exchange for a minority ownership stake in the program. This unusual experiment is one of the latest signs of the partnerships being forged between advertisers and major networks, arrangements that vaguely harken back to the early ''Golden Age'' of television, when the advertising community was virtually indistinguishable from the networks. 
Clearly, the romance is back. After years of agitated relations in the marriage between the networks and advertisers, the beleaguered networks are increasingly courting makers of canned peas and of crackers by flashing inventive ways to make expensive network commercials worth more.
Beset by dwindling audiences and brutal competition, the networks have been transforming themselves from lackadaisical order bookers to panting salesmen. They are doing things like mall tours in connection with advertisers, special segments on regular shows keyed to themes of keen interest to sponsors and joint sweepstakes with retailers and fast-food chains doling out millions of dollars in prizes. In rare instances, they are agreeing to plant products in episodes of prime-time shows, and considering having stars of shows plug merchandise. Cognizant of the shifting sands, large sponsors are pushing the networks to accept more programs produced - or co-produced - by advertisers. Can the return of the ''Goodyear TV Playhouse'' be far behind?
 
Just Trying to Help
 ''We're trying to be advertiser friendly,'' said Larry Hoffner, executive vice president of network sales at NBC. ''We're trying to find out what advertisers wish to accomplish and trying to help them.''
Jerry Dominus, head of sales at CBS, added: ''We are finding extra ways for advertisers to get more out of their sponsorship than sending us a commercial and we run it, thank you very much.''
There are those who fret, however, that this enhanced cooperation bodes ill for programming, and may ultimately blur the lines between programs and commercials. ''The weakening of the networks will no doubt make them prey to more advertiser control of program content,'' said Michael Schudson, professor of communications and sociology at the University of California at San Diego.
Just how much the promotional efforts accomplish, particularly in winning lasting viewers for new series, is questionable as well. ''Last year was not the best year for new shows on network television,'' admitted John Miller, NBC's senior vice president of marketing, advertising and promotion. ''It really boils down to good shows.''
And how far the faltering networks will now go to revive the days of old will depend in part on how much power programming executives are willing to relinquish and how well sales forces are able to balance the needs of competing advertisers.
In television's infancy, power was heavily centered with advertisers, who supplied most of the shows and named many of them after themselves. But as television prospered, the networks took command of programming and adopted an almost cavalier attitude toward sponsors.
At this point, more ideas are being bandied about than actually implemented. ''Something is happening, but the habits and emotions are so well entrenched that it will take a while for a lot to happen,'' said Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive of the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles advertising agency.
Advertisers and their agencies are clearly eager for more to happen. Mr. Bostock, for example, preaches an exceedingly focused view of the core purpose of network television. ''I think the networks need to define their business as delivering audiences to advertisers,'' he said. ''That's how they generate their revenues. And the networks have generally not thought in that way. But they did think that way in the 1950's.''
 
A Bullish Sign
To be sure, this new era of cooperation may only go part of the way toward rescuing the networks. ''It's an anchor in the storm of continuing slipping audiences,'' said John Reidy, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. He noted, however, that the three networks in their advance ''upfront'' sales for the 1990-91 season have achieved surprising price increases in the vicinity of 8 to 9 percent. ''So something that they're doing is contributing to a strong upfront market,'' he said.
The ways in which the networks are accommodating advertisers are taking myriad forms, with fresh derivations being constantly formulated.
Over the last two years, ABC has run a series of theme weeks on ''Good Morning America'' designed to attract new advertisers. During these weeks, the show incorporates a five-part series wedded to a single theme and then sells time to advertisers making products related to the theme.
In an added twist, during a recent parenting theme week, ABC promoted a phone number viewers could call for further information and to obtain coupon packages featuring the sponsors' products. ABC said the device has enabled it to lure a number of new advertisers, including Kodak, Chubb and Kimberly-Clark, and the network gets a premium of $25,000 from each sponsor.
On another front, ABC News has just begun creating videocassettes based on files in the sizable film archives - ''Royalty Around the World,'' ''Behind Kremlin Walls'' - it is trying to peddle to advertisers, who might hand them out as premiums or insert commercials in them and then sell them to customers. It said early interest has been substantial.
 
Geoffrey's Secret Word
 In return for Toys ''R'' Us doubling its spending on Saturday morning shows for the coming season, NBC structured a four-week promotion, ''Geoffrey's Secret Word Game,'' in which customers will be able to pick up game cards at Toys ''R'' Us and then need to watch an NBC show to listen for secret words.
In another unusual action, NBC signed a deal estimated to be worth more than $500 million in commercial time over three years with the General Motors Corporation, giving NBC a guaranteed level of revenue from the car maker and granting G.M. assurance of having commercial spots within shows it desires and a firmer fix on costs.
By buying a large quantity of ads on CBS sports programming, a small group of advertisers - including American Telephone and Telegraph, Visa, Nike and Sears - received places in a CBS promotional tour that began in April and is visiting shopping malls in 27 cities. In the fall, the network will stage a 50-campus college tour for Isuzu Motors and L'Oreal promoting ''The Young and the Restless'' soap opera.
Some of the new efforts are trespassing on long-forbidden territory. For Coca-Cola, CBS and the producer of the series ''TV 101'' agreed to the rare step of displaying a Coke machine in episodes of the show in return for Coke buying more than the normal amount of commercial time. As it happened, the series, Coke machine and all, failed. Such placements, although pervasive in movies, are tricky on television, because they outrage makers of competing products. ''Pepsi, for instance, wouldn't go in 'TV 101,' '' said Mr. Dominus of CBS. ''That's the downside of fooling around in this area.'' But almost anything is undoubtedly possible at the right price. The networks say they are becoming more open-minded about the notion of ''cast commercials,'' in which characters in series would perform pitches for a product during commercial breaks. One big hitch is what price to charge for such plugs, since the cast has to be compensated, too.
Cast commercials have been in disfavor in television for many years, though they were commonplace decades ago. Captain Kangeroo, for instance, used to promote Schwinn bicycles while he entertained children on his morning show.
''This hasn't happened in the medium for years,'' said Mr. Dominus. ''We've talked to some advertisers about it and it could be worked out. Yet it would probably involve a lot of investment.'' Many of these value-added techniques are aimed at recapturing promotion dollars. The bulk of the marketing budgets of most advertisers is spent on promotional activities - contests, discount coupons, direct mail and the like - rather than conventional advertising, and much of that promotion money has been siphoned out of television. Thus, the networks are trying to persuade advertisers that television can assist in these promotions.
Both CBS and NBC have linked themselves with major chains to push their new fall shows at the same time that the chains get network exposure. Last year, CBS ran a sweepstakes that was advertised through K Mart, and the promotion will be repeated this September. NBC, meanwhile, did a promotion last year with Sears that produced mixed results. For this September, it has signed up with McDonald's to do a ''McMillions on NBC'' campaign that will give away $35 million over 28 days in September and October.
In hope of developing additional customized arrangements for sponsors, Mr. Miller of NBC is finishing the organization of teams that will shortly fan out and call on the top 100 network advertisers to specify the portfolio of things the network can do for them.
 
Highly Motivated
Certainly, the networks have never appeared to be more open to change. Hobbled by a continuing loss of viewers to cable, the speedily-growing Fox Broadcasting Company, syndicated shows, independent stations and home video, the major networks have watched their share of audience tumble from some 90 percent in the late 1970's to around 65 percent last season.
Magnifying their woes was the startling report by the A. C. Nielsen Company that in recent months millions of people seem to have abandoned watching television altogether. The three major networks have since announced plans to alter the way they validate audience sizes to advertisers because of their lack of faith in the Nielsen numbers.
In recent years, advertising spending on the networks has hardly even kept up with economic growth. Last year, spending was off seven-tenths of 1 percent, according to Robert Coen, director of forecasting at the McCann-Erickson ad agency, and he projects an increase of just 5.5 percent in 1990, to $9.6 billion.
 
Long-Term Worries
Although all the networks were profitable last year, they have to worry in the long term about how to increase revenues while audiences shrink. ''The big question everyone is asking is, 'How can we be of mutual benefit to one another?' '' said Michael Moore, the media director at D'Arcy.
In many respects, though, the networks are still rookies in conceiving fresh marketing ideas. As Philip Guarascio, head of advertising at G.M., put it, ''Frankly, I think we're far more sophisticated than the networks in these things. And so they have to play catch-up.''
One of the more curious changes taking place - albeit a small factor in terms of total programming hours - is the slowly growing popularity of advertiser-generated shows. Although P.&G. has long produced daytime soap operas to peddle its suds - it currently does three - advertisers have had little say in the production end of prime-time programming.
For years, large advertisers like A.T.&T., G.M., Hallmark and General Foods, along with their agencies, have produced their own movies and specials and then bought the time to put them on prime-time schedules, usually through tough bargaining with the networks. Network programming people in particular have not been overly anxious to take them, though advertisers report that the networks are getting less chilly.
''This is still in its infancy in modern times,'' said Robert Cagliero, ABC's vice president of special program sales. ''But it has increased markedly in the last few years.''
As one sign of the increased interest, D'Arcy last week created a new position of director of broadcast programming to help develop ideas for programs for D'Arcy clients.
Like others, Mr. Miller of NBC acknowledged that the efforts to improve advertiser relations are still in their early stages. ''But the mood has changed,'' he said. ''We are making it clear that we are interested in talking to advertisers. We're regular people just like they are. They can pick up the phone and call us.''
 
DURING THE 'GOLDEN AGE'
In the ''Golden Age'' of television, during the 1950's, the relationship between advertisers and the networks was the very definition of cozy.
During this time, as Stephen Fox points out in his book, ''The Mirror Makers: A History of American Advertising and Its Creators,'' the ''lines were blurred between ad agencies and TV networks. Many top executives shuttled back and forth between the two, changing jobs but using the same skills and contacts.''
Most television programs were produced by agencies for a single sponsor. Fittingly, the shows routinely carried the names of the advertisers: ''Texaco Star Theater,'' ''Goodyear TV Playhouse,'' ''Kraft Television Theater.'' The sponsor took care of contents of programs, while the networks, which were essentially an assemblage of contractually connected television stations, furnished facilities and air time.
There was an insidious side to these arrangements. Nothing prevented the sponsor from blending plugs for its products into the shows. In certain instances, a show's principals recoiled from the interference they were subjected to.
Mr. Fox recounts the time scriptwriter Rod Serling was asked to change ''American'' and ''lucky'' to ''United States'' and ''fortunate'' because the cigarette company underwriting the show competed with American Tobacco's Lucky Strike. Mr. Serling capitulated but struck his name from the script.
 
ADVERTISERS OUT ON A LIMB
The costs and risks to advertisers of producing their own television movies and specials are high. Deals can be structured in many ways, often with a network as a partner. But if an advertiser produces a program on its own, it could easily spend $2.5 million to $5 million to complete a two-hour movie - then have to buy a two-hour time slot from a network, at a cost that can exceed $4 million.
Depending on the success of the program and what residual sales to syndication and foreign markets are made, the show could turn out to be cheaper than buying all the commercial time on a network show. But it could also be a lot more expensive. ''This is not a game for amateurs,'' said Philip Guarascio, head of advertising at the General Motors Corporation. ''It's not for the meek.''
Yet many expect the practice to grow further. ''The more crowded the world gets, the more appealing we feel programming is,'' said Marcella Rosen, executive vice president and managing director of media services at the Ayer advertising agency. ''In a cluttered world, this is a way to get noticed.''
While it may never come to pass that many regular series will again be made by advertisers, agency executives report that several large advertisers are intrigued by the thought of producing a series.
One, according to Louis Schultz, worldwide media director of the Lintas agency, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is working on a pilot for a series that may air in the winter. He would not identify the advertiser or the network, but said that the show might carry the advertiser's name.
Advertisers and agencies are also beginning to produce shows for European television, which is rapidly expanding and in dire need of programming. Lintas, for instance, does new versions of ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Jeopardy'' in Europe, and is bringing out a soap opera called ''Monte Carlo'' in the fall.

HEADLINE: New Accounting Proposal Create Nonprofit Anxiety

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
When a wealthy businessman said in 1986 he would donate $1.5 million to Princeton University, the school, as is usual for a nonprofit organization, decided not to show the revenues on its books until it had collected the money. It is a good thing, because the donor, Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street arbitrager, was subsequently arrested on insider trading charges, putting him in no position to follow through on his pledge.
But in an effort to hold nonprofit institutions to the same rigorous accounting standards that apply to for-profit corporations, the Financial Accounting Standards Board may force universities, hospitals and other charitable organizations to recognize most pledges as ''revenue'' as soon as a donor has made a commitment - in the same way that the board requires for-profit companies to handle credit-card sales, where the cash does not automatically change hands.
This is just one of the far-reaching new rules that the accounting board plans to propose in August and that is creating anxiety among nonprofit groups. The proposed rules will be released for public comment by the board before a final draft is issued in 1991. 
The rules would also require nonprofit organizations to account for as revenues certain assets that are now often not accounted for at all, from the donation of a priceless work of art to a museum, to the hard-to-value gifts of time made by volunteer workers.
''All gifts have value, and conceptually, they all should be recognized,'' said Ronald J. Bossio, the official in charge of the project at Fasbee, as the board is informally known.
While audited financial statements are the best proof to the public that their donations are well spent, many nonprofit groups are uneasy about the proposed standards. Putting a value on labor would increase their paperwork. Most are afraid that recognizing pledges will increase revenues, making them looking richer than they are, a turnoff to potential donors. Nonprofit organizations also worry that collection problems will put them in the awkward position of having to either shake down donors or suffer a write-off.
''If you press the guy, you may not get that pledge, and you'll certainly never get another one,'' said Richard T. Lawrence, the pastor of St. Vincent de Paul Church in Baltimore, explaining why many churches and schools prefer to keep mixed blessings like uncollected pledges off their books.
And accounting firms do not relish certifying the value that their nonprofit clients assign to volunteer labor. ''It's mind-blowing, and it's silly,'' said John K. McLaughlin, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick.
The accounting board, an independent seven-member group in Norwalk, Conn., was created in 1973 to set policy for for-profit and nonprofit corporations in the private sector that auditors could use to determine whether to sign off on a client's financial statements. But four years ago, the board began reviewing the accounting practices that are peculiar to nonprofit organizations.
Fasbee believed that the nonprofit groups could do a better job of recognizing the impact of unaccounted-for contributions on their revenues and assets. Because nonprofit organizations do not have shareholders as do for-profit corporations, they do not invite the same regulatory scrutiny. Auditors privately say they are not as hard on the sloppy accounting of their nonprofit clients as they are on that of for-profit clients, where the risk of being sued by disgruntled investors is higher.
Theoretically, the new standards would make the financial statements of nonprofit organizations more uniform and therefore easier for donors like foundations, which typically review a group's financial position before making a contribution, to compare.
''In the nonprofit world, the accounting is not that good, and there is not the consistency of the business world,'' said Daniel Borochoff, an analyst with the National Charities Information Bureau in New York, which rates nonprofit groups on their financial reporting. ''In the business world, you have the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors who would sue if they got information that would lead them to make a poor investment decision. In the nonprofit world, there's not that much pressure on having good information that accurately portrays what is going on.''
Groups like hospitals and charities should be able to account for their pledges without too much trouble. They know from past fundraisers what their collection record is likely to be, and they can set up reserves to handle the losses they might suffer from an occasional bad debt.
But colleges, universities and churches, which attract large, infrequent donations from prominent individuals, have always been loathe to record mere pledges, lest they fall through.
''There are many cases where people, for a variety of reasons, can't make good on their pledges,'' said Richard R. Spies, Princeton's vice president for finance. ''It can be business reversals, family circumstances, even a change of heart. We try to get people to honor those commitments, but we don't take legal efforts to force them to make good on those pledges. That's true whether it's Ivan Boesky or anyone else.''
Many museums believe they would have special problems complying with the proposed rules and strongly oppose their adoption. They contend that valuing the millions of objects they have in their collections is an impossible task, one reason they have balked at carrying them on their books at all.
Hospitals, churches, schools and other charitable organizations are also troubled by the proposal that would require them to put a dollar value on volunteer labor and to include the number in revenues whenever the activity meets certain tests. Otherwise, the board intends to encourage, but not require, compliance.
Several officials at nonprofit organizations said they agreed with the board that this approach captures the economic realities they face. But they complained that the proposed new rules would create enormous paperwork by forcing them to keep track of hordes of volunteers who come and go, and whose value to the organization is hard to gauge.
How much, for instance, was Jimmy Carter's time worth when the former President volunteered his carpentry skills to building low-cost housing for New York City's poor? What is the value of time donated by an unpaid board member or director, a staple of the nonprofit world, when the individual generally fetches a large salary? What about the 80 million Americans who contribute an average of five hours a week on activities ranging from candy striping to envelope-stuffing to being a den mother?
Barry S. Weinstein, chief operating officer for the Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, said that valuing all the ''surrogate grandparents'' who pitch in at his hospital would itself be a labor-intensive effort. ''The hospitals have a good cadre of finance people,'' he said. ''The question is, do you want to dedicate them to determining the value of volunteer employees or have them do something else that they're doing now?''
Though the ''contributions'' made by volunteers would indeed increase some organizations' revenues, they should have no impact on bottom lines, since the organizations would also recognize an offsetting expense to balance their books.
Nonetheless, some foundations fear that Fasbee may do more harm than good by giving nonprofit groups a choice of whether to value the volunteer labor they receive.
Here's the problem: Donors judge nonprofit organizations largely on how much of every dollar goes to worthwhile projects, as opposed to overhead. Thus, those organizations whose volunteers tend to work on projects that relate to the nonprofit organization's mission may be inclined to use volunteer labor to prop up their revenues. Doing so would make overhead appear smaller while inflating the amount apparently spent on program-related activities. But organizations whose volunteers stick to fundraising would simply opt out of the new rule because it would appear to increase their overhead in relation to their program expense.
Making the rules optional could create chaos rather than clarifying the relative financial positions of nonprofit groups. ''There's a potential for abuse,'' said Patrick J. Yogus, a vice president for the American Cancer Society. ''If any organization was not totally upfront, they could inflate what they're doing.''
His organization, for instance, has roughly 77,000 volunteers who are collecting information for a 10-year study on cancer prevention. Valuing their time at the same pay rate as say, census workers, Mr. Yogus said, could enable the society to put an additional $90 million in ''contributions'' on its books under revenues. The offsetting $90 million entry that would then be entered as ''research expense'' to balance the books, would make the society appear to be spending a higher proportion of its dollars on research than it is.
''To maintain credibility, we've backed away from doing that and maybe under these new standards, it will be seen as a legitimate thing we should be doing,'' said Mr. Yogus, who thinks that such information properly belongs in the footnotes, if anywhere.

HEADLINE: Circuit Breakers: Maybe They Work, Maybe They Don't

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
The embattled futures industry finally got a break last week, and it came in the guise of plummeting markets.
When the dust settled after the plunge on Monday, industry executives declared a victory for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's self-imposed circuit breaker system.
Circuit breakers are mechanisms that temporarily halt trading in wildly swinging markets. On Monday, when contracts for the Standard & Poor's stock index futures fell 12 points - the equivalent of 100 points in the Dow Jones industrial average - the Mercantile Exchange's circuit breakers kicked in and were widely credited by traders and market watchers with stemming the drop in both the futures and stock markets.
An expert trader could not have timed it better. The next day, at scheduled hearings before the Senate Banking Committee, futures industry representatives were able to point proudly to this performance as evidence the regulatory system is functioning smoothly. 
When Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, suggested that the futures industry had done little to correct problems that exacerbated the 1987 market crash. Leo Melamed, chairman of the Mercantile Exchange's executive committee, put it succinctly: ''Circuit breakers are in place and they work very well.''
Added Ted Doukas, an executive with the Chicago Board of Trade, where circuit breakers were also triggered on Monday: ''We could keep our heads up high and say some very good things about how the markets responded.''
Despite all the talk of victory, experts remain divided over whether circuit breakers can claim credit for stemming the drop in the markets. Some even question whether such an effect is for the best. In fact, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission itself has criticized circuit breakers in the past.
Recently, however, this discussion has been overshadowed by the much louder political debate over who should have regulatory control over the futures exchanges. While circuit breakers are not a key issue in the turf war between the commodity futures commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, they do play a role and were freshly examined last week amid this highly charged environment.
Hans R. Stoll, a professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, said it is not clear that circuit breakers perform as intended. Still, he said, if the public perception was that they helped, it would be useful ammunition for the futures industry. ''It reduces the political pressure to move authority from the C.F.T.C. to the S.E.C.,'' he said. In fact, the Administration's plan to do that has recently faltered. (See box.) Circuit breakers were introduced after the 1987 stock market crash in response to the public cry to ''do something.'' The chief intent of the mechanisms, which include trading halts and price limits, is to give traders a chance to gather their bearings in a wildly swinging market. Supporters say they are not meant to keep a market from dropping, only to help it drop in an orderly fashion.
Several studies on volatility, most recently a report issued in June by the New York Stock Exchange, have recommended circuit breakers, and the stock and futures exchanges have instituted a number of them over the last few years.
Circuit breakers are triggered by large price movements. On Monday, when the futures contract for the S.& P. 500-stock index fell 12 points at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, contracts were not allowed to trade at a lower level for 30 minutes.
At the New York Stock Exchange, if the Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 250 points, trading in all stocks would be halted for an hour. That has not happened since the rule went into effect on Oct. 20, 1988.
Proponents argue that trading halts reduce volatility by letting investors cool off and digest information. They also allow clearing operations to catch up with trading.
Critics charge that a halt interrupts a fluid market and prevents buyers and sellers from completing trades. Information that translates into price changes is slowed, merely delaying price swings. And big price drops, they say, can be beneficial by attracting bargain hunters. Halts delay or even prevent that from occurring.
There is also concern about a so-called magnet effect: when prices approach a circuit-breaker level, the drop accelerates in a rush to sell before the mechanism is triggered.
Mr. Stoll of Vanderbilt said it is not clear that the market's recovery on Monday had anything to do with circuit breakers. The Dow fell more than 100 points in little more than an hour before closing the day down 56.44. ''This time we were probably just lucky,'' he said.
If investors' perceptions have changed, causing stock prices to plummet, Mr. Stoll said, circuit breakers will ultimately do little to stop that decline. ''All they can do is stop people from trading, but it doesn't stop them from thinking.''
Other academics also question the philosophy of circuit breakers, while futures and stock markets have endorsed them and traders see them as basically benign. James H. Lorie, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago, said: ''If we attribute the rebound to the circuit breakers, I think we are making a mistake.''
''Even if circuit breakers worked, I think it would be counterproductive,'' Mr. Lorie said, since no one is helped by keeping the markets from gravitating to the correct level.
Indeed, a number of studies exist on the efficacy of circuit breakers, including ones by the commodity futures commission and the S.E.C. on the role of the trading halts in the crash last Oct. 13.
The futures commission report found that the circuit breakers did not reduce volatility. ''Instead,'' it said, ''there is some evidence that a binding circuit breaker in one market is associated with increased volatility in other unconstrained markets.'' Because circuit breakers are not triggered simultaneously in different markets, the commission contends, their activation increased volatility by transferring selling pressure to other markets.
The S.E.C. found, in contrast, that the imposition of the mercantile exchange's price limit for S.&P. futures coincided with a sharp reduction in program selling on the New York Stock Exchange and in the rate at which stock prices fell.
The chairman of the S.E.C., Richard Breeden, and the chairwoman of the futures commission, Wendy Gramm, exchanged bitter words over their interpretations of the Oct. 13 crash, both maneuvering to use the data to bolster their position over which agency should oversee futures.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, issued perhaps the final word last week in yet a third report, ordered by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on securities. The G.A.O. said the two agencies had used incomplete data to form conclusions that reflected their viewpoints. According to the G.A.O., ''Determining the soundness of these conclusions would require better data.''
But the battle over circuit breakers continues. On Wednesday, the S.E.C. approved a rule that could curtail program trading on days with broad market swings. The futures commission opposed it, saying it would decrease the linkage between markets and increase volatility.
''I find all this tinkering undesirable,'' Mr. Stoll said. ''You've got all these things that kick in at different points. Five years from now, we will say 'Gee, all these little rules are kind of silly. Let's get rid of them.' ''
 
REGULATORY PLAN IS UNRAVELING
Not too many months ago, the Bush Administration's bid to wrest regulatory control of much of the futures industry from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission seemed destined for success.
''I thought it was a done deal,'' said Daniel R. Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Washington.
Within the Administration, powerful backers of the plan shared that view. At the very least, the Securities and Exchange Commission would oversee stock-index futures, they said. ''Anything less than that is unacceptable,'' a senior Treasury official said in March. But now the Treasury is accepting less.
A compromise plan would give the Federal Reserve Board authority to set broad guidelines for margins for stock-index futures, which are now set by futures exchanges. Two powerful backers of the original plan, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Richard Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C., have argued that low margin requirements for futures make the market more volatile.
Why did the Administration's effort apparently fall short?
For one, the commodities industry's powerful political allies, like the farm lobby, rallied. ''It has been an intensely lobbied campaign,'' said Robert K. Wilmouth, head of the National Futures Association.
Futures officials argued that tampering with the system might add cost and inefficiency, driving business to London and Tokyo. Mr. Siegel of the University of Washington said the Administration had no compelling economic arguments.
Also, futures exchanges are getting less publicity about the Government's investigation of trading abuses. In the first case to come to trial, one defendant was acquitted and two were convicted on lesser charges. ''It seems that the F.B.I. sting operation kind of evaporated,'' Mr. Siegel said.
The Administration has been criticized by some backers of the original plan for not working hard enough for its passage. But a Treasury spokeswoman, Desiree Tucker-Sorini, said Secretary Brady has pushed hard for it.

Where a Boom May Not Be a Boon

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEINER; Benjamin Weiner, president of Probe International in Stamford, Conn., specializes in assessing political risk for corporations.

 BODY:
Expanded American trade and investment in the Soviet Union might prolong President Gorbachev's political life, but a number of American executives are beginning to sense that it could prove more a disaster than a boon for the American companies involved.
Admittedly there appeared to be a rapport of sorts between Mr. Gorbachev and the corporate leaders who crowded into the meetings set up during his recent visit to the United States. The Soviet President displayed a skillful blend of blandishment and warning in his sales pitch to American executives, promoting a very tentative Chevron Corporation and Soviet drilling venture as having a potential in excess of $6 billion and cautioning his audiences that if they did not jump on the bandwagon now the opportunity might be lost forever. The Gorbachev pitch was well received by a number of businessmen who already have committed themselves to activities in the Soviet Union and by promoters who sense profits in playing the middleman. 
Yet despite the preaching and the willingness of American executives to shout amen, it appears few approached the baptismal font. Surprisingly, it was only the Chevron project and the International Business Machines Corporation's sale of personal computers that generated publicity.
If this is a reflection of caution on the part of American industry it is well advised, for business prospects in the Soviet Union are slim indeed.
The current political uncertainties in the Soviet Union not only signal social instability but they also could drastically affect the quality and size of the marketplace.
For example, a joint venture established in Vilnius, Lithuania, in 1988, might have been predicated on a domestic market potential of 290 million people. Today that domestic market has shrunk to three million. And if the project required extensive energy inputs it would now face uncertainty.
Given the potential for the disintegration of the Soviet empire, the projected Chevron drilling venture in the Tengiz oil field may start out in the friendly Soviet Union but end up in an independent and hostile Republic of Kazakhstan.
It is also difficult to accept the Gorbachev challenge to take a chance on the Soviet economy when he and his associates appear unwilling to do so themselves. The Kremlin's leaders have been tentative and contradictory in their commitment to the realistic but painful path toward a market economy. Most importantly, they have procrastinated on convertibility of the ruble, presumably since the immediate consequences of inflation and unemployment would be politically unpalatable. Yet a soft ruble severely limits the potentials for foreign investors and traders who then are forced to engage in the archaic acrobatics of countertrade and barter to repatriate profits.
The off-and-on-again trade agreement signed by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev is not a panacea and in itself will not generate badly needed hard currency for the Soviet Union. The reality is that there are few Soviet products and services that can find significant markets in the United States, regardless of reduced tariff levels. Expanded caviar and vodka sales are hardly the answer, and it could be years before the Russians are in a position to market reliable and price-competitive industrial goods in this country.
Mr. Gorbachev and his advisers apparently are hoping that a surge of trade with the United States would smooth transformation toward a free market and could even jump-start the moribund economy. However, given the Soviet Union's festering sores of political conflict and economic stagnation, this may be the moment for caution on the part of the American business community.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris;
The Volatile Impact of Crude Oil

 BODY:
When words don't persuade, a gun can help.
Iraq's threat to take military action against competitors who undercut its prices for crude oil may or may not have aroused envy among businessmen who are forced to rely on other tactics. But it did send American warships scurrying to the Persian Gulf, and it breathed new life into the markets for crude oil and oil company shares. It also seemed to concentrate the attention of oil producers that had not been as determined to push up prices. 
On Wall Street, the oil stocks have replaced the growth stocks and the technology stocks as the market stars. Chevron and Texaco were featured prominently last week on the shrunken list of stocks making new highs, as hopes of rising profits drew investors who have been stunned by just how low profits seem to be in the rest of the economy. Exxon came within a whisker of hitting a 1990 high. It may be too strong to say, in a paraphrase of ''Engine Charlie'' Wilson, that what's good for Exxon is bad for America. But there is little doubt that, historically, what has been good for oil stocks has seldom been good for the entire stock market. Rising oil prices are paid by everyone, and while some parts of the economy benefit, the net effect is similar to that of a tax increase, draining money that would have gone to other uses. Oil price hikes helped to provoke recessions in the mid-1970's and early 80's.
One way to illustrate the counter-cyclicality of the oil stocks is to measure the Dow Jones industrial average against the three big oil companies in it. Since 1970, in quarters when the oil stocks bested the Dow in performance, the Dow has dropped an average of 1 percent. But when the oil shares lag, the Dow averages a gain of 5.5 percent.
As oil prices rise this time, it turns out the country has been skating even closer to recession than was thought. The Government went through its economic figures of the past three years, and now says that growth was much lower than previously reported. In the second quarter, it said, there were fewer final sales of goods and services than in the first. All of the meager 1.2 percent growth in the economy was due to rising inventories.
That second-quarter guess is subject to revision, and in the past the revisions have often been huge. But it added to the glum picture of an economy with profits lower than expected and renewed the confidence of the minority of economists who think a real recession may have already begun.
Monday's sell-off in the stock market reflected both economic fears and the fragility of the stock market itself. But those who blamed the fall on index arbitrage trading may want to reconsider. That trading normally hits the big stocks - the ones that dominate the stock indexes - the hardest. But small stocks were smacked as well last week. The Dow was down 62.62 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,898.52,last week, but the fall in the Nasdaq composite was even worse, 2.8 percent. That index is off 5.5 percent for the past fortnight, the worst showing since late 1987.

Sinking Against the Mark

 BODY:
The dollar moved into new territory last week. First, it hit a two-and-a-half-year low against the German mark on Monday as the stock market plunged. Then it fell further on Friday as the report on the American gross national product for the second quarter showed a very sluggish economy, one held above water only by the build-up of inventories. The dollar closed on Friday in New York at 1.6115 against the mark. It has not been this low since Jan. 5, 1988, when it closed at a dismal 1.5880. (The dollar surged to a close of 1.6380 on Jan. 6, 1988, after central banks bought dollars to support it.) But against the yen, the dollar is still holding its own. Despite the stock plunge and the weak report on G.N.P., the dollar was up slightly on the week at 149.

HEADLINE: A Reckoning for the Utility High Rollers

BYLINE: By LEAH BETH WARD; Leah Beth Ward, a reporter for the Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal in Santa Fe, has covered the utility industry for several years.

 BODY:
The utility industry has never been known as a haven for high rollers. But in late 1986, when Keith L. Turley agreed to buy a Phoenix savings and loan institution, he was only topping off a buying binge started six years earlier by four of the brashest utility companies in the country, all of them in the Southwest.
Mr. Turley headed the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, whose main asset, the Arizona Public Service Company, is the state's largest public utility. In a deal many industry experts call the highest-stakes gamble ever by an electric utility, Mr. Turley paid $426 million for the Phoenix-based Merabank, roughly twice the savings unit's book value. After two years, Merabank collapsed, nearly taking Pinnacle West with it and ultimately costing the utility holding company an additional $450 million to dispose of it.
Pinnacle West was only the biggest of the brazen. By the early 1980's, the Public Service Company of New Mexico, the El Paso Electric Company and, to a lesser degree, the Tucson Electric Power Company had begun their own wild rides into diversification. 
Much like the savings and loan industry, which sought greater profits than its plain-Jane home mortgages could earn, these four companies strayed far afield from the business they knew best, hoping to cash in on the booming Southwestern economy and create profits beyond the reach of regulators.
''They were considered the go-go companies in the utility industry,'' said Dan Scotto, a utility analyst at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
But as investors, ratepayers and regulators have learned, Southwestern-style utility diversification has been a painful failure. Indeed, the experience of Pinnacle West and the others - called ''the dismal four'' by Bert Kramer, a utility analyst at Paine Webber Inc. - is reinforcing what some in the industry had long suspected: Utilities, with their engineering-based corporate cultures and history of low risks and low returns, are asking for trouble when they venture into more volatile businesses.
Dismal just begins to describe the condition of the four battered companies, which lost more than $1.2 billion between 1987 and 1989 from investments related to diversification. The basic utility business has slowed, too, rendering total earnings anemic.
Mr. Turley and the heads of the other three companies during the go-go years have either resigned or retired. What they have left behind them is not a pretty sight:
The utilities have laid off several thousand employees, stopped paying dividends and seen their stock prices plummet. Debt has been downgraded to near-junk status and consumer groups worry that increased financing costs will be passed on to ratepayers. And at least two of the dismal four - Public Service of New Mexico and Pinnacle West - have become takeover targets.
Meanwhile, angry regulators have tightened their grip, contending that the companies reneged on promises to keep the utility business insulated from the risks of their other investments. Regulators are now talking about excluding some utilities from diversification by revoking exemptions from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a Federal law passed to end financial speculation by utilities in the 1920's.
Analysts and other industry experts say the four utilities were hobbled by a combination of mismanagement, poor timing and a blind belief that growth in the already pumped-up Southwest would continue unabated. ''There was a uniform pattern of overoptimism, but the numbers really weren't there to justify it,'' said Jerry Jordan, senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
Barring actual takeovers, the four companies will do little more than limp along until 1995 or so, most analysts say, when demand for power is expected to grow again.
Nationally, most utilities have diversified cautiously, says Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm. Utility managers in the Northeast are among the most conservative, said Ed Tirello, an industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''It seems the farther west you go, the more game they get,'' he added.
They were plenty game in the Southwest in the late 1970's and early 80's. Cash was overflowing in many utility coffers in that period, the result of rate increases that kept pace with inflation. The pot grew as big utility construction projects wound down and depreciation helped cash flow.
But the utilities worried that regulators might snatch up the profits, and paying them all out in dividends would shrink the size of their companies, said James Dewey, a partner in Price Waterhouse's utility group. ''They needed some place to invest,'' he said.
So Pinnacle West, El Paso, Tucson and Public Service of New Mexico (known as PNM) all plunged into the increasingly feverish real estate market through development companies, limited partnerships and ownership of, or investments in, savings and loans.
For a short time, the aggressive diversification boosted earnings. But then came the severe downturn in real estate and the collapse of much of the savings and loan industry. To make matters worse, three of the four utilities - Pinnacle West's Arizona Public Service unit, PNM and El Paso - own part of the Palo Verde nuclear plant west of Phoenix. Once hailed as a prime example of prudent construction, Palo Verde has since had operating nightmares, causing extended shutdowns and forcing Arizona and El Paso to buy expensive replacement power.
Shareholders have showered PNM, Tucson Electric and Pinnacle West with lawsuits, alleging mismanagement, and El Paso is embroiled in litigation over the sale of some of its diversified investments.
Citing the pending litigation, the executives who made diversification decisions at the four troubled utilities declined through company spokesmen or their attorneys to be interviewed for this article.
But Richard Snell, the man who succeeded Mr. Turley as head of Pinnacle West in January, conceded that real estate euphoria may have gotten the best of the company in 1986. ''Acquisitions of consequence probably were made at the top of the market,'' said Mr. Snell, a longtime Pinnacle West board member who had opposed Mr. Turley's ambitious diversification plans.
Outsiders have broader explanations for the deep troubles at the four utilities. They never truly diversified, said Mr. Scotto, the Donaldson Lufkin analyst, because they put all their chips on the Southwestern economy. ''They really did not spread out their business risk,'' he said.
And the experience of the four utilities underscores the need to create a solid wall between regulated and unregulated businesses, said Bill Berry, chairman of the Richmond-based Dominion Resources Inc., considered one of the most successful diversified utilities. The non-utility operations, he said, must stand alone financially.
That was supposed to happen with the Southwestern utilities, but didn't, say state regulators. Instead, to varying degrees the utilities pledged the parent companies' credit to underwrite their nonregulated businesses, exposing the whole company to claims by lending banks. And only minimal reporting requirements were established when the utilities received permission to diversify, often leaving regulators to uncover abuses after the fact.
But Mr. Dewey of Price Waterhouse said the regulators underestimated the potential for trouble. ''I think they were naive about how diversification would work,'' he said.
In any event, while the scale is different, there are striking similarities between the excesses of these utilities and the savings and loan industry, said Mr. Jordan of First Interstate. In both cases, he said, normal business risk was improperly shifted. ''Whenever you combine a regulated business with an unregulated business, you in effect make consumers stockholders,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''It's consumers that become the risk bearers, and if management makes mistakes, consumers pay. That's not the way the system is supposed to work.''
In general, ratepayers are facing higher bills not because of diversification, the new chief executives at the utilities insist, but because the costs of doing business have gone up and some of the utilities have found themselves with excess capacity. And shareholders have suffered the most, they say, given that dividends have been suspended indefinitely and stock prices have fallen.
Annual shareholder meetings were particularly brutal for Pinnacle West and PNM this spring. Some investors even hanged an effigy of Jerry D. Geist, PNM's longtime chairman who retired last month.
PNM's stock got a boost earlier this month when a group headed by the company's former chief financial officer made an informal bid that the board is still studying. And Pinnacle West is being pursued by Pacificorp, the acquisitive Portland, Ore., utility holding company that is trying to gain a foothold in the Southwest. Each of its four bids so far has been rejected.
Takeover possibilities aside, the people now running the four utilities have their hands full trying to turn things around. They must sell greatly devalued non-utility assets, regain Wall Street's faith and operate within strict covenants imposed by lenders. And at the same time, they must deal with angry regulators.
Arizona regulators, for example, have asked Federal officials to revoke the legal underpinning for Pinnacle West's diversification. ''I want to make sure they can't go out and do these same silly things again,'' said Timothy Hogan, chief counsel to the Arizona Corporation Commission.
But all four utilities say they are now going back to the basics. In fact, some are pursuing plainness as zealously as they chased glamour. Said Roger Yohem, spokesman for Tucson Electric: ''We are on a fast track to becoming a pure utility company.''
 
BUYING SPREE, POOR TIMING
In the Southwest, the utility shopping spree began with real estate and the most aggressive buyers were the Public Service Company of New Mexico, known as PNM, and the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation.
A PNM investment subsidiary became one of the general partners in a regional land development company a decade ago. When the real estate market began to sour in 1987, the other investors wanted to liquidate the partnership but PNM blocked the move, saying the market would rebound.
In 1989, when the others threatened to sue, the investment subsidiary bought its partners out. But the sale came just months before the land company filed for bankruptcy with more than $300 million in debts, leaving the PNM unit with a controlling stake in a greatly devalued company.
In Phoenix, Pinnacle West, through its Suncor Development Company, spent $168 million buying commercial land in 1986. The same year, Pinnacle West's chairman at the time, Keith L. Turley, reportedly shook hands at a football game on a $221 million deal to buy 12,000 acres of mostly undeveloped land west of the city. Management believes that even though some of the purchases have lost value, others will turn out to be profitable.
But Pinnacle West's biggest wager, which led to its steepest losses, came in December 1986 when a predecessor holding company, called AZP Group, bought Merabank. Two years later, the savings and loan unit recorded a $209 million loss, nearly wiping out Pinnacle West's net income.
The company agreed to pump $450 million into Merabank this spring. In return, it was released from any further obligations by Federal regulators, who now control Merabank.

HEADLINE: All About/The Shuttles;
Clipped Wings Along the Northeast Corridor

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
It's Friday morning at La Guardia Airport and the shuttle business is even slower than usual. Richard F. Cozzi, wrapping up his first week as president of the Trump Shuttle, glances about anxiously, as if hunting for more passengers. A holiday that week has thinned the weekend rush; only a few people straggle into the Trumpterminal, ready to board a Trumpjet, sink into leather Trumpchairs and enjoy Trumpsnacks. At the other end of the airport, Pan Am's shuttle gates are equally desolate.
The Northeast shuttles, on the New York-Washington and New York-Boston routes, were long considered cash cows. Nearly all the passengers are business travelers, frequent fliers who don't flinch at high fares. And with a virtual lock on gates at the three airports - Washington's National, Boston's Logan, and New York's La Guardia - the chances are slim that a third airborne competitor can elbow in on Trump and Pan Am.
But these cows may be going dry. The Trump Shuttle is not yet profitable, the Pan Am shuttle only modestly so. Short flights, with the stress of frequent takeoffs and landings, require more jet maintenance. Airport landing fees at the three airports are among the nation's highest, and standby planes - needed because every passenger is guaranteed a seat with no reservations - are costly. And the shuttles are links, not spokes; they do not feed traffic into airline hubs. 
Then there are the slumping Northeast economy and the stronger competition from Amtrak (see box) Mr. Cozzi predicts that total shuttle ridership will fall from 4 million passengers in 1988 to 3.6 million this year, and blames the economy. Richard Copland, president of the New York Chapter of The American Society of Travel Agents, said businesses are trimming their travel budgets. ''Instead of making three trips, they might make two,'' he said.
Both shuttles have been for sale for months, without attracting buyers. ''The shuttle is a great business to be in if you're the only one operating it,'' said Ed Starkman, an analyst with Paine Weber. ''If there are two of them, it's tough.''
 
Pan Am vs. Trump
A Barely Noticeable Difference
Pan Am and Trump have their loyalists, but the two are so similar that passengers often decide which to fly according to when they arrive at the airport. Trump flies every hour, Pan Am on the half-hour. Jerry Gitner, chairman of Tribeca Aviation, a consulting and investment firm, calls them the ''Tweedledee and Tweedledum'' of the industry.
Eastern started shuttling in 1961, with propeller-driven Constellations and a $10 fare. It had virtually no competition until 1980, when New York Air, a division of the Texas Air Corporation, entered the market. Pan Am bought the New York Air shuttle in 1986 for $76 million. Eastern's shuttle was sold to Donald Trump in June 1989.
Despite the competition, fares continue to climb. Last December, Trump raised fares to $119 from $99, and Pan Am followed. The airlines say that fewer riders but higher revenues resulted.
Since many passengers find the two products nearly indistinguishable, the marketers have been assigned to create some distinctions, also known as frills. Both already let passengers choose from dozens of newspapers and magazines - everything from Business Month to Garbage: The Magazine of Waste Disposal shows up on board.
Pan Am recently began offering its own, condensed daily newspaper. The airline is also holding a special drawing, available to passengers and non-passengers alike, for a new Cadillac Allante.
Pan Am, but not Trump, offers discounts for major corporate customers. Trump gives coupons good for restaurants discounts, extra frequent flier miles or companion tickets if its flights are more than 15 minutes late for any reason. The airline has given away thousands of the coupons, but, Mr. Cozzi said, ''We have enough confidence that we're not going to lose our shirt.''
 
Trump's Cargo of Debt
Market Share, But Not Profits
By one measure, the Trump Shuttle has done fine. Its market share has grown from 12 percent when Eastern sold it, after employees went on strike, to 48 percent. Many passengers had switched to Pan Am, but Mr. Trump lured many back. ''He started with an airline that had no place to go but up,'' Mr. Copland said.
But the Trump Shuttle has not made any money, mainly because of the debt that came with the $365 million price. Many analysts believe Mr. Trump overpaid.
Earlier this year Mr. Trump talked of selling it, but Mr. Cozzi says that no sale is imminent. ''I am not a caretaker for the sale of this airline,'' he said. ''I wouldn't have taken this job if I were.''
Mr. Cozzi took over as shuttle president after Mr. Trump ousted Bruce R. Nobles earlier this month. Mr. Trump had said earlier that he was dissatisfied with the airline's management. Mr. Nobles and Mr. Trump reportedly disagreed on several issues, like the seat assignments that Mr. Nobles wanted to eliminate but Mr. Trump kept.
Even as Mr. Trump adds frills, he has cut back on flight schedules and employees. He has refurbished 12 of his Boeing 727's at a cost of $1 million each and plans to do the same for eight more. He has installed leather seats, GTE Airfones in every row and ''marble-look'' bathrooms, complete with florid T's rimming the sinks and automatic sensors to turn on the taps.
Since the business traveler spends an average of only 10 minutes in the terminal and 45 on board, some industry experts question whether such luxuries are appreciated. ''You don't need rugs on the floor for a 45-minute ride,'' said Mr. Copland.
In other respects, the Trump Shuttle is economizing. A hundred employees, a tenth of the staff, were laid off earlier this month and a concierge service, for hotel reservations and the like, was suspended. Trump also quit serving free coffee in the terminals, but resumed after customers complained. It also dropped six weekend flights, where low fares failed to attract many riders, and may eliminate more. ''It was just a good management decision to say we have to streamline,'' said Mr. Cozzi. ''The demand for the shuttle just isn't there on the weekends.''
But analysts ask how the airline can still claim to fly every hour on the hour. ''Passengers don't want to be looking at their watch as they drive out to the airport,'' said Mr. Starkman. Pan Am said it has no plans to eliminate any weekend flights.
In one respect the Trump Shuttle is doing better than expected: the axiom about there being no such thing as bad publicity seems to be holding true. Reports of Mr. Trump's financial and marital problems have shown no signs of chasing away passengers, analysts say. As one flier explained while boarding a recent Washington flight out of La Guardia, ''It doesn't bother me as long as he gets me where I'm going.''
Mr. Trump has said he expects the airline to fetch $500 million or $600 million. Industry analysts say $300 million. Continental Holdings, formerly Texas Air, might exercise its right to veto the Trump Shuttle's sale if the buyer is a major competitor.
 
A Needy Pan Am Parent
Sacrificing the Successful Offspring
If Pan Am has no slick wheeler-dealer as its namesake, neither does it have that wheeler-dealer's debts. Pan Am bought its shuttle for for only $76 million. Its frequent flyer program is more attractive than Trump's, and it has gained about 10 percentage points of the market since before the Eastern strike, to more than 50 percent.
Pan Am provides no profit figures for its shuttle, but Harris K. Herman, the shuttle's president, said that it has been earning money for the last 10 quarters. Analysts estimate that it earned $15 million last year.
And yet, the Pan Am Shuttle is for sale. The parent company is apparently desperate, with cash reserves that have dwindled to less than $60 million. Thomas G. Plaskett, the company's chairman, has said that Pan Am needs to merge with another airline to survive.
No formal bidders have emerged for either shuttle, but the Transportation Department might exclude any major airline that would gain an overwhelming advantage in the Northeast.
America West, a mid-size carrier which was interested in buying the Eastern Shuttle but couldn't obtain financing, is reportedly considering a bid for either shuttle. Most analysts estimate that either would bring $250 to $300 million, a profit for Pan Am and a loss for Trump. But travelers should not hope for a fare war, since the market would still be dominated by two companies. As Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said, ''It's a legal duopoly.''
 
CAN AMTRAK COMPETE?
The two shuttles face little competition in the air, but Amtrak might give them cause to watch out below. The federally subsidized railroad carried 1.6 million passengers between New York and Washington in the year ended Sept. 30 - about a third of the number who flew. Its goal is to add 500,000 riders in 10 years.
To that end, Amtrak added three round trips between New York and Washington, for a total of four, last October. All are on sleek Metroliners that surpass 100 miles per hour. Coming next month: a test of conference cars in some trains.
Amtrak calls its express service the ''civilized shuttle.'' The trip takes two hours and 35 minutes - which, as Amtrak officials are quick to point out, might be less time than it takes to reach the airports and fly. Record-breaking flight delays at New York's airports give Amtrak another advantage. ''One of our best sales devices is a fog bank at La Guardia Airport or a snow bank at Washington's National Airport,'' said Clifford Black, an Amtrak spokesman.
Amtrak has been averaging about 75 passengers on the express trains - enough to cover its costs but not much more. A one-way Metroliner ticket, standard or express, costs $79, compared with $119 on the two shuttles.
But Amtrak has several disadvantages. Shuttle executives question Amtrak's ''downtown-to-downtown'' boast, saying that most passengers begin and end their trips in the suburbs. The railroad admits that it is considerably less competitive between New York and Boston, where serpentine tracks result in a four-and-a-half-hour trip, compared with a 45-minute flight.
Amtrak also has an image problem. As Mr. Black put it, ''To look and act and feel like an executive you have to fly, regardless of how unproductive it might be.'' And only the airlines have frequent-flier programs. But Amtrak is considering an airline tie-in, allowing frequent train riders to earn free flights.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Greek Market Takes Its Turn

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
In the months since the narrow victory last April of the conservative Government of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, the Athens stock market has soared. The tiny Greek market is up 200 percent for the year, and it is the leading performer by far this year in the group that analysts class as emerging stock markets.
Such performance puts Athens up there with other high flyers in Mexico, Thailand, Turkey and Taiwan. All have far outperformed the world's major stock markets in the last several years. Last year, the 19 emerging stock markets in the International Finance Corporation index outgrew Japan by almost 4-to-1 and the United States by just under 2-to-1. 
In September, Americans will be offered their first easy access to the Greek market. Alliance Capital is scheduled to launch the first closed-end country fund for the Greek market to be traded here. It will have a minimum of $60 million to invest. A major portion of that will go into state-owned companies as the Greek Government sells them to the public and into private companies that are not now traded on the exchange but are expected to go public in several years. Only about 25 percent of Greece's top 200 companies are now traded in Athens. In total, only 124 companies were listed on the exchange in June.
So should investors get on board? It will be a difficult decision, because there are some reasons to exercise caution.
For one thing, the steep climb in the Greek market has meant that price/earnings ratios are soaring. For another, the one-vote majority of Mr. Mitsotakis's Government gives a tentative air to the sweeping economic reforms Mr. Mitsotakis wants to take his country through and which account for some of the market's rise. Already, a radical group has protested the selling off of state-owned companies with a bombing incident in Athens. Greece also has high inflation, around 21 percent, and troublesome budget and trade deficits.
Antoine W. van Agtmael, who manages global investment funds through Emerging Markets Management in Washington, calls Greece a classic sell. ''I have been selling most of what I have,'' he said.
On the other hand, Greece has a leg up on many other developing countries because it is a member of the Euorpean Community and should be able to avail itself of some of the benefits of the economic union of 1992. And the high price/earnings ratios, now averaging 25, are based on 1988 earnings. Many analysts expect them to drop when compared with earnings for 1989 and projected earnings for 1990.
One reason for the sharp rise in stock prices is the shortage of stock to buy. Some of the new offerings to come to the market have been oversubscribed by up to 60-to-1. Nikitas A. Niarchos, the head of the stock exchange, said this stock shortage gives the market a floor. ''There may be a small fall in prices but not a big one,'' he said during a visit to New York last week.
Alexander E. Zagoreos, a global fund manager at Lazard Freres & Company in New York, made his bet in Greece early. Last June, at the time of the first, inconclusive, election, he said he saw price/earnings ratios down around 6 and thought much of the bad news in Greece was already in the price of the stocks. So he got in by buying a Greece fund that trades in London.
He did well, he said, but has now taken out all his profit because the market has moved so far and price/earnings ratios have risen to near their highest levels since the late 1970's. But he has left his original investment there.
''There is a good reason to take a hard look at the market,'' he said. ''But if underlying growth continues, the potential growth is so large you almost have to look past the price/earning ratios.''
''It is definitely not a sell,'' added Nicolas C. Bornozis of the CCF International Finance Corporation, a French firm in New York that is concentrating on the Greek market. He argues that the change in the government and, therefore, the economic climate in Greece is on a par with changes in such countries as Mexico and Brazil. ''But it is very hard to ask people to go in a buy now. You have to be very selective,'' he said.

The Power of the Pencil at Eastern
 
For an airline to boast of correcting vital maintenance and repair problems is hardly the path to recovery. Who on Madison Avenue could craft a campaign around a message like this? But claims of ''full corrective action'' were the essence of Eastern Airlines' response to an indictment last Wednesday on 60 counts of ignoring upkeep and falsifying records - ''pencil whipping,'' as it was called. Nine managers, up to the level of a former vice president, were also charged. The airline, now under a court-appointed trustee, is laying plans to plead that $1.9 million in fines last year by the Federal Aviation Administration for faulty maintenance was penalty enough. Some analysts say the indictment nearly obliterates the airline's fading chances of emerging from bankruptcy proceedings. As Helane Becker, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''This game might be over.'' 
 
Meeting Low Expectations
 
Such is the state of the American auto industry that companies can win applause for getting by with much lower profits but no debacles. General Motors earned $900 million during the second quarter, down 38 percent, and Ford $771 million, down 45 percent, from the same period last year. Weak sales in North America and turmoil in Brazil were to blame. But analysts said the companies have cut costs and reduced inventories to a five-year low. ''The core operating profits came ahead of exzpectations,'' said Scott F. Merlis, an analyst at Morgan, Stanley, ''considering that they had the worst rebates and one of the lowest production levels we've seen in a while. It was not Armageddon.''
 
No Frigate Like a Profit
 
Poets have never written language as sweet as the clauses giving Paul B. Fireman a share of Reebok International's profits. Last year, zzhe made $14.6 million as chairman, more in salary and bonuses than any other American executive at a publicly owned company, according to Forbes magazine. A bit much, even for the man who endowed sweaty old sneakers with a perfumed image as the height of footwear fashion. Ah, but contracts, unlike other forms of literature, are not everlasting. A new contract to take effect in January limits Mr. Fireman to a $1 million base salary and a bonus of as much $1 million more, depending on profits.
 
More Sieve Than Shield?
 
Tobacco companies are finding that cigarette warning labels might make flimsy shields. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the warnings do not protect the companies against damage claims. Five Federal appeals courts have said otherwise, but higher courts might be reluctant to reverse a state decision. The ruling stemmed from a zwidow's lawsuit against three tobacco companies that made the brands her husband, who died of lung cancer, smoked.
 
In Brief
 
General Electric consented to pay $16.1 million for overcharging the United States Army for a battlefield computer system and $11.7 million to settle other allegations.

William Donaldson, a co-founder of the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette brokerage firm, is said to be the leading candidate for chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
*
 
The Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Los Angeles agreed to sell $3-billion in ''junk bonds'' to Canadian investors.
 
Digital Takes a Dive
 
For the first time in 25 years as a public company, the Digital Equipment Corporation reported a quarterly loss. The company took a $400 million charge for retraining, pruning operations and reducing its staff by at least 5,000. Digital has rebounded before, from the days when the International Business Machines Company seemed invincible. Now Digital is beseiged by a host of smaller competitors whose personal computers and work stations often make its minicomputers look clunky and expensive. The company is counting on its first mainframe, and several other new productseasily linked into networks, to fuel its comeback. Despite a worse report than expected, Digital stock barely budged and analysts are modestly optimistic. ''DEC has clearly accepted the changes in the industry and they're trying to adapt,'' said George Elling, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''If we get any cooperation from the economy, DEC is positioned to improve.''
 
News From the 2d Quarter
 
Second-quarter earnings:
RJR Nabisco Holdings, a loss of $108 million compared with a loss of $319 million for the similar period last year. Higher sales, lower debt payments. Exxon, $1.1 billion, up from $140 million when the company was spending heavily last year to clean up the Alaskan oil spill. Time Warner, a loss of $189 million because of merger expenses and a slowdown in the magazine and book businesses. Morgan Stanley, $58 million, down 48 percent, and Salomon, $120 million, down 52 percent, as the investment business continues its slump.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Closing Down a Loophole
 
As the cost of paying back savings and loan depositors passes $500 billion, the Government seems about ready to impose new restrictions on deposit insurance. The Government now backs deposits of up to $100,000, but those who split their funds among many institutions have gained virtually unlimited coverage. And in practice, Federal authorities has made good on all deposits, whatever the size. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suggested last Wednesday a $100,000 limit for individuals and businesses no matter how numerous their accounts. With some banks and credit unions looking weak, Mr. Brady wants to avoid another bailout.
 
The Inexorable Recession?
 
Growth in the gross national product slows and recession talk quickens. The G.N.P. rose at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent during the second quarter. And the estimate of last year's rate was reduced to 2.5 percent, the lowest since the 1982 recession. The Administration deftly played both sides, predicting stronger growth ahead but adding that the Federal Reserve should lower rates to be safe. Few economists foresee a rebound strong enough to fulfill the Administration's prediction of 2 percent growth this year. Next year might be worse still, said Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton. ''I think there is an increasing risk of recession early in 1991,'' he said. ''It's really up to the Fed. If they don't ease, then they're going to be held responsible.''
 
Greasing the Wheels of War
 
Kuwait has 20,000 soldiers in all. Iraq had 100,000 troops massed along its border last week. Suddenly, the Kuwaitis and the United Arab Emirates saw the logic of cutting their oil output to help the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries raise prices. ''This is the first time in OPEC's 30-year history that a member country has used the threat of war,'' said David T. Mizrahi, editor of the Mideast Report. ''It took two armored brigades, plus 200 tanks plus 3,000 trucks to raise the price of oil from $17 a barrel to $20 in a matter of three days.'' OPEC agreed to a $21 target price on Friday.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
The Bolshoi Shops Till It Drops
 
The leaps! The pirouettes! The lifts! And after they finished shopping in New York, it was remarkable that members of the Bolshoi Ballet had enough energy left to continue their exertions on stage. The Moscow company, which ended its visit to New York last Sunday and opened in Washington on Tuesday, sprinted to the stores for goods scarce back home. Used to be that Bolshoi members would bring luggage filled with food cansso they could save their $25 daily allowance for videocassette recorders and computers. Now, on $50 a day, with many meals provided, they can really go wild. The first shipment home included 14 refrigerators.
 
Carats for Currency
 
The Soviet Union's latest guide along the capitalist road is, of all nations, South Africa. The Soviet Union is one of the world's major diamond exporters, and South Africa's De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. runs the world's diamond cartel. For decades, political qualms kept the Soviet Union from publicly associating with De Beers, although there was probably some cooperation behind the scenes. But Soviet officials newly concerned about squeezing the most hard currency from every carat struck a deal last week to sell an estimated $5 billion of uncut diamonds through De Beers. To help pay some foreign debts, the Soviets will receive a $1 billion advance from the company, shipping their diamond stockpile to London to serve as collateral.

Justice and Mercy

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
Perhaps there comes a moment in the life of every woman when she yearns to telephone an 84-year-old man she has never met and ask, ''How could you do this to me?''
For me, that moment came last week.
I am taking the resignation of Justice Brennan personally. I have read all of some of his opinions, and bits of others, and I know where he dissented and where he pulled together a tenuous majority. And I keep remembering the speech in ''The Merchant of Venice'' about mercy seasoning justice. 
Over the years I have come to believe that someone who was in my corner, who touched my life from within one of those pale official tombs that line the streets of Washington, was a member of that mysterious body, the Supreme Court. ''The lightning rod for individual rights and individual freedom,'' Barbara Jordan called him on television. The man who once referred to the treatment of women as '' 'romantic paternalism' which, in practical effect, put women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.'' That's how I thought of him the morning after he called it quits. Not too shabby for an ordinary guy appointed by Ike.
He was a kinder, gentler Justice. One reason that that well-wrought phrase has become so potent is that it is so patently false. We have the sour disposition of a country with diminished expectations, a country whose people have been living through a depression both economic and spiritual.
It is a depression our government refuses to acknowledge, so the American people live with a sinking feeling that their sinking standard of living is a failure of the individual. ''I really don't feel like politicians have any connection to me personally,'' a college student told me. Our elections are as big, bright and empty as balloons.
Only one branch of our tripartite system is not governed at the highest levels by the ballot box, and that is the judiciary. No commercials with the flag rippling in the breeze, no slogans (''Blackmun - because it's your body''), no term of office. Nine private people spend their lives defining our own through cases. Behind those cases there are always human beings, who want to be spared loyalty oaths and censorship, who want to buy birth control devices and be admitted to good colleges. Justice Brennan seemed to pick the people out of the fact patterns, and to respond to their problems and their pain. Justice and mercy. Maybe that was not his job, but I'm glad he did it.
America is a country that seems forever either toddler or teen-ager, those two stages of human development characterized by conflict between autonomy and security. While some interpret this to mean we want neither to use the potty nor have a curfew, it's a tension that is one of our great strengths. Justice Brennan stressed both sides, the right to have government leave us alone in some cases and be our defender in others. The rights of the accused. Free, even objectionable speech. Affirmative action. The right to die, to do what we please in our bedrooms, to be protected from sex discrimination. The discussion of his retirement has centered on a single right, the right to a legal abortion, and that is sad because his vision was larger than that.
His detractors saw it as too large, a liberal agenda that made the Court into a legislator of public policy, not an interpreter of the Constitution. Judge Robert Bork, whose nomination to the high court was rejected by the Senate and who is still smarting from it, calls Justice Brennan ''imperialistic.'' Judge Bork is a fan of the framers, those increasingly popular guys who actually made up the Constitution, and whose intent has become a matter of great moment to some jurists. We have judges who talk about the framers as though they played squash with them regularly. It reminds you of the proprietary, slightly arrogant way in which born-again Christians talk about God. They know Him; you don't.
The only thing I know about the framers is that they were general kinds of guys. They didn't go on about the right to put fences around your farmland, or the right to pull your children out of school if the teacher taught sedition. They used broad terms. Life. Property. Liberty. They designed a document that wouldn't go out of fashion. Written by men whose wives couldn't vote and whose country permitted slavery, it has transcended their time.
Justice Brennan made it transcendent. His work is full of empathy, and that is an uncommon thing, not only in a judge, but in our society. We rarely take government personally, and so I was surprised to feel personally disenfranchised by his loss. I prize what Justice Louis Brandeis called ''the right to be let alone.'' I'm an individual. One of the best friends an individual ever had has left the arena, and we will all miss him, whether we know it yet or not.

HEADLINE: Gas Tax Hike Could Help Us Kick Auto Habit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Broad Benefits of a Gasoline Tax Hike'' by Charles H. Percy (Op-Ed, July 8) makes many good points; however, I believe there are other compelling arguments the former senator did not mention.
While a large gas tax will cause people to buy more fuel-efficient cars and possibly drive less, the indirect effects could produce far more good. When one looks at the Japanese economy, two things stand out: one is a fairly high saving rate, the other is a small proportion of automobile ownership. I believe they are related. 
In Japan, even the typical auto worker either rides a train or rides a bicycle to work. Despite Japan's high food and housing costs, the Japanese still manage to save a signficant part of their income. Certainly, one reason for that is that they are not spending $10,000 to purchase a car every three years. Nor are they spending $1,000 a year on insurance. And we haven't even mentioned maintenance.
It is a particular flaw in the American psyche that most Americans consider the purchase cost of a car an investment, like a house or stocks and bonds. The truth, of course, is that it is just money thrown away.
Since Americans, unlike the Japanese, now require two workers to support a household, we tend to have two or more cars per household. After taxes, most of the extra earnings go to that second car, rather than to enriching the family.
A significant boost in the gas tax, combined with the national trend to establish and expand city rail lines (for example, Los Angeles and San Diego) should have the macroeconomic effect of increasing our saving rate. The money not spent on cars, a significant portion of which goes overseas, will be available to spend on such things as personal computers and home appliances.
However, the macroeconomic effects will not only be at the consumer level. With fewer cars purchased, the money otherwise invested in auto production can be shifted to investment in domestic electronics, aerospace and housing. These shifts will strengthen the American economy. Though there will be economic dislocation in the auto industry, the positive effects of investment in 21st-century technologies will far outweigh the problems.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Blacks, Jews and 'This Thing That Is Suffocating Us'

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A black California official's comment earlier this month that leading Hollywood film and television studios and executives are guilty of ''Jewish racism'' set off the latest troubled round in the sometimes strained history of relations between blacks and Jews in the United States.
Jewish leaders were outraged that the comments by the official, Legrand Clegg, were made at the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and were not immediately repudiated by its executive director, Benjamin L. Hooks. Dr. Hooks later said he did not attack Mr. Clegg's remarks because ''racism does exist in Hollywood, but we disavow the existence of Jewish racism.''
While that may have pleased Jews, who are tired of debunking the myth that Hollywood is a monolithic Jewish enterprise, the issue lingers in the minds of many blacks as an example of what might be called the disavowal syndrome, the expectation that black spokesmen should immediately repudiate each and every black person whose comments are considered offensive to Jews, whether blacks view the comment as valid criticism or as ill-founded opinion. Blacks object to the treatment and doubt its effectiveness as a remedy. 
''Anytime any black person says anything that is taken to have a tinge of anti-Semitism, everyone is asked to publicly repudiate them,'' said Mary Frances Berry, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She added that there were blacks even wondering whether they would have to repudiate Nelson Mandela during his recent visit to the United States because of his statements in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Clegg, who is chief deputy city attorney in Compton, Calif., heads a group called the Coalition Against Black Exploitation, which attracted attention in 1985 when it protested the portrayal of blacks, particularly black men, in the movie ''The Color Purple.'' Because he was included in the N.A.A.C.P.'s program, along with more than a hundred other speakers, his remarks became a national test for Dr. Hooks: yield to pressure to repudiate the statements and risk the scorn of younger and more militant blacks, or risk a clash with long-time allies.
The relationship between blacks and Jews, an alliance forged at the turn of the century, has grown increasingly rancorous over such incidents.
In the early 1900's, blacks and Jews, whose histories have been laced with periods of exploitation and discrimination, cooperated in the founding of the N.A.A.C.P., and in the 1930's and 1940's, black and Jewish lawyers framed civil rights lawsuits across the South. These bonds held through the boycotts and protests of the 1950's and early 1960's, but by the late 60's, blacks became more assertive and determined to plot their own course. Differences among blacks and Jews over affirmative action, black support for the Palestinians, Israeli links with South Africa and a growing perception that prominent black organizations and their leaders were beholden to Jewish interests also drove a wedge into the coalition.
Many blacks have said they resented the repeated questions about Israel that reporters put to Mr. Mandela during his recent visit, because he had expressed support for Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization. They took the questioning as another sign of what is perceived to be undue Jewish influence over the news media.
''I think the black community was upset about Mandela and the fact that he had to prove himself to the Jewish community,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist. ''Blacks are troubled by what they see as Jews' hard line; that if you are for Palestinian rights, you are anti-Israel. If you slip or make a mistake, you're painted as though all your thoughts are anti-Semitic. That's what blacks objected to about Mandela's treatment.''
Jews saw it differently. They felt that Mr. Mandela, a man of high moral authority, was using a double standard in praising Mr. Arafat, Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Fidel Castro of Cuba solely because they supported the African National Congress, while ignoring their human rights records with the explanation that he didn't have time to look into the affairs of other countries and that it didn't concern him.
''I think a cause of real consternation and some of the anger shown by Jews was the knowledge that Mandela's best and only friends in South Africa were Jews who went out on a limb for him; people like Helen Suzman,'' a longtime member of Parliament and campaigner against apartheid, said Rabbi Joseph Glaser, executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.
''There were cries of anger and pain that somebody who we've been so supportive of could turn on us.''
Despite such frictions, it is easy to exaggerate the tensions between blacks and Jews. While blacks may have become more openly critical of Jews, the two groups continue to work together, despite disagreements, on important issues, most recently the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
 
Turning to Old Allies
''There is no absence of participation on the part of Jews when it comes to assisting on things that are of substance to black Americans and vice versa,'' said Harry Belafonte, the entertainer and civil rights campaigner, who helped organized Mr. Mandela's American visit.
''When we began organizing the Mandela trip, we turned to some of our traditional allies who are not black, whites of various persuasions and Jews, for assistance and expertise,'' Mr. Belafonte said. ''When we looked around for money, there were a number of people of the Jewish faith who were quite responsive to us. A lot of what went on was very low profile.''
Some blacks argue that a long-smoldering resentment is now more frequently expressed because blacks have more political and economic power and feel less dependent on the goodwill of Jews and other white liberals for financial support - long a staple of the civil rights community. The statements about Hollywood come, for example, as black entertainers and entertainment executives are having enormous impact on the popular culture. Spike Lee, Arsenio Hall, Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby, to name a few, have awakened blacks to their own power within the industry.
 
Becoming More Outspoken
Many believe the ascension of blacks to more powerful positions has enabled - some say freed -them to be more outspoken on any number of issues.
''The evolution of blacks in American history has set the stage in the present moment so that we will continue to be much more outspoken on all these issues than we have been in the past,'' said the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis, executive director of the United Church of Christ's Commission on Racial Justice. ''Ironic as that appears, there are some in the Jewish community who want us to go back to a kind of rhetorical captivity where we would think one thing and not say it. Now more than ever we say what we think, and that has caused some tension.''
What many are saying at social gatherings and in public meetings is that blacks have grown impatient with the disavowal syndrome. While blacks are not monolithic in thought or actions, many are frankly unwilling to ostracize members of the race because they offend the sensibilities of another group.
According to Robert L. Woodson, president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a community-action program in Washington, leaders of traditional black institutions are particularly frustrated by such situations, because they serve as opportunities to alienate further the blacks in the inner cities who see groups like the N.A.A.C.P. as bought and paid for by white interests. ''Anybody or anything that thumbs their nose at whites, or those defined as white people, we must be for,'' Mr. Woodson said in describing the feelings of others in the black community.
Some say this perception accounts, in part, for the popularity of Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam and the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York City. They are seen as men who speak their minds with no concern about consequences. Such speech can feel liberating, much like the lyrics of militant rap groups like Public Enemy. Moreover, many blacks who condemn the anti-Jewish remarks of such figures are hard-pressed to dismiss some of their positions about black life in America.
''When Farrakhan talks about black solidarity and economic independence, you can't dispute that,'' said Dr. Hooks. ''I would look like a fool.'' Some blacks also argue that while Jews seem to use Israel as a ''litmus test'' of black people's loyalty, they often do not acknowledge similar tests on issues of concern to blacks. It has not been forgotten that prominent Jewish figures have been visible opponents of affirmative action, for example.
''Blacks feel very strongly about affirmative action being our litmus test,'' said Ms. Berry. ''Yet Jewish leaders don't repudiate things that interfere with black aspirations.''
But Jewish groups that have opposed affirmative action say they do so on a philosophical basis.
''We see race-based preferential treatment as unconstitutional,'' said Jill Kahn, associate director of legal affairs for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, one of the groups that actively opposes affirmative action programs that rely on goals and timetables.
''I think that among all civil rights groups, there is agreement that the goal is equal opportunity and the removal of any barriers to employment,'' she said. ''It is the method used to achieve this goal that we disgree about.''
For some Jews, quotas are reminders of a painful period in history when such limitations were used to restrict the number of Jews permitted in colleges and businesses and when covenants kept them out of certain neighborhoods.
Indeed, Jews and blacks now diverge sharply on political priorities.
While a secure Israel is still of paramount importance to most American Jews, many blacks believe it is unconscionable to expect them to support Israel while that country continues to supply arms to the Government of South Africa, and they feel solidarity with Palestinians.
''I think even those blacks who don't know the history identify with the Palestinians because they see them as an oppressed people with no land,'' said Ms. Berry.
The pressure to disavow blacks' statements about Jews is doubly distasteful, in the view of some blacks, because it seems to offer so few rewards. Jesse Jackson's apology in 1984 for having referred to New York as ''Hymietown'' is an oft-cited example.
''The perception is that Jesse has been singled out for too long for his 'Hymietown' remark,'' said Harry A. Robinson, a black man who is senior vice president of the National Conference of Christian and Jews.
Mr. Belafonte said that blacks expect more of America's Jews. ''There are some of us who believe that, given the Jewish religious ethic and historical experience, there should be greater sensitivity expressed on the part of Jews to the experience and struggles that blacks have had, so we hold them more accountable,'' said Mr. Belafonte.
''Still, Jews played a large part in opening doors that had been closed to blacks,'' he said. ''Had they not, we would not have been able to achieve a lot that we have. We need to talk very seriously and completely about this thing that is suffocating us. This anti-black perception in Jews and this anti-Semitic perception in blacks. We'll all be better for it.''

HEADLINE: The World;
In Quebec, Yet Another Splintering

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
In English-speaking regions of Canada, many spy an enticing irony in the crisis currently gripping Quebec. In the midst of the French-speaking province's renewed debate over independence, it has found itself confronted by an angry minority of its own, Mohawk Indians. Just as Quebecers have claimed to be a ''distinct society'' within Canada, so too are we, the Mohawks have proclaimed from the armed camps they have established across two highways near Montreal. If Quebec is a nation unto itself, say the Mohawks, no less so are we.
As the confrontations between masked Mohawk ''warriors'' and 1,500 provincial police officers entered their third week at the tourist town of Oka, 20 miles northwest of Montreal, and at the Mercier Bridge, just to the south, there was more than political embarrassment for Premier Robert Bourassa and the province's other political leaders. Together, the premier and the leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois have urged a new relationship with the rest of Canada since the collapse last month of a constitutional deal that would have opened the way for Quebec to assume broad political autonomy. Many people expect a commission report this fall to recommend that Quebec become a nation-state, in practice if not immediately in law. 
If the Mohawks have their way, their fight for historical rights will not only cut across the province's push to be ''master in its own house,'' but could halt it altogether. For the Mohawks are at the cutting edge of a drive by Quebec's 50,000 Indians and Inuit - the people hitherto known as Eskimos - for the restoration of traditional lands accounting for 85 percent of the province. Even if the natives end up with a much smaller proportion of the province's 595,000 square miles, many of their leaders will oppose Quebec independence. ''Our spirit is North American,'' says Konrad Sioui, president of the Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador. ''We don't want to be squeezed inside another border. We have suffered enough from them already.''
For many of the 19 million Canadians outside Quebec, the Mohawks have thus become allies of a kind. And even among Canadians sympathetic to Quebec's desire to protect its French culture, there has been a lesson in the television images transmitted nightly from Quebec. In the Mohawks manning barricades with assault rifles and submachine guns, in the angry crowds of commuters who have burned straw effigies of Mohawks at the Mercier Bridge, and in the tense lines of police officers anxious for an opportunity to avenge the 31-year-old officer killed in an attempt to storm the barriers in Oka, these Canadians believe, there is a blunt reminder for Quebecers of the miseries that can flow from any overzealous assertion of minority rights.
Still, the broader implications of the Montreal confrontations hardly ease the anxieties of the rest of Canada. What is happening at Oka, where a dispute over expansion of a golf course has escalated into the most serious confrontation over native rights in decades, may prove to be a watershed in the fight for similar rights across the country. Native groups have asserted their historic rights to roughly half of the country. Along with most of Quebec, the land claims would give the natives title to almost all of British Columbia, to virtually the entire region around Ottawa, and to broad areas of the prairie provinces, southern Ontario, and the Atlantic region.
As a matter of demographic reality, the most that the Government and the courts are likely to concede is a fraction of what the native groups have demanded: together, Indians and Inuit account for barely 5 percent of the national population of 25.5 million: 470,000 are registered Indians, 750,000 are of Indian descent but live off reservations, and 33,000 are Inuit. But the crisis at Oka has served notice that the days of native passivity and patience are at an end. Some Indian leaders have compared the resort to armed defiance in Quebec to the rioting that swept the black ghettos of America in the 1960's, and they have said that Canada, in seeking a remedy, faces a generation of soul-searching and commitment.
 
Economic and Political Implications
For Quebec, the economic as well as political implications are far-reaching. Among the land claimed by the Indians is the James Bay region, in the far north, where Mr. Bourassa is forging ahead with a mammoth hydroelectric development that he envisages as the linchpin of Quebec's economic expansion. In the 1970's, the first phase of the project barely survived a legal challenge by Cree Indians. The $7.5-billion expansion seems likely to meet a still more resolute challenge. The Cree have said any effort by construction crews to drive to the area will be met with armed resistance.
For now, the shock to Canadians of seeing Quebec held ransom by armed gunmen has been compounded by reports that as many as 40 of the 150 armed men at the Oka barricades are Mohawks from the New York side of a native reservation, the St. Regis-Akwesasne, that straddles the Canada-United States border.
All the same, in demanding more land and the right to self-government, the Mohawks appear to have struck a responsive chord. The federal Government, while branding the Oka gunmen as ''criminals,'' has offered to buy the 55 disputed acres to turn them over to the local Mohawks. In British Columbia, which has hitherto refused to acknowledge any ''aboriginal rights'' to land but which has seen road and railway blockades multipy in sympathy with Oka, the premier has signaled that the province will move toward a more sympathetic stand. But only time will tell whether these more generous policies will hold once the implications of ceding large areas of land begin to sink in for the non-natvies.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Carl Sommers

 BODY:

Convertibles in France
Q. We want to rent a convertible in France to go from Lyons to Paris. - Jaci Murphy, New York
A. The four big car rental companies all have covertibles in France, but in limited numbers and not always at all locations. You are advised to reserve your car as early as possible. There is an additional 25 percent V.A.T. charge, unless noted. 
Hertz (800-654-3001) does have some Ford Escort convertibles in Lyons and Paris. The rate is $93 a day plus 85 cents for each kilometer; for a week it is $1,159 with unlimited mileage.
Avis (800-331-1084) has convertibles, Volkswagen Golf or Opal Kadett, only in Cannes, Nice and Antibes. The cost is $193 a day or $966 a week, both with unlimited mileage.
National's European affiliate, Europcar (800-227-3876), has Volkwagen Golf and Peugeot 205 convertibles available only in Nice and Marseilles. The daily rate is $88.58 a day plus 90 cents a kilometer; the weekly charge is $1,457 with unlimited mileage, including tax.
Budget (800-472-3325) has some convertibles in France, but a spokeswoman said that the company would not confirm rentals of convertibles because there were so few of them. It's a good idea, she said, to ask if one is available when you arrive.
 
New Orleans Jazz Festival
Q. How do I get on the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival's mailing list? Are there bed and breakfasts or inexpensive hotels in the French Quarter? - Hank Kornfeld, Mahopac, N.Y.
A. The festival will next place April 26 through May 6, 1991. If you contact the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (1205 North Rampart Street, New Orleans, La. 70116; 504-522-4786) and give your name and address, you will be sent a brochure including a mail order form, when brochures become available.
Travel New Orleans (434 Dauphine Street, New Orleans, La. 70112; 800-535-8747) is the festival's official tour operator and sells packages that include housing, admission to the festival and transfers to the grounds from the French Quarter, where most of the hotels it works with are situated. Package details should be available by September. According to a representative, the least and most expensive hotels are booked first, as early as October.
Bed and Breakfast Inc. (800-749-4640) is a reservation service that represents about 50 homes in the New Orleans area, with rooms $36 to $226 a night. The New Orleans Hotel Association (330 Exchange Alley, New Orleans, La. 70130; 504-525-2264) will mail a free New Orleans Lodging Guide on request.
 
Vienna, Turkey, Yugoslavia
Q. We want to visit Vienna, Yugoslavia and Istanbul. We do not want to be with a group all the time but don't want to be totally on our own either. We would also like to make excursions outside the cities. - Renee Reed, Tulsa, Okla.
A.This is possible, but requires stitching together several programs offered by tour companies that combine some structure with plenty of time on your own in the places you wish to visit. You can make reservations on your own, using the example below, but a travel agent might know of similar options and could make travel arrangments connecting the packages.
One possibility is combining two packages offered by American Express, in Vienna (and other places) and in Turkey, with one offered by Pan Am Holidays in Yugoslavia. American Express (800-637-6200) has a city package that includes hotel, daily breakfast, a city sightseeing tour, and airport transfers. Participants are met at the airport by an American Express representative. There are packages of three nights,$169 to $439 a person, depending on hotel and six nights, $299 to $809, with charges for additional days. For more structure, and a chance to see other places, the company has what it calls a freelance package with three nights in Munich, two in Salzburg and three in Vienna. Travel between the cities, which is included in the price, is by bus, but in 1991 it will be by train. The package includes sightseeing tours in each of the cities, eight breakfasts, one lunch and two dinners. A host or hostess will be available at your hotel at certain times to provide guidance. The cost is $1,075 to $1,239 a person, depending on hotel. The prices do not include fare to and from the starting and finishing point.
These trips could be combined with an American Express package in Turkey. An Istanbul city package, $279 to $415, includes two half-day sightseeing tours and daily breakfast. A package with additional stops, ''Incredible Cappadocia,'' includes four nights in Istanbul, and a night each in Ankara and Nevsehir. The cost is $770 to $963 a person and includes air fare between the cities, nine meals (mainly breakfasts), two half-day Istanbul tours, a half-day tour of Ankara and a day-and-a-half tour of Cappadocia. There will be a host or hostess available at the hotel.
These tours can be combined with a Pan Am Holidays (800-843-8687) package in Yugoslavia. While these tours usually include air fare from New York, the company will sell just the land package. Those on a six-night ''Glorious Dubrovnik'' package add tours outside the city for about $30 each. The current cost is $680 to $980 a person, depending on hotel, going down to $280 to $580 a person the last two weeks in October. ''Yugoslavia as You Like It,'' six nights, can begin in Dubrovnik, Zagreb or Belgrade and includes an economy-size rental car with unlimited mileage and hotel vouchers for 74 cities. The land cost is $770 a person in the summer, down to $430 in late October.
 
Brancacci Chapel in Florence
Q. I plan to visit Florence in late September expressly to see the restored frecoes in the recently reopened Brancacci Chapel. However, I read that the chapel is being closed again for further work. When will it be reopened for public viewing? - C. H. Huvelle, Litchfield, Conn.
A. In the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, the Brancacci Chapel, which reopened June 7, is still open, according to Florence city officials. However, if you wish to see the chapel and its frescoes, painted mainly by Masaccio in the 15th century, you will need to visit by Sept. 16. After then, officials will decide if the chapel's altar is to be moved and, if so, where. It is possible that the chapel will stay open after then, with some restrictions, but there is no guarantee. Groups of up to 30 visitors are allowed in each 20 minutes between 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Saturday and 1 to 5 P.M. on Sunday. (Closed Aug. 15.) The cost of a tour is about $4.30. Information: 055 211876.

 BODY:
The anti-Reagan forces will have to try harder. Extremes of income and wealth are a fact of capitalism, but one that is really beside Phillips's point. The Reagan era has brought the longest economic expansion in American history. What matters is whether the vast majority of Americans benefited from the expansion. They did: their real disposable personal income rose every year between 1982 and 1989. Whether the expansion created a few more billionaires is irrelevant.

When Parentheses Are Transgressive

BYLINE: By Richard Bernstein; Richard Bernstein is a national cultural correspondent of The Times. William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
Rewriting the (Post)modern: (Post)colonialism / Feminism / Late Capitalism'' read the brochure advertising a conference that I attended at the University of Utah in March. The program was full of fashionable academic jargon - phrases like ''reified theory,'' ''(post)structuralist tropics'' and ''the racial subject'' - all of it standard lexical fare in the arcane world of literary criticism.
The parentheses were placed not only around words but also around parts of words. There was one paper titled ''Locating Un(re)presentable Desire: Narrational Transformations and Postmodern Man.'' Another was ''It's Not (Post) Until it's Post(ed): (Post)modernism and the Terminological Endgames of Terrorism.'' 
Trendy academic language has always kept me mindful of certain phrases from George Orwell's ''Politics and the English Language,'' particularly the one in which he likens the users of prefabricated jargon to ''cuttlefish squirting out ink.'' Yesterday, the cult terms were ''intertexuality'' and ''the signifier.'' Today, it's parentheses carving up words like scimitars.
But a few months before the Utah meeting, my skepticism was challenged. At the convention of the Modern Language Association, the major professional body for academic literary critics, I ran into Philip Auslander, a professor of English at the Georgia Institute of Technology. ''Why shouldn't literary critics have a technical language to express their ideas, in the same way that physicists or engineers do?'' he asked.
Why indeed? What the lit crits argue is that they are looking at the world in a new way, a way that requires the invention of a new language. Nobody objects to the linguistic innovations of Freud or Einstein, necessary to express meanings that nobody else had expressed before. Why should the acolytes of the great French post-structuralists, like Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, be any different?
And so I went to Utah scribbling words and phrases into my notebook and asking conferees to explain them. My first question concerned those parentheses.
''They show that there are discontinuities in the discourse,'' said H. Aram Veeser, of the English department at Wichita State University in Kansas, using a bit of lit-crit jargon to explain another bit. ''The parentheses are a way for the word to deconstruct itself on the page,'' he continued. ''It shows the word fragmenting into its different meanings and parts.''
Teresa Ebert, a conference organizer who teaches English at the University of Rhode Island, called the parentheses ''a denaturalizing term''; they are part of ''resistance post-modernism'' and ''transgressive strategies'' aimed at the status quo. In other words, the parentheses are in and of themselves a challenge to conventional and dominant assumptions, a way of catching the reader's eye and making him think again about meanings he had always taken for granted.
This forms a good part of the academic enterprise these days and informs much of the jargon. A powerful tendency in the age of deconstruction is to question the way culture has traditionally been examined. And so, at the M.L.A., for example, there are a lot of expressions being used to describe power and the way it is wielded through the ''texts'' of our society.
Our basic values constitute what is commonly called the dominant discourse. A very dominant discourse is a totalizing discourse, or sometimes a meta-narrative. The damage reputedly done to those outside the power structure might be referred to as ''the ravages of totalizing narratives.'' To be a rebel in this sense is to fight the meta-narrative. This gives rise to some quirky definitions. Kerry McKeever of the University of Idaho provided a new one at the Utah conference. ''Terrorism,'' she said, ''is a way of wounding the body of a dominant discourse.'' ON THE OPPOSITE ENDJU of the linguistic-political scale are a host of terms that describe those on the receiving end of ''patriarchal authority.'' Most common at the M.L.A. convention was the marginalized subject - ''subject'' having become the preferred lit crit term for person, self, individual. In Utah, the word subaltern took precedence.
Subaltern, made fashionable in some circles by a group of scholars from Calcutta who publish a journal called Subaltern Studies, refers to anybody who is low on the totem pole: the inhabitants of the third world, women, homosexuals, members of minority groups. Anyone outside of patriarchal authority is by definition a subaltern subject. Why subject? We are not selves, is the answer. We are subjectivities. An endless parade of impressions pummels our consciousness with inconsistency, indeterminacy, contradiction. Thus we, too, are not stable but always shifting. The word subject, a conferee said, puts the stress on process, rather than on fixity.
There are many other trendy terms. Commodified is very big; it refers to the tendency of capitalism to transform everything into a salable commodity. ''A commodified subjectivity'' is a way of looking at a world strongly influenced by late-20th-century materialism.
And then there is the frequent use of the suffix ''ality,'' which is tacked on to many words, usually adjectives but sometimes nouns. The various Utah sessions produced such ''-alities'' as postcoloniality, positionality, ideality, intentionality, temporality, globality, marginality, circumstantiality, potentiality, institutionality, paradoxicality, conditionality and traditionality.
''The suffix makes what was a temporary qualifier into a permanent feature of the landscape,'' Professor Veeser said. ''I mean, if you just use the word 'postcolonial,' you have to specify a postcolonial this or a postcolonial that. But if you use postcoloniality you give substance to that formerly abstract, helping term. Now, it is empowered as a word. It gains independence, clout all by itself.''
Why then positionality rather than, simply ''position,'' which is already a noun, already an empowered word, one with clout? I asked this question of Professor Veeser with a little vignette from the M.L.A. conference in mind. The members of a panel on the ''canonicity'' of Shakespeare were all sitting on the left side of a table, a fact that the panel chairman turned into a political metaphor. ''We're all on the left,'' he said. ''That's our positionality.''
The use of the suffix in this instance has to do with the complexities of the modern world, a world in which people can no longer be easily identified with some simple, overriding concept like economic class. Each person is embedded in a whole complex of sometimes contradictory positions. The word positionality in this sense says: nothing is as simple as it looks.
And so, the big question: Was this lingo squirted out by Orwell's cuttlefish or is it really useful? I contend that positionality is as inky as a word can get. And yet there is a seductive quality to some of this terminology: it has a cultish sensuousness to it. As the lit crits might put it, you become part of the transgressive, rather than the dominant, discourse. You are a member of the club.

HEADLINE: The Tragedy of Detroit

BYLINE: By Ze'ev Chafets; Ze'ev Chafets is the author of ''Devil's Night: And Other True Tales of Detroit,'' to be published by Random House in October and from which this article is adapted. Copyright c 1990 by Ze'ev Chafets.

 BODY:
It was in the Fall of 1986 that I first saw the devil on the streets of Detroit.
We were introduced by a friend who works for a local radio station. ''Spend the evening before Halloween with me and I'll show you something you've never seen before,'' he promised. ''People try to burn down their own neighborhoods. They call it Devil's Night.''
I vaguely remembered Devil's Night. When I was a kid growing up in Pontiac, just north of Detroit, it had been a time of harmless pranks -window soaping and rolls of toilet paper in the neighbors' trees. But it had been 20 years since I had lived there, and a lot of things had changed. 
One of them was Devil's Night. Two years earlier, in 1984, for reasons no one understands, America's sixth largest city erupted into flames. Houses, abandoned buildings, even unused factories burned to the ground in an orgy of arson that lasted for 72 hours. When it was over, the papers reported more than 800 fires. Smoke hung over the city for days.
The bizarre outburst turned into an annual tradition. By 1986, Devil's Night had become a prelude to Halloween in Detroit in the way that Mardi Gras precedes Lent in New Orleans, and even my friend's dramatic description did not prepare me for what I saw. From early evening, fires flared throughout the city. Police helicopters circled overhead and fire trucks, sirens blaring, raced from one conflagration to another. At every stop, people gawked at the flames and passed around bottles of whisky and thermos caps of coffee.
The fires raged on and on, more than 200 that night (and, I later learned, almost 400 in the three-day Halloween period). Detroit is a city of one- and two-story homes, most of them built on narrow lots. During the last 30 years, the city has lost almost half its population, and there are entire blocks where all but one or two houses are boarded up and vacant. Some parts of the city look like pasture land. Flames raced through the brush and into abandoned buildings. The gawkers cheered the firemen and jostled one another happily.
At dawn, on the way home, I asked my friend what it was all about. ''Damned if I know,'' he said. ''Frustration, anger, boredom. I only work here. I stopped trying to figure out this city a long time ago.''
So had I. In 1967, I moved to Israel, and for years I rarely thought about Detroit. I knew that the auto industry was in bad shape; that the 1967 riot had sent whites fleeing to the suburbs in droves; that the city was now mostly black, and that the national press referred to it as ''Murder Capital, U.S.A.'' Beyond that, Detroit held little interest for me.
But the fires of Devil's Night sparked my curiosity. I found myself unexpectedly drawn to my old hometown, and resolved that night to come back to the city and write about it.
I FLEW BACK TO DETROIT IN LY 1988. From the air, the urban sprawl seemed as intricate and harmonious as a Persian carpet. The sun glinted off the Detroit River, which separates the city from Canada, and winked back from the skyscrapers in Detroit's compact business district.
I could see the wide boulevards that fan out, like the fingers of a hand, from the city's riverfront center: Jefferson Avenue, which runs parallel to the river, past the Chrysler factory, out to the WASP stronghold of Grosse Pointe; Gratiot (the name a homage to Detroit's origins as a French trading post, but pronounced locally as ''Grashit''), leading to the Polish and Italian suburbs of the northeast; Michigan Avenue, which passes Tiger Stadium on its way west to the Ford plants, and, bisecting the city, Woodward Avenue, heading north past the mile roads - Five, Six, Seven - all the way out to the city's border, Eight Mile Road.
The geography of Detroit has not changed since my childhood. It is the demography that is different. In 1960, there were 1,670,000 people in the city, about 70 percent of them white. Poles and Italians lived in neat, boxlike homes on the east side. Jews and WASP's inhabited more substantial brick houses on the other side of Woodward Avenue. Blacks, who made up less than a third of the population, were crowded mostly into small neighborhoods downtown, near the river.
In those days Detroit was less a big city than a federation of ethnic villages bound together by auto plants. The only hint of sophistication was downtown. Woodward Avenue was lined with mock Gothic churches, an art museum and library, fine shops and grand theaters. At the heart of the hub were skyscrapers, citadels of commerce where the paper work for the Motor City of the world was signed and filed. Detroiters felt an awe and affection for their downtown center that was unmatched in other, more urban cities.
The bubble burst on July 23, 1967. A police raid on an after-hours club on 12th Street, in the heart of the black ghetto, erupted into rioting. Forty-three people were killed in the streets - most of them blacks gunned down by police or the National Guard. Whole neighborhoods were looted and torched. Eventually, President Johnson sent in 4,700 troops from the elite 82d and 101st Airborne Divisions.
The riot was the worst of 59 urban racial disturbances across the country in 1967; indeed, in terms of property damage and lives lost it was the worst in the 20th century, and its impact on the city was dramatic. ''For Sale'' signs sprang up in every white neighborhood, seemingly in front of every house. There had always been a lot of vacant land outside the city, and Detroit's suburbs had been expanding slowly since the 1950's; now developers threw up houses, schools and shopping malls beyond Eight Mile Road, and a mass exodus began. As it proceeded, people suddenly discovered what should have been obvious - that apart from the glittering downtown, the leafy neighborhoods, there was another city: poor, black and angry.
FOR YEARS, DETROIT'S GROWING BLACK population had been dealt with through repression and neglect. The police department recruited racist Southern cops; blacks took a risk just walking down Woodward Avenue. Residential segregation and urban renewal, which plowed down the old Black Bottom ghetto without replacing it, caused extreme overcrowding.
After the riot, Detroit's shift from a prosperous white city to a poor black one came extraordinarily fast; within six years, it had a black majority and a black administration, led by the city's first black Mayor, Coleman A. Young. The shift was more complete than in other major American cities. Chicago maintained stable white ethnic neighborhoods and a vital business district; Washington remained anchored by the Federal Government, which provided jobs; in Atlanta, mayors from the civil-rights movement built economic and political alliances with white suburbia.
But in Detroit, events conspired to leave the city uniquely impoverished, abandoned and militant. The bottom fell out of the auto industry, causing mass unemployment. The abundance of land beyond the municipal boundaries enabled suburbanites to create an alternative downtown in the suburb of Southfield. And the new Mayor was a militant former union man who consolidated power by adopting a confrontational policy toward the city's suburban neighbors.
Detroit today is a genuinely fearsome-looking place. Most of the neighborhoods appear to be the victims of bombardment - houses burned and vacant, buildings crumbling, whole city blocks overrun with weeds and the carcasses of discarded automobiles. Shopping streets are depressing avenues - banks converted into fundamentalist churches, party stores with bars and boards on their windows and, here and there, a barbecue joint or saloon.
Worst of all is the downtown. Several of the landmarks on Woodward Avenue remain, and in the last few years, there have been several grandiose building projects, but they can't obscure the fact that downtown Detroit is now pretty much empty. Entire skyscrapers - hotels, office buildings and apartment houses - are vacant and decaying; you can walk a downtown block during business hours without passing a living soul.
Suburban whites are dismayed by the physical degeneration of what was once their city; but they are truly terrified by its racial composition, and the physical threat they associate with blacks, who constitute between 70 and 80 percent of the population. Some, mostly elderly, whites still live in the extremities of the city, and municipal employees are required to reside there by law (although many have fictitious addresses). But in most parts of town, most of the time, Detroit is as black as Nairobi.
THE WHITE ABANDONMENT OF Detroit, coupled with the collapse of the auto economy, has left the city with a diminished tax base and a set of horrific social problems. Among the nation's major cities, Detroit was at or near the top in unemployment, poverty per capita and infant mortality throughout the 1980's. And shortly after I arrived in town, the local papers published the F.B.I.'s crime statistics for 1987, a compilation that showed Detroit once again leading the nation's major cities in homicide.
There were 686 homicides in Detroit in 1987 - almost 63 per 100,000 people. (Since then, the rate has declined slightly, and Washington has become the nation's leader.) Atlanta, second among major cities in 1987, averaged 48 per 100,000. The papers also published charts showing Detroit's homicide rate over the previous eight years. During that time, the city averaged 47 per 100,000 - almost 50 percent more than second-place Dallas.
I asked a local reporter if things were really as dangerous as they seemed in the news media. ''Are you kidding?'' he said. ''They're worse.'' And he took me to meet John.
John, who asked that his last name not be used for the sake of his family's safety, operates a small grocery with his two brothers in southeast Detroit. He was born in the city, in 1956; his parents, Iraqi Christians known as Chaldeans, came from a village not far from Baghdad.
The Detroit area has the largest Arab population in the United States, estimated at anywhere from 80,000 to 200,000. Since 1967, Syrians, Palestinians and, especially, Chaldeans (who often do not consider themselves Arabs, but are generally regarded as such by outsiders) have replaced the Jews and other white ethnics as the city's shopkeepers. Roughly 70 percent of the neighborhood grocery stores in Detroit are owned by Arab-Americans and Chaldeans.
These merchants, known locally as A-rabs, are enormously unpopular in the black community. Their control of the city's petty commerce is a rebuke to blacks, who have been unable or unwilling to set up their own stores, and relations between the two groups are often tense.
''They exploit us,'' said Robert Walls, a senior official in the city's Neighborhood Services Department. We were sitting in his office with his boss, Cassandra Smith-Gray, and George Gaines, the deputy director of public health, talking about the lack of black commerce in the city. When the subject of Arab merchants arose, the conversation turned angry.
''Let me tell you about overcharging,'' Gaines said. ''They operate on pure greed.''
''It is greed,'' said Smith-Gray. ''And it's the way they act toward us. You can go into some stores where kids have to walk with their hands at their sides'' - presumably an antishoplifting measure.
''Or, only one child at a time is allowed in,'' Gaines added. ''If there's another riot in Detroit, it will be against the Chaldeans.''
But like all the coins in Detroit, this one has another side. Since 1960, roughly 100 Arab and Chaldean merchants have been murdered in their stores. Six of them were related to John. Not long before I met him, his first cousin was murdered. Someone had ambushed him in a parking lot, stolen his cash and left 22 bullet holes in him.
''You may not believe this, but right now my family is involved in three separate murder trials,'' said John.
A single man with hard brown eyes, a soft voice and a weight-lifter's torso, John and his brothers had just bought a second store, in the suburbs, and they split the work, each putting in about 100 hours a week. ''Nobody does anything out of the family,'' he said. ''We are all in partnership or no one is. One pocket, one heart.'' Every night at 10:45, just before closing time, John's father calls the store. He always has the same message - ''Watch yourself,'' a Chaldean warning. At precisely 11, the brothers take their money home. ''We have the same ritual every night,'' John told me. ''Just before going out we say, 'Eyes open,' and then the lead man goes out with an automatic weapon and scans the street. If things are clear, the others follow with drawn weapons. There's no talking - it's done that way. You get careless, you get burned.''
The brothers have never been held up - a record that John attributes to the family's honest business practices and its militance. ''When we caught shoplifters we never used to call the cops,'' he said, preferring the past tense. ''We took care of things in our own way. But we don't look for trouble. We've got a friendly store. Come over any night and you'll see.''
The following Friday I took him up on his offer. After all the horror stories I had heard, I was surprised by the relaxed atmosphere in the store. Customers, mostly black, bantered with John and his brother, exchanging neighborhood gossip. John flirted amiably with several of the young women and they flirted back. Over the cash register there were snapshots of kids from the block.
His vigilance, however, was constant. The store's security system could be fairly characterized as forbidding. The front door has a permanent squeak, to let the brothers know when someone comes in. They work behind a thick shield of bullet-resistant glass, and behind the counter keep a small arsenal - a .44 Magnum, a 9-millimeter pistol, and a couple of AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifles.
Friday nights are especially busy, and the brothers waited on a steady stream of customers. During the week, when things are quieter, they go downstairs into the basement and take target practice in a makeshift pistol range.
The basement serves a less sporting purpose, too; it is where the brothers take shoplifters. ''We handcuff them to this,'' John said, pointing to a metal post. On the other side of the room, on a chain-link leash, was the family Doberman, Taza - ''tender'' in Chaldean Arabic. When extended, the leash lets Taza come within inches of the genitals of the thief. After a few charges, thieves usually get the point. ''At the end of the evening we come down, beat their ass and send them home,'' John said.
One of John's hobbies is monitoring the police radio. That night we heard a weekend crackle of announcements - shootings, break-ins and other assorted crimes. John didn't seem to be listening, but suddenly he held up his hand for silence. Together we heard the report of a holdup at a nearby grocery store.
John dashed from behind the counter, jumped into a van parked outside and headed for the scene of the crime. As we raced through the ruined streets of the east side it crossed my mind that if anything happened, my friends in Tel Aviv would never believe that I was killed trying to protect an Arab grocer.
To my profound relief, it proved to be a false alarm. John turned the van around and drove back toward his store. We hadn't gone more than a few blocks before spotting an agitated crowd of kids on the front lawn of a ramshackle house.
John pulled over. As we got out, we saw a boy, maybe 14, lying on the grass, oozing blood from a knife wound in his chest. A friend held his head in his arms and moaned softly, ''Don't die, Matthew, don't die now, baby,'' but the stabbed boy didn't respond. Neighbors on either side of the house stood on their porches and watched the scene with dismay. In the distance, we heard the sound of an ambulance siren. Within a minute or so it arrived, and stretcher bearers took the boy away. ''God damn this city sometimes,'' John said.
FROM 1979 THROUGH 1986, DETROIT'S juvenile homicide rate was more than triple that of the combined juvenile rate for the nation's 10 largest cities. Shortly after that statistic appeared in the newspaper, I asked a black journalist why Detroit's kids are so violent.
The reporter regarded me with disdain. ''Drugs, unemployment, babies making babies,'' she said, reciting the causes in a bored tone. I had asked a naive question, and she was letting me know it. I also detected a note of resentment in her voice.
Throughout my stay in Detroit, the only real hostility I encountered was from members of the black intelligentsia. Some were better at concealing it than others, but very often there was an unspoken question in the air - What the hell do you care? White apathy regarding the fate of blacks in general, and black children in particular, is so pervasive that interest is automatically a cause for suspicion.
This is reflected in the antipathy that many blacks, including black journalists, feel toward the Detroit newspapers and television affiliates. The major media are all white-owned and operated, and most of their reporters and editors live outside the city. Several years ago, black reporters at The Detroit News staged a weeklong byline strike to protest discrimination in assignments, and most of them, at The News and elsewhere, continue to believe that press coverage of black affairs swings between the sensational and the apathetic.
Certainly this is true in the case of teen-age violence. Particularly gruesome killings, especially when the victim is white, get front-page treatment. But average murders are reported on inside pages under laconic headings like ''In This Weekend's Shootings.'' Partly this is the old journalistic rule that a dog biting a man is not news; every year, upward of 300 kids - under the age of 18 - are shot in Detroit; last year, 71 were killed. But it is also true that black teen-agers killing one another is of scant interest to the upscale suburbanites who are the media's target market.
In the city, however, where hardly a family has been untouched by adolescent violence or drug addiction, the question of kids - how to raise them, protect them, defend yourself against them - is a constant topic. In a strange way it reminded me of Israel, where parents are universally concerned about their children's compulsory military service. Yet the chances of a teen-ager being shot on the streets of Detroit are far greater than those of an Israeli soldier being wounded in combat.
Clementine Barfield learned that in July 1986, when her 16-year old son, Derick, and his 15-year-old brother, Roger, became 2 of the 365 children shot in Detroit that year. Roger survived; Derick did not.
''After Derick was murdered, about a month later, I began looking for a support group,'' said Barfield, a large, gentle-faced woman with a lilting Mississippi accent, as we sat in her office on the second floor of an old schoolhouse on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. ''But there was none. So I went out and started one.'' The name of the group is Save Our Sons and Daughters - Sosad.
Half a dozen women, mothers of slain children, were in the Sosad office that day, performing the menial tasks that go with running an organization. They worked quietly while Clementine Barfield, a frequently interviewed woman, patiently retold the story of the day that changed her life.
''The day before it happened, there had been an argument in school and a boy pulled a gun on Roger,'' she recalled. The next day Derick and Roger went looking for the boy. He saw the Barfields first, sitting in their car in a gas station. Afraid they had a gun, the boy fired four shots into the car and fled. The gunman was 18 years old; he was sent to jail. ''The family of the killer lost their son, too,'' said Barfield. ''It's a thin line between victim and murderer in the black community.''
Mrs. Barfield handed me a copy of the program for Sosad's first Mother's Day benefit. It was a glossy booklet, featuring page after page of ads - memorial messages from bereaved parents, with pictures of their murdered children.
''There is a war in Detroit,'' Barfield said. ''And young black men are the targets. Our sons are at risk - to suicide, murder, jail and hopelessness. Really it's genocide; the enemy is the society that has forced the situation on them. Right now, the largest employer of young men in Detroit is drugs.''
Genocide seemed a strong word; after all, the vast majority of black victims are killed by other black teen-agers. ''Statistically that's true,'' she conceded, ''but it's misleading. The real enemy is hopelessness.''
One of the women who had been stuffing envelopes when I arrived was listening to our conversation. Suddenly she began to sing, in a soft, mournful contralto: ''Reach out and touch somebody's hand, make this a better world if you can,'' she sang, and the other ladies in the office put down their papers and joined in. A phone rang but no one answered it. Instead they sang on, mothers lamenting a generation of hopeless, furious, defenseless children.
ACCORDING TO A STUDY published by the University of Chicago in 1988, the suburbs of Detroit are the most segregated in the United States. Many blacks look beyond the Eight Mile Road border and see an undifferentiated, uncaring world of suburban affluence where they are neither liked nor wanted. As Arthur L. Johnson, head of the local N.A.A.C.P. observed, Detroiters know they aren't loved by their neighbors. During the years of the great white exodus, this antipathy was impersonal. It got a face in 1973, with the election of Mayor Coleman Young.
The problem started with Young's inaugural address, in which he warned hoodlums - whether they're wearing ''Superfly suits'' or ''blue uniforms with silver badges'' - to ''hit Eight Mile Road'' and keep on going. The idea of Detroit policemen crossing the boundary didn't seem to bother suburbanites, but they were mightily exercised by the prospect of a legion of Superfly bad guys invading their turf. A more politic mayor would have tried to mend fences, but Young is not a fence-mender. He dubbed his neighbors ''the hostile suburbs'' and mounted a campaign of verbal and political harassment that has continued with little abatement.
In the fall of 1986, for instance, Young gave an interview to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. The occasion was Detroit's No Crime Day, and the interview, which has become legendary, went, in part, like this:
CBC: What would happen if you went door to door and started collecting all the guns?
Young: Well, then people wouldn't have guns to shoot at each other. I have no problem with collecting all the guns if it is done like you do it in Canada. But I'll be damned if I'm going to let them collect guns in the city of Detroit while we're surrounded by hostile suburbs and the whole rest of the state who have guns, where you have vigilantes, practicing Ku Klux Klan in the wilderness with automatic weapons. I am in favor of everyone disarming; I'm opposed to a unilateral disarming of the people of Detroit.
Actually, the four million people of the metropolitan Detroit area - including Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties - are subdivided by ethnicity. Macomb, to the northeast, is blue-collar territory; a large percentage of its people are second- and third-generation Poles and Italians who are refugees from Detroit. Oakland, to the northwest, is the second wealthiest American county among those with a population over 1 million, and it is dominated by WASP's, and to a lesser extent, Jews. Detroit itself is in Wayne County, where, outside the city, there is a substantial populations that is working-class Southern white, Hispanic and Arab.
In most ways, the towns of this tri-county area have little in common; what they share is an estrangement from Detroit. Unlike the suburbs of other major cities, they are not bedroom communities. The average suburbanite almost never visits the city - much less has any reason to want to live there.
As for traffic the other way around, moving to the suburbs, even for those who want to, isn't so simple. Detroit's suburbs did not get to be the most segregated in the country by accident.
A generation ago, when I was growing up in nearby Pontiac, Grosse Pointe had a ''point system'' to keep out undesirables. Prospective buyers were rated by skin color, accent, religion and other criteria, including a ''typically American way of life.'' Under the system, blacks, Mexicans and Orientals were automatically given a failing grade, as were virtually all Jews and southern Europeans.
In Dearborn, the seat of the Ford empire, segregation was less scientific, but equally virulent. Mayor Orville L. Hubbard, a vocal segregationist, was kept in office for 36 years by an admiring populace who subscribed to his antiblack attitude. ''I just don't believe in integration,'' he said in 1967. ''When that happens, along comes socializing with the whites, intermarriage and then mongrelization.''
This sort of blatant race-baiting has all but disappeared from the public discourse of metropolitan Detroit. The fact is, civil-rights legislation and black political activism have chipped away at institutionalized racism. In the summer of 1988, for example, Dearborn was forced to accept its first black police recruit. A smattering of blacks now live there and in Detroit's other working-class suburbs. Even Grosse Pointe has a handful of wealthy black residents. Today, the main obstacles to integration are economic and social. Realtors say there is no place in the Detroit area where a black can't buy a home, but the cost is often prohibitive. The most modest white neighborhoods in the suburbs are more than twice as expensive as comparable areas in the city - precisely because they are white. And those blacks who can afford to move often feel unwelcome.
Nowhere is this truer than in Warren, a small city just east of Detroit, inhabited largely by Poles and Italians. Twenty years ago, a mixed couple tried to move in, and police had to be called to protect them from outraged mobs. A few years later, the city turned down badly needed H.U.D. money because it meant building integrated housing. Today, the only important black institution in Warren is the Detroit Memorial Park Association, the metro area's largest black burial ground; and most Warrenites want to keep it that way.
''The attitude isn't as much racist as one of fear,'' said Richard D. Sabaugh, a county commissioner and public relations executive who, as a Warren City Councilman, helped lead the H.U.D. fight. ''People don't see every black as bad. But the image of Detroit is of a decaying, crime-ridden city headed by a mayor who makes racist remarks. We view the values of people in Detroit as completely foreign. We just want to live in peace. And we feel that anybody coming from Detroit is going to cause problems.''
Sabaugh, who ran unopposed in his last contest, faithfully mirrors the views of his constituents. ''It's all as one complex - blacks, Coleman Young, crime, drugs, Detroit,'' he said. ''People feel they've been driven out once, and it could occur again.''
Considering the conditions in the city, I wondered if anyone felt compassion for its residents. Sabaugh seemed amazed at the notion.
''Any sentiment to help Detroiters? Not at all. I've never heard that. If you ever asked to raise taxes to help Detroit, it would go down 15 to 1. Guilt to help people who won't help themselves? That's a thought that's not even tolerated. If they saw a young kid in a destitute situation, there might be some compassion. But otherwise, no. There is no feeling of pity for Detroit in the suburbs.''
IN THE FALL OF 1988, A DETROIT television station ran a profile of Mayor Young. Young's relations with the local media have been stormy, but the documentary was complimentary, and the Mayor seemed to be enjoying himself. The high point of the show came when he discussed his warm personal relations with former President Jimmy Carter.
''He is a very moral, very religious person,'' said Young, and his eyes crinkled and shoulders shook in the mirthful gesture that usually precedes his one-liners. ''Now I'm not immoral, but I've never been accused of being too moral, either.''
It is one of the few accusations he has escaped during a public career that has spanned almost 50 years. Young has been denounced as a heartless big-city boss and a ruthless dictator. In the suburbs, he is considered a black racist; in the city, following his refusal to support the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential bid, some people labeled him an Uncle Tom. There is only one thing that everyone agrees on: Coleman Young, 72 years old, the Mayor of Detroit since 1974, who was elected to a fifth term last November, is a formidable and fascinating man.
Many Detroiters can never remember another mayor. Today, there is a Coleman A. Young community center on the east side and a Coleman A. Young civic center downtown. Accomplished schoolchildren receive financial aid from the Coleman A. Young Scholarship Fund. The Mayor's picture hangs in virtually every city office; his name is inscribed on the stationery of city officials, and on their personal calling cards. A few years ago, he had it plastered in huge letters on the tower of the Detroit Zoo, which is located in suburban Royal Oak. This was vintage Coleman, an in-your-face gesture to the white suburbanites.
The Mayor has the ability to captivate white people in face-to-face encounters. He is capable of cordial, even close relations with trusted whites, and he has been able to build strong working relationships with a number of wealthy businessmen. But these are always based on mutual interest, never on sentiment. Coleman Young is the black Mayor of a black city, a fact never far from his consciousness, and he has cast the city government in his own image. Five of the nine members of the City Council are black. So are the chief of police, the fire chief, three of the four current police commissioners, the heads of most city departments (and, although Young does not appoint them, both Congressmen, the superintendent of schools and a majority of the city's judges). The few whites on the Mayor's personal staff are usually in positions that require liaison with the outside world.
Most people simply take the black complexion of the administration for granted. After all, Coleman Young is not exactly the first big-city mayor to provide patronage and power to his own supporters. But Young has done more than broaden access to the pork barrel. Under him, Detroit has become not merely an American city that happens to have a black majority, but a black metropolis, with all the trappings of a third-world city - showcase projects, an external enemy and the cult of personality. Detroit has even developed a quasi-official ideology that regards the pre-Young era as a time of white colonialism, ended by the 1967 insurrection and its aftermath.''
Not surprisingly, some of Coleman Young's closest associates identify readily with Africa and the third world.
''Race is the element that makes Detroit completely different from other American cities,'' said Ronald Hewitt, the city's planning director. ''We are seen as not just black, but aggressive and assertive. The situation here is very similar to post-colonial situations in the third world. People always say, 'The Africans can't govern themselves' and that's what they say about us, too.''
Hewitt, no less than Young himself, regards the relationship with the white communities as an ongoing war of liberation. ''If you feel at the end of every day that you have struggled, that's liberating,'' Hewitt said. ''That's probably the extent of the black man's liberation in America. Now, we may lose the struggle with the suburbs, but we will make it interesting. They better bring their lunch.''
COLEMAN YOUNG HAS been divorced twice and lives alone in the Manoogian Mansion on the Detroit River. He travels the city in a midnight-blue limousine (''You want a Cadillac mayor, you buy him a Cadillac'') with two bodyguards and a police escort, earns $125,000 a year and dresses in expensive, double-breasted suits. The trappings of wealth and power convey a message, but they don't conceal, and are not meant to conceal, the fact that he is still a street man, a signifying mayor who uses the style and language of Black Bottom to delight his supporters and shock his opponents.
It took me about three days in Detroit to realize just what a powerful man he is. For one thing, none of the municipal officials I contacted for appointments would return my calls. ''In this city, nobody will say anything without Coleman's O.K.,'' a reporter explained. ''You better see him and let him know what you're up to.''
I tried but it wasn't easy; you need a sponsor to get an appointment. Finally I found somebody who knew somebody who talked with Young's spokesman, Bob Berg. After a few weeks of negotiation, I was eventually granted an audience.
I arrived at the mayoral mansion on a sweltering August afternoon. An aide ushered me into the living room and told me to wait. After half an hour or so, Bob Berg appeared and walked me upstairs to the Mayor's study, a cluttered and mercifully air-conditioned room. There, at half past three in the afternoon, I found the Mayor of Detroit dressed in blue pin-striped pajamas and a checkered bathrobe.
The television set in the room was tuned to CNN, and a deck of playing cards sat on the desk. Interviewers often mention the fact that the Mayor conducts conversations while watching the tube and playing solitaire. The implication is that he is easily distracted, or perhaps a bit eccentric. But, as I came to discover, there is a white interpretation of Young's actions, and a black one. Toward the end of our conversation that day, I asked him why he kept the television on.
''I don't really watch this thing,'' the Mayor said, gesturing toward the set. ''But I like to have it on in the background. See, I don't want people listening in on my conversations.'' This is not paranoia; several years ago, during an investigation into a municipal scandal, the F.B.I. bugged the Mayor's private town house. And what about the solitaire? ''I only play when I get bored,'' said the Mayor dryly, and his shoulders shook with silent laughter.
Humor is Coleman Young's great solvent. He uses it to shock and deflate, charm and conciliate. Young has the timing of a professional comedian and the keen ear of an impersonator. He is able to switch back and forth effortlessly between perfectly crafted English and street talk. The latter is used primarily to disconcert what he calls ''the black boogie wazzie'' and other ''phony-ass people.'' Since unknown white visitors are all suspect, he usually prefers to begin with profanity and jive, enabling him to size them up on his linguistic turf.
That afternoon, when I entered his office, the Mayor was engrossed in some official papers. After a time he looked up and shook his head. ''They want me to pass out free condoms, because of this AIDS thing,'' he said, dropping the documents on the desk with an exasperated gesture. ''Hell, why do I have to get involved in this? I neither condemn, nor do I condone, ah . . . '' - he used a familiar profanity referring to the sex act, then paused and peered out of narrowed eyes for my reaction. ''Mr. Mayor,'' said Berg, ''this interview is on the record.'' ''Oh,'' said Young, in mock alarm. ''Well, in that case, you better say that I, ah, condone it. I don't want people to get the wrong idea about me.''
He peered across the desk again. I don't know what he saw, but he was apparently satisfied; he conducted the rest of the interview in more or less conventional language.
Young's conversational style is rambling and circuitous, but he always returns to the point, which is usually connected with white racism and its crippling effect on blacks. Some of this is posturing, calculated to create an us-against-the-world atmo sphere that he can use for political gain.
But there is no doubt that militance is more than a tactic; Young genuinely sees the world in racial terms. And when it comes to assessing guilt, he refuses to play the liberal game of dividing the blame. ''I view racism not as a two-way street,'' he once told a conference on race relations. ''I think racism is a system of oppression. I don't think black folks are oppressive to anybody, so I don't consider that blacks are capable of racism.''
Young also rejects the popular notion that the problems of black people - and of black Detroit - are a seamless web. ''I'm not going to buy that vicious cycle theory,'' Young told The Detroit Free Press in 1987. ''It starts with economic pressure, and the first economic pressure was slavery. . . . It reminds me of something Martin Luther King said: 'How do you expect us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps when we don't even have boots?' ''
Paradoxically, some blacks feel that Young himself has opened the door for white interference. Since taking office he has concentrated on rebuilding the downtown, and most of his grandiose projects have been financed and built by whites like Henry Ford 2d and Max Fisher. The Mayor is unapologetic about the strategy - which he views as necessary for creating jobs - or the tactic of marshaling suburban help: ''Ain't no black people wielding any of the major power - economic power - in this city,'' he said.
The inability to translate political control into economic self-sufficiency is perhaps Young's greatest frustration. The dominant theme of his administration has been to get more black numbers on the scoreboard, but judged by that standard, he hasJU been a disappointment. Only 14 black-owned companies in Detroit earned more than $10 million in 1987, and 6 of them were auto dealerships. Even more revealing, of the 25 largest black-owned companies, just 2 were building firms; their combined income was only $6.6 million.
The sense that Detroit has been fleeced and abandoned runs through Young's conversation. So does resentment of whites who have left but continue to meddle in the city's affairs. ''I don't know of any other city in the nation where there's such a preoccupation in the suburbs for control,'' he told me. ''The same people who left the city for racial reasons still want to control what they've left.''
The Mayor's critics contend that his tough racial rhetoric has kept whites from moving back to the city, but he dismisses the notion. ''White people find it extremely hard to live in an environment they don't control,'' he observed archly.
Black control of Detroit was very much the issue in the mayoral campaign of 1989, in which Coleman Young defeated Thomas Barrow, a 40-year-old black accountant with a reputation as a consensus-builder and a base of white support, more than half of whose campaign contributions came from suburban donors. The contest wasn't even close; Young was re-elected by a margin of 56 percent to 44 percent, with almost 70 percent of the black vote (and only 13 percent of the whites').
On election night, several thousand people packed Cobo Hall, the convention center on the river, to celebrate Young's fifth consecutive victory - executives with $1,000 suits and street people in jeans and tornJU sweaters; church women wearing huge crosses and sophisticated ladies in ball gowns and glittering jewelry; aging auto workers sporting U.A.W. jackets and young Muslims dressed in white robes and skullcaps. This was no rainbow coalition; there weren't more than a couple of dozen whites at the celebration.
In his speech that night, Young congratulated David N. Dinkins for being elected Mayor of New York and L. Douglas Wilder for winning the governorship of Virginia, two men whom television pundits were already heralding as exemplars of the new black politician - moderate, mainstream liberals, successful because they eschew racial rhetoric. Listening to Young, it occurred to me that in Detroit, they wouldn't have had a chance.
TWENTY YEARS IN THE Middle East have given me a good eye for tribal animosity, and in Detroit I recognized it. Strangely, it didn't seem personal. The local disposition is mild, even friendly. Black and white Detroiters rarely meet, but when they do - at work, in suburban shopping malls or at other neutral sites - it is not at all unusual for them to get along amicably.
No, the tribal rivalries, fears and hatreds in Detroit tend to be collective, almost abstract. Each side has an orthodox, almost ritual explanation for what has happened to the city they once shared and no longer do. It is not surprising that each side blames the other.
Tom De Lisle is an engaging man in his early 40's who grew up in Detroit and served as an assistant to the city's last white mayor, Coleman Young's predecessor, Roman S. Gribbs. De Lisle dresses like the 1960's are still on, in jeans and boots. His hair is unfashionably shaggy and he has the down-to-earth amiability found in many educated Detroiters of his generation. Although he now lives in the suburbs, he still works in town, as a producer for WDIV, the NBC television affiliate. His views encapsulate the white version of what went wrong.
''This is the place where the wheels came off the wagon of Western civilization,'' he told me. ''This town has become unlivable. What I want to know is, where's the outrage? There is no outrage here. ''You'd think there would be an outcry, or at least some sympathy for the victim. Detroit is as helpless and hopeless a place as any in America.''
Tom De Lisle is not unaware of the conditions that brought the city to its present state. ''It was never easy to be a black in Detroit,'' he conceded. ''Blacks felt - rightly - victimized. There were always racist cops. But the riot never stopped in Detroit. Both the criminals and the cops understood that it was a whole new ball game. In the 70's, it was like a gang war between the blacks and the cops - and the blacks won.''
The flight to the suburbs was, in De Lisle's view, a simple desire to escape the endemic violence of the city. ''In metropolitan Detroit today, fear is the most pervasive single factor,'' he said. ''When I worked for the Mayor, almost every member of his staff suffered a major crime. One night someone pumped three shots through my window for no reason. One of the Mayor's secretaries was brutally raped. In the City-County Building. During working hours.
''Everything goes back to the racial situation. Detroit has been the first major American city to cope with going from white to black. And whites left. That's the American way - people have a right to move in, or move out. There's evidence to point out that white people who moved had something to fear. Who wants to put their kids in a situation where they are likely to be crime victims? That's as basic as life gets.''
I heard this view repeated a hundred times. It is a constant refrain - blacks, especially black violence, drove people out of their homes and their city.
This is the white way to look at it; but Arthur Johnson reminded me that there is another perspective as well.
Johnson, president of the Detroit branch of the N.A.A.C.P. and a vice president of Wayne State University, is a scholarly-looking man with thick glasses and a white beard. He leads an organization that for many years symbolized moderation and interracial cooperation. But when we met in his office on the campus of Wayne State, he sounded anything but moderate on the subject of his white neighbors.
''Blacks in Atlanta feel their city is loved,'' he said. ''Here, white people are proud to say, 'I haven't been downtown in 10 years.' We know we're not loved. We know our city has been scarred by the media on an unprecedented scale. I attribute this to the fact that we have a black majority and black leadership. Detroit has unjustly come to represent the worst in America. If they make that stick, it is possible to justify our neglect and separation.''
Johnson, who serves as one of Detroit's four police commissioners, is not naive about the city's problems. But in his view, they spring not from black incompetence, or violence, but from white hostility.
''Whites don't know a goddamned thing about what's gone wrong here. They say, 'Detroit had this, Detroit had that. . . .' But economic power is still in the hands of whites. It's apartheid. They rape the city, and then they come and say, 'Look what these niggers did to the city,' as if they were guiltless.''
De Lisle spoke about the death of a city; but to Arthur Johnson and the rest of Detroit's black intelligentsia, something is being born in Detroit.
''Detroit has helped nurture a new black mentality,'' he said, pounding his desk for emphasis. ''More than any other city, blacks here make an issue of where you live. If you're with us, you'll find a place in the city.''
Whites often say, in their own defense, that many middle-class blacks also leave the city at the first opportunity. I mentioned this to Johnson, but he waved it away. ''The majority of the black middle class is here,'' he said. ''We are engaged in the most determined, feverish effort to save Detroit. Why? Because Detroit is special. It's the first major city in the United States to have taken on the symbols of a black city. It has elected a strong, powerful black mayor, powerful in both his personality and his office. Detroit, more than anywhere else, has gathered power and put it in black hands.''
My own instincts and experience told me that each man was, in his own way, right. It is hard to deny the harsh portrait of the city painted by Tom De Lisle. Judged by the standards of the white middle class, it is an urban nightmare, a place that offers neither safety nor prosperity to its citizens.
At the same time, I remain intrigued by Arthur Johnson's concept of Detroit as a developing black polis. It's the Israeli part of me in particular that responds to that notion. Israel, like Detroit, is a place where people with a history of persecution and dependence finally gave up on the dream of assimilation and chose to try, for the first time, to rule themselves. Both are rough, somewhat crude places. Both feel embattled and both have learned hard lessons about the limitations of going it alone.
Indeed, during my stay in Detroit, I came to regard the city as isolated and nearly autonomous, struggling for economic survival and political self-determination. But of course it isn't; Detroit is located firmly in the American heartland. For almost a century, it has been the bellwether of urban change, a place that pioneered the assembly line and the $5 day, where great unions first rose and fell, and where the pinch of foreign economic competition was initially felt. Now it has become the first major city to be abandoned by its white citizens and to pioneer black political self-rule.
The bitter controversy over who is to blame for Detroit's problems may be insoluble, but to my mind, blame is largely beside the point. Detroit will either be helped or it won't. And that decision lies, first and foremost, with those who have the capacity to extend aid.
Money is one answer, but not the only one, and perhaps not the most important. What must come first is an emotional reconciliation that will enable the black polis to rejoin the American family and to accept help without feeling humiliated or being robbed of its political gains. This aid must be given not out of guilt, or fear, but with generosity and good will. If it is forthcoming, Detroit could well become the model for an American racial modus vivendi. If it is withheld, America's first black metropolis - and its white neighbors - may be headed for a Devil's Night that will never see the dawn.

HEADLINE: The Language Thing

BYLINE: By Maureen Dowd; Maureen Dowd is a White House correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Yes, the President talks funny. Yes, he gets tangled in wayward clauses and preppy adverbs, dangling predicates and galloping gerunds. Yes, he never met a pronoun he liked or a non sequitur he could resist. And no, they are not saving space for George Bush, between Edmund Burke and Cato the Younger, in future editions of ''The World's Great Speeches.''
Not since Warren G. Harding left town has a President been so mocked for his speech. ''He writes the worst English that I have ever encountered,'' H. L. Mencken said of President Harding. ''It reminds me of a string of wet sponges. . . . It is so bad that a sort of grandeur creeps into it.'' When Harding died, E. E. Cummings lamented, ''The only man, woman or child who wrote a simple declarative sentence with seven grammatical errors is dead.'' 
President Bush enjoys a similar arm's-length relationship with the English language, as the columnist Mary McGrory put it. But I come to praise Bushspeak, not to do the bury thing. Let us examine the case for Bush's fractured syntax, with a handful of reasons why the Me-Tarzan-You-Jane school of oratory may be underrated. 1. Being mush-mouthed can give a country-club President the common touch. As Alistair Cooke noted: ''Americans seem to be more comfortable with Republican Presidents because they share the common frailty of muddled syntax and because, when they attempt eloquence, they do tend to spout a kind of Frontier Baroque which is sanctioned by long familiarity.''
Bush may have traveled to kindergarten in Greenwich, Conn., by limousine, but Dana Carvey, the ''Saturday Night Live'' comedian who mimics Bush with tinny voice and flapping arms, says the President ''has the basic demeanor of a guy flipping burgers at a barbecue and talking off to the side.''
The anti-rhetorical President gave this answer to a Knoxville high-school student who wanted to know if he would seek ideas overseas to improve American education: ''Well, I'm going to kick that one right into the end zone of the Secretary of Education. But, yes, we have all - he travels a good deal, goes abroad. We have a lot of people in the department that does that. We're having an international - this is not as much education as dealing with the environment - a big international conference coming up. And we get it all the time - exchanges of ideas.
''But I think we've got - we set out there - and I want to give credit to your Governor McWherter and to your former Governor Lamar Alexander - we've gotten great ideas for a national goals program from - in this country - from the governors who were responding to, maybe, the principal of your high school, for heaven's sake.''
During a commencement speech in the South, Bush began to rhapsodize about a tour of the Lincoln Bedroom he had given Vaclav Havel, the President of Czechoslovakia: ''And the look on his face, as the man who was in jail and dying, or living - whatever - for freedom, stood out there, hoping against hope for freedom.''
During the recent economic summit in Houston, at a dinner at the Museum of Fine Arts, the President of the United States toasted his fellow world leaders: ''Simply, we want you to have a very good time in this museum that we, at least in Houston, are very proudful of.'' 2. The unusual childlike quality of the 66-year-old President's speech tends to make him sound sincere.
In Chicago last month, Bush described his job to a group of children: ''It's full-time work. It's very interesting. You meet interesting people. It's very important. It's exciting. You live in a beautiful White House.
''After supper, guess who we walk with?'' he added excitedly. ''Millie! So it's not all hard work.'' When he read the youngsters a story, he confided, ''I read so much sometimes I start to read backwards, which is not very good.''
On a visit to a child-development center in Washington shortly after First Dog Millie had her litter, Bush regretted that he had not brought along some pups in a basket. ''Kids just love those little fuzzy things,'' he said.
At a fund-raising luncheon in Omaha, Bush finally articulated a vision thing: ''We need to keep America what a child once called 'the nearest thing to heaven. And lots of sunshine, places to swim and peanut-butter sandwiches.' '' 3. For Washington, a town that cannot get enough obscure jargon, Bush's speech patterns are gratifying. The more references he can drop to M.F.N., G-7, Start, GATT, R.&D., D.O.D. and Cocom, the better. ''My allied colleagues and I should agree to take up these ideas at the C.S.C.E. summit this fall, to be held around the signing of the C.F.E. treaty,'' trips off Bush's tongue the same way ''Ask not what your country can do for you'' rolled off John F. Kennedy's. 4. The President, who calls himself ''a restrained kind of guy,'' likes to strip the ideological edge from statements and speeches. After defending his much-criticized China policy at a press conference, he said, beaming: ''So, I'm glad you asked it because then I vented a spleen here.'' He says over and over that he wants to behave without ''a rancor in there'' with former adversaries like the Soviet Union and Congressional Democrats. He does not want to offer a ''situation of dictation'' to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. With world leaders, Bush prefers ''presenting argumentation'' or ''the process of dialoguing'' - or even ''trialoguing.''
Since he hates to take a stand on anything and since he wants to try to please all of the people all of the time, the President has become a master at using language - not to reveal, but to obscure. When reporters try to pin him down on critical differences of opinion, he slides away, saying he wants to be ''very up-front,'' but he doesn't want to ''get into semantics.''
Questioned about Gorbachev's claim during a superpower summit in Washington that the Cold War was over, Bush turned on his verbal fog machine: ''I see this glass not half empty, but half full and more,'' he told befuddled journalists. 5. The President has chased away all the fussy majesty of the Reagan years with his casual, slangy mode of expression. After his session at Camp David with Gorbachev in June, Bush noted with satisfaction: ''No neckties. Very relaxed.'' After his birthday a few days later, he reported: ''Good cake, good cards and not bad.'' Chatting by phone with the astronauts on the space shuttle Atlantis, he asked, ''How was the actual deployment thing?''
Bush once said that the speech he most admired was the thick one that Teddy Roosevelt had in his pocket that had helped cushion the blow of a would-be assassin's bullet. His allusions are not to de Tocqueville or Jefferson but to his mom and to Millie.
No longer afraid of elitist metaphors, the President said he would try to ignore tension over the budget sessions by sharing the advice his mother gave him about staying calm while learning to snorkel: ''So tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel above the water level.''
White House officials used to struggle to explain novel Bush phrases, but now everyone is accustomed to the way the President talks. When a reporter quizzed him last year about his role in the Iran-contra scandal, the President blithely mixed his metaphors, somehow combining a running meter with an hourglass.
''You're burning up time,'' he warned the reporter. ''The meter is running through the sand on you, and I am now filibustering.''
The official White House transcript of the press conference mistakenly reported the President's comment to the reporter as something a bit more bellicose: ''The meter is running. Throw sand on you.''
It did not strike anyone at the White House as odd.

THE RAIN CAME LAST & OTHER STORIES
By Niccolo Tucci.
223 pp. New York: New Directions.
Cloth, $22.95. Paper, $10.95.
NiccolO Tucci has been churning out his autobiography for over 40 years, mostly in short stories published in magazines like The New Yorker and Harper's, but also in memoirs and novels written in both English and Italian. Inevitably his project makes one wonder whether it rests on a life that is sufficiently representative to support such obsessive retelling, or on an ego that cannot think beyond its own experience and therefore must repeatedly impose its limited perspective on the world. This selection of pieces written between the mid-1940's and the early 1960's shows that both apply in Mr. Tucci's case. 
Born in 1908 in Switzerland, the son of a Russian mother and an Italian father, Mr. Tucci enjoyed a privileged upbringing, studying with private tutors and at European and American universities. The Bolshevik Revolution irrevocably altered his family's situation by removing their considerable financial base and forcing them to relocate to a small Tuscan town where his father could practice medicine. Mr. Tucci embarked on a career as a Fascist politician in Mussolini's Press Ministry, but in 1938 he resigned and immigrated to the United States, ''where,'' as he puts it, ''nothing and no one awaited me but hunger and despair.'' He settled in New York, writing at first anti-Fascist propaganda and then the autobiographical stories by which he came to be known to American and Italian readers.
The 14 stories in ''The Rain Came Last & Other Stories'' sketch the trajectory of Mr. Tucci's life from his childhood to his mother's death in 1939. ''Terror and Grief'' provides a glimpse of the affluent and cultured setting in which he and his siblings were raised: while their parents travel through Europe, sending back postcards from France, Italy and Hungary, the children remain in their lavishly furnished apartment, amid Greek and Arabic manuscripts, Italian Renaissance paintings and Chinese jades, engaging in childish rivalries and submitting to the stern discipline of their German governess. ''The Beautiful Blue Horse,'' set in Italy after the family's declassement, depicts the father's disgruntlement at being sold what he believes to be an inferior horse. ''Military Intelligence'' satirizes the Fascist imposition of ''military culture'' on Italian universities during the 1930's, exposing it as a sham exercise in revisionist history.
Judging merely from the episodes Mr. Tucci has chosen to narrate, his life can indeed be called representative. Yet what his stories represent most effectively is the passing of European aristocracy and the tenaciousness with which it held on to its class consciousness, its elitism, its high esteem for wealth and erudition. Story after story positions the reader in this aristocratic stance, asking him to adopt a strong antipathy for commerce and industry, to suspect the motives of provincial businessmen, to disdain the poor and ''their narrow ways.'' The ''ignorant horse dealer'' comes to personify greed, even though ''we were unwilling to pay what he was asking for the horse,'' writes Mr. Tucci, ''solely because we were obliged to practice various disagreeable economies in order to reconstruct the family fortune.'' ''History Comes C.O.D.'' opens with a Tuscan proverb, ''Who says administrator says thief,'' and then relates an incident designed to prove it.
A striking example of how class bias shapes the stories occurs in the different handling of two Italian words, both of which poke fun at the poor for their lack of education. A priest uses the word ortodossa to inform ''the peasant people'' that Mr. Tucci's mother is a member of the Russian Orthodox Church. And when they begin to cross themselves in front of the family's house, Mr. Tucci explains that the word ''sounds rather ominous to illiterate ears, because 'un orto d'ossa' means a yard full of bones.'' Elsewhere we learn that the name of a farmer's wife, ''strangely enough, was Gorilla. She came from one of the many Gori families and there were several girls named Gorilla Gori.'' Yet the name appears strange only because Mr. Tucci fails to add the sort of detailed explanation he gave for the epithet used to describe his mother. He could have noted that the Italian suffix illa conveys both smallness and affection, and so ''Gorilla'' would have been a term of endearment in the Gori families - not to mention that the farmers probably never heard of the animal of that name. Mr. Tucci's stories present ample evidence for the crushing poverty of the farmers but lack the generous sympathy the material seems to demand.
The class bias is not immediately apparent because of Mr. Tucci's witty, elegant style. His narratives unwind effortlessly in the most translucent prose, making even tragic events somehow more bearable. The artfulness of the stories can function as a compensation for the displacements in his own and his family's lives, as an appropriately refined way to come to terms with the ravages of history. The problem is that Mr. Tucci surveys historical change from the vantage of a rather elite group, demonstrating that his art can redeem life, but only at the cost of repressing its complexities.

HEADLINE: The Looting of Wedtech

BYLINE: By ANDREW FEINBERG; Andrew Feinberg is writing a book about personal debt.

TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
The Outlandish Story of Wedtech.
By James Traub.
Illustrated. 379 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $21.95.
 
FEEDING THE BEAST
How Wedtech Became the Most Corrupt
Little Company in America.
By Marilyn W. Thompson.
Illustrated. 337 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $22.50.
The notorious Wedtech fiasco cost taxpayers and investors about $300 million, which by Reagan-era standards seems like a fine on an overdue library book. Despite its low-rent status, however, the scandal remains a wonderfully sleazy and improbable tale, with a hallucinatory ''only in America'' quality. 
Here in the land of opportunity, a small South Bronx machine shop can use influence peddling and bribery to become a large defense contractor. Here an illiterate Hispanic entrepreneur can purchase Democratic Congressmen, a New York City borough president, Republican bureaucrats, a former White House aide and, indirectly, perhaps even an Attorney General - just like anybody else. Given the ethical climate of the last decade, it is strangely appropriate that former President Ronald Reagan in 1984 called John Mariotta, the founder of Wedtech, ''a hero for the eighties.''
The most nightmarish aspect of the Wedtech affair is that a bunch of losers who could barely run a business - remarkably, Wedtech was always on the verge of bankruptcy even when the fix was in - could be so good at finding the right palms to grease. In ''Too Good to Be True,'' a delightfully written book, James Traub compares the unworldly Wedtech crew to innocents abroad - they certainly never planned to become criminals. They were merely very open to learning how the world actually worked. Was merit irrelevant for a company seeking a minority-business contract from the Small Business Administration or a friendly nod from a Pentagon procurement officer? Hmmm, how interesting. And how convenient.
So Wedtech's executives began to take a series of outrageous shortcuts. They falsified the company's minority status, freely handed out bribes and gave huge campaign contributions to those politicians who preferred to take their bribes in a legally sanctioned form. Wedtech threw money at the system and, in return, it received large contracts to build Army engines and Navy pontoons. Once corrupted, the Wedtech crew showed little restraint. Top executives began looting the company shamelessly, stealing millions while the accountants and investment bankers casually looked on.
Wedtech had some good civics teachers, such as former Congressman Mario Biaggi, who told the company how much influence a $20,000 annual retainer to his law firm would buy. The loathsome legislator, whose greed was unseemly even by criminal standards, eventually demanded $5 million in Wedtech stock plus 5 percent of the dollar value of all Government contracts - far above the going Congressional rate. (Mr. Biaggi got the stock, plus eight years in prison.) Wedtech always managed to find such people. ''Destiny sometimes seemed to escort Wedtech through the world with a lantern, looking for yet another dishonest man,'' writes Mr. Traub, a New York City journalist.
Ronald Reagan was one of those drawn to the light. When he listened to the nearly incoherent babbling of John Mariotta (who described himself as ''a New York Rican . . . an individual that cannot speak English and cannot speak Spanish''), he heard a kind of music. Here was a man who could take drug addicts and ex-cons off welfare without squandering any Federal funds on the poor. (In the Reagan era, of course, Federal funds were supposed to be squandered on the rich.) For Mr. Reagan, Mr. Mariotta embodied capitalism's heroic assault on urban blight; he was a walking, talking enterprise zone.
One of the tragedies of Wedtech is that Mr. Mariotta and his colleagues really did take society's castoffs and give them decent jobs and self-respect. Mr. Mariotta was a charismatic leader who inspired tremendous loyalty. The workers were never the problem at Wedtech.
Edwin Meese 3d wasn't the problem, either. Both Mr. Traub and Marilyn W. Thompson, author of ''Feeding the Beast,'' suggest that Mr. Meese's actions in the case probably should have been rewarded with an indictment. The former Attorney General directed one of his deputies to help Wedtech win its $32 million Army contract. (According to Mr. Traub, Mr. Meese later lied to investigators about his actions.) And, by discussing Wedtech's status ad nauseum with his best buddy and Wedtech consultant E. Robert Wallach, he gave the clear impression to everyone involved that he was willing to use his public office for his friend's private benefit.
Mr. Traub and Ms. Thompson think the special prosecutor was far too gentle with Mr. Meese. (Two of Mr. Meese's top aides did resign because they agreed with Federal prosecutors that their boss was ''a sleaze.'') Intriguingly, what seems to infuriate both authors most about Mr. Meese is his astonishingly casual assumption of virtue for everything he did - no matter how great the stench of impropriety. Mr. Meese emerges as a hypocrite of grotesque proportions - our Mr. Pecksniff or Uriah Heep.
Happily, the rest of the Wedtech cast is also extraordinarily colorful, if not quite Dickensian. There's Fred Neuberger, Wedtech's sex-obsessed president, later vice chairman, who often had Three Stooges-style fights with Mr. Mariotta during which they screamed, wrestled and threw coffee and furniture at each other. Typically, the two entrepreneurs argued about how much they should steal from their company and which bribed officials offered the biggest bang for the buck. Mr. Neuberger is serving a Federal prison term on fraud and conspiracy charges.
Then there's E. Robert Wallach, the foppish lawyer who was Mr. Meese's best friend. He was not content to view his buddy's elevation as the opportunity of a lifetime to buy influence; with Mr. Meese in the Cabinet, Mr. Wallach also thought he could ooze his way into Federal policy making. Mr. Wallach was convicted last year on racketeering and fraud charges.
And there's Stanley Simon, deemed by Ms. Thompson ''perhaps the stupidest man ever to serve as Bronx borough president.'' Mr. Simon, now serving a five-year sentence in a Federal prison, is depicted as a shnorer, a moocher, the kind of man who would shake down his administrative assistant for lunch money. But Wedtech needed him, too, to handle local issues.
And it needed the fancy accountants, lawyers and investment bankers who did all they legally could to help Wedtech commit its myriad frauds and felonies. When examining the actions of the Touche Ross accountants and Squadron, Ellenoff, Plesent & Lehrer lawyers, both Mr. Traub and Ms. Thompson conclude that six- and seven-figure retainers can often work just as well as outright bribes.
Mr. Traub's is by far the best of the Wedtech chronicles. It is elegant, funny and, for the most part, exciting. Ms. Thompson, who helped break the story as a reporter, has more prosecutorial zeal - perhaps not surprising since Wedtech hit her and The New York Daily News with a $1 billion libel suit. Unfortunately, her book is sometimes confusing and filled with cliches (''However, the memos fell on deaf ears''). An earlier book, ''Feeding Frenzy'' by William Sternberg and Matthew C. Harrison Jr., is an amusing and informative account, though less effervescent than Mr. Traub's ''Too Good to Be True.''
Ultimately, though, the whole story is more depressing than most tales of white-collar crime and political malfeasance. The scandal here is simply too indecent and too predictable. It is not that the system just didn't work - the system failed.
The reader is left with no illusions that the next procurement scandal will be prevented. In the case of Wedtech, the public did not know sooner because Government employees had so many disincentives to protect the public interest. Those who defied Wedtech's cadre of paid enforcers, and a few were brave enough to do so, all got hurt - just as they feared they would.
That should not be the end of the story. Whistle blowers need both more protection from institutional persecution and greater economic incentives. Wasn't one of the lessons of the 80's supposed to be that money could make people do almost anything, even the right thing?
 
TWO ANGRY MEN
 In June 1970, Fred [Neuberger] joined up with John Mariotta. As a working couple the two men fell somewhere between Felix and Oscar of The Odd Couple and Martha and George of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? John saw limitless possibilities everywhere; Fred saw dangers. John was impassioned; Fred was steely-eyed. John was generous; Fred was tight. Both men had fought their way through disasters; they were fearless and, at bottom, angry. Neither would ever forgive the world for his suffering. Rather than temper one another's ferocity, each had the effect of corroding the other's already tenuous inhibitions.
From ''Too Good to Be True.''
[John] Mariotta, the dreamer, and [Fred] Neuberger, the pragmatist, seemed destined somewhere down the line to come to blows. Their personalities mixed like oil and putrid water. Mariotta, whose staccato voice could climb to the highest octave in the human range, was the type to cajole bureaucrats with crying fits and hysterics. Neuberger negotiated with grunts, cold stares, and fumes from a foot-long cigar. . . . Neuberger was stingy to an extreme. Mariotta, on the other hand, liked to make a grand show of his generosity. He would walk onto the factory floor and pass out hundred dollar bills like penny candy to favored employees.

LUCIUS D. CLAY
An American Life.
By Jean Edward Smith.
Illustrated. 835 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company. $35.
Franklin Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins once told the writer Robert Sherwood that it was a miracle that the United States, which had neglected its Army from 1919 to 1939 in a shameful manner, produced so large and so brilliant a group of World War II military leaders, competent to deal with complex and unique problems that were as much political as military. Indeed it was, and among those career soldiers Hopkins was talking about, none surpassed Gen. Lucius D. Clay (1898-1978), who as the head of the American occupation of Germany after the war had an impact on today's world that can hardly be exaggerated. In a very real sense, he was the father of West Germany. 
Born in Georgia, the son of a United States Senator, Clay was educated at West Point, then entered the Army Corps of Engineers, where he had a brilliant career. During the Depression, he worked closely with Hopkins, Sam Rayburn and other central figures in the New Deal. During World War II, he served as the War Department's director of materiel. His only instructions were to ''find out what the Army needs and get it.'' Clay spent billions of dollars, without a hint of scandal, while maintaining excellent relations with Congress (John Kenneth Galbraith called him ''one of the most skillful politicians ever to wear the uniform of the United States Army'') and insured that the men at the front got the firepower and support they needed.
It was a great accomplishment, but as Jean Edward Smith writes in ''Lucius D. Clay,'' ''Clay's principal achievement was the creation of a prosperous, stable, and democratic Germany.'' He ''presided at the birth of the West German Basic Law (constitution),'' was the instigator of currency reform and was the driving force behind the 1948 Berlin airlift, which was the critical turning point in post-World War II European history.
Mr. Smith's biography is masterly. The author of ''The Defense of Berlin'' and ''Germany Beyond the Wall'' and a professor of political science at the University of Toronto, Mr. Smith had access to Clay's papers (he edited them) and to the general himself. Mr. Smith provides large sections of his interviews with Clay, mixing them with his own research and analysis quite successfully. Indeed, a brief review can only begin to delineate the riches of this book, or to describe the character and accomplishments of its subject.
The high point in the story is the Berlin airlift. In April 1948, with the Russian blockade of Berlin about to begin, official Washington believed the Western position in the city was untenable and wanted to withdraw. Clay thought the Russians were bluffing, that they did not want war, even with their 10-to-1 manpower advantage in Germany. He also thought the stakes were such as to make withdrawal unthinkable.
''Why are we in Europe?'' Clay asked in a teleconference message. ''We have lost Czechoslovakia. We have lost Finland. Norway is threatened. We retreat from Berlin. . . . After Berlin will come western Germany. . . . If we mean to hold Europe against communism, we must not budge.'' Mr. Smith believes that had it not been for Clay, the United States would have cut and run, and he is quite convincing on the point.
Clay worked for a unified, democratic Germany; he fought hard against the division of the country; he believed it was the French far more than the Russians who blocked German unification. It was Clay who insisted on giving the Germans self-government right away, who frustrated French moves to split off the Ruhr and Rhineland, who carried out the most vigorous Nazi war-crime trials of any of the occupying Allied forces.
''Being Military Governor was a pretty heady job,'' said Clay's successor, John J. McCloy. ''It was the nearest thing to a Roman proconsulship the modern world afforded. You could turn to your secretary and say, 'Take a law.' ''
There was much, much more. Although Clay was unappreciated at home, the Germans know what they owe him. At the foot of his grave at West Point there is a memorial from the citizens of Berlin: ''Wir danken dem Bewahrer unserer Freiheit'' (''We thank the defender of our freedom''). When he left the city in 1949, West Berliners by the tens of thousands lined the streets from his headquarters to Tempelhof airfield. On retirement, not incidentally, his total personal assets amounted to a $3,000 family savings account.
After the Army, Clay went into private business and engaged in some politics on the side. And, typically, he was hugely successful at both (he was instrumental in getting Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the Presidency in 1952 and played a central role in the campaign that followed). Mr. Smith once asked Clay why the Continental Can Company and Lehman Brothers were interested in a retired general. ''Well,'' Clay replied, ''I don't know of anyone who probably had as much experience with the full range of the nation's economy as I did while Deputy Director of War Mobilization in World War II. And I don't know of anyone else on Wall Street who ever conducted a major currency reform. Or for that matter, who established a government.'' I don't either. I recommend this book without reservation.

 BODY:

Never Learned the Game of Life
When Jim Bouton's book came out in 1970, we were shocked when he implied that sportsmanship in pro ball is a contradiction in terms. Now, two decades later, we read the revised version with nothing more than a shrug. This is from ''Ball Four'' (Collier).
 Why do ballplayers have to take drugs and have girlfriends in the first place? This may come as a shock to some people but it's because they're human beings. Young human beings. Think of a ball player as a fifteen-year-old in a twenty-five-year-old body. 
Being a professional athlete allows you to postpone your adulthood. You grew up in Heroworld. Parents change the dinner schedule for you, teachers help with grades, coaches fawn over you, cops ask for an autograph and someone else buys the drinks. Or worse. As basketball great Bill Russell put it, ''most professional athletes have been on scholarship since the third grade.''
 
Persecuted by Pastiches
 When Hemingway was still alive, it must have been an uncanny feeling for him to see so many credible imitations of his style. It's conceivable that these pastiches contributed to his suicide. This latest example is from MacDonald Harris's novel ''Hemingway's Suitcase'' (Simon & Schuster).
 ''Oh, you're so clever. You're so omniscient. You always know about everything. How canal boats work. Which horses to bet on. And especially about women.''
''Oh, I know a lot more than that. Hunting and fishing. Military strategy. The psychology of cats. I've got the whole Paris Metro system in my head. . . .''
''Couldn't we get out of town? I'm fed up with everything. I'm so bored I could scream. All I do is sit in the park and read. . . .''
I was sorry that being with me didn't make her happy. I had thought she would enjoy living in Paris and all the things you could do there. But she came from the Middle West and she never got rid of that part of her. I knew that the way I had treated her was rotten but I couldn't do anything about it. She didn't like my friends, except for George, and he had gone back to America now. I didn't really know what she liked to do. I never found out.
 
Freud's Away, Analysts Play
While we think of the founders of psychoanalysis as a dour or frigid group, that's not how Alix Strachey saw them in Berlin in 1924. This is from ''Bloomsbury/Freud: The Letters of James and Alix Strachey 1924-1925,'' edited by Perry Meisel and Walter Kendrick (Norton).
 [Theodor] Reik, in a positive sweat of - of - what is it, eigentlich? He could hardly contain himself, his fat & his exhilaration. I can never make out whether it is pure joy in his breast or a pin in his bottom that makes him bound like a jelly & snort like a porpoise. . . . On the other side of me was [Sandor] Rado, who plied me with more wine; & then Dr. [Hanns] Sachs who shrieked literary criticisms at me across him. The speeches, the usual performance by [Ernst] Simmel, & some dreary attempts at song & joviality by [Hans] Lampl. Finally a moonlight walk in small groups - I, fatally enough, paired off with Simmel again; but he turned out to be really not so bad. . . . Lectures next day from 9-12. Train, 3d.-class . . . in the company of Sachs (with whom more literary conversation - but; he's been 3 weeks in Paris & never heard of Proust).
 
The Poetry of Precariousness
 Space, which promised so much for poetry, turns out to be ''not 'wild' enough,'' as if science had tamed it before poetry could get a grip. This is from ''The Moon and Us,'' one of many essays in ''Other People's Trades'' by Primo Levi (Summit).
 Is it perhaps too soon, do we only have to wait, will the poet of space come later? There is nothing to assure us of it. Aviation, the penultimate great leap, is already sixty years old, and has given us no other poet than Saint-Exupery and a step lower Lindbergh and Hillary: all three have drawn inspiration from precariousness, from adventure and the unforeseen. The literature of the sea died with ships under sail; the poetry of railroads never was born, nor does it seem thinkable. The flight of Collins, Armstrong, and Aldrin is too sure, too programmed, not ''wild'' enough for a poet to find nourishment in it.
 
The Literature of 'Inspired Ideas'
European literary critics talk more in terms of ''inspired ideas'' than of techniques. Here is Hans Mayer, a professor of literary history, reminiscing about novelists and how they used their ideas or let their ideas use them. This is from ''Franz Werfel: A Life in Prague, Vienna, and Hollywood'' by Peter Stephan Jungk (Grove Weidenfeld).
Werfel never knew how to be economical with his ideas; he used them, so to speak, raw. ''The task of a writer consists in being able to make something out of an idea,'' Thomas Mann said. But it was just that ''making'' that Werfel never managed. . . . For Werfel, the decisive things were the emotional aspect, the romantic idea, the lyrical substance - the power of language. He did have a language of his own! Unlike Stefan Zweig, who is simply an intolerably poor writer. Zweig blows himself up, he inflates ideas that he doesn't even have. Whereas Werfel is prodigal with his ideas but often doesn't know how to make anything out of them. He was an infinitely greater natural talent than Musil, but Musil is the infinitely more interesting writer. I think I know what Werfel lacked: he hardly ever questioned himself.

Mikhail S. Gorbachev did not stand idly by and watch the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe disintegrate. He intervened to push the process along. He stayed the hand of Soviet military and K.G.B. forces in Eastern Europe, and in so doing paralyzed their indigenous allies. And he prodded Communist Party leaders in the Eastern-bloc countries to cede power to reform-minded colleagues and share it with non-Communists.
Perhaps he hoped that local Communists could reform themselves in time to hold on to power, but he was not prepared to prop them up militarily if they could not. Let Poland be Poland, he decided, knowing that to do otherwise would frustrate reform in the Soviet Union.
Today, Mr. Gorbachev's Russian Reformation rumbles on. The transformations of 1989 have brought hope for many, foreboding for a few and daunting questions for everyone. What caused those upheavals? What will they lead to? And how should the United States respond? These three books, each in its own unsatisfying way, look backward for answers. The authors interpret the past so differently that it's hard to imagine they all lived through the same events. Walter Laqueur and company in ''Soviet Union 2000'' and William G. Hyland in ''The Cold War Is Over'' are exponents of an American anti-Communist orthodoxy. Bogdan Denitch in ''The End of the Cold War'' espouses a European socialist orthodoxy.
In the American orthodoxy, Soviet Communism's implacable hostility to the West and its ideals is the enduring continuity. Mr. Gorbachev's five-year rule is the discontinuity, a temporary aberration born of economic necessity and renewed pressure from the West that has forced Moscow to pull back for what Mr. Hyland calls a ''breather.'' But, in fact, the Russian Reformation has gone far beyond that.
In socialist orthodoxy, the continuity is the growing convergence of democratic socialism and Christian democracy along Swedish lines. The discontinuity was the Communist seizure of power in the Soviet Union, and the later imposition of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe, matched by United States hegemony in Western Europe. Now democratic socialism, not capitalism, will triumph across Europe. Mr. Denitch, a professor of political sociology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, was unusually prescient in anticipating the collapse of Communism in Europe, but as he himself concedes, the Poles and other Middle Europeans are showing surprisingly ''visceral'' hostility to economic arrangements that bear the name ''socialist.''
The sharpest disagreement comes over whether it took two to make the cold war. The American orthodoxy offers a simple, one-sided version of cold war history: Hitler destroyed the old order in Europe, allowing Stalin to impose dominion on the East. The United States was merely reactive, often not in a tough enough way. A gradual thaw began in 1962, but there were few opportunities for real accommodation until Mr. Gorbachev's arrival.
Socialist orthodoxy sees a much more complex, two-sided clash, with a potentially democratic socialist Europe caught in the middle. A militant United States, in this view, passed up opportunities to compromise with an increasingly defensive Communism.
The American orthodoxy would be on stronger ground in the argument had the United States tried accommodation and been rebuffed. It did not, a point on which Mr. Hyland and Mr. Denitch concur. But that suggests the cold war was much more two-sided than Mr. Hyland cares to acknowledge.
So was its end. What Mr. Hyland, the editor of Foreign Affairs, dismissively calls the ''Vietnam syndrome'' was the increased public resistance to cold war interventionism that began in the late 1960's. If ever there was a place where direct military involvement was a sure thing, Nicaragua in 1981 was it. But the tortured extraconstitutional ways that Ronald Reagan went about it were a clear sign of the spent power of anti-Communism, despite his cold war rhetoric and military buildup. And Leonid Brezhnev's reluctance to send the Red Army into Poland in 1980 sent a similar message about the waning power of Communism.
What is to be done in the Soviet Union now? Mr. Laqueur, the chairman of the International Research Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the other authors of ''Soviet Union 2000'' at least raise some key questions.
Reform has historically been imposed from the top down. Can democratic politics and competitive markets, which must be nurtured from the bottom up, ever take root? Especially if the populace associates them with disorder and privilege? Radical reformers in the Soviet Union blame Mr. Gorbachev for braking the pace of reform, but can he or any other leader impose radical reform on an increasingly fractious country?
Mr. Gorbachev himself sows division among potential opponents to keep them from coalescing against him. That secures him in power within the Kremlin. But can he extend his power beyond its walls? Not through a Communist Party now splintering over his policies. Not through a statist bureaucracy that he is beginning to dismantle. Not through leaders in the republics, who allied with him against Moscow's ministries but are now turning against him. Not through a K.G.B. divided between the forces of modernization and the forces of order. Maybe not even through the reform coalition, increasingly riven by disputes between moderates and radicals.
The Communist ideology that rationalized power and privilege for three generations has collapsed. What norms can take its place to provide the Soviet presidency and new governing institutions with legitimacy? Surely not nationalism, which pits republic against republic and neighbor against neighbor. Probably not democracy, whose supporters are confined largely to the urban intelligentsia, and whose practitioners are hard to find even there. Perhaps the rule of law, but it remains to be seen whether the rulers, let alone the people, will abide by its strictures.
With the historian's conceit that the past is forever prologue, the authors of these three books paper over radical discontinuity by looking for enduring continuity. But the Soviet future could well resemble no known past - in the Soviet Union or elsewhere.

The Race That Isn't a Race

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Sparky Anderson, the dean of major league managers, knows a pennant race when he sees one, but he's not sure what he sees when he looks at the American League East.
''I don't know if we're in the race or nobody else wants to be in it,'' the Detroit Tigers' manager said. ''I never knew you could be five games under .500 and be in the race. It's really funny. I'm not sure why we're in it, but we are.''
An official of another American League East club had a similar reaction to the so-called race. ''We're in it,'' he said. ''God only knows why.'' 
Perhaps someone on or near that level of authority could explain why what is occurring in the division should be classified as a race. One definition of ''race'' is the act of rushing onward. In the American League East, teams appear to be going backward.
In the last month or so, the Toronto Blue Jays have lost 16 of 28 games and the Boston Red Sox have lost 18 of 27 games. Yet the Blue Jays entered yesterday's games in first place, the Red Sox in second only one game back. Despite that 12-16 stretch, the Blue Jays doubled their lead, from half a game to a full game.
In approximately the same period, Anderson's Tigers have lost 19 of 34 games but have lost only half a game in the standing.
''We started 11-22, and it looked like it might be another nightmare,'' said Anderson, whose 1989 team lost 103 games and finished 30 games from the top. ''But we won a few and slowly pecked away. We got to get to .500. If we can do that, we'll truly be in the race.''
The Tigers have not had a .500 record this season. Once they passed the first 10 days, the closest the Tigers have been to the break-even mark was the 33-34 record they had June 19. It is since then that they lost 19 of 34 entering yesterday's game.
The Milwaukee Brewers had a 32-34 record June 23 and had lost 18 of 30 before yesterday. In that 30-game span, they lost only a game and a half in the standing. They had, in fact, fallen 11 games back and presumably out of the race, but the Blue Jays and the Red Sox magnanimously - not to mention ineptly - let them back in the race.
The Cleveland Indians were at .500, 37-37, on July 1 but then lost 15 of 24. Yet they remained six and a half games from first.
The Baltimore Orioles have probably benefited the most from the inability of the top two teams to create space between them and the other would-be contenders. The Orioles were at .500, 29-29, and three games out June 12. Then they won only 6 of 22 games and plummeted 11 games back. In the last three weeks, though, the Orioles have won 13 of 18 games, gaining ground on the leaders, who seemed to be running in place.
In reality, they weren't running in place; they were rushing backward. The Red Sox, in that same period, have had a 6-13 record, the Blue Jays 7-9.
''There's nobody overwhelming,'' Anderson said in an understatement from the master of overstatement. ''I like Toronto very much; you have to when you look at them. I like Boston as far as their offense. But it doesn't look like anybody is strong enough to pull away from everybody else. I don't think it'll take much over .500. We've played 100 games and no one has run away. If you haven't proven it by then, you're not going to run away.''
What does he think of the Tigers' chances of staying in the race in their effort to soar from last to first? ''As long as nobody cheats and wins 8 or 10 in a row,'' he said, ''we could be there.''
 
Beyond Hope
 No matter how poorly the American League East leaders have played, they could not possibly be bad enough to drag the Yankees into the race.
By sweeping a doubleheader from the Indians Friday night, the Yankees of Stump Merrill matched their victory total - 18 - under Bucky Dent. The Yankees played 49 games with Dent as the manager. They had played 47 under Merrill entering last night's game.
The records are remarkably similar, suggesting that it's not the manager but the team. George Steinbrenner, in making the change, said that he had made a mistake, that Dent wasn't ready to manage in the major leagues. What does the Yankees' subsequent lack of success under Merrill mean? That after 10 years of managing at every level in the minors he wasn't ready?
 
Earning His Salary
 Jose Canseco hit seven home runs in a recent span of seven games in eight days. Only five teams hit more home runs in that time, and they each played eight games. (The rest of the Oakland batters hit nine.) The Chicago Cubs hit only one home run, by Ryne Sandberg, while the Houston Astros (Bill Doran, Bill Doran) and the Chicago White Sox (Robin Ventura, Carlton Fisk) each hit two.
Canseco hit two in a game three times in that period, giving him six such games this season. The Athletics, with five by Mark McGwire, have had players hit two or more home runs in a game 14 times. Canseco himself has done it more often than 19 of the other 25 teams and has done it as often as three teams.
 
Drought Report
 A couple of Andys found Friday night to be dandy.
When Andy Hawkins won for the Yankees in Cleveland, it was his first victory since May 6. He had labored the longest of any regular starter in the majors without a victory. In between victories, he made 12 starts, losing five (including a no-hitter) and finishing with no decision in the other seven.
Andy Benes of San Diego won the same night. He had not won since June 4, having failed in eight starts (three losses, five no-decisions).
Marty Clary of Atlanta hasn't won since May 2, but he was out of the Braves' rotation for a while so his drought has reached only nine starts (seven losses, two no-decisions).
Chris Bosio of Milwaukee hasn't won since May 20 (10 starts). Mike Bielecki of the Chicago Cubs and Jeff Ballard of Baltimore haven't won a start since May 27, although Bielecki won in relief July 20 and Ballard, too, has gone on relief, starting only once in the last month.
Most notable among starters who have victory droughts is Mark Langston of California. Langston, best known for the five-year, $16 million contract the Angels gave him as a free agent last winter, hasn't won since June 5. He has lost eight starts and emerged with no decision twice.
 
Ryan Speaks and Owner Listens
 Nolan Ryan's influence in Texas, at least with the Rangers, extends beyond his no-hitters and his strikeouts and his victory total. The boss listens to him.
George W. Bush is the boss, and earlier this season he was hearing a lot of talk about Tom House, the team's pitching coach, who has introduced some unconventional training methods, such as throwing a football.
''People started getting on House,'' Bush said. ''Some called him an eccentric, a radical. The talk was maybe he was not training our people properly.''
Those raising the question cited two glaring examples: Jose Guzman and Edwin Correa. Guzman hasn't pitched since 1988 because of shoulder problems. Correa also had shoulder problems and did not pitch for the Rangers for two and a half seasons before leaving them as a free agent last winter and signing with Los Angeles.
''It concerned me,'' Bush said. ''I'm not at all skilled in evaluating Tom House so I went to my friend Nolan Ryan and said, 'Does this guy know what he's doing?' He said, 'Absolutely.' He believes in Tom 100 percent. That stopped my inquiry. If Nolan Ryan speaks highly of him, that's good enough for me.''
 
Labor Milestone
 Promising sign of improved labor relations:
 For the first time in 10 years, labor representatives of the owners and the players have managed to publish their labor agreement in printed booklet form.
The last one was printed after the 1980 agreement but was promptly outdated by the agreement the next year on compensation for free agents. No booklet was printed then, after the 50-day strike, nor in 1985, after a new agreement ended the two-day strike.
The new contract has been published, inside a powder-blue cover, only four months after the agreement was reached.
Possible further sign of improved labor relations:
Charles O'Connor, the owners' chief labor representative, and Donald Fehr, the union chief, will have a series of meetings beginning Tuesday with George Nicolau, the arbitrator, to negotiate a settlement on the damages the owners owe the players for their collusion against free agents.
The negotiations won't be easy because the principals will be talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. If they can reach agreement, it would bode well for future relations. If they can't, the matter would go back to Nicolau for a decision and their efforts to put their differences behind them would suffer.
Either way, the owners will pay dearly for the ill-conceived conspiracy. It could cost them $250 million or more, averaging nearly $10 million or more a club. That's not what the owners had in mind when they hired Peter Ueberroth as commissioner to improve their economic status.

HEADLINE: Golf Course Development Gets Rougher

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
TO the 222 million Americans who do not golf, the line that forms before dawn at the Tamarack Golf Course in East Brunswick, N.J., may seem eerie, perhaps even cult-like. But to many of the nation's 25 million golfers, such bleary-eyed rituals are par for the course.
''You want to play, you fight the crowd,'' said Malcolm McEwen, a 67-year-old New Jersey retiree and an avid golfer for 50 years. His Saturday regimen brings him to Tamarack at 3:30 A.M. He then waits more than two hours to tee off. ''It has never been so hard to get on a course,'' he added. Mr. McEwen's frustrations are rooted in two conflicting trends. One is the rising value of land. In urban and suburban population centers, where the lines to tee off are the longest, the great real estate rush of the 80's made large undeveloped parcels suitable for new golf courses scarce. Many existing courses have been eliminated as developers subdivided them for homes and offices. But just as land values have boomed, so has golf. Ten million more Americans turned out at courses across the country last year than 10 years earlier. 
The result is that one of the nation's most popular sports - and its most land intensive - is in a real estate squeeze. As golfers queue up for hours, developers and architects have spawned a small new industry trying to satisfy the clamor for more fairways and greens.
''I don't see any possibility that government can add many more public courses,'' said Jim Evans, superintendent of five courses at the Bethpage State Park on Long Island, where weekend players now begin arriving in campers at 9:30 the night before they tee off. Like the Tamarack Golf Course, which is owned by the county, the Bethpage courses are in particularly high demand because they are open to the public and inexpensive.
To be sure, many new golf courses have been built, and more are planned. The National Golf Foundation, a trade group, said golf-course development had proceeded slowly and steadily in the 80's, expanding the number of courses to 13,738 last year from 12,849 in 1980.
But it added that as land values rose, many existing courses were under intense pressure from home builders and office developers. Although 260 new courses opened last year, 100 others were lost, mainly to other forms of development.
Developers have added hundreds of courses by building them in ''golf communities'' - large residential developments in which homeowners pay a premium for a view of the links. If they play, they also have a private course at their disposal.
Examples of the golf communities abound. In Victor, N.Y., 15 miles south of Rochester, work is under way on Cobblestone Creek, a 412-acre project with an 18-hole golf course and 282 homes that will be priced from $350,000 to $650,000.
In Carlsbad, Calif., 30 miles north of San Diego, work has begun on Aviara, a 1,000-acre complex with an 18-hole course and 2,000 condominiums, town houses and detached homes priced from just under $300,000 to just under $600,000.
''In many cases, it just isn't economically feasible to build a course unless you can sell a lot of homes in the same development,'' said Geoffrey S. Cornish, an Amherst, Mass., architect who has designed courses across the country.
The economics are straightforward: a full-size 18-hole course takes at least 140 acres of land, and often more if part of the land is broken up by water, wooded areas that cannot be cut down, or other parts of the landscape that must remain undisturbed. Around New York, Boston, Los Angeles and other large cities, suburban land goes for $50,000 to $100,000 an acre, and sometimes more, meaning that the cost of the raw land would be at least $7 million.
Many developers of golf communities have built courses to satisfy municipal or state requirements for open space in their housing developments. They also charge enough for the homes to recoup their costs. Others are trying to capitalize on golf's growing popularity among business people by building courses as part of office complexes and conference centers.
''GOLF is becoming more intertwined with business activity, not the least of which is between American and Japanese executives,'' said Frithjof Lunde, director of planning for the Stabler Land Company, a Pennsylvania development concern that is spending $5 million to build an 18-hole course as part of a 1,800-acre office complex four miles east of Allentown, Pa.
Although rare, private courses that are not part of bigger real estate development, and are operated for members only, are still being built. In Jackson Township in central New Jersey, for example, Richard Sambol and his son, Herb, spent 10 years assembling a 400-acre tract and in 1987 opened the first 18 holes of the exclusive Metedeconk National Golf club. An additional nine holes are now under construction.
The developers declined to say how much they paid to acquire the land and build the club, but one aspect of the project sets its apart from most other new courses - it is intended as a magnet for corporate wealth.
Memberships cost more than $50,000 and many members are senior executives. One selling point is that they can fly to the course's private landing pad in their corporate helicopters from New York City, 120 miles to the northeast.
''We appeal to a special market niche,'' Herb Sambol said. ''Because of the economic and regulatory environment, the number of new courses is going to decrease and they are going to become more expensive for everybody.''
Even where land and money are available, building new golf courses or expanding existing ones is posing difficult political and environmental problems.
In an extreme example, the attempt to expand a course in the Canadian community of Oka, 40 miles west of Montreal, led to violence this month. Mohawk Indians, protesting that the expansion was planned on sacred ground, put up a blockade to keep bulldozers away, and on July 15 engaged in a fierce gun battle with law-enforcement officers. One officer was killed. Nothing similar has occurred in the United States, but legislative and community debate is intense over whether golf courses are the best use of large tracts of land. Some officials maintain that denser residential or commercial development is preferable because it generates more taxes, while others want undeveloped land kept just as it is.
Environmental laws are also a factor. Increasingly stringent rules on the use of pesticides and fertilizers, development in low-lying wetlands areas, and the protection of scarce plants and wildlife are standing in the way of some new courses.
''There is a growing awareness of the demand for new courses, but they are difficult animals to develop,'' said John Rossi, chief executive office of Gold Services, a subsidiary of the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla., which was formed last year to advise communities and developers on golf-course development.
The sport's popularity shows little sign of falling off. Several factors are bringing more players into the game, including the aging of the baby-boom generation, the rapid increase in the number of women who play regularly and steady growth in the number of retirees who have more time to learn the game, or play more often.
Even with increased investment in new courses, Mr. Rossi said, ''We aren't going to catch up with demand.''
The greatest demand is for courses open to the public, where players pay a daily fee or membership dues that are far less expensive than those charged by most country clubs and private courses. Of the nation's current inventory of courses, the National Golf Foundation said half are private and charge a daily fee, as do the 15 percent that are municipally owned. The rest are for members only.
The difficulties of developing municipal courses - even where land is available - are illustrated on Cape Cod, where the Town of Barnstable, which includes Hyannisport, expects to complete an 18-hole course by the spring of 1992. If it opens on schedule, the course will have been eight years in the making.
''The course has been a huge issue up here,'' said Joseph O'Brien, a Barnstable insurance broker who is heading a town committee in charge of developing the course. ''We have people on both sides of the coin. Some were sure that we should go after the kind of development that would bring in more money. The environmentalists didn't want the land touched.''
Part of the incentive to build the course in the central Cape Cod township, was that a wealthy local family of golf enthusiasts made the land for the course available cheaply. After Barnstable's town fathers gave preliminary approval for a course in 1985, the family agreed to sell the town its undeveloped 154-acre parcel for $15,000 an acre, far below what the land would have brought for commercial or housing development. But environmental questions became more complicated than the economics. As in most golf course developments, water became a critical issue because of the huge amounts necessary to sprinkle greens and fairways, and because of the potential damage to underground water tables from pesticides and fertilizers. Since Cape Cod relies on one aquifer for its drinking water, part of which lies beneath the Barnstable site, exhaustive planning was required.
Town officials said an environmental impact review determined that any threat to the aquifer could be avoided by careful use of chemicals, and by making sure they were stored on part of the property that did not sit over the underground water supply. But environmental studies revealed other problems - scarce and endangered species that required protection under state law.
That meant a series of changes in the course's design. Fairways were bent around areas where sand plain flax, Nuttall's milkwort and other protected plants grow. Holly trees were transplanted. To meet state rules, when the course opens, hay bails used for erosion and siltation control will be removed each spring to allow the migration of mice and other rodents.
Stephen Seymor, Barnstable's project manager, said the cost of environmental studies, architects' fees and construction would total $4.3 million, nearly double the amount the town paid for the land. When the course opens, Mr. O'Brien said, the town plans to offer memberships to residents for $400 to $500 a year.
Although they confront many hurdles, developers have seized upon golf communities as a way of marketing expensive homes. The approach has many variations, but is based on a premise that people will pay a hefty premium for their houses if they can look out over fairways and greens.
The first golf communities were built long before World War II, but the development strategy gained much of its momentum in the 1980's. And while recent studies by the National Golf Foundation and others have shown that fewer than half of those who buy homes in the communities are active golfers, the appeal is well established.
MR. CORNISH, the golf-course architect, said that in many parts of the country developers have been able to charge 35 percent more for homes beside a golf course.
Still, the golf communities are not easily built, particularly if they are on environmentally sensitive land. One example is in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where a development group from Atlanta last year opened the Old Marsh Golf Club as the first phase of a development that will include 213 homes.
The developers, hoping to build a course and luxury homes on unusually pristine land, chose a site with an uncommonly sensitive environment. Their 450-acre tract is adjacent to a state wildlife refuge that is home to a host of protected species, including sandhill cranes, Southern bald eagles, alligators and deer.
Ground water from the marshy refuge flows directly into the Florida Everglades, the main source of drinking water for South Florida. The means any hazardous runoff from the course would find its way into human consumption, as well as that of wildlife.
David Pearson, a spokesman for the club, said the Atlanta developers and their architect, Peter Dye, spent five years designing and redesigning the course to obtain government approvals and avoid environmental damage. The project required many unusual construction techniques: at one point, teams of college students were hired to painstakingly plant marsh grass strand by strand in shallow lakes that had been excavated along fairways.
Drainage from the fairways was also a critical issue, he said. Unlike other courses, where the fairways are designed to allow rain water run-off at their sides, those at Old Marsh are designed with drains and underground channels so that rain water is trapped and filtered.
With work on the course complete, Mr. Pearson said half of the building lots in the development have been sold. Buyers have the option of building homes with their own architects, but houses put up speculatively by the Old Marsh developers are priced from $550,000 to $1.2 million.

HEADLINE: Computers Slowing the Pace of Permits

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
AT 10 A.M., dozens of people are milling about the hallways on the fifth floor of 60 Hudson Street, the lower Manhattan office of New York City's Buildings Department. Some are standing on lines, chatting. Others are leaning against tables or sitting on the floor, reading newspapers or doing crossword puzzles. All are waiting to speak with city examiners and clerks to process applications for building permits and certificates of occupancy.
Some, like Judith A. Faulkner, an expediter who represents architects and engineers, have been there since 5 or 6 A.M. They arrive in the dark to sign up before the office opens for 10-minute appointments to begin the filing process. By late morning, the waiting list has grown to 123 names. 
Architects and expediters say that these traditional inconveniences are nothing compared to new obstacles that have resulted from a computerized filing system installed in late March by the Buildings Department in Manhattan.
It now takes much longer to obtain the permits that are required before renovations or new construction can begin and the certificates that are needed before a new building can be occupied, expediters and architects said. The new system is more cumbersome and inflexible than the one it replaced, they said, and it is adding to the cost of applying for permits and of building in New York.
They say it used to take an average of a week to 10 days from the initial filing of an application, which is called prefiling, until a building permit was issued. Since the computer system was installed, they contend, it takes three to six weeks.
''They took a system that did not work very well and made it worse,'' Ms. Faulkner said. ''Now the old days seem like paradise.''
Stewart D. O'Brien, a deputy commissioner in the Buildings Department, said some delays were inevitable as the city made the switch. He contended, though, that adjustments had been made. Mr. O'Brien said the new system had reduced drastically the number of forms that applicants must file and had made applying for permits more rational and efficient.
Many complaints, he said, stem from the fact that people were familiar with the old system. ''It's been a certain way for 20 or 30 years and people are used to the old forms,'' he said. ''When you take a system and in effect turn it upside down, you are going to get a lot of resistance. Is it perfect? No. That's why we are making changes. But it is opening up the process.''
Architects and expediters who frequently apply for permits at the Buildings Department's Manhattan office disagreed sharply. They said the new system was less efficient and more inflexible than the one it replaced.
Andrew G. Antoniades is an architect who is president of the Architects' Council, which works with city agencies on behalf of the profession. He said the new system had cut down ''on a certain amount of paperwork,'' but that it had created significant new hurdles.
''I am getting a barrage of complaints about the system,'' Mr. Antoniades said. ''They have lengthened the process and complicated it.''
Many architects and expediters said it now takes a week or two after they file applications for city workers to punch the information into the computers. Only then can applications go to examiners for a substantive review. In the past, they said, an examiner would review an application within a day of its filing.
Many if not most applicants have to amend their filings, both to meet objections from the city and to revise plans. The new system has no provision for amending applications, many architects and expediters said, so that each time a change is required they must begin the filing process over again.
Many expediters and architects said they were forced to increase their fees, because of the additional time they have to spend pushing applications through the system. The delays have increased other costs for building owners and those who rent commercial space.
MS. FAULKNER cited one client, an optician who she said is paying $7,000 a month to rent an office suite. Because of delays in processing his application for a permit, he cannot start the renovation of his new office and so cannot use it, she said. And, of course, he must continue to pay the rent.
Mr. O'Brien, the deputy commissioner, said the backlog on entering applications into the computer had been trimmed, and that it now takes ''three days or less'' for a complete application to be typed into the computer. He also contended that the long daily waiting lists for appointments to begin the application process had been reduced by some small procedural changes.
Mr. O'Brien accused some expediters of having signed the daily waiting lists several times to create a misimpression that delays were worse than they really were. ''They were creating a list so imposing that anyone who walked in at 9 in the morning would say, 'I'm not spending my entire day here,' '' Mr. O'Brien said. ''Some of the expediters have been portraying things in this way because it's in their economic interest.''
The same computer system was installed last year in the department's offices in Queens and the Bronx. Mr. O'Brien said similar complaints were heard during those transitions. ''This is a major change for the industry and for us,'' he said. ''It's a useful management tool. We just have to hang tough until it is entirely implemented.'' Mr. O'Brien said he expected that things will soon be running more smoothly.

HEADLINE: Rival Proposals for Purchase of Jay Land

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

 BODY:
A LONG-AWAITED decision by county legislators over acquisition of the Jay Property in Rye may face yet another delay, political leaders indicated last week, even though two proposals offering a choice of action are now officially before them.
One plan, by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, would have the county buy 10 acres of the 23-acre site for a negotiated price of ''up to $6 million.'' The land was once owned by the family of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the United States and a two-term New York Governor.
As part of the O'Rourke plan, the Jay Coalition, representing preservationists, environmentalists and others who have long sought to prevent development of the site, would be responsible for all costs of rehabilitation and upkeep of a 152-year-old mansion on the grounds.
The 1838 Greek Revival structure was built by the jurist's son, Peter, on the site of his father's boyhood residence. Known as the Peter Jay House, it has been empty for nearly a decade and is in need of extensive renovation. 
The alternative plan, put forward by Legislator Diane A. Keane, Republican of Rye and the Board of Legislature's majority leader, would have the county acquire the entire 23 acres through eminent domain. This plan has the backing of the Jay Coalition.
 
'A Two- or Three-Month Delay'
TThe state, Mr. O'Rourke said, has pledged $4 million, either as part of the $6 million purchase price that the County Executive said he had negotiated with the owner, Diane G. Millstein, or as part of a condemnation price, which would be determined in court.
But condemnation means ''a two- or three-month delay, at least,'' said Katherine S. Carsky, the Yonkers Republican who heads the pivotal Budget Committee, ''because the state says it will not provide its $4 million share until an appraisal confirms that the land is worth that much.''
The rival plans surfaced more than a week ago at an unusual news conference, where Mr. O'Rourke argued for his 10-acre purchase, Mrs. Keane pressed for her alternative and each criticized the other's plan. In the end, both proposals were sent to the Board. Last Monday, the Board accepted the competing plans and, without comment, referred them to the Budget Committee. An informal poll of legislators indicated no consensus for either proposal, with some undecided, a few in favor of purchase and several backing condemnation.
Nine votes, or a simple majority on the 17-member board, are required for either purchase or condemnation, and 12 votes are needed if the county raises its share, as it said it would, through the sale of bonds. If the amount is more than $10 million, approval also is required in a referendum.
A county appraisal last year put the value of 23 acres at $6.9 million, or roughly half the $13.9 million that Ms. Millstein had been seeking in negotiations for sale of the entire site. Mr. O'Rourke said in introducing his plan that Ms. Millstein is no longer interested in selling all of it.
Last year, the city of Rye assessed the 23-acre property at $612,500, or the equivalent of $13.6 million at market value, according to the Rye Assessor, Philip J. McGovern. He said it was an increase of 63 percent over the 1988 assessment of $375,000, equivalent to $6,087,000.
 
'Proper Value' on the Property
''It had been underassessed because we were waiting for this property to get through the planning and development stage,'' Mr. McGovern said. ''She was holding a piece of vacant land, which meant other taxpayers were subsidizing it, so we put the proper value on the property.''
He said Ms. Millstein's initial proposal was for ''office buildings and a conference center,'' but she later applied for permission to build 39 homes on half-acre lots. He said Ms. Millstein paid $1.2 million for the property in 1983.
The Jay Coalition, which claims the support of 61 environmental, historic preservation and civic organizations in the state, has fought development of the property, in part as a means of preserving the adjacent Marshlands Conservancy, a 137-acre coastal sanctuary owned by the county.
Some legislators indicated that they favored Mr. O'rourke's plan because it included a negotiated price, rather than the ''open ended'' nature of the condemnation cost. Under the O'Rourke plan, the county's $2 million share would be raised through the sale of bonds and the county would be responsible for closing costs.
The O'Rourke proposal also states that the Jay Coalition would not only be responsible for the restoration and upkeep of the Greek Revival mansion, but that Millstein Associates, the current owner, would have the right to repurchase the mansion for $1 million if the building was not restored within two years of the transfer of title.
Helen W. Paschal, a coalition leader, said Mr. O'Rourke ''assumed a commitment from the Jay Coalition that he knows full well was made contingent on acquisition of the entire property.'' She emphasized the word ''entire.'' Eva Stern, a coalition member who attended the news conference, said afterward that the County Executive's proposal was ''a slap in the face.''
She said the funds needed by the coalition to restore the mansion would come from preservationists who might resist contributing if the property had been ''compromised,'' by which she said she meant ''breaking up the historic district, which contains several properties, one of them being the Jay property in its entirety.''
 
Other Historic Properties
Other properties in the district, besides the Marshlands Conservancy, include the three-acre Jay Cemetery; Lounsberry, a 13.5-acre parcel owned by the city of Rye; and Whitby, 110 acres including the Rye Golf Club owned by the City of Rye.
Ms. Stern said there was probably no way the coalition could approach agencies that provided grants for preservation and upkeep ''until we've got the property,'' meaning acquisition by the county. She said she did not know if any grants would be available if only a portion of the property was acquired.
Several legislators said they preferred condemnation. Stephen P. Tenore, Republican of New Rochelle, thought that partial acquisition would be a bad precedent for the county. Echoing a sentiment voiced by others, he objected to the ''negotiated'' price, ''which comes down to $600,00 to $700,000 an acre.''
Legislator Timothy S. Carey, Republican of Montrose, wondered ''how the $6 million negotiated price for 10 acres sat with the county's own $6.9 million appraisal last year for all 23 acres.'' He also wondered whether the O'Rourke proposal was even feasible. ''Does it protect the Marshlands?'' he asked.
 
Healthiest Tidal Marsh in County
Environmentalists say the preserve has the largest and healthiest tidal marsh in the county, and that the construction of houses, with the attendant loss of wooded area, would jeopardize the quality and quantity of water flowing into the marshlands, threatening the ecosystem that makes it so unusual in a suburban area.
John E. Hand, the Yorktown Heights Republican who is chairman of the Board, said he was ''leaning'' toward Mr. O'Rourke's proposal, ''although some people on this Board don't like the price he negotiated.'' On the other hand, condemnation is ''even scarier, because that price can be open-ended.''
Herman Keith, a Yonkers Democrat, said he was not supporting condemnation ''because there would be no way to anticipate the final cost'' and ''we could pay much more than $6 million,'' he said. Ernest D. Davis, a Mount Vernon Democrat, was similarly wary of condemnation.
''The state says it's in for $4 million, but I'm not sure I'd step into the ring with the state backing me up, especially in these times of budget problems,'' he said. ''What if it comes in at $10 million - we'd have the state's $4 million and our $2 million, but where's the rest coming from? I'm not sure we can afford to gamble.''
 
Land for Future Generations
Martin L. Rogowsky, a Democrat of Harrison, said he favored condemnation. ''If we were totally in the dark, it would be one thing, but we're starting with a county appraiser's figure of $6.9 million for 23 acres, and since then the real estate market has softened considerably.''
''We have the chance to preserve a valuable piece of land for generations,'' Mr. Rogowsky said. ''And if I can support a $5 million bond act for new jail cells, I can vote for this proposal.''
Edward J. Brady, Republican of Thornwood, favored neither alternative and Sandra R. Galef, an Ossining Democrat and the Board minority leader, said she was undecided, especially about the firmness of the state's commitment. ''We have to know if the $4 million is really available,'' she said.
Patricia V. Hotchkiss, Democrat of a Bedford, and Daniel P. Thomas, a Yonkers Republican, raised similar questions about whether the 10-acre acquisition would be enough to provide the environmental protection.
 
Condemnation Could Triple Price
Andrew A. Albanese, the Eastchester Republican, said he was not looking favorably at condemnation ''because it can end up a lot higher than what we are prepared to spend,'' he said. ''We were told that condemnation awards could be three times the assessment figure.''
Bernard D. Fischman, a condemnation lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Shea & Gould, said it depends on the evidence, but ''normally, if you've got a reputable expert, the valuation, the final decision, is close to the range of the experts.''
''The thing that hurts the owner more than anything else is the purchase price paid for the property. For owners to collect more than they paid, they have to prove that the property appreciated in value since it was purchased,'' he said. Appreciation can measured in physical improvements, in a neighborhood that has appreciated in value or through inflation.
 
HOW THE PROCESS OF CONDEMNATION WORKS
Marilyn J. Slaatten, the County Attorney, and Bernard D. Fischman a condemnation lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Shea & Gould, outlined the process of condemnation that is being considered as an alternative in acquiring the Jay Property in Rye. In condemnation, they said, a government body can use its right of eminent domain to acquire property for a fair-market value regardless of whether the owner is a willing seller.
Once the Board of Legislators authorizes a condemnation procedure, the Board of Acquisition and Contract becomes the condemning body and its first task is to hold a hearing on the public use and benefit of the action.
Within 90 days of the hearing, the condemner - which would be the county, in this case - must publish findings of fact, setting forth the impact on the environment and establishing that the condemnation is for a public purpose. Anyone opposed to it has 30 days to file an appeal with the Appellate Division.
Such an appeal is expedited, going to the head of the court calendar. The judges decide if the findings were properly determined, and a decision is likely within two or three months. The court can approve the findings, order new findings or set them aside, which would mean the case is over - there would be no condemnation, unless the Court of Appeals decided differently.
Once the right to condemn is upheld, the county must make an advance offer in the amount of its approved appraisal. If the condemner has two appraisals, it must pay the higher amount. It is called an advance payment and it does not affect the owner's right to seek more money.
The case now would go to a trial court, where a judge fixes value. At this point, before the value is determined, the court orders the filing of a map and the transfer of title to the county.
At the trial, each side brings in experts, and for the most part the valuation is based on ''comparable sales.'' Since the property in this case is somewhat unique, with no closely comparable sale, it becomes a battle of experts. The property is valued for its ''highest and best use.''
The county cannot limit its liability, saying it will not exceed a certain amount, and must pay whatever amount the court fixes. The county can back out any time until title to the property changes hands, although in that case it must pay the property owner's expenses.

HEADLINE: Fewer Relocations, and Each Costs More

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHEN a 38-year-old engineer in Minneapolis was offered a new position in the New York City area, he hesitated, although professionally it was a big career advancement.
''He was worried about leaving his $160,000 house in a suburb of Minneapolis for a lesser one, costing twice as much, in a New York suburb; and his wife, a teacher, was reluctant about leaving her job,'' said Matthew M. Luca, president and chief operating officer of Prudential Relocation Management in White Plains.
The high-tech communications company wooing the engineer thought so much of the candidate, Mr. Luca said, that it eventually paid $90,000 in relocation costs to transfer the engineer and his family to a new home in Armonk, near its corporate headquarters in White Plains.
''Included was the cost of moving the couple's 22-foot sailboat, their second car, plus fees for career counseling for the wife, to help her find a new job in Westchester,'' Mr. Luca said.
The cost of transferring an employee into the Westchester area is more than double the average cost of $40,000 nationwide for relocating an employee, Mr. Luca said. And relocation efforts are being influenced by the changing demographics of the workforce, as well as the current housing market here. 
 
Fewer Moves, More Cost
''Understandably, companies in the Northeast are very selective about moving employees today,'' he said. ''And while they are moving fewer of them, they are spending more on each relocation.''
Mr. Luca said Prudential Relocation was formed in September 1989 with the Prudential's purchase of Merrill Lynch Realty and Merrill Lynch Relocation Management. ''Prudential was anxious to get into the financial-services industry and Merrill Lynch was selling because it was getting out of the real estate industry,'' he explained. ''We provide relocation services to more than 30,000 employees and their families for more than 400 major corporate clients a year.''
Mr. Luca, who spent 16 years as vice president of Merrill Lynch Relocation Management Services, said few companies were moving into New York, Connecticut and New Jersey because of the high cost of living in the area.
''The market is still suffering from the inflated real-estate prices of the 80's here. Houses are still overpriced and what has happened is an exodus of companies leaving the area to relocate in lower-cost states such as Georgia and Texas, where house prices are still low.''
The second-quarter report issued by the Westchester County Board of Realtors, based in White Plains, bears this out. The report showed a decrease of nearly 11 percent in closings from the second quarter of last year.
Henry W. Fries, president of the Board of Realtors, said, ''The logjam in the market may shake loose if we see additional price reductions, more than the 2 to 3 percent that was indicated in our report. Low interest rates alone are not sufficient. Sellers still have not confronted the reality that prices overshot the real market during the last few years of the 1980's.''
Prudential Relocation's latest management survey of corporate mobility policies among major American corporations showed that companies moved 12 percent fewer employees last year than in 1988, Mr. Luca said, with almost half the companies surveyed reporting difficulties in getting employees to transfer to high-cost-of-living areas.
''Today, employees voice concern about quality-of-life issues,'' he said. ''And in two-income families there are worries about the spouse's job.
 
The Big Picture Is Changing
Companies are facing problems that are linked to changing demographics: by the end of the decade it is expected that more than 50 percent of the professional work force will be made up of married women.
The number of dual-career families has increased steadily every year, said Rose Emerson, president of Courier Relocation Corporation of America, which provides career counseling to transferred spouses of large companies like Citibank, Kraft, General Foods and Union Carbide.
''Mobility is still an important facet of American business life,'' Ms. Emerson said. ''For example, each year we provide spousal job assistance to about 300 employees of Citibank alone.''
Ms. Emerson's company, based in Purchase, has career counselors in 94 different satellite offices nationwide who provide job assistance to more than 1,000 working spouses of client companies each year.
''Currently, about 15 percent of the spouses we work with are men,'' she said. ''But the number is growing as transferred female executives are becoming more numerous in such industries as financial services and communications. But in most industries - the oil companies in particular - we find that transferred executives are still almost always male.''
Mr. Luca said companies that offer working- spouse assistance are providing it ''in the form of out-of-pocket costs'' to the firm. ''That includes reimbursement for resume preparation, formal counseling, employment-agency fees and extra job-finding trips,'' he said.
 
Incentives for Mobility
But mobility ''isn't what it once was,'' Mr. Luca said. ''Several years ago, if you didn't accept a move, you were sidetracked in a company. Although flexibility is still important in going up the career ladder, increasing numbers of companies report that they are not getting their first choice of employees. Some companies in the county, notably those in the communications and financial-services industry, are offering employees additional incentives to move'' to this area, he said.
Much of the increase in relocation costs are in the rise of subsidy payments, he said. ''They consist of cost-of-living allowances, mortgage aid and tax-assistance payments. And the more progressive companies are also offering to pay for live-in help, which can cost a company about $10,000 a year.''
Some companies, he added, are finding that when it comes to house hunting, they can save money by offering the transferee a lump sum instead of paying for several house-hunting trips. ''If the employee finds a house on the first trip out,'' Mr. Luca said, ''the rest of the money is his.''
Increases in relocation costs, fueled by the high cost of housing, has directly contributed to the growth of some industries.
Edward S. Rosenfeld, president of International Furniture Rentals in Hawthorne, said his company had increased its sales volume significantly over the last several years.
''What has happened is that the soft economy and cutbacks mean that more companies are relocating executives on a temporary basis,'' Mr. Rosenfeld said. ''And when the market is flat, the trend now is to have a transferee keep his old house and rent it out furnished, and then move into a rented house in the new location and rent furniture. This helps a company's cash flow.''
Mr. Rosenfeld's company recently began construction of an addition, to expand its warehouse/distribution center in Hawthorne by nearly 40 percent.
''We've been helped by relocation specialists who are advising transferred employees to rent now, buy later,'' he said. ''In a down market, real-estate flexibility is important.''
And large companies, he said, are renting furniture as a cost-saving tactic. When J. C. Penney moved its headquarters from Manhattan to Dallas two years ago, Mr. Rosenfeld explained, ''they brought about 180 employees to New York for a year for training. By putting them in apartments with rented furniture, J. C. Penney saved about $1 million in hotel bills.'' Mr. Rosenfeld's company furnished the J. C. Penney apartments.
''Typically, for an eight-month stay in the metropolitan area, a company can save upward of $30,000 by renting an apartment for a transferred employee instead of paying for a hotel room,'' Mr. Rosenfeld estimated. ''And furniture rental costs are 100 percent tax deductible as a business expense.''
When asked how much it costs to rent furniture, Mr. Rosenfeld replied that the rule of thumb was to allot anywhere from 10 percent to 25 percent of the monthly apartment or house rental for renting furniture.
''And a lot of customers end up buying the furniture they have rented from us,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The New Arrivals; Immigrants Reshape New York;
Young Immigrant Wave Lifts New York Economy

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
For the fourth time in its history, New York City is being resettled and reshaped by migration.
The latest arrivals come largely from the Caribbean, Latin America, Asia and Africa. They have revived bleak sections of the Bronx and Brooklyn and built two new Chinatowns. They have taken fruit stands and stationery stores and fashioned them into commercial empires. They have filled low-skilled but crucial health-care jobs and may have preserved New York's garment industry.
But less evident than the proliferation of Chinese newspapers in street- corner kiosks or the Dominican flags flying from the aerials of livery cabs is the basic impact immigrants have had on the city's economy. The latest influx, which started in the 1960's, gained force during New York's remarkable economic comeback, providing a fresh source of youthful workers and helping to sustain the boom of the 1980's. 
Economists say the city still needs young people to balance a native population becoming older and smaller. But in the period of economic stagnation that has descended upon New York, there are questions about whether the immigrants will continue to arrive at their current rate, which approaches 100,000 a year, and, if they do, how well the city will be able to absorb them, at least until slack times end.
 
Inevitably, Some Hostility
Some worry as well about the prospects of immigrants already here, many of whom work in the machine shops and factories of the city's manufacturing concerns, a part of the economy that is shrinking rapidly. And the new immigrants have attracted hostility, as immigrants inevitably do, from sometimes less prosperous groups already living here.
Eighteen countries sent 5,000 or more people to New York from 1980 to 1986, led by the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Jamaica, China and Haiti. The latest influx is far more varied than two previous waves of foreigners who came to the city, the Irish and Germans between 1840 and 1860, and the Italians, Poles, Russians and Greeks from 1890 to 1915, or for that matter the migration of southern blacks and Puerto Ricans after World War II.
With perhaps 2.6 million foreign-born residents in the city, about a third of the population, immigrants are already a huge consumer market that generates economic activity and jobs.
 
'We Trust Each Other'
The new immigrants have not had much of an impact on welfare rolls, experts say, and many take jobs as restaurant workers, hotel housekeepers and hospital attendants that are often spurned by native-born residents.
They have formed networks to help newly arrived compatriots to find employment and housing and to make their way.
''We trust each other, we understand each other,'' said Sali Nezaj, an Albanian who found work in the Bronx 20 years ago as a superintendent in an apartment building and now owns buildings, hiring others from his country to work in them.
Immigrants have rebuilt whole neighborhoods of the city, including Mr. Nezaj's Kingsbridge in the Bronx, Washington Heights in Manhattan and Elmhurst in Queens, some of them home to previous waves of foreign-born settlers.
''The empty stores become full, and the full stores become better,'' said Louis Winnick, a senior consultant at the Fund for the City of New York, who has written a book about Sunset Park in Brooklyn, a neighborhood settled and resettled by the Dutch and English, Scandinavians and Irish, Italians, Poles, Greeks, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans and, most recently, Chinese.
Without the latest wave of immigration, he said, New York would be ''a boarded-up city.''
Even so, Vernon M. Briggs Jr., a professor at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, notes that some blacks who made up the third wave of migration are now returning to the South.
''I think immigration is part of what's pushing them back,'' he said.
 
From Many Lands, Youth and Ambition
In the 1970's, as the latest wave of immigration was gathering, New York City suffered a deep and demoralizing decline, as factories fled to the South and middle class residents to the suburbs. The decade that followed brought a sharp turnaround as the city gained jobs and people.
Had it not been for immigrants, many economists say, the 70's would have been worse and the 80's, though largely driven by a boom on Wall Street, less impressive. From 1980 to 1987, for example, 575,000 immigrants to New York City replaced 375,000 native-born residents, for a net gain of 200,000 people.
''Certainly, in the 80's, it would have been tough to sustain the kind of expansion we had without immigration,'' said Emanuel Tobier, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University.
The new settlers vary educationally as well as ethnically and have filtered into a wide variety of occupations, from Indian physicians to Filipino nurses to Romanian knitters to Albanian building superintendents to Chinese garment workers to Haitian cabdrivers. But they largely share one demographic characteristic: They are of working age. Some 60 percent are in the prime working years of 25 to 44.
The impact of so many relatively young people has been great. In the 1970's, immigration pushed up the potential labor supply slightly at a time the city's population was actually declining by about 1 million.
Among non-whites, employment rates also tend to be higher in foreign-born groups than in corresponding native-born groups. For example, 1980 census data indicates that 65 percent of black immigrants over 15 years old were employed, against 53 percent of native-born blacks in the same age group, and that 65 percent of Asian immigrants were employed, but 56 percent of native-born Asians.
''The people who come here are the most ambitious of the groups,'' Professor Tobier said. ''They may sometimes look like poorly educated people to us, but they are more educated than those who don't leave. And they have a higher sense of self-esteem, of what they can do in the world.''
''They have more of an incentive to work hard,'' he also said, ''and less to fall back on, in the sense of the welfare system. They come here and feel they have to rely on themselves, and their own effort. They're not plugged into the social service system.''
 
Ethnic Networking Helps New Settlers
Since the turn of the century, Ridgewood, Queens, has been a center of the knitwear industry, its hundreds of small sweater mills run by succeeding waves of immigrant labor. First were the Germans. Then, in the late 1960's, the Yugoslavs and Romanians came. Now there are growing numbers of Chinese and Hispanic workers.
At J and B Knitting Mills, at 1647 Centre Street, the time cards bear evidence of a changing ethnic mix -Lopez and Luki, Morales and Julevic, Chavez and Popopov. As she checked sweater labels on a large table before her, Vera Ljutec, who is 29 years old, said in Serbian that she had come to New York from Yugoslavia two years ago. Friends told her there was work in Ridgewood and helped her land a job.
Similarly, when Mr. Nezaj came to the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx 20 years ago, a relative who was an apartment superintendent helped him get a superintendent's job.
And so the city's new immigrants have gotten jobs the way immigrants always have - through ethnic networking, in which recent settlers are helped by earlier ones, and ethnic niching, in which various groups stake out particular kinds of employment.
Often the latest immigrants have followed older ethnic groups into specific industries and occupations. Ownership of neighborhood fruit stands has largely passed from Italians and Jews to Koreans, for example, and Chinese restaurants followed Greek coffee shops and are being followed in turn by South American establishments. Taxis once driven by Israelis and Eastern Europeans are now driven by Haitians, Dominicans, Africans and Arabs. Dominicans and Chinese have taken over from Jews and Italians in the city's garment shops. Dominicans are buying bodegas, often from Puerto Ricans.
The new immigrants are willing to work long hours and to take risks, carving out new markets for goods and services, from Mexican flower sellers to Korean manicurists to Senegalese street vendors, who are common throughout midtown, where rough-hewn wooden masks decorated with feathers and beads and solemn bronze busts of African kings look out blankly at pedestrians.
And it is hard to imagine how New York City's hospitals would have continued to function without the influx of immigrant labor.
At Mount Sinai Medical Center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, many people from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean - especially the Dominican Republic - are housekeepers. There are Jamaicans working in the kitchen and in labs. West Africans, many from Ghana, work in the laundry and wheel patients on gurneys through the corridors. Many nurses are from the Philippines; others are West Indian. There are lab technicians from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Many were physicians in their homelands, but are not accredited here.
''You rely on your country people to get jobs,'' said Estela Vazquez, an organizer for Local 1199, the hospital workers' union. ''Whoever gets in, helps the others.''
 
Few Are Homeless, But Experts Worry
Even without a return of the economic growth of 1980's - a prospect that seems increasingly unlikely - the city will still need workers.
''Ninety percent of all job openings are replacements,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
And non-immigrant New Yorkers of working age are expected to decline by more than 300,000 in the 1990's.
Should the bad economic news persist, some believe it will spread over the same networks that spread the word of prosperity in the last decade, and the flow here will slow. During the 1970's, they say, the influx of Puerto Ricans to the city reversed in response to the softening economy.
Regina B. Armstrong, an economic consultant to the Regional Plan Association, says she believes immigrants will keep coming to the city, propelled by political unrest and population pressures abroad and lured by family members and compatriots in New York. She forecasts a majority of the city's population to comprise foreign-born residents and their children by the end of the decade.
So far, the new immigrants are notably absent from the homeless population, and they are not numerous on city welfare rolls. In her book, ''Immigration in New York,'' published by Praeger, Elizabeth Bogen of the New York City Planning Department, former director of its office of immigrant affairs, found that immigrants made ''slightly less'' than their proportionate use of services and paid ''slightly less'' than their proportionate share of taxes. That, she said, was largely a result of their lower-than-average incomes and the city's graduated tax structure.
But Ms. Armstrong worries that many new settlers could become more dependent on government in a prolonged economic slump and that more immigrants may be lured into working off the books. As it is, there are hundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens in the city, many working without the knowledge of tax officials.
Immigrants are already making demands on a public school system in which at least 114 languages are spoken. At P.S. 89 in Elmhurst, Queens, a sign directing visitors is in English, Chinese, Korean and Spanish. Administrators cannot send newsletters to parents without several translators.
The Elmhurst district is one of the city's most diverse. Most of the school's 1,300 students were born in another country and almost all need to learn English, said Kay McCarthy, the assistant principal. Indeed, the school holds monthly workshops where parents are also taught English.
But given the percentage of new settlers in the child-bearing age group, the burdens on the city's schools would seem only to be beginning.
 
A Boycott Reopens An Age-Old Anger
The boycott of a Korean grocery by black residents of Flatbush, Brooklyn, was set off by the allegation that Korean merchants had assaulted a Haitian customer. But it is doubtless heightened by resentment of Koreans, who have taken over many stores in black neighborhoods, and by the more general fear that immigrants are competing for jobs, housing and other resources with black and Puerto Rican New Yorkers.
Demonstrators have complained about the lack of black-owned businesses in the area. The city's Human Rights Commission, which is trying to end the conflict, is studying ways to improve economic opportunities as well as improve relations between customers and store owners.
The issue of displacement has always shadowed major immigration. It seems especially troublesome, however, when about half a million New Yorkers of working age do not have jobs and are not even looking for them, despite living in a city that generated 350,000 new jobs in the 1980's.
While economists generally believe there is some competition between the foreign- and native-born, they disagree on its extent.
Some say immigrants have carved out their own sections of the economy, notably in personal services and manufacturing, while native-born blacks are more likely to be government workers. When they do work in the same industries and businesses, the two groups often focus on different markets.
On the other hand, immigrants are not often subject to the same degree of discrimination native-born blacks face, and have made inroads in some service industries that have resisted black workers.
But if the immigrants cause displacement, Roger Waldinger, associate professor of sociology at City College, says he believes there are offsetting benefits for the city's economy. For example, they are a major market for goods and services in their own right.
And labor experts say foreign-born workers may have helped the city retain industries that would have moved elsewhere in search of labor, particularly the garment industry.
Professor Briggs, however, says any gains have come at the cost of exploitive wages and dismal working conditions. He says he is troubled by what he believes is a revival of garment-industry sweatshops and a resurgence of child-labor law violations in ethnic stores and restaurants.
''We're recruiting third-world workers,'' he said, ''for third-world working conditions.''

HEADLINE: Labor Dept. Wants to Take On Job Bias in the Executive Suite

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Even as it is fighting Congress over a major civil rights bill, the Bush Administration says it is looking for a way to curb job discrimination in a realm that the Government has never really touched: the white male echelon that rules the nation's largest corporations.
Women and minority members complain that in climbing the corporate ladder they collide with a ''glass ceiling'' of subtle discrimination that blocks their access to the highest rung. Confirming accounts that have arisen in legal circles here, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said last week that she was devising a ''glass ceiling initiative'' to try to speed the promotion of women and minority members to top posts and threatening cancellation of Government contracts with companies that do not cooperate.
Labor Department officials say female, black and Hispanic employees make up 30 percent or more of the middle management of big corporations, but less than 1 percent at the level of the chief executive and those directly beneath.
 
Lists of Executives Cited
Combing through lists of directors and highest executives at 799 major companies this month, Fortune magazine found 3,993 men and only 19 women. Other studies show smaller proportions of black and Hispanic executives. 
Because the Federal policy will not be fully defined until September or October, Mrs. Dole declined requests for interviews about it. In written replies to a reporter's questions, however, she said: ''I have made this issue a top priority, and it will remain so during my service as Secretary of Labor. For me, it is a matter of fairness and equity, born out of personal experience.''
She added, ''There can be little doubt that a woman or minority, no matter how well-schooled, what their wage or how thick their portfolio, enters many business organizations with limited or no hope of reaching the top.''
To discourage practices that limit careers, she said, ''we will be examining developmental programs, training, rotational assignments and reward structures - all the indicators of upward mobility in corporate America.''
 
Rigid Quotas Opposed
Mrs. Dole's plan seems at odds with the White House's resistance to job discrimination provisions in the civil rights bill that has passed the Senate and is now before the House. The White House calls the bill unacceptable, saying it would force employers to set rigid numerical quotas for hiring and promoting female and minority workers.
But Alixe Glen, a spokeswoman for the President, said Mr. Bush endorsed the general goal of workplace equity. And the Administration seems to have recognized a demographic fact: the relative decline in the number of white men.
 
Social and Cultural Conditions
As yet it is unclear how far the Labor Department will be able to go in differentiating illegal discrimination, conscious or unconscious, from social and cultural conditions that contribute to the preponderance of white men at the top. Nor is it certain how deeply department investigators can legally dig into a company's affairs. And it is not clear how much Mrs. Dole might commit in money and personnel to the initiative.
But her aides say that at least some patterns of discrimination can readily be found by such tactics as tracing the progress of men, women and minority members through the executive ranks, by examining compensation plans and executive advancement programs and by comparing a company's mix of top executives with those of other companies in similar places and industries.
And the aides note that with two other issues Mrs. Dole has singled out for emphasis, violations of child labor laws and of worker safety regulations, she has been collecting more in penalties for violations than any of her predecessors.
Within the Labor Department, 20 of Mrs. Dole's 32 top executive appointees, or 63 percent, are female, black or Hispanic, second to the Department of Health and Human Services, with 70 percent.
 
Johnson Executive Order
The department's tool in thwarting discrimination in industry is the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and it is playing tougher than it has in years. The office enforces an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that prohibits Government contractors from discriminating on the basis of sex, race, religion or national origin. The office monitors the affirmative action programs of more than 10,000 companies that have about $200 billion in Federal contracts.
Last year, in its largest financial settlement involving a discrimination case, the contract compliance office won a $14 million back pay award for female and minority employees of the Harris Bank in Chicago.
Now, in trial runs leading to a full-fledged glass ceiling investigation, the Labor Department recently began dispatching investigators to the executive suites of a dozen major companies. Department officials declined to identify them.
At this rarefied level of corporate life, discrimination typically is subtler than the overt obstacles to hiring and promotion that show up at lower levels. Executives may be favored for promotion if they have had foreign assignments, for example, or advanced business courses - opportunities some companies offer only to men.
 
The Exclusion Factor
Or, among managers at a meeting, women may be asked to take notes, inhibiting their freedom to participate and compete. Or men may negotiate deals in places not open to women and minority members, like some private clubs.
Jeffrey A. Norris, a Washington lawyer who is president of the Equal Employment Advisory Council, which is financed by 200 leading companies, said many companies had set up procedures intended to open the highest ranks to women and minority members and do not object to the Labor Department's scrutiny. But he said some companies were afraid that the department would prove meddlesome and would inadvertently disclose corporate secrets, including salaries.
Some companies are challenging the constitutionality of the Johnson executive order. Charles J. Cooper, a Washington lawyer who was an assistant Attorney General in the Reagan Administration, said he was helping prepare a court challenge.
Corporate opposition to the Dole initiative is easy to find. ''I'd hate to see the Government poking into this,'' said Lester Korn, head of Korn/Ferry International, an executive recruiting concern.
 
Late Entrance in Work Force
Barbara J. Laski, vice president and treasurer of the Capital Holding Corporation in Louisville, Ky., who is one rung removed from the 33 men and 2 women who run the big insurance and financial services company, said, ''I don't think you can regulate that kind of thing.''
Critics of the Labor Department plan say the disparity for women arises because large numbers of them did not enter the work force until the 1970's and few have reached the age - 50 or 55 - when people are usually promoted to the top jobs. But by now a few in their 30's or 40's might have been expected to have reached the top, as a few men normally do.
Black and Hispanic executives, longer in the work force, are often hindered by economic, cultural and educational obstacles, as well as by illegal discrimination, Labor Department officials say.
The compliance office acknowledges that finding subtle forms of discrimination at a company's highest reaches can be difficult. In trying to arrest it, the office pays more attention to the manifestations of discrimination than to the causes. All Federal contractors with more than 100 employees must file annual affirmative action reports with the office, showing the breakdown of women and minority executives at nine levels of the corporate structure.
 
How the System Works
If a company's breakdown diverts sharply from patterns among other employers in the area and in its industry, the office sends the company a letter asking for further details that it uses to try to determine whether the disparities might result from discrimination. It then sends two to five of its 685 investigators to spend up to a week at the company, looking into the disparities.
''We look at how people who are where they are got there,'' said Leonard J. Biermann, the office's deputy director.
The office's findings can be challenged to an administrative law judge.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Asian Allies Deadlock Over Boat People

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 29

 BODY:
Three days of talks between the United States and its Southeast Asian allies have failed to break a deadlock on how to treat thousands of Vietnamese refugees who continue to arrive on foreign shores every year.
The impasse over whether nations have the right to forcibly repatriate selected refugees back to Vietnam threatens to tear apart international agreements under which Hong Kong and nations like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines admit Vietnamese who flee their country, despite risk of becoming victims to pirates or stormy seas.
The Southeast Asian nations want to begin to clear out the 125,000 Vietnamese who inhabit squalid camps in their countries, and prevent more people from leaving Vietnam. But the United States, which finances much of the refugee relief and grants a large number of Vietnamese permanent refuge, has opposed involuntary return of refugees, even among those classified as economic migrants. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d presented the six foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, what was described as a modified American position on Vietnamese ''boat people'' under which refugees would be encouraged though not required to return to their homeland.
 
Counseling Is Suggested
Mr. Baker suggested that while the United States could not support involuntary repatriation, it would not oppose returning ''those who do not object'' after screening and counseling. He also said the United States was committed to resettling or returning all asylum-seekers by late 1992.
But today, at the close of the Asean meeting, officials who say their countries have the sovereign right to accept or not accept refugees sternly dismissed Mr. Baker's position as a thinly veiled restatement of the old American position against forced repatriation.
In private meetings, the Asian foreign ministers told Mr. Baker that if Washington did not move closer to their position, they might eventually be forced to scrap the Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indo-Chinese refugees, under which several Asian countries and Hong Kong offer Vietnamese asylum with the financial support of Western industrialized nations. The agreement, they say, guarantees resettlement for poltiical refugees, not economic migrants.
''The gap between Asean and the United States remains quite big,'' said Datuk A. Kamil Jaafar, Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ''The Baker position does not represent a movement forward.''
 
Baker Plan Called Unworkable
Helen Barber, the acting director of the Southeast Asia Bureau of the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said the Baker position ''is not workable,'' because it does not distinguish between political refugees and migrants who leave Vietnam to escape poverty.
Mrs. Barber added that the Comprehensive Plan of Action ''is in danger; it can fall apart if there is no movement by the United States.''
The principle of first asylum has suffered a severe setback over the last 15 months as Malaysia pushed off an estimated 8,700 boat people trying to land on its shores. Scores of those refugees have been robbed, raped or killed by pirates after they were refused entrance.
The discord between the United States and the Asian nations was highlighted three weeks ago when a 28-nation conference on boat people in Geneva was postponed because participants saw no hope for bridging the gap on forced repatriation.
Such discord prompted Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to shuttle around Europe, Asia and the United States to try to come up with a compromise arrangement before the Asean meeting to save the principle of first asylum.
The outlines of Mr. Stoltenberg's proposal were endorsed by Mr. Baker before the Asean meeting.
Southeast Asian diplomats said they find the Stoltenberg proposal vague, and they indicated that they hoped the United States would further modify its position on the refugees.
 
Accept Refugees, U.S. Urged
Raul Manglapus, the Philippines Foreign Minister, said the United States should simply accept all the Vietnamese refugees.
''The United States,'' he said, ''has all the land in the world to absorb them.''
Other Asian diplomats privately expressed hope that the United States would improve relations with Vietnam. An end to the economic embargo of Hanoi, they suggested, would improve the Vietnamese economy and dampen the desire of many to leave.
Mr. Baker's attendance at the Asean meeting was very much a mission to soothe tensions on the refugee issue and explain recent shifts in Cambodian policy. He privately told the foreign ministers that the Administration was in part obliged to respond to Congressional pressures when it dropped diplomatic support for the Cambodian guerrilla coalition, but that President Bush continued to share their desire to limit Vietnamese power in the region.
The foreign ministers told Mr. Baker that they would like him to consult with them more on Indochina policy in the future, but they resisted expressing harsh public criticism of American policy on Cambodia.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Aide, Praising U.S., Sees Hope of Cambodia Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, July 29

 BODY:
Reacting to the American policy shift on Cambodia 11 days ago, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said today that he was optimistic about a settlement of the Cambodian conflict. He said Hanoi agreed with Washington that the main issue now was how to get to ''free, fair and democratic elections under international supervision.''
The comments by Mr. Thach in an interview here marked a considerable change in tone and emphasis for the Foreign Minister.
For years, negotiations on Cambodia have been bogged down over what Mr. Thach now calls ''the petty, transitory details'' - how power should be shared by the four rival Cambodian factions before elections. Still, Mr. Thach was not specific today about what type of transitory phase Hanoi would accept. 
On July 18, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced that Washington was withdrawing its diplomatic support at the United Nations for a Cambodian opposition coalition including the Communist Khmer Rouge. Mr. Baker said the United States would open talks on Cambodia with Vietnam, which backs the Cambodian Government in Phnom Penh. The talks are scheduled to begin Aug. 6 in New York Moves on the Chess Board Mr. Thach said the timing of the American move surprised him, adding: ''But sometimes when one pawn moves, it changes the whole chess board. So now, on the Cambodian problem, others will move also.''
It made the game more complicated, he said. ''but if you are a good player, you take your chance.''
Asked if he was a good player, and if he would take his chance, he shrugged, smiled and said: ''Yes. Why not?''
Mr. Thach went out of his way not to gloat over what some in Southeast Asia regard as a major American concession to Hanoi, calling the United States decision ''very wise'' and saying, ''If we are too ambitious, we kill the goose to get the golden egg.''
Mr. Thach, a jovial and skillful negotiator, said, ''Now I am thinking how to cooperate with America and facilitate this issue of Cambodia, and how to cooperate and have fair, free and democratic elections under international supervision.''
 
Importance of Elections Stressed
''The decisive point is general elections,'' he said. ''Everything else is petty details. All will be solved by general elections.''
Hanoi installed the present Cambodian Government in 1979 after it invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule more than a million Cambodians died. The guerrilla coalition seeking to oust the Vietnamese-backed Government is dominated by the Khmer Rouge, and includes two non-Communist factions. The coalition is nominally led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, head of one of the non-Communist forces.
As recently as two months ago, a promising opening between Vietnam and China, the principal backer of the Khmer Rouge, turned sour over the shape and responsibility of an interim Cambodian authority to run or represent the country.
The way in which power is shared is widely expected to influence the fairness and outcome of the elections.
Asked if Vietnam was prepared to see the Cambodian Prime Minister, Hun Sen, lose elections, Mr. Thach laughed and said, ''If you play a game, you must work for the best and be prepared for the worst.''
Vietnam, he stressed, had two main interests now in Cambodia: a neutral, indepedent and nonaligned country that posed no threat to its neighbors, and a rapid move to supervised elections to resolve the Cambodian conflict and end the external supplies of arms to the combatants.
Asked if that meant Vietnam would urge Phnom Penh to compromise on the formation of an interim authority, or supreme national council, and allow a major role for the United Nations, Mr. Thach hedged.
 
Cambodian 'Sensitivity' Noted
''The Cambodians must decide for themselves,'' he said. ''They are the key. Outsiders can advise, but cannot dictate to them.''
With a slight smile, he added, ''You know how sensitive the Cambodians are about their sovereignty.''
Pressed for Vietnam's position on a council and the United Nations role, he said: ''I don't say yes, and I don't say no. In these matters I will support any agreement among the Cambodian parties. I should only have a say on the external aspects.''
In these responses, too, Mr. Thach seemed eager to say nothing that would bias or forestall the coming talks with the United States.
Hanoi and Phnom Penh have always objected to a major United Nations role in a settlement, for instance, saying the organization was biased so long as the opposition coalition held Cambodia's seat. So for Mr. Thach, the American shift about the seat is enormously helpful, even if Washington was recoiling from the Khmer Rouge rather than trying to bolster Mr. Hun Sen.
 
Hun Sen's Position Undercut
The effect, however, apparently is what matters, particularly when Mr. Hun Sen's position had been undercut by governmental corruption, low morale and his failure to deliver peace.
Mr. Thach's position in the Vietnamese leadership is thought to have been strengthened as well. He insisted that Vietnam had to withdraw its troops from Cambodia last year to receive Western aid, investment and technology that had largely been blocked by an American-led embargo.
But Mr. Baker's announcement, with its implicit promise of more rapid normalization, was the first tangible dividend for Mr. Thach's policy.
As for the Khmer Rouge, Mr. Thach said, ''I don't think anyone wants the genocidal regime reinstalled.''
He played down reports of Khmer Rouge military successes, saying the Cambodian Government held all main towns, cities and highways. He compared the Khmer Rouge to ''a skin disease, uncomfortable, but not cancer.'' Still, he said, ''the economic situation in Cambodia is not so good,'' with rising inflation, lack of confidence and reduced aid from other countries.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
4 European Nations Planning a New Focus on North Africa

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 26

 BODY:
Increasingly alarmed by the potential for unrest in North Africa, four southern European nations have begun organizing a major international initiative to bolster political stability and economic development in the Mediterranean region.
Officials from the four countries -Spain, France, Italy and Portugal -acknowledge that they are essentially motivated by self-interest. Specifically, they fear that a surge of Islamic fundamentalism and deepening poverty could bring them a new wave of Muslim immigrants.
But they also argue that after the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact, the southern rim of the Mediterranean could emerge as the greatest single threat to Western Europe's security. 
''Europe's focus is beginning to turn from East-West to North-South,'' a Spanish official said. ''And when we talk about security, we mean security in the broadest of senses, from migratory flows to food supplies.''
 
Informal Forum Established
To address that challenge, the four countries are promoting the idea of a conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, modeled after the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which for the last 15 years has served as a forum for East-West negotiations.
As a first stage, the four countries have established an informal Forum for Regional Cooperation in the Mediterranean with Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania, which as members of the Arab Mahgreb Union, are also discussing the idea of forming a common market of their own.
Eventually, the plan is to involve more countries from Europe and the Mediterranean. This month, a Spanish delegation briefed State Department officials on the state of negotiations with the idea of insuring Washington's participation in an eventual Mediterranean conference.
So far, the discussions have been taking place at a technical level, mainly among officials from Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. But the four countries hope to make their initiative formal at a meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Spain in late September.
 
Anti-Immigrant Sentiments
Traditionally, France was the European country with deepest ties to North Africa, with large immigrant populations from former colonies like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia living in its territory. Today, France is also the European country where anti-immigrant sentiments run strongest.
But in recent years, as their societies have become more prosperous, Spain and Italy have begun receiving more immigration from North and West Africa. That has resulted in new racial tensions and occasional acts of violence against Arab and African workers.
And, experts say, North African migration to Europe continues to be stimulated by troubled economies and booming populations. According to World Bank projections, for example, the combined population of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will grow from 54 million, in 1987, to 127 million in 2025.
After the Islamic Salvation Front won a majority in local elections in Algeria last month, there was also new fear in France and other southern European countries that Islamic fundamentalism could begin to destabilize Muslim countries that for many years have had political stability.
 
'Shock Treatment' Initiative
Amid warnings that the region should not be neglected in favor of Eastern Europe, awareness of the need to help North Africa has been growing in the 12-nation European Community. Abel Matutes, head of Mediterranean policy at the European Commission, recently proposed a $3.3 billion package of assistance for eight countries of the region.
Arguing that a more ambitious ''shock treatment'' was needed, Spain began consulting its southern European neighbors this year about a broader initiative. Spanish officials said Italy immediately agreed to co-sponsor the idea, while France and Portugal joined later.
Borrowing the method used successfully by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the four countries are now working with the idea of creating three separate topic areas -economic cooperation, security and the human dimension.
A senior Spanish official said that formula would permit a global approach to the region's problems, incorporating everything from population growth and urban concentration to Islamic fundamentalism, unemployment and immigration. ''The idea is to pull everything together,'' he said.
 
Assurances on Naval Forces
As with the European Conference's 1975 Helsinki accords, he said, the Mediterranean Conference could also eventually draw up ''a common code of conduct,'' which would cover political and human rights and establish democracy as a universal objective.
Other diplomats said the four co-sponsors had started dealing with the five members of the Arab Mahgreb Union, but they recognized that any regional conference would have to include countries of the eastern Mediterrean as far as Turkey and even Balkan countries like Romania and Bulgaria.
They said the co-sponsors had already sought to reassure France, Britain and the United States that any debate on security by such a conference would not lead to a questioning of their right to maintain naval forces in the Mediterranean.
''We're thinking of a process that will have many different stages and will inevitably be extended,'' the senior Spanish official said. ''And from our point of view, the most important thing is economic cooperation. Remember, it was 15 years before the European Conference bore fruit.''

HEADLINE: Premier of Trinidad Offers to Quit if Rebels End Coup

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, July 29

 BODY:
Trinidad and Tobago's security chief said today there was scant hope of an early breakthrough in negotiations for the release of Prime Minister Arthur N .R. Robinson, who was taken hostage on Friday in a coup attempt by Muslim rebels and reportedly wired to explosives.
Gunfire and widespread looting continued for the third day, turning the capital's downtown streets into a virtual combat zone. A curfew was extended throughout this two-island Caribbean nation in an effort to restore order.
A senior official at Port of Spain's main hospital said that at least 300 people had been wounded since the group of Muslim militants began its attempt to topple the Government on Friday. The leader of the group, Abu Bakr, said his aim was to end Government corruption. 
Appearing on national television, Security Minister Herbert Atwell described the negotiations with the group holding Mr. Robinson and key members of his Cabinet at the Parliament building as a ''touch-and-go situation.''
 
Exploring 'Reasonable Options'
''We are going to exhaust all reasonable options for a peaceful solution,'' he said, adding ''I am in no position to give any hope'' for an early solution. Asked how long he believed the standoff would last, he replied: ''If I could answer that, I could win the lottery. I can give no indication.''
It was the Government's first statement on its negotiations with members of the radical Jamaat al- Muslimeen group, and it flatly contradicted rebel statements that Mr. Robinson had agreed to resign and that an accord was near.
Flying with President Bush from Kennebunkport, Me., to Washington, the United States national security adviser, Brent Scrowcroft, also denied a report today of a deal involving the 63-year-old Prime Minister's resignation.
Mr. Robinson, who was wounded in the leg when the rebels stormed the Parliament, has served as Prime Minister since 1986. Elections are not due until the end of 1991.
 
Curfew Extended
Announcing tougher security measures in Trinidad and Tobago, which has a population of 1.3 million, Mr. Atwell said that a national curfew was being extended from 12 to 18 hours a day and that military and police units had begun joint patrols.
Mr. Atwell, who was not in the Parliament when the rebels burst in firing AK-47 assault rifles, said the Government had decided to impose a 24-hour curfew around the Parliament and the television station where the rebels are holed up.
In storming the Parliament building and seizing control of a state-run television station on Friday, the Muslim rebels said they had toppled the elected Government.
The army and the police have remained loyal to the Government and surrounded the buildings held by the rebels. A tense standoff resulted.
Despite the capture of Mr. Robinson and other officials, ''the Government is functioning and is taking every step to restore security,'' Mr. Atwell said.
 
Accord Had Been Predicted
The extremists led by Abu Bakr are known as the Jamaat al-Muslimeen. About 250 of the group's members are believed to be involved in the coup attempt.
The rebels said late Saturday that they were close to an agreement that provided for Mr. Robinson's resignation, new elections within 90 days and an amnesty for the coup plotters.
But almost 24 hours after that statement was issued by a rebel spokesman, the state radio station quoted a rebel leader as saying that the negotiations were taking longer than expected.
As gunfire continued to crackle today in Port of Spain, a senior official at the capital's main hospital said that about 300 people had been wounded, most of them by gunfire, since violence flared Friday.
Stewart Smith, assistant administrator of the city's state-run General Hospital, said about 200 of those people were still being treated. The Caribbean News Agency reported over the weekend that 22 people had been killed.
 
Measures Against Looters
Announcing the deployment of police and military patrols, the Acting Police Superintendent, Leonard Taylor, said late today, ''There has been serious looting and we are going to take stronger measures to prevent it.''
The radio said that the police were under orders to shoot looters, who have rampaged through the center of the capital and left practically every shop empty.
The rebels denied reports that they had demanded a plane to fly Abu Bakr and his followers to Libya, a country that the rebel leader has visited several times.
The Government radio said that negotiations for an end to the hostage crisis were continuing, with a senior Anglican cleric, Knolly Clarke, acting as a mediator. Ignoring the Signs? A senior police official said today that the Government had ignored police warnings that the Muslim group was planning violent operations with the backing of Libya.
The official, who declined to be named, said that the police raided one of the group's communes earlier this year and discovered a cache of weapons. Last December, he said, three Libyans visited Trinidad to train Muslim militants.
Although detailed information on these activities was relayed to the Government, no action was taken, he said.
Trinidad and Tobago, a multiracial, oil-producing republic off the Venezuelan coast, has been hit hard by a fall in oil prices. Unemployment has jumped to 20 percent.
 
Foreigners Seek to Leave
Commercial flights to Port of Spain were suspended again today.
At the Hilton Hotel, dozens of foreigners, including a number of Americans and Europeans on vacation, crowded into the lobby seeking information on when they could leave.
The capital's residents were advised to stay off the streets.
The Bishop of Trinidad and Tobago, Clive Abdulah, appealed today for an end to the looting. ''Those who have set up a whole convoy of vehicles to take away large iterms such as refrigerators, TV's and video recorders should stop,'' he said in a radio broadcast.
Residents of the capital said that the coup attempt was precipitated by a police raid last month on swampland reclaimed and developed by the Muslim group on the outskirts of the capital over the past decade.
The group had built schools, a mosque and other buildings on the land, which the Government says the group does not own and is seeking to have them vacate.
 
Rebels Trained in Libya
WASHINGTON, July 29 (Special to The New York Times) - The leaders of the Muslim group holding the Prime Minister of Trinidad and other hostages received training in Libya last fall, State Department officials said today, but it is unclear whether the militants acted alone or had foreign backing for their coup attempt.
''These people definitely have a Libyan connection,'' said a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among those who were trained in Libya were the group's leader, Abu Bakr, and two aides, the official said.
Mr. Abu Bakr was described by a State Department official as a ''do-gooder'' who has tried to cultivate a following among the country's poor.
An official of the Trinidad Defense Ministry, interviewed by telephone today, described the group as ''radical'' and ''fanatical,'' but said that it had not been actively involved in politics.
In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation monitored today in Barbados, Mr. Abu Bakr said he had visited Libya several times.
''I am a personal friend of Colonel Qaddafi,'' he said. ''I am a Muslim and they are Muslims. I have also had help from other Muslim countries, such as Saudi Arabia.''
State Department officials expressed disbelief that the group had any ties to Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Urban League Leader Calls Equality Essential to U.S.

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

 BODY:
Citing projections that members of minorities will make up a larger and larger part of the nation's work force, the president of the National Urban League said last night that the United States must grant them equality not merely out of a moral imperative but for ''its own economic self-interest.''
''Unless they are brought into the mainstream,'' the president, John E. Jacob, said, ''this country's living standard will nose dive and we'll lose out to the Japanese and Germans, who make better use of their people.''
''America has only one hope of entering the 21st century as a world power and a global economic force,'' he added. ''That is its ability to achieve racial parity and to make full use of the African Americans and minorities it has so long rejected.'' 
Mr. Jacob gave the keynote address before an audience of 3,000 on the opening day of the civil rights group's 80th anniversary conference at the New York Hilton. The organization was founded in New York in 1910 to help rural blacks make a successful transition to urban life.
 
No Shyness About Politics
The Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are the nation's two largest black organizations. While politics is the principal arena of the N.A.A.C.P., the Urban League has concentrated its efforts on economic and social issues.
But Mr. Jacob did not shy from politics. In addition to emphasizing American self-interest in achieving civil rights, Mr. Jacob said American blacks must increasingly rely on political muscle rather than constitutional protections as interpreted by the courts. Nothing has brought this home more clearly, he said, than the recent resignation of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court and the nomination of Judge David H. Souter to replace him.
''As the Supreme Court becomes a conservative playground,'' Mr. Jacob said, ''the front line defense of our rights will be the Congress and state and local legislatures.''
He said he was not prepared to pass judgment on the qualifications of Judge Souter until more is made public about his views. But Mr. Jacob added, ''It is clear that the aspirations of African Americans will depend more on the executive and legislative branches than on the courts.''
 
Speeches by Office Holders
Mr. Jacob took note of the political achievements of blacks in recent years in announcing that Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York and Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia will be among those to address the convention, which ends Wednesday evening. Both men are the first blacks to hold their offices.
The Urban League president acknowledged that his ideas about American self-interest or political muscle were not original. Black political power has been building for decades; in addition to Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Wilder, there are some 7,000 black elected officials in the United States.
As for self-interest, Mr. Jacob quoted Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist and sociologist, as writing 50 years ago in ''The American Dilemma,'' a benchmark book on race relations, ''America is free to choose whether the Negro shall remain her liability or become her opportunity.''
Mr. Jacob said, ''That stark choice is still present today. America can decide whether African Americans represent a liability because of continued denial of opportunity or whether we become the engine of America's future economic growth.''
 
A Changing Work Force
The nation's demographics are changing, he said. ''A predominantly native-born white male work force is a thing of the past. In the 1990's, more than four out of five new workers will be women, immigrants, Hispanics, or African Americans.''
The implications for educational programs, child care and equality are many, he said, adding, ''It means that job discrimination is not only a civil rights issue - it's a form of economic suicide.''
Mr. Jacob warned that in the past, ''America has often allowed racism to dictate wrong choices.''
''So it is possible that America would rather endure economic decline than assure future prosperity by moving toward racial parity. But history also teaches that vested interest drives America's actions. So while moral considerations may take a back seat, America may just move to racial parity in its own economic self-interest.''
In his speech, Mr. Jacob outlined several steps he said would enable members of minorities to achieve racial equality by the year 2000. Among them were these:
* Spending the expected savings on military programs because of changes in Europe - which he put at $150 billion a year - to help reduce the nation's growing deficit, roll back taxes for ''working people'' and expand social programs.
* Starting an urban Marshall Plan as a centerpiece of the expanded programs to concentrate on repairing roads, bridges and mass transit systems and on making ''investments in human capital'' to ''prepare our work force for the brave new world of the future.''
* Convening a ''national summit meeting'' on employment issues to insure that ''everyone, and especially today's excluded minority youth'' receives the education and skills ''to make it in our society.''
* Approving the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which seeks to reverse six Supreme Court decisions that civil rights groups say are hampering Federal efforts to fight job discrimination. President Bush has threatened to veto the measure.
''All elected officials have to be held accountable for their actions on that bill,'' Mr. Jacob said. ''A veto will end the President's chances of capturing significant black votes in 1992.''

HEADLINE: An Office That Has the Capital's Ear

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
When Congress suspects that an Administration has ignored or covered up a problem, it dispatches a collection of faceless auditors to investigate. Typically, the General Accounting Office finds the problem worse than anyone suspected.
Whether the issue is the savings and loan debacle, the cost of cleaning up radioactive waste or the cause of an explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, White House officials often concede the validity of G.A.O. findings.
If Congress seems to have the upper hand in a political tug-of-war with the President, that is partly because it can call upon the accounting agency, a cadre of professional experts who, for the better part of the agency's 69-year existence, have consistently turned out top-quality research.
As head of the General Accounting Office, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher makes authoritative pronouncements on a mind-boggling array of volatile questions. With Mr. Bowsher entering the 10th year of his 15-year term, the G.A.O. is at the zenith of its power, as demonstrated by recent events. 
 
Getting Their Attention
Concern in Congress and the Bush Administration over the savings and loan bailout jumped noticeably in April when Mr. Bowsher said the cost, including interest, could total $500 billion over 30 years. The figure was roughly twice as much as previous official estimates.
Tests performed for the G.A.O. forced the Navy to reconsider its conclusion that the explosion aboard the Iowa last year resulted from a suicidal act of sabotage by a desperate young sailor. The accounting agency said it was more likely that gunpowder bags, rammed into the breech of a gun at high speed, had ignited accidentally.
And the G.A.O. was the first Government agency to sound an alarm over safety and environmental hazards at the nation's nuclear weapons plants, years before Congress or the Energy Department focused on the problem.
With 5,100 employees and a current annual budget of $364 million, the agency is busier than ever. It issued 880 reports and 3,800 legal rulings last year, and in the last 12 months it began 1,500 audits and investigations at the request of Congress.
 
Can Act on Its Own
The G.A.O. can initiate studies on its own, but a steadily increasing proportion of its work, now 82 percent, is produced in response to Congressional requests. The agency often negotiates with lawmakers to insure that Congressional assignments mesh with its work plan, focusing on what the agency calls ''issues of national significance.''
The G.A.O. is required to perform work requested by the heads of Congressional committees and, as a matter of policy, its guidelines say, ''We assign equal status to requests from ranking minority members.'' It also responds to many requests from junior members of Congress as resources permit.
By most accounts, the agency, often described as an investigative arm of Congress, deserves its reputation for incorruptibility and intellectual honesty. Accounting and financial management have long been its strong suit. By its own estimate, the G.A.O. saved $79 billion for the Government over the last five years.
But it is not just a financial auditor. Most of its work is program evaluation. Nearly every important piece of legislation passed by Congress directs the G.A.O. to study its effects. Three-fourths of the agency's recommendations are adopted. Biased Toward Congress? If the accounting agency has one institutional weakness, its critics say, it is a subtle, pervasive bias in favor of Congress: a predisposition to favor Congressional action as the solution to problems.
The agency rarely investigates Congress, even though many people say there is at least as much mismanagement and misconduct on Capitol Hill as in any Federal agency. Asked if he ever considered doing a comprehensive audit of Congress, Mr. Bowsher said, ''I'd love to do it, but in my 15th year.''
Mr. Bowsher, a former partner at Arthur Andersen & Company who once served as Comptroller of the Navy, is paid $96,600 a year and can be removed only for neglect of duty, malfeasance or misconduct. Mr. Bowsher, 59 years old, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan from a list of eight candidates recommended by Congress.
Harry S. Havens, one of 11 assistant comptrollers general, acknowledged that close ties between the G.A.O. and Congressional committees, which often use the agency's research for partisan political ends, ''could pose significant risks to credibility'' for the watchdog agency. Republicans in the Reagan and Bush Administrations complain that the G.A.O. is used by senior Democrats in Congress to ''micromanage'' the executive branch.
 
A Critic Speaks Out
Former officials in the executive branch give the G.A.O. high marks, with a few exceptions, like James C. Miller 3d, Mr. Reagan's second budget director, who said: ''The work is spotty, uneven. All too frequently, G.A.O. has been politicized by members of Congress to do a hit job.''
John S. Herrington, who was Energy Secretary in the Reagan Administration, complains that the accounting office has become ''a kingdom, a law unto itself.'' At the same time, he said, ''I give G.A.O. high marks for its work on nuclear waste and weapons production.''
The secret of G.A.O.'s success is its institutional culture, its methodological rigor and technical expertise. Dozens of engineers, economists, social scientists, psychologists, biochemists, geologists, actuaries, statisticians and computer scientists have joined the accountants and lawyers who form the backbone of its staff. Such expertise enables the G.A.O. to answer tough questions about chemical weapons, spacecraft computers, pesticide residues, global warming, cancer drugs and controlling infection in military hospitals.
The G.A.O. also puts extraordinary emphasis on recruiting and training and has established special links with 60 college campuses, using senior agency officials as recruiters. It had 7,000 applications for 200 professional jobs this year. Young auditors who join the G.A.O. seem to believe deeply that government can and should work. Many have worked at consulting firms for higher salaries, but prefer the G.A.O. because, they say, its standards are higher and they do not have to chase after business.
 
Access to Much Data
The G.A.O. works under the discipline imposed by knowing that nearly all its work will become public. It benefits from having access to Federal tax returns and classified government documents. But it may not declassify documents, and it can use tax returns only for the purpose of auditing the Internal Revenue Service.
''We have a legal right to virtually any information where the Federal dollar is involved,'' said Ira Goldstein, assistant comptroller general for operations.
As a condition of receiving Federal grants and certain contracts, private companies, universities and state and local governments must let the G.A.O. audit their books for any misuse of Federal money. The Central Intelligence Agency is the only Federal agency not subject to review by the G.A.O.
 
Clashes With Pentagon
The accounting agency is meticulous. In an annotated copy of each report, auditors list the source of every factual statement. A G.A.O. employee verifies each reference, and the draft report is reviewed by G.A.O. officials.
Despite such safeguards, G.A.O. reports often anger policy makers, and none more than at the Pentagon. About 25 percent of the agency's work focuses on the Defense Department.
Eight years of work by the accounting office documenting technical flaws in the Bigeye chemical bomb recently forced the Defense Department to cancel its production. ''Testing of the weapon was really inadequate,'' said Eleanor Chelimsky, an assistant comptroller general.
John E. Krings, director of weapons testing and evaluation at the Pentagon from 1985 to 1989, complained recently that some G.A.O. investigators had ''low levels of engineering competence and minimal knowledge'' of the military purpose for which weapons were designed. But Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democrat of Florida and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, praised the G.A.O. for ''carefully and objectively evaluating'' poison-gas munitions.
The G.A.O. was created in 1921, but it traces its roots to 1789, when Congress established a Comptroller in the Treasury Department to ''examine all accounts'' of the Federal Government. The Comptroller General has a mix of duties, some esoteric, some anachronistic. They include prescribing accounting standards for Federal agencies, settling financial claims by and against the Government and issuing authoritative opinions on the legality of Federal spending.
Mr. Goldstein, the assistant comptroller general, said, ''The duties are all tied together in a latticework that reinforces the stature of G.A.O., its image as a powerful organization.''
The G.A.O. brings the same methodical rigor to its own business as to investigations of other agencies. In 1986, when AIDS was stirring panic and prejudice, Mr. Bowsher appointed a panel of 11 G.A.O. officials to devise a policy for the agency. Their report said that G.A.O. employees with the disease should be treated humanely and should not be dismissed or subjected to discrimination.

HEADLINE: How Not to Honor Malcolm X

 BODY:
An unusual coalition of preservationists, civil rights advocates and militant groups is threatening a worthwhile project that would benefit all New Yorkers. At issue is the future of the Audubon Theater and Ballroom, where Malcolm X was assassinated 25 years ago.
The old building in northern Manhattan is abandoned and falling apart. But Columbia University and the city, which owns the site, have long had plans for putting it to good use. 
The structure includes a huge theater and, on the second floor, the Audubon ballroom and another ballroom. The original plan was to replace the building with a six-story, $25 million biomedical laboratory. The laboratory was seen as the cornerstone of a research park that would give the Washington Heights neighborhood, and by extension the whole city, a badly needed economic transfusion.
Columbia and City Hall said they would make sure that the new building contained an appropriate memorial to Malcolm X. But that wasn't enough for civil rights activists, who wanted a larger memorial, or preservationists, who wanted to preserve the Audubon ballroom and terra-cotta facade.
Their criticisms persuaded the Dinkins administration to offer a compromise. The new plan would preserve about 40 percent of the ballroom. City Hall hasn't provided firm projections of the extra costs; estimates range from $6 million to $9 million. Nor has it said where the money would come from. If City Hall can clarify these points, its compromise merits the support of the Board of Estimate, which is scheduled to vote next month.
But even the revised plan doesn't satisfy the critics, who have united behind a proposal from the Municipal Art Society that would save the entire ballroom and facade. That plan, supporters claim, would accommodate Columbia and a larger memorial. They say it would cost about $4 million. The city says it would add an unaffordable $10 million to $15 million to the project.
City Hall's analysis is persuasive. Its compromise plan is fair. Now it's up to Mayor Dinkins to guide it through the Board of Estimate.
The Mayor cannot do it alone, though. He needs help, especially from Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. Unfortunately, Ms. Messinger favors the Muncipal Art Society's approach. And under an obscure state law, she has veto power over such projects in her borough. Ms. Messinger would do the city no favor by attempting to act unilaterally. The project has citywide implications, and so deserves a full, unprejudiced hearing before the Board of Estimate.
If for any reason the compromise is blocked -either by Ms. Messinger or the board itself - all New Yorkers, including those most committed to honoring Malcolm X, may wind up with nothing but the shell of an abandoned building. And that would only honor intransigence.

HEADLINE: Reunified Germany Offers Hope for the Future;
The Constant Phoenix

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Victory With Vision in Europe'' (editorial, July 7), your comparison of the Soviet Union in the putative wake of the cold war to a defeated post-World War I Germany is interesting, but debatable. Soviet armies never invaded Western Europe, nor were subdued in all-out combat. 
Moreover, to state that ''Germany was truncated geographically, and doomed to poverty by reparations'' is more perception than fact. By and large, Germany remained intact; overseas colonies, and border areas returned on the principle of self-determination, were not inherently part of the Fatherland.
As for reparations, myth may have triumphed over reality. The estimated damages caused by invading German armies were repeatedly scaled down, and of that only the smallest fraction were ever paid. Such token amounts were subsidized by American aid tied to war-debt payments from our allies. And far from being doomed to poverty, Germany emerged as the most prosperous European country by the end of the 1920's. Its civilian infrastructure undamaged by foreign invasion, it also benefited from billions in dollar investments (public and private).
Why was Germany increasingly popular in the world of capitalism? In the 1920's and beyond, it was fear of Bolshevism. And in the aftermath of the cold war, the German economy may emerge as the prime beneficiary. Nor is its future irrevocably with the West.

HEADLINE: Reunified Germany Offers Hope for the Future;
Beyond Metternich

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Clifford A. and Charles A. Kupchan recommend the Concert of Europe as a model for a new European order (Op-Ed, July 6). The system constructed in 1815 was devised to roll back as much as possible of the revolutionary gains of the previous quarter-century, restore aristocratic privilege and block political progress. 
The German Confederation, the part of the system presided over by two of the powers, Prussia and Austria, was an alliance of increasingly repressive police states. All written works of less than 320 pages were subject to precensorship, and all others to the possibility of postpublication bans and confiscations. Writers and scholars were hounded and sometimes terrorized. The law threatened student fraternity members with fortress imprisonment and leaders with death. Jewish disabilities, relieved in the Napoleonic period, were restored.
Since, as we should know by now, a tyranny cannot manage an economy, tens of thousands of potentially useful citizens were driven to emigration. The effect was to choke off and distort the political maturation of Germany, with consequences that have been felt into our own times.
If this system has been a model for anything, it is for the order of things in Eastern Europe that is crumbling. Whatever one may think of the level of political enlightenment we have reached, surely we are beyond Meternich.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The Wrong Medicine

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The clear possibility of a recession has been raised by revised Government figures showing that the economy struggled only to a 1.2 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter. So why are White House and Congressional negotiators urging each other on to a tax increase?
Both personal consumption and personal income fell, in the latest summary, as did business investment in new plant and equipment, and housing construction. It's hard to see a tax increase as the right response to these indicators, particularly when the increase is to be coupled with a big cut in Government spending -both deflationary. 
Even if a tax increase and a cut in spending were the right medicine, the Republican package leaked to the press last week - granted that it was billed as only an opening proposal -hardly seems what the doctor should order. It would couple a cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes from Federal income taxes with stiff increases in consumption levies on beer, wine and liquor, and cut more than twice as much - $16 billion -from Federal retirement payments (excluding Social Security) as from military programs - $7 billion.
If the economy needs stimulus, as it plainly does, why increase consumption taxes and reduce retirement payments? What good is a relatively minor reduction - $54 billion - in the Federal deficit if the steps to achieve it kick the economy into the threatened recession?
Capping state and local tax deductibility at $10,000 also could hit some middle-income taxpayers hard enough to curtail their consumption - especially in the Northeastern states, where taxes are high and many economists believe a recession is already under way. Such a cap, moreover, is a bad idea in itself, without regard to its possible effects on buying power.
If the deductibility of state and local taxes were limited, then clearly state and local governments would find it more difficult to raise taxes, or in some cases to keep them at present levels. Yet the Bush Administration has been trying to shift much of what used to be Federal spending to the states and cities - in transportation, for example, in education, even in the so-called ''war on drugs.'' It makes little sense to urge the states to spend more on roads and prisons while limiting their ability to raise revenue.
The cap would have greater effect in the Northeast, where taxes are steep and services have been established at high levels, than in the lower-tax states of the South and West. At the same time, the savings and loan bailout will mostly benefit the South and the West, at the expense of other regions - and it just happens, or maybe it doesn't, that the South and the West are where the Republican Party's strength is centered.
Republicans complain endlessly that the corporation tax is double taxation on stockholders. But if the deductibility of state and local taxes is capped at $10,000, and any amounts paid above that level are taxed again by the Federals, that's much more clearly the kind of double taxation to which Republicans supposedly are opposed.
The proposal was touted as a whack at the wealthy that would make unnecessary an increase in the upper brackets of the Federal income tax. But numerous Americans who are not really at the highest income levels pay more than $10,000 in state and local property and income taxes and also would be disadvantaged by the cap. But in some circumstances, very wealthy Americans might not pay much more than $10,000 in non-Federal taxes.
Besides, more and more evidence accumulates that the Reagan-Bush Republican years of the 1980's have been one long bonanza for the rich -the most graphic accounting being Kevin Phillips's ''The Politics of Rich and Poor.'' If a tax increase is really necessary, therefore, the fairest version would be a high-bracket income-tax adjustment to recapture some of Uncle Sam's handouts to the rich. Americans who did not share in the gravy would then be able to drink their beer untroubled and deduct the full value of their state and local taxes from the Federal bill.
In view of the new and depressing economic statistics, however, those bipartisan negotiators seem to be talking about giving a sick man the wrong treatment. Bringing on a recession in their zeal to cut the deficit would be like giving a patient pneumonia in order to cure a common cold.

Which Mayor Knows Best On the Boycott?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Who's right about how best to end the boycott by black protesters against a Korean-owned grocery store in Brooklyn: Mayor David N. Dinkins or his predecessor, Edward I. Koch?
Mr. Koch is appalled by what he says is the failure of the Dinkins administration and of New York's civic and religious leaders to champion the besieged store owner and to denounce racist remarks by some demonstrators. He expressed outrage that the police refuse to enforce a court order requiring the demonstrators to stay at least 50 feet from the store.
What also galls the former mayor is his perception that public figures who have acquiesced to Mr. Dinkins's quiet diplomacy are guilty of hypocrisy. 
''I am sure that if black merchants were being boycotted and picketed by whites in Bensonhurst, the leaders would be denouncing the community and demanding action,'' Mr. Koch wrote in his New York Post column. ''Can you imagine the firestorm that would have erupted last year if, when Al Sharpton and his supporters marched in Bensonhurst after the killing of Yusuf Hawkins, and were greeted by white bigots shouting 'Nigger!' and holding up watermelons, I had said that those name-calling bigots were simply exercising their constitutional rights?''
Mr. Koch is probably right, but that may be beside the point.
The boycott of the store on Church Avenue in the Flatbush section began in January after an altercation between a black shopper and the store's Korean employees. Despite the boycott's racial overtones, some demonstrators say the underlying issue is economic empowerment in a community where blacks own few businesses.
''These things take on their own momentum,'' said Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins's deputy mayor.
Have the bigots been denounced?
Yes, but probably not as strongly as those in Mr. Koch's hypothetical protest might have been. Mr. Dinkins has, at times, deplored racist remarks by the demonstrators. But Mr. Koch complained that some officials have defended the demonstrators' free speech rights and others, whom he named, have been largely silent. Among those, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said she hadn't been asked and didn't think it was desirable to intervene in another borough; Hazel N. Dukes, who heads the state branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said she would comment when a mayoral fact-finding commission reports next month; Laura D. Blackburne, the N.A.A.C.P. counsel who heads that commission, said, ''condemning racist language is not useful if nothing else is done.'' Should the court order be enforced? Responding to a civil suit by the store owner, a State Supreme Court justice barred picketing within 50 feet of the store. The frustrated store owner asked the court to compel the police to enforce the order. The judge did; the city appealed. Police officials said the only alternative site for the demonstrators is across the street, in front of a church building, and that moving them there would probably cause a violent confrontation that could prolong the boycott.
''To protect the right to peacefully protest is not to approve the sentiments expressed by the picketers,'' said Victor A. Kovner, the city's Corporation Counsel. What would Mr. Koch have done? Better yet, what did he do? Mr. Koch said if he were still mayor, the Human Rights Commission would be suing the demonstrators and the court order would have been enforced. During a 1988 boycott of another Korean-owned store in Brooklyn, he told merchants he would support them if they sued, but said the city would not initiate a suit. They were short of money, though, and Mr. Koch's Police Commissioner, Benjamin Ward, warned them that court intervention could galvanize the demonstrators and expand the protest. ''They did it his way and went out of business,'' Mr. Koch recalled. He said it had not occurred to him then to go to the store and buy provisions for Gracie Mansion, as he has suggested Mr. Dinkins do.
That Mr. Dinkins campaigned as a conciliator and, like most of the demonstrators, happens to be black, has not carried much weight in swaying militants whom he neither knows nor wishes to antagonize. At some point, failed diplomacy may be perceived as weakness.
That Mr. Koch's message was morally correct does not mean he would have been the ideal messenger. He had so antagonized many blacks that his presence or even his public posture might have triggered larger demonstrations and further polarized the city.
''Maybe,'' Mr. Koch acknowledged, ''but at least you would have done the right thing.''

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., July 26

 BODY:
Mortgage foreclosures are soaring in the New York metropolitan region as growing numbers of property owners are overwhelmed by crushing real-estate debt.
Just months after the giddy boom years of the 1980's, with their rising home values, generous bank lending policies and firm optimism about the regional economy, banks have started declaring defaults on thousands of delinquent mortgages and forcing owners to scramble for new financing or face property losses.
Officials in the region say they are stunned by the depth and suddenness of the increase in foreclosures.
 
Worst Market in 50 Years
In many cases, officials attribute it to declining real-estate values, people including well-paid professionals carrying too much debt and the slumping construction industry. 
''There's no precedence for the numbers were getting now,'' said Myron C. Weinstein, chief of the foreclosure office of New Jersey Superior Court. ''We're getting 1,400 new filings a month and I don't think anybody knows the upside anymore. No one really knows the cause of the magnitude of the jump, except that this is the worst real-estate market in 50 years.''
''I'm seeing the most dramatic surge in the last 25 years,'' said Roger Sirlin, a Westchester County lawyer who represents mortgage lenders in southern New York. ''The foreclosures are bridging the entire socioeconomic spectrum. Right now, I'm foreclosing on doctors, lawyers, architects, dentists, stock brokers and real-estate people. I'm foreclosing on loans as high as $1.6 million. The average is around $200,000.'' In Connecticut in the last two fiscal years, bank foreclosure filings have almost tripled, to 9,248 for the year ending on June 30, from 3,482 for the year ending on June 30, 1988, said Larry Moore, a spokesman for the Connecticut Judicial Department.
Across New Jersey, similar filings rose to 11,816 in 1989, from 8,182 in 1988, Mr. Weinstein said. As of June, there were 8,478 filings, an increase of nearly 50 percent over the same six-month period last year, he said.
New York State's court system does not keep statewide figures. But county officials report sharp increases. Between January and June, judges in Westchester issued 166 judgments of foreclosure, the last step before sale of a property at auction. For all of 1989, there were 112 such judgments. Suffolk County has had 655 similar judgments through June, well ahead of the pace that produced 853 in 1989. In 1988, Suffolk had 439 judgments. In Rockland County, banks filed 251 foreclosures between January and June. There were 193 for the first six months of 1989.
In all three states, foreclosures for single-family homes have increased since 1988 while decreasing nationally, said Thomas Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America in Washington.
Regional court officials say their figures represent all commercial and residential properties. They include hundreds of single-family houses in the cities and suburbs; an unfinished town house project, Knickerbocker Village, in Old Tappan, N.J., that was sold at a sheriff's auction for $100; condominiums in North Salem, N.Y., Monmouth Beach, N.J., and near Atlantic City; a shopping center in Aberdeen, N.J., and a nursing home in Spring Lake Heights.
Beneath the figures are stories of deep debt and personal hardship and, for some, despair and tragedy. Last month in New York, a Vietnam veteran whose foreclosed home is up for auction on Aug. 3 committed suicide. #3 Months Behind on the Mortgage The man, a self-employed house framer, built his home three years ago and was unable to make his $3,000-a-month mortgage payments when his $200,000-a-year business soured, said his widow, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. She attributed his suicide to his war experience and his mounting debt.
She said she is three months behind on the mortgage payment and on an $800-a-month loan for two trucks. The banks refused to restructure the debt, she said.
''The banks didn't want any partial payment,'' she said. ''They wanted the whole thing.''
A banker in his mid-50's in Westchester County said he lost his condominium when he became overwhelemed by debt, particularly college loans for his five children. At one point, their education costs were $38,000 a year, against his annual salary of $47,500. Garnishees have cut his net weekly income from $583 to $192 and he is 10 months behind in his $1,202 mortgage payment. ''It all came down too heavy on me,'' he said. ''I just ran out of money. I've always made good on every penny of my debt and I'll pay this off if they just give me a chance.''
 
Banks 'Feeling the Pressure'
In Monmouth County, N.J., where 113 foreclosed properties have been sold at sheriff's auction between January and July 23 - as opposed to 120 for all of 1989 - a young woman returned to her foreclosed home in Hazlet after giving birth only to find that a bank that had bought her house at auction had begun eviction proceedings. A judge eventually blocked the eviction.
Experts closest to the spurt in foreclosures offer several explanations.
''In Connecticut several banks have experienced losses and Federal regulators are looking at loan portfolios,'' said Judge Aaron Ment, Chief Court Administrator for the state. ''My sense is the banks are feeling the pressure: Federal regulatory pressure and shareholder pressure and management pressure.''
Experts also say a decline in property values after their dizzying appreciation of the mid-1980's has left some owners, particularly those who bought at peak prices, watching their property values slide toward - or even below - their mortgage amount. In those cases, some willingly abandon their properties.
 
Too Much Debt, Too Little Value
''That was the real story in Texas and Oklahoma; real property lost value and people walked away,'' said George Sternlieb, founding director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. ''We're just seeing the beginning of this and no one has a handle on how long it will last.''
Another reason cited is that property owners are overextended.
Mr. Sirlin, the bankers' lawyer in Westchester County, said nearly all his foreclosures are on adjustable-rate mortgages issued in 1987 and 1988 that carried first-year interest rates of 7 percent and subsequent annual increases of two percentage points, with a maximum of 14.9 percent.
Banks, he said, were eager to lend in the late '80's and, because of a lack of Federal requirements, assessed a borrowers ability to repay only on the initial 7 percent rate.
''People can't afford the second interest bump and they're falling behind two or three months' payments,'' he said. ''That's the typical scenario.''
Banking authorities say all three elements are at work now.
''Banks are scrutinizing portfolios more closely because of pressure from regulators,'' said E. Robert Levy, executive director of the New Jersey Mortgage Bankers Association. ''I would emphasize that financial institutions and mortgage companies do not desire to foreclose. They make every effort to work things out. Foreclosure is expensive, time consuming and requires a lot of reserves to be set up.''

HEADLINE: Heritage and Pageantry At Powwow in Queens

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
More than 300 years after the Matinecock Indians traded away much of what is now eastern Queens, dancers in buckskin pants and feather headdresses swayed to the rhythm of drums during the weekend against a backdrop of Little Neck Parkway traffic.
Well into Saturday night and again yesterday afternoon, 250 Indians from the Mohawk, Hopi, Winnebago, Apache, Lenape and 20 other tribes gathered for the Thunderbird American Midsummer Powwow at the Queens County Farm Museum in Floral Park.
Men wearing war paint and waving spears slung themselves close to the ground in a warriors' dance, miming creeping up on an enemy. Women spun in a frenzy until their shawl fringes floated. ''Fancy dancers'' improvised wild moves, trying to outdo each other. Singers alternated between the slow, low-pitched wailing characteristic of the Southern Plains and the fast falsetto chant of Northern tribes. 
About 35 vendors sold Navajo rugs, Hopi kachina dolls, silver and turquoise, fry bread, corn soup, sassafras tea, Indian tacos and souvenir tepees to the 7,000 non-Indians who attended.
 
An Urban Powwow
''It's a little strange to have a powwow with all these buildings around,'' said Earl Kaye, an Arizona Navajo selling leather items and beadwork.
A powwow is traditionally a social gathering, not an open-air market. The origins of the word are disputed; some texts argue that it is Algonquin for ''rejuvenate,'' while others say it evolved from a grass dance ceremony among the Omahas.
Whatever its history, the assembly is an important way of maintaining traditions and teaching non-Indians about Indian life, organizers said.
''It's good to come together and educate the public,'' said Lance Richmond, a Mohawk from Brooklyn. ''A lot of people think Indians don't exist in New York.''
 
Like Powwows of the Plains
The powwow has been at the farm each July since 1982. The gathering was organized by the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, a New York troupe founded in 1963 to preserve Indian music and dance, and proceeds go to scholarships.
The powwow was modeled after ones on the Plains, said Louis Mofsie, the Thunderbirds' director. ''We do Western-style powwows because they're the most popular and the dancing is less structured.''
The bookstall and newsstand of the Native American Authors Distribution Project was especially popular. The project started about five years ago in Greenfield Center, N.Y., said Ron Welburn, a Cherokee managing the booth, adding, ''We're the only Native American distributor.'' Passers-by perused copies of The Cherokee Advocate, Akwesasne Notes and other newspapers.
Many booths flew American flags with the head of an Indian warrior superimposed on the stripes. ''A Navajo group in New Mexico came out with it about a year ago,'' said Doug Burdick, a Blackfoot jewelry-maker from Pennsylvania. ''Indians see it as, like, their own flag.''
 
'On the Graves of Indians'
Political views were visible at the farm's ad hoc campground. Several vans sported bumper stickers declaring: ''America was built on the graves of Indians.''
Such powwows are also opportunities for local Indians to affirm their identities.
''In the 1950's and 1960's, part of downtown Brooklyn was an Indian neighborhood, but now there's no concentrated area,'' said Rosemary Richmond, the director of the American Indian Community House, New York's largest social-service agency for Indians. ''That's part of the problem. It makes it difficult to organize Native Americans or reach them with services.''
The city has about 20,000 Indians, with another 5,000 in the suburbs, Ms. Richmond said. Many came to New York early in this century to be ironworkers on skyscrapers.
Housing, health care and unemployment are Indians' principal problems here, she said. ''There are many homeless Native Americans, and many others don't have private doctors and health insurance.'' The National Urban Indian Council has estimated that unemployment among urban Indians is as high as 60 to 80 percent. Tuberculosis, cirrhosis and teen-age suicide are more common among Indians than the general population, according to the Federal Indian Health Service.
Another more subtle but equally intractable problem was in evidence at the powwow: white children streaking their faces with paint and dancing around patting their lips.
''There are many stereotypes to combat,'' Mr. Mofsie said. ''When you tell people you're an Indian, they say, 'You don't look like one. You don't live on a reservation. What are you doing in the big city?' But half of all Indians live in metropolitan areas because there are no jobs on reservations. And the 'woo-woo,' patting the lips: That probably came from Hollywood, but it's very insulting.''

HEADLINE: Bruno Kreisky, Austria's Leader For a Record 13 Years, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Bruno Kreisky, who dominated Austria's public life as the nation's longest-serving Chancellor from 1970 to 1983, died yesterday at Lainz Hospital in Vienna. He was 79 years old.
Mr. Kreisky, who consolidated the neutral nation's prosperity and gave it a vigorous voice in international affairs, died of heart disease, hospital officials said.
The former Chancellor, an urbane and pragmatic Socialist, was first elected to Parliament in 1956 and was Foreign Minister from 1959 to 1966. He was chairman of Austria's Social Democratic Party from 1967 to 1983 and its honorary chairman until 1987. 
He at times evoked criticism abroad, particularly from Israel for meeting with Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. He defended the contacts as efforts to achieve an Israeli-Arab peace and called it hypocritical to trade with Libya while snubbing its leader.
Mr. Kreisky, who won a majority in Parliament for the Socialists three consecutive times and who speedily fulfilled a pledge to resign if he lost that majority, was widely respected in Europe and overseas as a leading postwar Social Democrat.
 
A Tribute From Brandt
In a statement yesterday, Willy Brandt, a longtime friend and former Socialist Chancellor of West Germany, said that with Mr. Kreisky's death, ''Austria loses one of its most distinguished postwar politicans, European democracy one of its most convincing leading figures.''
Franz Vranitzky, Austria's present Socialist Chancellor, said: ''We have lost one of the greatest Austrian politicians of this century. With his international reputation, he gave Austria a position in the world that far outstripped the size of our country.''
Mr. Kreisky, who was widely popular among Austrians, stressed European detente and ''active neutrality'' for Austria while he negotitated an association agreement with the European Economic Community and made Vienna a leading center of international forums, including summit talks. He also accelerated Austria's policy of aiding Soviet Jews in migrating to Israel and elsewhere.
More than 200,000 Jews from the Soviet Union passed through the Austrian capital in the 1970's and 1980's, according to Paul Hofmann, a former correspondent for The New York Times. In his book ''The Viennese: Splendor, Twilight and Exile,'' published in 1988 by Anchor Press/Doubleday, he offered the following conclusion: ''For many years the state of American-Soviet relations at any given time could be gauged from the volume of Jewish emigration flowing through Vienna.''
 
A Jewish Agnostic
Bruno Kreisky was born in Vienna on Jan. 22, 1911, to Irene Felix and Max Kreisky, a textile industrialist. The family was of Jewish descent, but the son later described himself as a religious agnostic.
The young man attended schools in Vienna and, at the age of 15, joined the Socialist youth movement. The Social Democratic Party was outlawed in 1934, and in 1935 he was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. On his release, he entered the University of Vienna and earned a doctor-of-laws degree.
After the Nazi takeover, he was again arrested, in 1938, for political activities. He escaped to Sweden, where he spent the war years, working in a consumer sales cooperative and occasionally serving as a correspondent for Swedish newspapers and also as adviser on Austrian affairs for the Swedish Government. It was in Sweden that he met and married his wife, Vera Alice Fuerth.
At war's end, Mr. Kreisky returned to Austria, joined the Foreign Service and was assigned to the legation in Stockholm for four years. In 1953, he became State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and in the next two years was involved in negotiations that led to the restoration of Austrian independence under terms of maintaining a neutrality similar to that of Switzerland.
 
Neutrality 'No Easy Escape'
In 1959, he became the first Socialist to serve as Foreign Minister in a coalition government. He was deeply committed to making Austria's neutrality more than a simple avoidance of commitment.
In 1960, he wrote: ''A policy of neutrality is by no means an easy escape from international responsibilities. The governments of neutral nations are called upon to cooperate, within the limitations imposed upon them by their status and size, in solving the great questions of our day.''
Mr. Kreisky was a folksy, well-read, low-key man who kept his telephone number listed in the Vienna directory for many years after becoming the head of government.
His durability led to the nickname ''Emperor Bruno.'' In insisting in 1980 that he would resign as Chancellor if it meant haggling within a coalition, he offered this explanation:
''To work in a coalition government is a terrible waste of time. A coalition government is mostly a government of confrontation. This is not my business.''
 
A Period of Prosperity
In 1973, responding to Israeli criticism of his evenhanded attitude toward Israel and Palestinian Arabs, he said he could see no other possible policy for Austria but ''equidistance between the Arab states and Israel.''
During much of Mr. Kreisky's tenure, Austria prospered, with a moderate yearly inflation rate of about 5 percent, and close to full employment. Labor-management conflicts were quietly settled by negotiation and compromise.
In foreign affairs, he once said, ''The Austrians' task is to win maximum trust in the West, and at the same time only evoke a minimum of mistrust in the East.''
Mr. Kreisky's wife died last year. Survivors include a son, Peter, and a daughter, Susanne.

HEADLINE: Review/Concert;
Where Chamber Music Is Learned and Performed

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARLBORO, Vt., July 29

 BODY:
For 40 summers, music's young professionals and advanced amateurs have been coming to the tiny campus of Marlboro College to get away from concert halls, managers, press agents and the people who write reviews like this one.
Guided by mutually agreed on schedules of hair-raising complexity, this year's assembly of 68 musicians splits into ever-changing smaller groups of two, three, four and more, and then disperses to the old white framed buildings of what was once a farm. Here chamber music is learned and played.
Seventy-six pieces in various states of preparation and ranging alphabetically from Bach to Zemlinsky have emanated from the barns, cottages and farmhouses standing on this gentle Vermont hilltop this week. Three were performed before an audience on Saturday night, and three more were performed this afternoon. 
The concert on Saturday offered Mozart's Divertimento for six winds in F (K. 213) led crisply by a young oboist, Rudolph Vrbsky. But it was Janacek's song cycle ''The Diary of One Who Vanished'' that provided the evening's most startling beauty and originality.
In this story of a plowman beguiled and undone by a gypsy lover, Gregory Hopkins sang with a decisive tenor, using the original Czechoslovak text and negotiating vocal lines of punishing difficulty with great confidence.
Mary Westbrook-Geha was the strong mezzo-soprano. Supporting them and an offstage vocal trio was Luis Batlle, a splendid Uruguayan pianist who first came to Marlboro in 1956.
The programs were chosen on Thursday with one late-hour change on Friday. Pieces needing more work may never leave the practice room all summer. Invitees to Marlboro are enjoined by letter from any expectation of public performance so that words like ''rehearsal'' - which imply a concert deadline - are shunned.
Terminology is important to Marlborians. Roughly one-fourth of this year's musicians are called seniors (those older than 50) or invited artists(those older than 35). Calling them teachers and their younger colleagues students is to invite the horrified looks of administrators here.
The elders, they say, are carefully placed with young artists in what is called a society of equals. The venerable violinist Felix Galimir moves from string quartet to string quartet playing second violin and distributing his wisdom and experience through word and osmosis.
Isidore Cohen of the Beaux Arts Trio shared a Beethoven trio on Saturday (the E flat, Op. 1) with Dena Levine, a pianist, and Jean-Guihen Queyras, a cellist. This was classic Marlboro: Mr. Cohen's dignified playing in the slow movement held a staying hand against two excellent young players bursting at the seams with expressive energy, yet it was the older player who turned up the heat in the finale.
In much the same vein, David Soyer, the cellist of the Guarneri Quartet, and Kerry McDermott, a violinist at the New York Philharmonic, joined much less experienced musicians in the Schubert C-major quintet this afternoon.
The seniors welcome interpretive ideas, but they are by definition on the high end of this society of equals. It is difficult, for example, to imagine the gauntly elegant octogenarian Rudolf Serkin taking more interpretive advice from his junior colleagues in the Beethoven Op. 70 Piano Trio than he is currently giving.
Indeed, Marlboro's terminology is fragile to the point of euphemism. It is easier, however, to forgive the niceties when one understands that it is the tone of words like ''teacher,'' ''student'' and ''instruction'' that its directors are trying to avoid.
Accustomed to authoritarian training as virtuosos, for example, young East Europeans here are reveling in the chance to be musicians. ''They are getting a sense of family and a sense of freedom not that common in the East Bloc,'' said Frank Salomon, who with Anthony Checchia has managed Marlboro for more than 30 years. ''They love the unlimited rehearsals and the unlimited food.''
Marlboro has been recruiting throughout Europe for two years. This year's group includes an Albanian violinist living in Paris, a Soviet pianist living in New York, two East Germans and two Czechoslovaks. One German, Jan Vogler, is principal cellist at the Dresden Staatskapelle Orchestra.
Participants live dormitory style on campus and dine together, taking their turns waiting tables and cleaning up. The waiters on Friday night included Mr. Cohen, the flutist Carol Wincenc and Donald Weilerstein, a violinist with the Cleveland Quartet.
Marlboro seniors get expense money and a small honorarium but otherwise donate their time. The younger musicians pay as they are able: either now, in the future, or not at all. The festival's relatively modest $10 million endowment helps absorb all this, but as its administrators say, the free services of professional musicians is of enormous economic benefit.
The concert on Friday, which was not precisely a Marlboro event, offered Blanche Moyse conducting her own chorale and small orchestra in blunt, rough-cut performances of four Bach cantatas. Marlboro fellows infiltrated the orchestra and took major wind parts. All five singers at this summer's festival served as soloists.
Miss Moyse is a member of one of the three distinguished musical families that formed Marlboro in 1951. Her father was the French flutist Marcel Moyse, who with Adolf and Herman Busch and Mr. Serkin decided that music needed a place outside the pressures of a concert career.
The Guarneri Quartet was formed here in 1964, and two of its members, Mr. Soyer and Arnold Steinhardt, return regularly. Practically every major chamber ensemble quartet in this country - from the Emerson Quartet to Tashi - have members with Marlboro training. A lone exception is the Tokyo Quartet, whose violist, Kazuhide Isomura, remarked not long ago, ''It's like operating without a license.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Marlboro Music Festival in Marlboro, Vt., misstated the professional affiliation of a musician at the festival. The musician, Donald Weilerstein, was a founding member of the Cleveland Quartet but left the ensemble last year.

Slow Book Sales? Off to the Shops!

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Isabel Geffner spent two days at the Shakespeare & Company bookstore on the Upper West Side of Manhattan last week, unpacking boxes of books, stocking shelves, setting up displays and fielding questions from customers about what to read on vacation and where to find a book entitled ''Sex After Sixty'' - a ''gift book,'' the customer stressed.
While these were routine tasks, Ms. Geffner was not a routine employee. She is, in fact, the associate publisher of the Dell Publishing Company and is usually pre-occupied with manuscripts, authors, agents, deadlines and policy issues worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to her company.
Her stint at Shakespeare & Company is part of a new - and publishing executives say bold - experiment by Bantam Doubleday Dell. Under the program, 60 top executives are being sent this summer to work for two to three days in bookstores across the country to learn more about how books are actually sold after they have rolled off the presses. 
The experiment - which involves independent and chain bookstores -is a response to the current slump in book sales. While it will cost Bantam Doubleday Dell only $100,000, publishing executives say the program borders on the revolutionary in an industry that has been slow to accept change and adopt new practices in the increasing competition for the public's leisure dollars.
''What's exciting is that the program includes people who will benefit the most from a foray into the real world,'' said Joel Turner, the owner of Under Cover Books in Shaker Heights, Ohio.
The unusual experiment was devised by Jack Hoeft, the president and chief operating officer of Bantam Doubleday Dell.
''I have a feeling that not enough people in publishing get out of their offices and into bookstores, unless it's their neighborhood bookstore,'' he said. ''Our hope is that by doing this, we'll come back with a better understanding of how and why people buy books, and how we can help bookstores sell more of our titles.''
Even Mr. Hoeft will be gettting hands-on experience today and tomorrow, working at Ives Bookstore in Fort Myers, Fla.
As unsold books - ''returns,'' as they are known in publishing - have begun to flood back at rates as high as 60 percent on some titles, and as profit margins become razor thin or nonexistent, book publishers have intensified the search for greater efficiency and economies.
They are also seeking to strengthen their ties to bookstores, where retail sales this year are expected to reach $7.2 billion. While this is up from $5.1 billion in 1987, the American Booksellers Association reports, sales have slumped markedly in the second quarter for some publishing houses.
To cut costs, many publishers have installed computerized ordering systems, increased their discounts to booksellers and absorbed the cost of shipping books to the stores.
 
'Lots of Preconceptions'
But until Mr. Hoeft ordered his troops out from behind their desks and into the bookselling trenches, no publisher thought it was necessary for so many executives to experience the retail side of the business.
''We have lots of preconceptions but not a lot of knowledge,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a vice president of Bantam Doubleday Dell. ''Various executives make ambassadorial visits to a few major accounts for a few hours, but it's rare that we roll up our sleeves and do the nitty-gritty work that makes a bookstore.''
If the experiment works, the company will expand it to include another 100 of Bantam Doubleday Dell's 1,500 employees. Mr. Hoeft said he would consider the investment worthwhile if it caused his executives to think about such things as why stores order certain books and not others, how they display them, whether display makes a difference and what the company's competitors do differently and better.
Mr. Turner of Under Cover Books said the few days that the executives spent in the stores were likely to be less important than the lines of communication they established. ''When a problem comes up somewhere down the road,'' he said, ''a publisher will say, 'I'll phone the store where I worked and get their view.' ''
Bantam Doubleday Dell, which is owned by Bertelsmann A.G., the West German media giant, publishes a total of 1,400 new titles a year and sells them through more than 100,000 retail outlets in North America. Its three publishing houses sell the books to stores at an average discount of 44 percent off the suggested cover price.
Working through the American Booksellers Association, Bantam Doubleday Dell had little trouble enlisting the cooperation of 60 stores in 26 states and the District of Columbia, from E. Shaver Fine Books in Savannah, Ga., to Chaucer & Company in Santa Barbara, Calif. Eleven chain stores are included, three each from Crown Books and the Waldenbooks chain, two B. Dalton stores, and one each from Barnes & Noble, Doubleday and Brentano's.
 
Getting Their Hands Dirty
Mr. Hoeft told participating bookstores to treat the executives like any new employee; that is, they can get their hands dirty. The executives are prohibited only from ringing up transactions (to avoid any potential misunderstandings from handling money) and from pushing particular titles (to resist the temptation to play favorites with the company's books), and they are asked to write two-page reports on their experiences.
The experience of Ms. Geffner at Shakespeare & Company, a large store in an affluent neighborhood, convinced her of its value.
She said she learned much about book buyers and sellers. She developed a new appreciation for the importance of covers in selling books. And she learned that bookstores prefer four-color posters for their windows, rather than blowups of prominent book reviews.
Felice Rose, the store's general manager, also learned a few things. ''We get frustrated seeing all the money pumped into best sellers, but I learned that the publishers do, too,'' she said. ''Yet they have to publish best sellers in order to publish quality books that don't sell as well.''
 
'Lot of Unglamorous Work'
Marly Rusoff, an associate publisher of Doubleday, is eagerly awaiting her two days at Baxter's Books in Minneapolis. Ms. Rusoff once owned Rusoff & Company Book Dealers in Minneapolis.
''But bookselling has changed so much in the 12 years or so since I was in it,'' Ms. Rusoff said. ''We didn't have computerized inventories then, and children's books are a lot more important than they ever were. But I'm sure there's still a lot of unglamorous work involved, and knowing the small margins bookstores operate under, they can always use free help with the unpacking.''

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Rose 27.2% Last Month

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Reflecting a surge in exports, orders for American-made machine tools rose 27.2 percent in June from the level of May, the industry's trade association says in its monthly report. But economists cautioned that the rise did not reflect significantly higher spending on capital improvements in the United States.
According to the report, which is being released today by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, machine tool orders rose to $262.7 million in June from the May level of $206.4 million. The June orders were 9.1 percent higher than those in June of last year. 
For the first half of 1990, machine tool orders were down 4.8 percent from the period a year earlier.
 
Indicators of Capital Spending
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products ranging from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials. The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production, and economists consider patterns of machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
The level of new orders has fluctuated widely in the last few months. Some analysts said after increases in March and April that the gains reflected slight rises in capital spending by domestic manufacturers, particularly in the aircraft industry.
But economists cautioned that one large order by a single company or from any large foreign customer could affect the overall picture on orders. They said the June figures continued to show that American manufacturers were reluctant to raise their spending on capital investments from what had been sluggish levels.
 
Weakness in Profits Cited
''The level of new orders for machine tools indicates that the sense of sluggishness is being ratified,'' said Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation. Mr. Soss added that the recent weakness in corporate profits was likely to translate into a continuation of lower capital spending and weakness in tool orders.
In recent months, as car sales have slumped, auto makers have sharply curtailed their orders for machine tools. That has particularly affected tool producers, because the auto industry typically accounts for about a third of domestic tool sales.
New orders from foreign customers rose 75.5 percent in June, compared with the figures of May. Domestic orders were up 20.5 percent in June.
For the first six months of the year, foreign orders increased by 35.5 percent, compared with the period a year earlier, and domestic orders dropped by 10.5 percent.
Shipments of machine tools climbed 28.3 percent in June, to $350.2 million. Domestic shipments rose 27.8 percent and foreign shipments were up by 32.5 percent. For the first six months, shipments of machine tools increased 10.6 percent, compared with the period last year. Shipments to foreign customers increased 16.9 percent while domestic shipments rose 9.7 percent for the first half of 1990.
''We are very pleased to note that both foreign and domestic orders were strong in June,'' said Albert W. Moore, president of the association. ''The second-quarter 1990 total orders were the highest since the first quarter of 1989.''
''Analysts had forecast an improved order picture in the second half of 1990,'' he added. ''We hope that we are seeing the beginning of this predicted upturn.''
 
Worries on Interest Rates
But Mr. Moore added that interest rates continued to cause concern for machine tool makers. ''Our industry is particularly sensitive to interest rates as capital equipment spending requires large outlays,'' he said. ''Many of our members and their customers have suffered from increasingly stringent credit conditions.''
He added that recent indications by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, that interest rates might be eased offered hope that the American economic expansion would continue, ''and that potential customers for manufacturing equipment will not be discouraged by a lack of credit.''
The level of metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, increased 35 percent in June from May's level. That segment of the industry typically accounts for three-fourths of new orders. Orders for metal-forming tools were up 11.7 percent in June from May's level.
The machine tool order backlog stood at $1.56 billion in June, down from the May level of $1.65 billion.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
So Far, No Shock For Consumers

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AMERICAN consumers rarely cause a recession. Even when their incomes are barely rising, which is the case today, they somehow manage to spend enough to keep the economy afloat. Only a national shock seems to frighten them into cutting back so drastically that a recession becomes unavoidable. And so far in 1990, that shock has not come.
As Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics, puts it, ''People try to maintain their living standards even in hard times, and they don't ration their spending until they feel forced to do so.'' 
What often forces them are widespread layoffs and rising unemployment. That alarms not only the newly unemployed, but also the millions of people still holding jobs. They postpone purchases and give up amenities and an incipient recession becomes a full-fledged one. This has been the pattern in six of the eight recessions since World War II. Only twice has the consumer initiated a recession without warm-up blows from layoffs, unemployment or other events that were already moving the nation toward recession.
The first consumer-led recession was in 1974, in response to suddenly rising oil prices that threatened to disrupt household budgets. Six years later, when President Carter restricted consumer credit to fight inflation, many Americans responded by putting away their credit cards for a while. Consumers account for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, and when they ration this vast buying power, the economy inevitably contracts.
''There has to be a shock to make consumers slow down enough to participate in a recession,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. Absent the shock, economists have great difficulty anticipating how consumers will behave during a prolonged period of sluggish economic growth, such as the present one.
The usual economic data fail to offer reliable guidelines. Commerce Department figures released on Friday, for example, showed that personal disposable income - what Americans have left to spend from all sources after paying their taxes - had risen at an average annual rate of only 1.5 percent over the past year, adjusted for inflation. But personal consumption almost kept pace, rising by 1.1 percent since June 1989.
From the viewpoint of the economy's health, the most important consumer spending involves durable goods, like cars, appliances and furniture. When this is cut sharply, the manufacturing sector responds by shutting down factories and laying off workers. But while spending on nondurables, like clothing, gasoline and restaurant meals, keeps weakening, spending on durables seems to be holding its own. True, the Commerce Department data released Friday showed a big cutback in durable-goods spending in the second quarter. On average, however, these purchases in the first six months of 1990 have remained above 1989 levels.
Clearly, the consumer is hard to anticipate: income might be weak, but spending holds up anyway. What is more, Americans have in reserve enough extra borrowing power to increase their spending, if the spirit moves them. Installment payments eat up a relatively low 11 percent of the average American's disposable income, largely because monthly payments have been stretched over longer periods. And delinquency rates on various forms of consumer credit have declined this year, surveys show.
''We consider this a sign that consumers are being cautious and are bringing their payments up to date,'' said Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. The declining delinquency rates are also a sign that consumers can increase their borrowing and spending, if their caution should dissolve.
The key, then, to what happens next is the consumer's sense of well-being, a state of mind not tied very tightly to income. The Government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which tries to forecast the next swing in the national economy, recognizes this. Among the index's components, the one dealing with consumers reflects surveys of ''consumer sentiment,'' not income or spending. These surveys show a decline in consumer confidence this year, but not to recessionary levels, except in New England and the mid-Atlantic states.
In sum, consumers are not in shock in most of the nation, says Fabian Linden, who surveys consumer sentiment for the Conference Board, a business organization. ''But more people are saying that jobs will soon become harder to find,'' he said. ''There is less impulse-buying because there is less security about jobs.''
Another factor is also at work: even without a shock to their confidence, consumers are not likely to become big car buyers in the early 1990's, and motor vehicles account for more than 15 percent of all consumer spending. The problem is that car ownership has reached the level of almost one car for every driver in America, says Wynn Van Bussman, a Chrysler Corporation economist.
''To convince people to spend more on cars, you have to convince them to buy more options such as stereos and safety devices, and they are doing this,'' Mr. Van Bussman said. But when it comes to stimulating the economy, buying more options does not provide the punch that comes from adding to the number of cars on the road. ''It is a force that is holding down consumer spending,'' Mr. Van Bussman said. But not to recessionary levels.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Lower Interest Rates Called Likely

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A strikingly weaker view of the economy than the one that existed just a few short days ago has altered psychology in the credit markets, increasing the chances that interest rates will move lower in the weeks ahead, analysts say.
The touchstone for the shift in sentiment was provided by the Commerce Department, which released three years of revised economic statistics on Friday that showed growth was much weaker than had previously been thought.
In its revisions, the department pared the relatively healthy 2.6 percent growth rate recorded last year to a decidedly more anemic 1.8 percent, lowered its figure for growth in the first three months of 1990 to 1.7 percent, from 1.9 percent, and estimated on a preliminary basis that the expansion slowed to a 1.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
 
Change in Perception
''When you revise growth in 1989 from a 2.6 percent rate to 1.8 percent, it changes the perception about where you had been,'' said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. 
''Moreover, it seems we have slowed down further in the first six months of this year, and I have difficulty seeing where we are going to get strength in the second half,'' he added.
To market participants, the weaker gross national product numbers also provided a useful explanation for the Federal Reserve Board's unexpected decision to ease monetary policy earlier this month.
 
Resolve Was Questioned
Ever since the Fed moved to lower the rate on overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market to 8 percent, from 8.25 percent, bond traders have been uneasily questioning if the central bank had lost its resolve as an inflation fighter.
''I think the Fed probably had a pretty good idea about these numbers when they eased policy,'' said Robert M. Giordano, a partner and director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''And the chances of getting another easing move before we get a budget deal has probably improved.''
Even as the weaker economic statistics seem to have vindicated the Fed, they have made negotiating a meaningful cut in the Federal budget deficit much more difficult, Mr. Giordano and other analysts said.
''You can't get away from the fact that any significant cut in the deficit at a time when the economy is soft may not be able to take place,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
 
Smaller Reduction Favored
Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, said the weaker economic statistics ''argue for a budget reduction package that is smaller, not larger,'' than the $50 billion reduction that had been expected for the last few months.
The magnitude of the Government's borrowing needs will likely be noticed again on Wednesday, when the Treasury is expected to announce the size of its quarterly refunding auctions. Most analysts are expecting that the Treasury will announce that it intends to sell a record $31.5 billion worth of new 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
The exact time of the auctions is still a matter of conjecture, since Congress has not yet approved an increase in the Treasury's debt ceiling.
 
Delay of at Least a Week
Market participants who have spoken with Treasury officials said late last week that an increase in the debt ceiling does not appear likely until Aug. 10. Such a delay would postpone the expected auction dates by a week at least.
The flood of new Treasury issues is likely to prevent long-term interest rates from declining as much as short-term rates, analysts said. But the prospect of further easing moves by the Federal Reserve and continued weak economic growth should help drum up demand for the new securities.
''As recently as last Thursday, the market psychology was that the supply would be a problem,'' Shearson Lehman's Mr. Slifer said. ''Now, with these new economic numbers in hand, the perception is very different.''
 
New Reports This Week
In addition to the refunding announcement, market participants will be presented this week with a number of important new reports on how the economy fared during July. The most important is expected on Friday, when the Labor Department will release employment data. Most analysts expect that, excluding dismissed census workers, July's nonfarm payroll employment rose by 125,000.
Analysts at Salomon Brothers are projecting that most of the job growth was concentrated in private, service-producing industries. Continued sluggishness in the construction and manufacturing sectors suggests that goods-producing employment fell by approximately 35,000 jobs in July, the analysts said. That would bring the cumulative decline in those sectors to 156,000 jobs.
''An increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 125,000 would be consistent with economic growth of between 1 percent and 1.5 percent,'' Mr. Fine of Chase said. ''That is a little weaker than the Fed had been expecting.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Overseeing East German Transition

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN

 BODY:
A year ago, Walter Romberg was a mathematics professor with an interest in economics. Today, he is East Germany's Finance Minister, faced with melding his nation's moribund economy with West Germany's economic juggernaut.
His spacious office here in the House of Ministries reflects the hectic pace and the sheer volume of work. A long table and his desk are piled with neat stacks of files and papers. 
The rush is not to the liking of Mr. Romberg, who is more accustomed to the deliberate pace of academe. ''I think it would have been better for all sides if the process had gone much slower,'' he said in an interview. ''What we did in three months we should have done in three years.''
 
A Difficult Process
Rebuilding East Germany's aged and obsolete industries and infrastructure will be a painful process, he said, but it will create many opportunities.
''I think there is a great need for service companies, for skilled trades, for construction companies,'' Mr. Romberg said. ''There are many, many possibilites. There are already many new companies, some small, some larger. The question will be how many of these companies are capable of surviving. The sharp competition is just beginning.''
He said East Germany needs to develop a stronger regional economic structure. To that end, Mr. Romberg is promoting a plan for an Oder-Neisse economic development region along the border with Poland, using foreign capital.
''The Polish are interested, and we also know there is interest from the French to work with us on this,'' he said. ''Maybe we can get the United States interested.''
The all-German elections in the fall will seal unification and probably put Mr. Romberg out of a job, but he is somewhat optimistic. ''The economy in the past months has become ever more unstable,'' he said. ''But, on the whole, I think we have already accomplished it.
''The change from the old economic, financial and political order to the new structure is very complicated. For many people, the trouble will be to adjust to the new structure. Some of them will only discover the trouble when the new structure is there. In that sense, it is a political-psychological problem. Economic stability is very important. It can provide stability for the transition.''
 
Survival Factors
Survival in the new era depends on several factors, Mr. Romberg said. Productivity, economic efficiency and marketability being the most critical. ''You can have good machines and make good products,'' he said, ''but if you can't sell them, it's no good.''
And what of Walter Romberg, mathematician? Is there political life after unification? Does he wake up in the morning with a sense of shaping history?
Mr. Romberg laughed. ''Sometimes more, sometimes very little,'' he said. ''At the moment the burdens on me are very great. There is much stress. But some things are fun. As for the future, I'll see. It depends on whether I can be useful.''

HEADLINE: Growth in Jobs Shifts to Losses in New York Region

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
After slowing to a crawl for more than two years, the regional economy has shifted into reverse, shedding 8,000 jobs in private industry in New York City and 7,000 such jobs in northeastern New Jersey in the five months ended in May.
In a gloomy briefing yesterday, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that the downturn that followed the stock market plunge of October 1987 had deepened in intensity and spread through more of the economy and that it now blanketed the New York metropolitan region.
 
'Growth Engine' Loses Steam
In addition to the job losses in the city and New Jersey, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, job figures for Long Island and the northern New York suburbs were essentially stagnant.
''The overwhelming reality is that all parts of the region are in the same boat,'' he said. ''The growth engine has run out of steam.'' 
In suffering its first drop in private employment since 1982, the region lost 5,500 jobs in finance, insurance and real estate, businesses that propelled the boom of the 1980's; 15,000 jobs in manufacturing, which has now lost 326,000 jobs since the end of 1979; 9,200 jobs in construction, and 6,500 jobs in wholesale and retail trade.
Those losses were partially offset by more than 20,000 additional service jobs, but a growing share of the new jobs was in nonprofit health care and social services, as opposed to business and professional services like law and accounting, which attract wealth to the region.
 
Government Jobs Added
There were 25,000 government jobs added in the region, which gave the region a gain of about 12,000 jobs. But 19,000 of those new government jobs were part-time positions with the Census Bureau.
While government employment in the last few years has tended to compensate for private job losses in the region, the tight budgets anticipated by states, cities and towns are likely to limit any new hiring.
Mr. Ehrenhalt declined to describe New York and New Jersey as in a recession, saying the term was technically reserved for the national economy and usually associated with deeper drops in employment. He also said the region's unemployment rate of 5.2 percent compared favorably with the national average of 5.5 percent.
But he added that in some respects the local economic condition was ''of more concern.'' Recessions, he said, are ''very often associated with inventory buildups, and then when it's over, the economy comes back.''
''I think here in the region we're facing an exhaustion of whatever growth impulse there was, problems in many major sectors of the economy and issues that really at this moment have no end in sight,'' he said.
 
'A Fine Line'
Referring to a possible recession, Sylvia Ashrafiuon, an economist with the regional services division of the WEFA Group, a forecasting organization in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said: ''It's a fine line, and we haven't crossed it yet.''
''Basically, the New York area is slow,'' she said. ''There's no better way to describe it.''
But she said she expected the region's economy to improve next year as many worried consumers, who are now delaying spending, can no longer put off making purchases.
In the first full year after the stock market plunge, private employment in the region edged up eight-tenths of 1 percent, confounding some economists who expected a sharp drop. In contrast, it rose 3.4 percent in the nation.
In 1989, the national rate dropped to 2.4 percent and the regional rate declined to three-tenths of 1 percent. From December 1989 to May 1990, the national rate was 1.5 percent and the regional rate was minus five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
'More Significant Influence'
Besides the region's internal problems, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, the slowing national economy ''is now a more significant influence.''
In some cases, the region's strengths have turned to weaknesses. For example, New York City's financial-related industries have lost 35,000 jobs from December 1987 to May 1990 and would lose 15,000 this year at the current rate of decline.
Total payrolls in the securities fields, which rose sixfold from $2.1 billion in 1979 to $12 billion in 1988, fell to $10.8 billion in 1989, preliminary data showed. Average annual pay in these fields dropped from $78,625, to $75,243, though that was still more than double the citywide average.
Long Island, with a concentration of defense-related industries, gained 16,000 factory jobs from 1982 to 1986. But in the last three and a half years it lost 24,000 such jobs and remains vulnerable to further cuts in defense spending.
''Employment is flat or tilting down everywhere, whether we look at Long Island, which had the most rapid growth in the 1980's, or the northern suburbs, or New York City, which added more than a quarter of a million jobs prior to the slowdown, or northeastern New Jersey,'' Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
His briefing covered employment in 23 counties in New York and New Jersey from December 1989 to May 1990. But Connecticut is hardly better off, with a job-growth rate of one-tenth of 1 percent last year.
That gave it the seventh worst record in the nation, after the other New England states and Michigan.
 
A Bright Spot
One of the few bright spots in the region was inflation, which soared during the first quarter to an annual rate of 10.3 percent but fell to 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Wage and salary increases in the Northeast moderated from 6.4 percent in 1989 to 4.8 percent in 1990, which will make the region more competitive in a nation that is averaging increases of 4.5 percent.
More than half the counties in the region have unemployment rates below 5 percent, although some in New Jersey have rates so low that they are suffering labor shortages that impede growth. In all of New York City's boroughs except Manhattan and in Hudson, Passaic and Essex Counties in New Jersey, the rates are higher than the national average.
 
Growth Rates Compared
The decline in the region in the last few years was especially telling when its employment record was compared to those of the Los Angeles-Long Beach area and Chicago. From December 1979 to December 1987, New York had an annual growth rate of 1.8 percent, against 1.5 percent for Los Angeles and minus seven-tenths of 1 percent for Chicago. Since then, New York has had an annual growth rate of six-tenths of 1 percent, against 1.8 percent for Chicago and 2.4 percent for Los Angeles.
But Mr. Ehrenhalt, who in past briefings has cited New York's resilience, was not entirely bleak about its prospects. He said the region was rich in expertise in the scientific, technical, financial and communications fields that, he said, are ''at the forefront of world economic development.''

HEADLINE: The Textile Bill's Awful Bill

 BODY:
The Senate has overwhelmingly approved a textile bill that would impose a vicious cost on U.S. consumers, violate existing American trade agreements and undermine international trade talks. Three big strikes, yet the House is poised to approve similar legislation, perhaps this week.
The best hope for the nation is that the House vote will fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed to override President Bush's threatened veto of this ruinous legislation. 
The House and Senate bills would restrict the overall growth of imports of textiles and clothing to 1 percent yearly, compared with recent growth rates of about 6 percent annually. With foreign competition blunted, it's estimated that domestic producers would eventually charge consumers $50 billion more each year. That would amount to $200,000 for each job saved in American textile manufacturing.
Even that formidable figure disguises the full harm. The legislation would destroy as many jobs as it would save. Retailing jobs would be lost because higher prices would cause sales to fall. And jobs in export sectors would be lost once the third world reacted to its loss of sales in the U.S. All the legislation would accomplish is to take a lot more money from families trying to buy affordable clothing and put it in the hands of politically powerful textile owners. The bill is testimony to their power, and to the callous indifference of many legislators.
Textile trade is currently governed by an international agreement under which the U.S. has negotiated bilateral pacts with exporting countries. All of these agreements would be violated by the proposed legislation, and without provocation.
Also imperiled would be the Uruguay Round of international trade talks. The U.S. is now lobbying for developing countries to open their economies to more imports of goods, services and foreign investment. In exchange, they would receive greater access for their exports of food and manufactured goods, especially low-cost apparel.
By shutting off the U.S. market - and preventing the President from negotiating tariffs on textiles, apparel and footwear - Congress would leave the third world little to gain from further talks. The Uruguay Round would die, delivering a crippling blow to world trade and economic growth.
The House and Senate bills would devastate these third world exporters, scuttle international trade talks and seriously hurt American families with low incomes. That's an astounding amount of damage, all for the sake of bailing out one non-competitive group of producers.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Gorbachev Must Hurry

BYLINE: Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev pulled the plug that choked the Soviet system. Now other people are swarming to the surface with ideas that go far beyond his program for reform. They are no longer talking about reform, but about ''a fundamental new approach.''
Those are the words of Leningrad's Mayor, Anatoly Sobchak, to a group of Americans last week. ''Every undertaking must start with the individual, and end with the individual, with the human being,'' he said. ''For the last 70 years, everything here has started with a party decree and ended with a party decree.'' 
Mr. Sobchak is one of the new local leaders who are challenging the center. He quit the Communist Party after its last congress and criticizes Mr. Gorbachev for staying on as General Secretary. The idea that that was necessary to prevent a conservative takeover was wrong, in his view, because it means Mr. Gorbachev will continue to lean on party structures instead of speeding the end of the Communist monopoly by building his base at various levels of government.
The Leningrad leader is an ally of the Russian Republic's President, Boris Yeltsin, Moscow's new Mayor, Gavriil Popov, and others who are emerging in many parts of the country. These alliances themselves bring merit to some reassessment of Mr. Yeltsin, because these others do not share the bumptious, nationalistic, apparently anti-Semitic aspects of Mr. Yeltsin's record that have made him unappealing in the West. Maybe we have judged too hastily, and taken too earnestly the argument that Mr. Gorbachev's caution is the only alternative to chaos. People do talk about the possibility of chaos, even civil war. But the danger seems to come more from impatience for both autonomy and material improvement than from party hard-liners or the military.
The military is deeply split, by generation, nationalism and grass-roots disaffection. Moscow officials confirm a report that there have been 15,000 ''suicides'' in the ranks in the last five years.
Mr. Sobchak argues that holding the country together has to be in two stages, first accepting demands for separatism, which are burgeoning, and afterward seeking reintegration ''on a voluntary basis.'' Things wouldn't have reached this point, he says, if serious moves had been launched a year ago to restructure the Soviet Union. Now Mr. Gorbachev talks about it, but it hasn't started.
Instead, he has reasserted central control of the banking system, which doesn't work and brakes local initiative. It would be worse if all the republics issued their own currency, but what is happening to the ruble now is destruction of the currency.
Mr. Sobchak, like practically everybody, pleads for Western help to start reversing the economic collapse. But he has strong feelings about how it should be delivered. ''Don't give it to the Government,'' he said. ''Our civil servants are masters at wasting billions on grandiose plans 'to build Communism.' It should go company by company, project by project,'' which means a high degree of intrusion, but that doesn't bother him.
This is a difficult issue for Western decisions. The West cannot remake the Soviets to its own specifications, and it cannot be indifferent to the risk of a vast, violent upheaval in a country with such an awesome arsenal and such fierce passions.
But it is not evident that the risk would be greater by supporting new forces that are pressing Mr. Gorbachev to move faster in dismantling the Communist system. He still seems to be trying to make it work.
People like Mr. Sobchak, who is a likely prime minister if momentum does pick up at the center, are rethinking from the start. ''We have a psychological even more than an economic problem,'' he said. ''Our people were taught that only our enemies have private property, so we have a nation of paupers.''
As for his city, a magnificent jewel that still looks west, he acknowledges there is a movement to change its name back from Leningrad to St. Petersburg. ''But that wouldn't change people's lives at this point; it should only be done by referendum.''
Is he waiting for Lenin to be removed from his Red Square mausoleum and buried there? he was asked. ''In a year or two, the body will be where it belongs and the news will be on the third page,'' he answered.
Events are racing ahead of Mr. Gorbachev now. Though he provided the initial spark, he is no longer the spark plug. The West should encourage him to hurry, not support more equivocation with untied credits.

HEADLINE: Flower Sellers' Ruthless Competition

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
At an intersection near Times Square, passers-by on either side of Broadway can follow the scent of flowers in every direction. There are vendors with bouquet-laden shopping carts. There's a couple who make flower arrangements under an umbrella. There's a mobile fruit stand with a floral section. There are arguments.
''I've told him: 'I don't interfere with your business. I'm here and you're there,' '' a shopping-cart florist said the other day, reliving one of his turf skirmishes with the fruit-stand owner.
Flowers seem to be everywhere these days, and behind every carnation, gladiolus and pompon, a competitive war is raging. Take the roses. Once a symbol of the special occasion, roses can now be bought - usually at decidedly everyday prices - at grocery stores and most produce markets, from street vendors who push carts or carry boxes, at stores that sell other flowers and those that sell roses alone. 
 
Buying on Impulse
Across America, more cut flowers are being sold than ever before, industry people say. Partly, it's economics: more flowers imported from newcomers to the market, like Italy, or cheaper new crops from traditional producers like Colombia, now a major source of roses.
In New York, the flower business has been swept up in the new wave of immigration, tackled first by the Korean grocers, and, most recently, itinerant shopping-cart sellers from Mexico.
All of which may have actually helped shops at the top of the market, as more people buy on impulse and for themselves, and some of the newly hooked buyers move up to floral arrangements and fancier flowers.
''The economy is not doing well, and my business is still growing,'' said Ruben Consa, owner of Environmental Designs at Fifth Avenue and 53d Street, which specializes in contemporary arrangements that use metal sculptures and whose clients include hotels and fashion houses.
But if Mr. Consa's business niche resembles a serene garden, for the neighborhood florists and inexpensive vendors, it's a jungle out there.
 
Lethal Competition
In Flushing, Queens, about 20 flower shops recently banded together and went to the police. They want the eviction of vendors who pop up on popular flower days like Mother's Day and Easter. The shop owners charge that the vendors are unlicensed, pay no taxes and sell an inferior product. With almost no overhead, they say, the vendors are lethal competition.
''That kills us,'' said Frank D'Iorio, owner of Georgewood Florist at 158-15 Northern Boulevard. ''That would put small flower shops out of business because these shops make their money during holidays.''
At the corner of 90th Street and Lexington Avenue, Nicholas Adamis has posted a ''Business for Sale'' sign on the window of his small flower shop after 31 years. Like other small-business men in New York City, Mr. Adamis has had to contend with higher taxes and skyrocketing rents. He now pays $3,250 monthly for the same 350 square feet of commercial space he first rented for $175 a month, he said.
But Mr. Adamis's special bane has been cutthroat competition. Four roses-only shops - Roses Only, Rose Garden, Rose Farm and I H Roses -sprang up in the last year near Mr. Adamis's store, Dorothy's Flower Shop.
 
No Middleman
Many of these ''boutiques'' grow their own roses and cut out the middleman, which enables them to charge as little as $4 a dozen. The 63-year-old florist, whose cheapest roses go for $24 a dozen, said he hasn't charged $4 for a dozen roses since the 50's.
''It doesn't pay to be in the business,'' he said.
Old-time florists, many of them Greek immigrants, said that the new breed of competitors surfaced about 10 years ago when a newer immigrant group, the Korean greengrocers, added flowers to their fruit and vegetable displays. Today, most of the 1,300 produce markets in New York City sell flowers, with many expanding varieties as they gain more experience in flower care, said Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean American Small Business Service Center of New York.
Chang Yang, who since 1985 has offered several kinds of flowers at his Golden Food produce market on Third Avenue near 82d Street, said the profit margin for flowers is higher than that for produce, although they are more perishable and are a riskier investment. His sales have also dropped as competition has intensified, he said, but he said the markets' edge is still convenience.
''Even though customers don't stop by to buy flowers, they may want candy, but they see the flowers and they buy them,'' he said.
 
Arranging in the Basement
About two years ago, vendors selling from shopping carts appeared in noticeable numbers, other florists said. Most are immigrants from Mexico like 21-year-old Alfonso Santos.
For $200 a month, Mr. Santos and nine other vendors are allowed to use the basement of a Washington Heights apartment building to prepare their merchandise and load their carts.
On any given morning, the men stand amid roses, gladioluses, carnations and pompons they have picked out at the West 28th Street flower market much earlier, and silently trim, arrange and package as a radio plays mariachi music. Then they head for subway stations to fan out around the city.
Many of the vendors work for another vendor and take a 40 percent cut on sales ranging anywhere between $70 and $300 a day, they said. Mr. Santos, who works for himself and sometimes has vendors working for him, said he nets about $100 on a good day, but he has been arrested about 20 times in the last two years for selling without a permit. Each time the police throw away his cart and jail him for one to five days before releasing him, he said.
Mr. Santos said he would rather work in a restaurant, but he is undocumented and employers will not hire him.
''What other option is there? You have to make a living,'' he said.
In March of 1988, the first roses-only store, Rosa Rosa Inc., opened on Lexington Avenue between 63d and 64th Streets. A second Rosa Rosa opened on West 72d Street between Broadway and Columbus Avenue last April, and a third store operates in Southhampton, L.I. during summers only.
The stores are owned by a Dutchman who grows the roses in Guatemala and who didn't find any takers when he first tried to sell his crop to wholesalers in New York City, said Jorge Zambrano, who manages the stores. By taking care of their own growing, packing and distribution, Mr. Zambrano said, the stores are able to offer roses for $5 to $9 a dozen.
Lines of 15 or more waiting customers became a fixture at the first store soon after it opened, Mr. Zambrano said. The lines are gone now that about 20 other similar specialty shops have also opened, he said. But there are plans to expand to other areas of the country, said Mr. Zambrano, who argued that his stores' strength is quality.
Quality is an issue raised by established florists, who argue that they still offer the best grade, selection and advice.
But quality can be uneven at all retail levels, flower lovers and experts said. They said that only a careful consumer can get the best deals.
Just how many street flower vendors there are is hard to gauge. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs requires that they get a general vendor permit for which they would have to pay $200 annually and post a $2,500 bond. But a cap of 853 permits that can be issued has already been met and department officials acknowledged that unlicensed vendors outnumber those who are licensed.
The more the better, customers said. Enzo Caterini, 28, an Upper East Side resident, said he used to pay florists $2.50 to $3 for each stem of yellow roses, his favorite. Now he buys a dozen for $8 from a nearby rose boutique and sometimes drives to the Upper West Side for purchases ''because they are $1 cheaper. Maybe it's the rent,'' he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: In New York, the flower industry - and competition for sales - is growing as immigrant businesses challenge established florists.

HEADLINE: Yankees, Sanders Have a Parting

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
The brief, controversial and uncertain major league baseball career of Deion Sanders came to an abrupt halt yesterday when the Yankee organization ended contract negotiations that would have extended his commitment to baseball and could have led to a legal struggle.
Sanders, suddenly a former outfielder for the Yankees and soon to be a defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons who was becoming the focus of a developing legal dispute between the two organizations, announced that his Yankee season had ended and he was going on vacation.
Less than 90 minutes before last night's game between the Yankees and the Detroit Tigers, his season having suddenly ended with a batting average of .158 in 57 games and his third home run of the season in his final game Sunday afternoon, Sanders sat at a table in the Yankee clubhouse and wrote telephone numbers to leave for selected teammates.
Before his departure, however, he challenged a statement by the Yankee organization he had requested the contract extension and criticized teammates who had complained about an inexperienced teammate possibly earning a major contract. 
 
Steinbrenner Says No
The Yankee statement, issued yesterday afternoon, said that a request by Sanders for a $1 million contract for the 1991 season had been rejected by George Steinbrenner, the principal owner. The statement came several hours before Steinbrenner was permanently banned by the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, from any further involvement in the management or day-to-day operations of the team.
Steinbrenner was quoted in the statement: ''Under no circumstances could we offer Deion that kind of salary for the 1991 season. Even so, we still would like Deion to continue with the Yankees and wish him well in whatever he chooses to do.''
Sanders maintained that the Yankees had raised the economic possibilities in an effort to persuade him to remain with the team. ''They threw a lot of money at me,'' he said.
He said that the failure to reach an agreement with the Yankees was partly the result of the threat of legal pressure by the Falcon organization, which was intensified yesterday, and by the unrelated concerns of Steinbrenner. who had been awaiting a decision on his status from Vincent.
When asked what he would miss about his brief stay with the Yankees, Sanders said: ''The challenge of the game. The challenge of the game. And leaving on not a great note. Leaving on a bad note. People will say, 'He was no baseball player.' ''
Sanders said yesterday that he had decided earlier in the season that he would leave the Yankees and report for a full season with the Falcons in the hope of becoming a Pro Bowl caliber player.
''Then, once I thought about the situation,'' he said, ''I thought I really want to prove to a lot of people I can play this game and play it well.''
In a letter to George Bradley, the Yankee vice president, the Falcons' legal adviser, Marion H. Allen III, informed the team that the Falcons would seek a court order to recover the $2 million signing bonus Sanders had been paid, a total salary reduction of $600,000, $10,000 for missing the team's minicamp, $1,500 a day for absences from the current training camp and additional money for missed games and subpar performances due to missed practices.
On Sunday, after what eventually became his final game of the season, Sanders said that the threats of the Falcon organization were an unsuccessful tactic meant to scare him. ''I don't scare when I've got Mr. Steinbrenner in my corner,'' Sanders said then.
Yesterday, he acknowledged that the threats may have had a bearing on the Yankee decision to end negotiations.
''That might have scared them a little bit,'' he said.
Now that his plans had been changed, Sanders said he would the Falcons, but did not say when.

HEADLINE: Impersonator Wants To Portray Still Others, This Time, Onstage

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

 BODY:
It shouldn't surprise anyone that David Hampton wants to be a professional actor, considering the success he has had as an amateur. Posing as Sidney Poitier's son, he gained access to the homes of many prominent New Yorkers in 1983, and his deception inspired ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' John Guare's hit play, which opened in June at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.
Mr. Hampton has just returned to New York after an absence of seven years to see the play and, he said, to begin an acting career.
In an interview last week, Mr. Hampton, who is 26 years old, talked about his life since his 21-month prison term for attempted burglary ended with his parole from the state prison at Dannemora in New York State in October 1986. He addressed what is perhaps the most pressing question on the minds of everyone who has seen the play: Why did he masquerade as someone else? 
Simple, he said. He wanted to get into Studio 54.
Mr. Hampton was then 17 years old and unemployed. He said he came to New York from Buffalo to pursue a career ''in the arts'' but was ''not pounding the pavements hard enough to get an acting job.'' Dancing in club competitions was a way to make money.
 
'I Said, ''We'll Lie'' '
''A friend and I really wanted to get into Studio 54,'' he recalled. ''We waited on line and when we got to the front the bouncer looked at us and said, 'Fifty dollars apiece.' I didn't have the money, so we said thank you and walked away. Then my friend said: 'We have to get in there. There are celebrities in there we want to meet.' And out of the clear blue sky, I said: 'We'll lie. Think of who you can be.'
''My friend was Caucasian, and we thought about it, and I said, 'You can be Gregory Peck's son.' For me, it boiled down to a choice of being the son of three people: Sidney Poitier, Sammy Davis Jr. or Harry Belafonte. I look like Belafonte the most, but I had read in People magazine that he had a son, named David, who is a model. And I thought Sammy Davis Jr. was too glitzy, too gaudy. Poitier has so much more class. He was the only one to have won an Oscar, in 1963 for 'Lilies of the Field.' ''
''We got back on line and even though it was only an hour and a half later, the doorman didn't recognize us,'' he continued. ''We told him who we were, and we were swept into the center doors like we owned the place.'' He paused. ''It was a magical moment.''
''Three days later,'' he said, ''I was hungry, and I found myself with little money. So I tootled up to one of the bistros on Columbus Avenue and told the doorman I wanted a table for two, that I was to meet my father there, and the last name was Poitier. Once again, magic happened. They did cartwheels: drinks were sent over to my table. To make a long story short, my 'father' didn't show up that evening, and the meal was on the house.''
''I was ignorant of the criminal charges of doing that,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''I didn't know conning people was a crime. I thought I could do these things, and once I had success, I could look back on it 20 or 30 years from now and laugh.''
 
A Matter of an Address Book
Of course it didn't happen that way. Which is where the address book, filled with the names of those prominent New Yorkers Mr. Hampton deceived, came in. Though it has been reported that Mr. Hampton had stolen an address book from a Connecticut College student, Robert Stammers, Mr. Hampton said that was untrue. While staying with a friend at the college he met Mr. Stammers, he said, who left the address book with him so he could enter his address and telephone number.
''I didn't realize I still had it until I was back in New York, and found it in my knapsack,'' Mr. Hampton said.
Once he found it, ''with its glamorous East Side addresses, the ball got rolling,'' he continued.
''The story about being Sidney Poitier's son got bigger and better,'' he said. ''Whether you're Ivan Boesky or the guy playing three-card monte on the street, once you're accomplished at what you do, you can get lazy, overconfident and sloppy. You forget what you've said. But you're having so much success that you think it can never end. That along with greed, was my downfall. I kept procrastinating about finding a job, and I became a minor celebrity at the places I went.''
Among the people who admitted Mr. Hampton into their homes were John Jay Iselin, who was then the president of Channel 13, and his wife, Lea, a lawyer, and Osborn Elliott, who was then the dean of the Columbia School of Journalism, and his wife, Inger.
 
'You Get Paranoid'
''In a way, I was happy that the game was over,'' Mr. Hampton said of his arrest on Oct. 18, 1983, at the age of 19. ''It gets tiring after a while. You get paranoid.'' Mr. Hampton was arraigned on charges of petty larceny, criminal impersonation and fraudulent accosting. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of attempted burglary.
When his parents learned of his activities ''they were mortified,'' he said. ''They thought I was pursuing an acting and dancing career,'' he said. ''Both my parents were the first in their families to go to college. My father is a lawyer and my mother was a nurse who went back and got a degree in communications. They were always headstrong and conservative people. I wanted a career in the arts, but they wanted me to be a doctor, lawyer or stockbroker. But I felt those 9-to-5 types of things were too easy.''
After he served his prison sentence, he said, he moved back to Buffalo. He said he did menial work at the Langston Hughes Institute there for almost a year. He then went to London, where he said he lived for two and a half years working off the books as a waiter and bartender in various places and traveling through Europe. Tired of getting paid ''like an illegal alien,'' he said, he returned to the United States early last year, settling in West Hollywood, Calif., where he got a job delivering groceries. He said he then moved to Venice, Calif., where he painted houses and started writing ''an autobiographical type of work.''
It was while he was on vacation in Hawaii in June, he said, that a friend called and told him about the success of the Guare play.
 
And More Paranoia
''It was rather shocking,'' Mr. Hampton said. ''I had been planning to come back to New York, thinking that by now I would be anonymous and no one would know me. Because after an experience as traumatic as incarceration, I perceived that everyone knew about me, which does create a bit of paranoia.''
Of course, ''Six Degrees of Separation'' is a play, not a piece of journalism. Mr. Guare has said in interviews that a newspaper story about Mr. Hampton interested him enough to use it as the starting point for a fictive work. But the distinction between fact and fiction seems lost on Mr. Hampton, who said he had not yet seen the play. Based on what he has read, he said: ''I am slightly upset by the way my character is being portrayed. I have never been homeless, and I have never been a street hustler. I grew up in a correct middle-class environment.''
Mr. Hampton said his move to New York City was permanent. ''I really want to succeed in the arts,'' he said. ''I don't wish to become a victim of my notoriety. I would rather be known for positive achievements than as a slickster in an Off Broadway play.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Up 1% in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Personal spending rose 1 percent in June, the strongest gain in five months, the Government said today. The Commerce Department report suggested that consumers have been keeping the nation's weak economy out of a recession.
''This seems to indicate the consumer is not dead,'' said Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ''As long as the consumer hangs in there, I believe we will avoid a recession.'' 
The Commerce Department also said personal income rose four-tenths of a percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.64 trillion, after gaining three-tenths of a percent in both April and May.
The department said consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.64 trillion, the biggest jump since a similar 1 percent gain in January.
 
A Source of Concern
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, has been a source of concern in recent months. Spending rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in February and April and three-tenths of a percent in March. Spending was unchanged in May.
As measured in the gross national product, the nation's total output of goods and services, second-quarter personal consumption, which includes all spending except interest payments, actually fell three-tenths of a percent. But the second-quarter figures, released Friday, included June estimates that might be revised.
The higher spending level resulted in a drop in Americans' savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - to 4.9 percent. It had been 5.4 percent in May and 5.1 percent in April.
 
Commerce Department Revision
All of today's figures reflected major changes in last year's numbers as a result of the Commerce Department's annual revision announced last week. The biggest change involved the department's $57.9 billion overestimate of wages and salaries, which lowered the 1989 savings rate to 4.6 percent, from 5.4 percent.
Americans' income after taxes increased five-tenths of a percent, up from a three-tenths gain a month earlier. Wages and salaries rose $13 billion in June after a $10.1 billion increase in May.
Personal consumption rose $34.5 billion, including a $9.6 billion gain in spending on durable goods - items expected to last more than three years. This included a robust $6.1 billion rebound in automobile sales, which had been sluggish for much of the year.

HEADLINE: Stocks Up on Belief in an Interest Rate Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
A growing belief that the Federal Reserve may take steps to lower interest rates to revitalize the economy pushed stock prices higher yesterday.
But a parallel prospect - that weak consumer spending would become weaker - prompted market sentiment that now might be a good time to get out of stocks that are still close to their highs for the year.
By the end of the day, even though investors remained extremely skittish about the economy and the potential for further earnings surprises, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 18.82 points, to 2,917.33. 
In Tokyo, shares closed sharply higher today after falling for the previous seven sessions. The Nikkei stock average closed up 592.71 points, or 1.95 percent, to 31,035.66.
On the New York Stock Exchange, trading volume yesterday sank to a slow 146.5 million shares, from 149 million on Friday. Declines outstripped advances 792 to 717, and 88 stocks set new lows, among them A.T.& T., which fell to 36 before ending the day at 37, up 3/4.
''We're facing a dramatic change in growth in personal consumption spending,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, the Wall Street investment house.
He told clients that among retailing stocks he considered vulnerable were Home Depot, the do-it-yourself stores; Nordstrom, the apparel chain; Dillard Department Stores; Circuit City Stores, the electronics chain, and Blockbuster Video, the video rental chain.
The next casualty, he maintained, would be the casino group, including Circus Circus and Golden Nugget.
Circus Circus fell 3 1/8, to 59 7/8, while Golden Nugget fell 1 1/4, to 32. Home Depot fell 1, to 35 3/4. Three others fell only slightly and Circuit City rose 3/8, to 27.
Saying he thought it was time to take profits in some of the big blue-chip growth stocks that have not had disappointing earnings, Barton M. Biggs, director of worldwide strategy for Morgan, Stanley & Company, urged clients to sell 50 percent of their stakes in Boeing, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Wal-Mart Stores and Waste Management.
He said he urged them to switch into other growth stocks that have already had disappointments, including Sallie Mae, McDonald's, Reuters Holdings, Walt Disney, Compaq Computer and AMP, a producer of electronic connectors.
Explaining the market's rise, traders said a study of Friday's weak gain in the gross national product, the value of the nation's goods and services, suggested that the economy was deteriorating rapidly and that the Fed would almost certainly step in.
On the theory that stock prices would also rise, traders who had sold short Standard & Poor's 500-index futures were forced to buy them back to avoid big losses. Around 2 P.M. Central daylight time, when the futures market in Treasury bonds closed in Chicago, program traders began buying stock in New York, driving prices up. This in turn brought more short covering in the S.&P. 500-index futures, and the rally was on.
Birinyi Associates said two series of buying programs starting a few minutes before 3 P.M. and extending for most of next 20 minutes lifted the market 24 points. Six buying programs in all lifted the Dow a total of 41 points.
With crude oil prices expected to go up, oil stocks were up yesterday. Exxon rose 1 1/2, to 50 3/4; Texaco 1 3/8, to 62 7/8, and Chevron 1 3/4, to 79 - all helping the Dow make its strong showing. ARCO rose 2 3/4, to 127 3/4, and Mobil rose 5/8, to 65 1/8.

Bond Prices Continue Strong Rise

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Continued strong demand for Treasury securities sent prices soaring and interest rates tumbling yesterday.
Dealers said portfolio managers were among the more aggressive buyers, with many venturing out to the longer maturities for the first time in weeks. The activity also stimulated demand for corporate debt securities.
 
Long Bonds Down to 8.40%
After some late profit-taking, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds were being offered at 103 24/32, up 25/32. This caused the yield to drop to 8.40 percent, from 8.47 percent late Friday and 8.53 last Thursday. The yield yesterday was the lowest since July 5, when it was also 8.40 percent. 
A measure of the demand was that the buyers ignored three developments that would normally have depressed the prices of fixed-income securities. One was the weakness in the dollar, which makes domestic investments less attractive to foreign investors. Another was a report that the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal entity entrusted with bailing out the savings industry, would need to borrow at least $100 billion in fiscal 1991. The other was a 1 percent rise in consumer spending in June reported by the Commerce Department.
''What we witnessed today was increased carry-over buying that was sparked by the weak second-quarter G.N.P. figures released last Friday,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., the senior vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''But today's major buyers weren't traders or speculators. They were investment portfolios managers and, significantly, their orders ranged out to the long end of the Treasury market.''
The Government reported on Friday that the nation's gross national product grew at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent in the second quarter. This, together with downward revisions for the previous two quarters, led economists to warn the economy was sliding toward a recession.
''All this has intensified the pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates,'' Mr. Sullivan continued. ''It has also minimized the inflation threat that has long preoccupied the Fed.''
Because the value of fixed-income securities rises when inflation and competitive interest rates decline, any increase in the number of the unemployed would encourage more demand for long-term Treasury and other high-grade debt issues. The Government is scheduled to release its July employment data on Friday.
 
Long Notes at 8.34%
Among other representative issues traded in the secondary market, the long notes, the 8 7/8's of of the year 2000, climbed by 17/32, to 103 17/32, as its yield dropped to 8.34 percent, from 8.41 percent on Friday. With many of the buyers yesterday focusing at the long end, the 8 1/2's of 1997 rose by 13/ 32, to 101 5/32, to yield 8.28 percent; the 8's of 1992 gained 3/32, to 100 4/32, to yield 7.93 percent.
Tomorrow, the Treasury will announce the terms of its mid-quarter refunding. It is expected that a record $31 billion or more of 3-year and 10-year notes, as well as 30-year bonds, will be auctioned next week.
The Treasury held a record auction yesterday of $18.4 billion in three- and six-month bills, or $400 million more than at last week's sale. The average discount rate on the 90-day bills was 7.50 percent, up by a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the week before. The average discount rate on the six-month bills fell to 7.37 percent, from 7.40 percent. One-year bills slipped by 4 basis points, to 7.24 percent.
The Federal Reserve did not intervene in the credit markets yesterday, and the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, traded all day at 8 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Decline On Signs of Slower Growth

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly against major foreign currencies yesterday, continuing a decline prompted by the latest signs of a weakening United States economy and the prospect of lower interest rates.
''Global investors don't think the dollar is very attractive right now,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president with the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Traders said the dollar closed at its lowest level since January 1988 against the West German mark and at nearly a two-year low against the British pound. It fell more than a yen against the Japanese currency. 
Chris Mendell, a vice president with the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, said that as differences in global interest rates have narrowed, rates of return for investors in Europe and Japan have become higher or comparable to those in the United States.
 
Continuation From Friday
The market activity yesterday was largely a continuation of that on Friday, when the dollar tumbled in reaction to reports of slow growth of the gross national product in June.
The financial markets believe that with the United States economy continuing to slump, the Federal Reserve Board will push interest rates lower to help stimulate growth. But such a move would come at the expense of the dollar. Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in United States yields makes the dollar less competitive.
Against the West German currency, the dollar fell to 1.6040 West German marks, down from 1.6120. That is the lowest since it closed at 1.5880 on Jan. 5, 1988.
 
Sterling Gains
The British pound climbed against the dollar, following up on a more than 2 cent rise on Friday. Sterling rose to $1.8465 in New York from late Friday's $1.8375.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell more than a yen, to 147.83 in New York, from 149.10 late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar tumbled 2.15 yen to a closing 148.60 Japanese yen, and it was quoted in London at 148.15 yen.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.3602 Swiss francs, down from 1.3620; 5.3725 French francs, down from 5.3990; 1,174.25 Italian lire, down from 1,180.00, and 1.15245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15195.
 
Gold and Silver Mixed
In the precious metals market, the August gold contract fell 20 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $367.80 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $367.70, up 40 cents from Friday.
In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid of $367.25 an ounce, up from $367.15 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $367.50 an ounce, down from $367.15 late Friday.
Gold in Hong Kong fell 18 cents to close at $367.86 an ounce.
Silver prices for current delivery slipped 2.9 cents to $4.803 an ounce on the Comex. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $4.83 an ounce from $4.80 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Shortage of Skilled Workers Is Expected

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
IN 1967, Herman Kahn, the late founder of the Hudson Institute research organization, took a look ahead in a prescient book titled ''The Year 2000.'' He accurately predicted that United States corporations would have increased needs for skilled employees and training programs, that Japan would play a leading world economic role, and that commerce and industry in this country would extend in unbroken lines along highways between major cities, like the route from Boston to Washington.
Now the Hudson Institute has joined with Towers Perrin, a management consulting firm, in a report called Workforce 2000, based on a survey of 645 companies.
This study, which relies primarily on a questionnaire that is usually answered by lower-level corporate managers, could hardly be as in-depth or imaginative as Mr. Kahn's effort. But Jill Kinan-Lovers, a Towers Perrin vice president, said that the use of task forces for personnel planning is increasing among companies and that if these groups filled out the survey, ''we are getting more accurate results than we might have expected.'' 
The survey offers some instant surprises. It indicates that there is a labor shortage now, at a time when many people talk about additional reductions, like a recently announced plan to cut 17,000 jobs at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
In five years, the shortage will be worse, the survey predicts. For example, 21 percent of the respondents expect ''great difficulty'' hiring professional personnel, and 43 percent expect ''some difficulty.'' The dearth of secretarial-clerical personnel is expected to worsen, with 24 percent of the companies expecting ''great difficulty'' and 43 percent expecting ''some difficulty'' finding the help they need.
Furthermore, 52 percent of the financial institutions included in the survey indicated that they had ''some current difficulty'' finding supervisory and management personnel -another surprise in the face of huge dismissals by Wall Street investment firms and by many big banks in New York, Boston and elsewhere.
''I expected an overall shortage in the near future, but I was surprised that so many companies indicated a shortage right now,'' Mrs. Kinan-Lovers said, adding that the study might be more aptly called ''Workforce 1990.''
Another surprise was that many companies, while acknowledging difficulty finding skilled employees, said they were not prepared to give on-the-job training, especially remedial training to improve writing and verbal skills. Only 8 percent provide such training. But 78 percent said they had tuition reimbursement programs.
''Companies will have to do more training, especially remedial training,'' Mrs. Kinan-Lovers said. ''They will do it mostly in house and they will work more closely with local educators.''
The survey also showed, she said, that companies are expected to divide more jobs into parts, so that, for example, the more challenging parts of a job can be handled by those better trained and qualified.
Many ''leading edge'' companies, she said, want good publicity about their personnel policies - companies like International Business Machines, Hewlett-Packard, American Express, and Marriott. Better publicity obviously helps them attract more skilled employees, she added.
To recruit in a tight market for skilled workers requires innovative techniques, Mrs. Kinan-Lovers said. For example, she continued, the Lotus Development Corporation went through a period of rapid growth and needed to attract a large number of professional and technical employees.
''You have to compete for good technical managers,'' she said, adding that Lotus offered one unusual employee benefit: it hired a massage therapist to help employees handle stress.
''Another exciting innovation is cafeteria menus, which now offer a wider variety - from hamburgers to sushi,'' she said.
One Japanese company, Fujitsu Ltd., provides free Japanese language training courses for American employees, she said.
Dr. Edward Lewis, president of St. Mary's College, a liberal arts institution in St. Mary's, Md., said he deplored the low corporate interest in on-the-job training that the survey indicated.
''Managers must learn how to handle diversity among employees,'' he said in an interview last week, adding that he expects almost a third of the labor force to consist of minority group workers by the year 2000.
''Companies must realize that employes with many different backgrounds do not have the same assumptions that their managers have,'' he continued.
A former English professor, Dr. Lewis cited Shakespeare's character Prospero in ''The Tempest'' ''In the play, Prospero learns that a ruler must be a teacher. All levels of management in the year 2000 will have to teach. I wish that students working for master of business administration degrees would learn more about handling people problems and less about the theoretical.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Greets 1st Saturn Car With a Closed Ceremony

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 30

 BODY:
Eight years after committing the General Motors Corporation to a compact-car project called Saturn, Roger B. Smith drove the first customer-ready version of the car off an assembly line in Spring Hill, Tenn., today - the day before he is to retire as chairman.
Typically, Mr. Smith's last hurrah as G.M.'s top executive would have received a media splash, especially since it fulfilled a promise he made five years ago to drive the first Saturn off the line before he retired.
But no outsiders were allowed to view the ceremony, and photographs were taken by a company photographer and cropped to reveal as little of the car as possible. The event was attended only by factory employees, top G.M. executives and Owen Bieber, the president of the United Automobile Workers union, who sat in the passenger seat beside Mr. Smith, a spokeswoman for Saturn said. 
The suspicion raised by this secrecy - that the Saturn car was not ready - was vigorously denied by the spokeswoman. Saturn executives have said they are reluctant to show the car before it goes on sale, which is expected in October.
Last month, problems with plastic door panels that buckeled in the heat at G.M.'s Arizona test track threatened to prevent Mr. Smith from meeting his deadline. The company said that problem was corrected.
 
An Analyst's Appraisal
Christopher Cedergren, an analyst for the automotive market research firm J. D. Power & Associates in Westlake Village, Calif., said he drove a Saturn car two weeks ago in Arizona. The vehicle ''is certainly the best thing G.M. has developed on the small-car front,'' he said.
''G.M. is playing the Japanese game,'' he continued. ''They are not showing the car to anybody other than dealers. I think they don't want to raise anyone's expectations and then have people be disappointed.''
A spokesman for the Saturn division said, ''Our rollout plans call for the vehicle to be shown to the public in the fall, and not before then.''

HEADLINE: America Is No. 1. It'll Stay No. 1.

BYLINE: By Alfred Balk; Alfred Balk is author of the forthcoming book ''The Myth of American Eclipse: The New Global Age.''

 BODY:
Since the late Reagan years, we've heard a media and political refrain: the U.S. is in decline; it has lost world political and economic leadership; Japan is the coming No. 1 power.
Is this rational? After all, we have twice Japan's population and gross national product, and our political, cultural and economic weight has Americanized the world.
This fear makes sense only if we fixate on the immediate postwar years, in which we alone among industrial powers remained unscarred. Before World War II, there were five great powers. Recovery - the fruit of U.S. policy to promote world stability - has restored that multipolarity in a far richer world with different players, with America the reigning superpower and chief broker of a new global order. This is decline? 
Long-term trends suggest that it is not. From the late 60's through 1989, our share of the gross world product remained at 20 to 25 percent.
In the year 2010, according to an '88 Pentagon projection, our gross national product will be twice that of Japan or China or the Soviet Union.
Manufacturing muscle? From the 60's through the 80's, manufacturing provided at least 24 percent of our G.N.P., requiring ever fewer workers as reindustrialization has advanced. Productivity? Real productivity per U.S. worker is by far the world's highest - and 50 percent above Japan's International competitiveness? In the 70's and 80's, as trade has expanded, our share of world exports remained at a stable 17 percent. It is capital goods - production equipment - not autos or electronics, that caused more than half of our 80's trade deficits; oil is our fastest rising import, accounting for one-third of our trade imbalance.
Science-and-technology capability? Our university, corporate and governmental research complex is pre-eminent in all ways. We far outspend anyone else in research and development. Our scientists lead Japan and Europe combined in postwar Nobel Prizes. We write more than a third of all scientific and technical articles published. From '76 through '86 we doubled our scientist population.
High-technology industries? U.S. companies account for two-thirds of all commercial aircraft. The world's largest microchip manufacturer is not Japanese but American (I.B.M., which produces only for itself), and we excel in several classes of chips. The U.S. controls more than 60 percent of the world's computer industry compared to Japan's 20 percent. We lead in supercomputers; microprocessors and software are virtually American monopolies.
Global investment? One-fifth of our corporate assets are outside the U.S. General Motors and Ford are No. 1 and No. 2 in the auto world in sales, assets and profits, obtaining more than half their profits overseas. Foreign branches of U.S companies, far larger than anyone else's, in '87 recorded more than $1 trillion in sales: four times our exports and seven times our trade deficit that year. Today, the U.S. leads the world by far, because we have the largest economy and science-and-technology establishment; the new ''world language'' is English; the most contagious ideal is democracy; the benchmark currency is the dollar, and the trust and good will we enjoy can only be envied by Germany and Japan, our main rivals.
Why are we so insecure? Partly because of the new interdependence. Partly because interest groups (high-tech, for example) frighten us; psychologically, we need an adversary (exit Soviets, enter Japanese), and our quality of life, social programs and political dialogue are deficient.
We don't know our own strengths. If we are to restore our national spirit and fulfill our destiny in a global ''American century,'' it is this malaise, not the delusion of impending eclipse, that we should address. We have the wealth, international status and the know-how to solve problems in a variety of fields. If the media and other opinion leaders opened our eyes to our true status, the speed of our ''revival'' might surprise us.
