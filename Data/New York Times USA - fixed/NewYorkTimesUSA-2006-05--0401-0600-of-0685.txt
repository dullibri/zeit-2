HEADLINE: Democrats Offer Alternative To Republican Energy Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats on Wednesday fueled the debate over rising gas prices by introducing an energy bill they said would do more to wean the country off foreign oil than the plan advanced three weeks ago by Republicans. 
 The bill would cut domestic oil consumption to 12 million barrels a day in 2020 from about 20 million barrels, its supporters say. It calls for expanding the use of alternative fuels for vehicles, in part by requiring more federally owned vehicles to use them, and by ensuring that more service stations sell them.
The bill would also revoke subsidies for the oil industry, increase subsidies for the renewable fuels industry and restore aid to low-income Americans struggling to pay energy bills.
 ''We need lower gas prices and energy independence,'' the minority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said at a news conference with nine other Democrats. ''Republican leaders have proposed the same old solution: drill, drill, drill. But drill, drill, drill is not going to deliver the results we need.''
 The fight over how to respond to gasoline prices of more than $3 a gallon has become an especially pitched debate as the midterm elections approach and as Republicans fight to maintain control of both houses of Congress. But the Democrats, who do not control crucial committees or the schedule that brings legislation to the floor, appear to have scant hope of passing their proposals.
 Last month, Republicans floated a plan for expanding domestic fuel supplies by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, by giving oil companies new incentives to build refineries and by returning $100 to every taxpayer to offset fuel costs. The rebate idea died quickly in the wake of scornful public reaction. The plan would also have rolled back some oil subsidies and extended tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles, as requested by President Bush.
 Democrats criticized the Republican approach as unsustainable, saying that the United States, which uses 25 percent of world oil supplies, has only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the Republicans' energy plan was a metaphor for incompetence and coziness with the oil industry.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said his party's bill was an answer to critics who had accused Democrats of lacking ideas. ''This is a big idea,'' he said. 
 But Republicans shot back quickly, accusing Democrats of repeatedly blocking Republican efforts to increase domestic oil supplies through new exploration in Alaska and in coastal waters. 
 ''This latest plan is a sprinkling of good ideas, a heavy helping of bad ideas and distractions, and a pathetic absence of any effort to increasing American energy supply,'' Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement.
 Mr. Domenici said Democrats were ignoring basic economics.
 ''If we want to bring down energy prices, we must reduce demand while increasing supply,'' he said.
 Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and another strong proponent of drilling, said the Democrats' plan was ''more empty political rhetoric at the expense of the American people.''

HEADLINE: Makers Put Health and Pension Burdens Squarely on the Workers

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Ky. 

 BODY:
For the last quarter-century, Toyota, Honda and Nissan have strived to appear to American consumers like homegrown companies. 
 They built a string of manufacturing plants in the South, employing tens of thousands of local workers. They hired American designers. They spent millions on ads to trumpet their growing roots in communities across the country.
''Being a good corporate citizen starts with hiring lots of good citizens,'' one Toyota ad says. 
 Yet as they built up their operations, the Japanese ''transplants'' have worked hard not to resemble an American car company in one vital respect: how they treat their retirees. 
 ''We want to avoid commitments when we have no control over their costs,'' said Pete Gritton, the head of human resources for Toyota's United States manufacturing operations. ''We can't build in things in such a way that we won't be able to keep our commitments later.''
 Until recently, the issue has mostly been academic for the Japanese car companies. Most of the American factory workers they started hiring in the mid-1980's are still working. 
 But age is creeping up on them. All three Japanese companies are anticipating that the ranks of retirees will swell over the next several years. Toyota's American arm, for example, has just 258 retired production workers (G.M., by contrast, has more than 400,000 retirees).
 But things will change over the next five years. In 2011 and 2012, a combined 1,700 workers will be eligible for retirement at Toyota -- about 6 percent of its current labor force. 
 Their retirement will contrast in a crucial way with their counterparts who have retired from the Big Three auto companies in that they will bear much more of the costs and the risks of retirement on their own. 
 This difference adds up to an important cost disadvantage for the Big Three as they fight to regain market share.
 The benefit packages offered by Detroit's three carmakers to its blue-collar workers, negotiated over time with the United Automobile Workers union, pretty much fit a standard model. Retirees receive a pension check every month, which varies with the number of years served.
 An average worker who reaches retirement age at G.M. will get a monthly pension check worth about $50 for every year of service, up to a maximum of about $1,500 a month, which accrues after 30 years of service, according to a G.M. spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski. Retirees with 30 years of service get a supplement that brings their monthly check up to about $3,000 until they reach 62. 
 Moreover, until last year, when General Motors and the union cut a deal for retirees to cover co-pays and deductibles, G.M. covered retirees' health care expenses.
 With benefits like these, it's no wonder that G.M. was once known as ''Generous Motors.'' 
 But these days, health care costs are causing enormous financial headaches for the Big Three. G.M. has an unfunded liability of $85 billion in today's money to cover future health care costs for workers and retirees. That is seven to eight times the market value of the whole company.
 General Motors estimates that health care costs add about $1,500 to the cost of each vehicle it makes in the United States. Chrysler claims a health care cost of $1,400 per vehicle. Ford says its burden is $1,100.
 G.M.'s pension plan has also been a drain. Since 1992, G.M. has plowed $56 billion in stock and cash into it. It is hoping to reduce its burden by offering all of its 105,000 U.A.W. workers buyout packages worth up to $140,000. It is still unclear how many plan to accept the offer.
 ''The higher legacy costs are reflected in a less modern product,'' said George E. Hoffer, a professor of economics at Virginia Commonwealth University who has studied the auto industry. ''They had to cut costs somewhere else and they cut costs in retooling.''
 Japanese companies face little of this burden in Japan, where the government covers retirees' health care and pays a bigger share of workers' pensions.
 Toyota expected to pay out about $700 million in pension benefits in fiscal year 2006, which ended in March. That's less than a tenth of what G.M. expects to pay on its pensions this year. 
 In the United States, retirees of the Japanese companies pay part of their health care costs. And the Japanese companies' pension obligations are a fraction of that of the American carmakers.
 While G.M. paid $5.4 billion last year for the health care of its 141,000 workers, 449,000 retirees and their dependents, Toyota said in its 2005 annual report that its obligations to cover the health care expenses for its retirees ''are not material.''
 At Honda, a 60-year-old retiree with 10 years of service would typically pay $345 a month for health care; a 62-year-old retiree with 25 years at the company would pay $70. Toyota also requires retirees to pay part of their premiums, based on years of service. 
 In general, these retirees are cut off from the company health plan when they turn 65, and receive instead a lump sum with which they can buy supplementary insurance to Medicare. Honda is alone among the big three Japanese carmakers to still offer a defined-benefit pension guaranteeing a monthly check to newly retired workers in the United States. 
 At Toyota, a worker's pension consists of an investment account in which the company deposits the equivalent of 5 percent of a worker's earnings each year, typically around $3,000 to $3,500. An employee can supplement that with a 401(k) plan, and the company matches contributions up to a maximum of 4 percent of the worker's income.
 For the company, these retirement packages carry no uncertainty. But they do for workers, whose nest eggs depend on their contributions and the financial markets. 
 Consider Richard Baugh. The 61-year-old worker, who applies sealant on Camrys, Solaras and Avalons in the paint room, is planning to retire next January after 17 years at Toyota's factory here, to tend his horses and teach at his local church in nearby Cynthiana.
 His wife, Ruth, 58, will also retire after 14 years at the plant. With total savings of some $700,000, the Baughs feel ready for retirement. They were thrifty, plowing at least 12 percent of their wages into their 401(k)'s. 
 ''After the stock market crash we stayed invested and kept buying, and our 401(k) roared back,'' Mr. Baugh said.
 With less than 25 years at the company, they will have to pay a portion of their health insurance premium, which Mr. Baugh said would amount to some $300 a month. 
 Tim Garrett, vice president of administration at Honda Manufacturing of America, says talk of the Big Three's ''legacy'' problem is overblown. Had they set enough money aside when the workers were active, their retirement would not be costing them anything today. ''Depending on your decisions you will have legacy costs or you will not have legacy costs,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''We have no legacy costs.'' 
 To be fair, Detroit's car companies were no more shortsighted than many companies in other industries. From steelmakers to telephone companies, free health and defined pension checks were a staple of the retirement packages negotiated between America's industrial titans and their unions half a century ago.
 When these companies were growing quickly, providing generous retirement benefits seemed cheaper than offering better pay, a future cost that often did not even have to be accounted for on the financial books. 
 From 1990 to 2005, G.M.'s payroll shrank by two-thirds, and its current work force is now just one-third the number of its retirees and their dependents. 
 Today, defined-benefit pensions are dwindling across industries, as companies force retirees and active workers to pick up part of their health costs. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only one out of three big companies now provide health care coverage for their retirees, down from two-thirds in 1988. 
 In 2003, 22 million workers were covered by some sort of defined-benefit pension, 8 million fewer than in 1980, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. And the number of workers in defined-contribution plans jumped to 52 million, from 14.5 million, over the same period.
 Union contracts have limited what Detroit's car companies can do with their blue-collar workers, but they are paring back where they can. 
 G.M. eliminated health care coverage for its salaried, nonunion retirees hired after 1993. This year, it froze the salaried workers' defined-contribution pension plan. Chrysler made its salaried workers pay more for their health care starting this year. 
 Under an agreement last year with the autoworkers' union, retirees at G.M. and Ford will start paying part of their health care costs, up to $370 a year for an individual and $752 for a retiree's family.
 With Detroit sagging under the burden of these ''legacy'' costs, it is unsurprising -- even to executives at the Big Three -- that the Japanese companies arriving in America chose to do things differently.
 ''These are well-managed companies,'' said Frederick A. Henderson, G.M.'s chief financial officer. ''It is natural that they would look at our experience and say 'I don't want to do that.' ''

HEADLINE: Egypt, Defying West, Jails Hundreds at Rally

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona el-Naggar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CAIRO, May 18 

 BODY:
Egyptian security forces beat and arrested hundreds of demonstrators on Thursday, its leaders holding firm in a drive to silence protests and reassert the power of the state in the face of criticism from the United States and the European Union.
 As Egypt prepared for officials from around the world to arrive for the World Economic Forum on Saturday, a judge was also reprimanded for saying publicly that elections here were rigged, and an opposition leader's appeal was denied, condemning him to serve a five-year prison term on charges widely seen as politically motivated. 
 The government rejected criticism from Washington and the European Union over its crackdown on demonstrators supporting judges' demands for independence, and for criticism of its use of emergency laws to detain political critics.
 ''Egypt totally rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any value judgment on an internal issue related to the Egyptian judiciary,'' the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement directed at the European Union, but with broader implications as well. 
 The words were backed by troops on the ground. For the third time in recent weeks, thousands of riot police officers shut down a broad patch of downtown for much of the day, as a disciplinary panel reprimanded one judge, Hisham Bastawisi, even while he lay in a hospital after a heart attack, and a nine-judge panel ignored a prosecutor's call to give a new trial to the jailed opposition political leader, Ayman Nour. 
 As a result, Mr. Nour, the second-place finisher in the presidential election in September, has been sentenced to five years in prison on charges widely viewed as politically motivated.
 Since the start of the year, the government and its security forces have slowly worked to shut down the small political freedoms of last year when opposition movements were allowed to demonstrate in the streets and even criticize the president by name. The events of Thursday signaled that it would be hard for the government to take back what it had given -- and also that a degree of fatigue had set in among the small sliver of the population pushing for greater political freedoms.
 ''They were determined, and they are still determined, to take back the right to demonstrate, and we are determined to keep it at whatever cost,'' said Muhammad el-Sayed Said, a political analyst at the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ''And once they take back the right to demonstrate, they will take back the expanded freedom of expression so that they move the cycle back to the status quo that we had before 2005.'' 
 Egypt's actions are especially troubling for Washington, because Egypt receives nearly $2 billion a year in military and development aid from the United States. 
 Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, called for Mr. Nour's release and said the denial of his appeal was a ''miscarriage of justice by international standards, and a setback for the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people.''
 If there was any effort on the part of the state to calm tensions, however slight, it was in a decision not to expel Judge Bastawisi and a second judge, Mahmoud Mekki, for their public comments declaring fraud in parliamentary elections, judges and others said. Mr. Mekki was found not guilty, and that prompted the Judges Club, the judiciary's professional association, to announce that it was ending a protest over the charges against the two.
 But the decision to reprimand Mr. Bastawisi was also criticized.
 ''We are not happy about this sentence,'' said Muhammad Mekki, a member of the board of the Judges Club and a nephew of Mahmoud Mekki. ''We are actually sad because this will be used against us in the future for anyone who speaks to the press.''
 Outside the High Court in the center of the city, row after row of riot police officers stood silently in the bright afternoon sun, breaking ranks only to attack demonstrators who tried to express support for a group of judges calling for independence from the executive branch. 
 As the day unfolded, the dynamics on the street and in the corridors of the courthouse reflected the reality that there are only two organized political forces -- the government, with its National Democratic Party, and the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned, but tolerated. It appeared that only the Brotherhood was able to generate a large turnout on Thursday after weeks of arrests, and the pressure from security forces. 
 The Brotherhood and the government challenge each other, with both sides mindful not to push so hard as to provoke a major reaction. The Brotherhood, which has demonstrated the ability to bring out tens of thousands of its supporters, mustered only about 1,500 on the streets on Thursday. For its part, the government arrested 200 of them, including some of the Brotherhood's most prominent leaders, but has not moved to crush the organization or try to shut it down.
 In between the forces, professional organizations like the judges have emerged as forces promoting change. An estimated 7,000 of the 9,000 judges have battled with the government for independence from the executive branch and for the right to oversee elections.
 At midday, when a group of protesting judges entered the courthouse, a crowd of court employees who had gathered on a staircase landing broke into applause, chanting ''Egypt, Egypt,'' demonstrating the judges' popularity on the street. 
 At Mr. Nour's courtroom, the doorway was guarded by rows of riot police officers. Mr. Nour was convicted of forging signatures to create his party, charges widely rejected.
 Inside, Mr. Nour's wife and his teenage son, Nour, and a few foreign diplomats sat in a largely empty courtroom to hear the verdict. 
 After the prosecution and defense lawyers' arguments and a brief break, the court announced that the appeal had been rejected -- leaving Mr. Nour with no avenue in that regard.

HEADLINE: Violent Rebel Rift Adds Layer to Darfur's Misery

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: TINA, Sudan, May 16 

 BODY:
A grisly new battle between rebel factions is raging here in Darfur, casting doubts on the future of a peace agreement to end the war. 
 Two of the main rebel factions fighting the Sudanese government and its allied militias have turned on each other, spurred by ethnic tensions and what appears to be a relentless grab for more territory. Now the rebels have unleashed a tide of violence against the very civilians they once joined forces to protect.
''Right now, we don't have any security problem with the government forces or with the janjaweed,'' said Lt. Col. Wisdom Bleboo, the commander of 140 African Union troops based in nearby Tawila, referring to the Arab militias that have terrorized the people of Darfur in recent years. ''It is only the fighting between the rebel factions that is causing us trouble.'' 
 The tactics of the rebels have grown so similar to those of their enemies that an attack on this dusty village on April 19 bore all the marks of the brutal assault that first forced its people to flee their homes three years ago. Soldiers in uniform, backed by men toting machine guns on camels, flooded the village, burning huts, shooting, looting and raping. 
 Only this time, the soldiers were not government troops, as they had been before. Nor were the men on camels and horseback the fearsome janjaweed, who often destroy villages alongside government forces in a campaign of state-supported murder and rape that the Bush administration has called genocide.
 Instead, last month's attack came from a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army, the same rebel movement that says it wants to liberate the non-Arab people of Darfur from the yoke of Arab domination. Alongside the rebels were armed nomadic herdsmen from the Zaghawa, a non-Arab tribe that is supposedly fighting for the people of Darfur against the government.
 ''It was the Zaghawa who did this,'' said Ismail Rahman Ibrahim, one of Tina's sheiks. ''We used to fear the Arab janjaweed. Now we have another janjaweed.''
 The carnage in Darfur, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives, has often been described as a fight between Arabs and Africans, or a battle between herders and farmers. But neither characterization captures the complexity of the ethnic, social and economic tensions in the region that have fueled the new hostilities between the rebels. 
 The leader of the largest rebel faction, Minni Arcu Minnawi, signed a peace agreement with Sudan's government on May 5 to end the conflict in Darfur, in the face of mounting pressure from international diplomats. 
 But the leader of a second faction, Abdul Wahid al-Nur, refused, saying the agreement did not meet basic requirements on issues like power-sharing and disarmament of the janjaweed militias. He has remained unwilling to sign, but the African Union is so keen on bringing him on board it has once again extended the deadline for him to sign until the end of the month. 
 The split between the leaders was initially dismissed as irrelevant by diplomats negotiating the peace agreement to end the Darfur war. But the depth of that rift now threatens to undermine the shaky new accord, which the Bush administration has hailed as a hard-won diplomatic victory. 
 In an interview, Mr. Nur said he had no regrets about not signing, because, he said, the accord failed to address the root causes of the conflict. 
 ''I refused to sign the agreement because it forgot that the crisis in Darfur was first a political crisis, before it developed into a military crisis and now humanitarian crisis,'' he said. ''So, if you really want to address the crisis and put a real end to the crisis, you have to go back to the root, which is political.''
 Mr. Nur, who founded the S.L.A., and Mr. Minnawi, his rival, both come from non-Arab tribes. But Mr. Nur is from the Fur, farmers who make up the largest ethnic group in Darfur, while Mr. Minnawi comes from the Zaghawa, a much smaller group of non-Arab nomadic herdsmen who also live in Chad and Libya. 
 Initially they fought side by side with the same aim -- forcing the government in Khartoum to grant greater autonomy and a larger share of the nation's wealth to the impoverished region of Darfur. It was a partnership that made sense. The Fur are the largest ethnic group in Darfur, but they lacked tactical expertise. The Zaghawa had plenty of military experience and access to money and weapons from the military in neighboring Chad, which is led by Zaghawas. 
 But tensions soon emerged between the groups. The Fur grew suspicious of the Zaghawa, believing that they wanted to form a Zaghawa nation in Darfur and dominate the other tribes living here, a suspicion some analysts believe was fomented by the central government in Khartoum in an effort to force a split between the rebels. 
 The Zaghawa fighters were more effective at keeping away janjaweed and government attacks, so the Fur and other tribes bore the brunt of the assaults in 2004, the year the war increased to a grim crescendo. 
 Here in the area around Tina, Fur villagers were forced from their homes by the thousands as the rebels and the government battled for control over every inch of territory in a series of pitched battles. But the rebels took firm control last year, so much so that farmers who had fled to camps around Tawila returned to their fields to plant their crops. 
 But the brief tranquillity came to an abrupt end with an assault by Mr. Minnawi's fighters on several towns held by Mr. Nur's faction. The battles came after an irrevocable split in the movement last year, when the two leaders tussled for control, and seem to be attempts to seize territory. Tiger Muhammad, a commander in the Nur faction, said the attack on Tina and other towns his faction controlled was unprovoked and took a grievous toll. 
 ''It seemed to be the only objective was to displace the civilians from their places and to loot their possessions,'' Mr. Muhammad said, sitting in a bullet-scarred school in Tina. ''If there is a problem between armed factions they should not attack civilians.'' 
 In nearby Susuwa, where the Minnawi faction has its base, commanders denied attacking civilians. Sounding very much like the government in Khartoum, which has blamed tribal conflicts for the violence in Darfur and has denied playing a role in arming militias responsible for much of the carnage, the Susuwa commanders said the conflict between the Fur and the Zaghawa here was simply a matter of stolen property. 
 ''The conflict is due to the stealing of animals,'' said Muhammad Daoud, a commander of the force, arguing that Fur villagers steal animals, so Zaghawa herders go looking for them in their villages.
 That explanation does not sit well with the thousands of villagers huddled in a makeshift camp with scant water, food or health services that has sprung up next to the African Union base in Tawila. Most of the people living in grass huts here arrived as a result of the recent violence between the rebel factions, running for their lives for the second or third time in this increasingly chaotic conflict. 
 ''First it was the janjaweed and the government, now it is the rebel factions,'' said Abubakar Moussa, who fled Tina after the April 19 attack. ''Separation is the nature of humanity. We don't care much whether it is Abdul Wahid or Minni. We need one nation under peace in Darfur.''

Most of the shops here on the airport road outside Odessa are neither buildings nor stalls. They are shipping containers, stacked two high in rows long enough to be called streets, though these are little more than overcrowded alleys.
 From their steel gates spills a consumer abundance of inexpensive clothes, shoes and toys, kitchenware, hardware and software, cosmetics, sporting goods and various sundries -- virtually everything, in short, in a part of the world that not long ago was used to getting by with virtually nothing.
 Jeans for $9. Turkish suits, marginally stylish, for $60. Dior, Chanel and Armani are all a steal, if one harbors no complexes about authenticity. Speaking of complexes, there are no dressing rooms in shipping containers. Modesty, though, is in short supply, unlike anything else here, and men and women strip unabashedly in search of a proper fit. 
 ''Juice! Water! Beer! Watch your feet!'' a woman shouted as she plowed a battered cart through this cacophonous, dizzying retail labyrinth, offering to slake any thirst, with a warning to avoid any unfortunate collision with her mobile enterprise. That explains how the market earned its informal nickname, Tolchok. In Russian, still the dominant language in this part of Ukraine, it derives from the verb to push.
 But the only way to avoid her was to stumble back into the entrepreneurial embrace of another container and risk encountering someone trying something on.
 ''They were growing wheat here when I came,'' said Aleksandr Sedov, who once programmed computers for the Soviet space program and now sells, mostly, suspenders and women's blouses. ''Now this place is called the field of wonders.''
 It was also a dump and a garbage incinerator -- paved over and torn down, respectively -- when the last Soviet city fathers of Odessa expelled the pioneers in a previously unknown free market from the city, banishing them to a 10-acre spot seven kilometers, or about four miles, from the city's limits, hence the name. That was in 1989, as the Soviet Union itself was unraveling, and what has since emerged is Europe's most extraordinary and, some say, largest market.
 It now sprawls over 170 acres. The largest shopping center in the United States, the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., covers 96 acres, though all comparisons end there.
 The market is part third-world bazaar, part post-Soviet Wal-Mart, a place of unadulterated and largely unregulated capitalism where certain questions -- about salaries, rents, taxes or last names -- are generally met with suspicion. 
 Open every day but Friday, the market now has 16,000 traders or so and a central staff of 1,200, mostly security guards and janitors, making it the region's largest employer. An estimated 150,000 shoppers come each day, traveling in hundreds of buses from as far as Russia, more than 300 miles away, in search of the bargains that the evident avoidance of customs and taxes makes possible.
 ''Over the 15 years of its operation it has been called different things,'' the Ukrainian newsweekly Zerkalo Nedeli wrote in 2004, ''but in fact it is a state within a state, with its own laws and rules. It has become a sinecure for the rich and a trade haven for the poor.''
 Change looms. President Viktor A. Yushchenko, elected in December 2004, has vowed to bring Ukraine's economy out of the shadows, which is apparently where seller and shopper alike would rather it stay. 
 During the presidential campaign, he pledged not to close the market, saying, ''Nobody will roll Odessa's Seventh-Kilometer under asphalt.'' He apparently had something else in mind: tax inspectors. When Mr. Yushchenko visited the market last December, he ordered the creation of a commission to examine compliance with the tax code at a market where the daily sales, according to Zerkalo Nedeli, were believed to be as high as $20 million.
 No one really knows, not even Anatoly I. Berladin, the deputy director of the market, which is owned by a local land and agriculture tycoon, Viktor A. Dobriansky, and three others.
 Mr. Berladin said the owners themselves contributed roughly $11 million a year in federal and local taxes, but with the containers franchised out, the taxes on goods and income, like customs duties, are not the market's business. ''We never tried to control it,'' he said. ''We are not the tax authorities.''
 Mr. Sedov, the former computer engineer, said he paid $2,300 a month to rent his container. Others, depending on location, of course, rent for $6,000 or more. Like many left adrift by the Soviet implosion, he turned to shuttle trading, bringing in what he could from Poland or other countries of the former Soviet bloc.
 Some, like Mr. Dobriansky, made millions; more, like Mr. Sedov, have squeezed a living out of 12-hour days.
 A woman from neighboring Moldova comes on weekends bearing slippers from a factory where she used to work. ''They pay workers with them,'' she said of her stock, made by a company called Florare in Moldova's unrecognized breakaway region, Transnistria. She gave only her name and patronymic, Yelena Yakovlena, refusing, like most here, to reveal her family name.
 The market itself now has its own Web site -- www.7km.net -- and the owners have begun to build covered structures and actual buildings. Three health clinics provide emergency care at no cost, Mr. Berladin said, and there are a fire station and, at last, modern toilet facilities.
 There are markets like this, if not so large, across Ukraine and Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union, and gradually, sleek new malls are going up in these countries, as are big-box retailers. One just down the road, called Metro, caters to the budding consumer who, if not middle class, can afford better than the cheapest goods from China, Turkey and other low-end suppliers.
 ''The fate of the market depends on the economy of Ukraine,'' Mr. Berladin explained. ''As soon as the economy of Ukraine develops normally, the necessity of our market will die.''
 And then what will become of this extraordinary place?
 ''We will go into wholesale.''

LAW FIRM CHARGED -- The nation's leading class-action securities law firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, and two of its partners were charged with making more than $11 million in secret payments to three individuals who served as plaintiffs in more than 150 class-action lawsuits. [Page A1.] 


OIL LEASE MEASURE -- In a move to revoke billions of dollars worth of government incentives to oil and gas producers, the House approved 252 to 165 a measure that would order the government to renegotiate more than 1,000 leases with companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico. [A1.]

AUTO WORKER RETIREES -- For Japanese car companies with manufacturing operations in the United States, the issue of how to treat retirees has mostly been academic so far. But age is creeping up on the American factory workers they started hiring in the mid-1980's. [C1.]

APPLE STORE OPENING -- Apple Computer is opening a showcase store in Manhattan that will burnish a reputation for clever design. [C1.]

DELL TO USE A.M.D. CHIPS -- Dell, which has used only Intel processors until now, announced it would begin using a chip made by Advanced Micro Devices, as part of a broader plan to improve its flagging sales and market share. Earnings for Dell, the world's largest seller of personal computers, were down 18 percent in the first quarter. ''The competitive environment has been more intense than we had planned for or understood,'' said Kevin Rollins, Dell's chief executive, above. [C1.]

DRUG STUDY DETAILED HEART RISK -- Previously unpublished data from the study that led the drug maker Merck to halt sales of its Vioxx painkiller appear to show that the drug raised the risk of heart attack and stroke within a few months -- not after at least 18 months' use, as Merck has consistently argued. [A21.]

PANEL ENDORSES CANCER VACCINE -- A vaccine produced by Merck that blocks viruses that cause most cervical cancer is safe and effective and should be approved, a federal panel advised. [A21.]

SECOND ENRON TRIAL STARTS -- As a jury spent its first full day deliberating the fates of the former Enron chief executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, a second criminal trial began with prosecutors accusing Mr. Lay of repeatedly lying to banks about how he would use $75 million in loans. [C4.]

LAY'S LAWYER -- When Michael W. Ramsey, the lead lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, the former Enron chief executive, was forced into surgery two months ago to clear an arterial blockage, it was the beginning of the most challenging personal odyssey of his career and an event that may turn out to play a crucial role in Mr. Lay's case. [C1.]

RETAILERS REPORT -- Sears Holdings reported first-quarter profit that exceeded analysts' estimates. Sears posted net income of $180 million, or $1.14 a share, in contrast to a loss in the first quarter of 2005. But Gap, the clothing chain, said first-quarter profit fell 17 percent as it struggled to revamp merchandise and increase store traffic. [C9.]

TUNE IN NEXT FALL -- As the broadcast television networks get ready for the fall season, they are turning over more of their evening schedules to episodic serialized programming, a genre as old as ''The Perils of Pauline'' and as new as ''Desperate Housewives.'' Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C6.]

FOX AND CW ROLL OUT SCHEDULES -- The Fox network introduced a new lineup of shows that emphasized stability, while the new CW network -- created from two smaller networks, UPN and WB -- emphasized meld-ability. Fox's big announcement was of a new late-night entry. [E23.]

HEALTHSOUTH TO PAY $3 MILLION -- The Justice Department announced that HealthSouth, the chain of outpatient rehabilitation hospitals, would pay $3 million and avoid prosecution over a giant accounting fraud. [C11.]

ECONOMIC GAUGE FALLS -- An important gauge of the nation's future economic activity dipped in April, once again suggesting slower growth in the months ahead.

HEADLINE: Outsourcing, Schmoutsourcing! Out Is Over

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I was on my way from downtown Budapest to the airport the other day when my driver, Jozsef Bako, mentioned that if I had any friends who were planning to come to Hungary, they should just contact him through his Web site: www.fclimo.hu. He explained that he could show people online all the different cars he has to offer and they could choose what they wanted.
 ''How much business do you get online?'' I asked him. ''About 20 to 25 percent,'' the Communist-era-engineer-turned-limo-proprietor said. 
The former secretary of state James Baker III used to say that you know you're out of office ''when your limousine is yellow and your driver speaks Farsi.'' I would say, ''You know that the global economy is spinning off all kinds of new business models when your Hungarian driver has his own Web site in English, Magyar and German -- with background music.''
 Jozsef's online Hungarian limo company is one of many new business models I've come across lately that are clearly expanding the global economy in ways that are not visible to the naked eye.
 I was recently interviewing Ramalinga Raju, chairman of India's Satyam Computer Services. Satyam is one of India's top firms doing outsourced work from America, and Mr. Raju told me how Satyam had just started outsourcing some of its American work to Indian villages. The outsourcee has become the outsourcer.
 Mr. Raju said: ''We told ourselves: if business process outsourcing can be done from cities in India to support cities in the developed world, why can't it be done by villages in India to support cities in India. Things like processing employee records can be done from anywhere, so there is no reason it can't be done from a village.'' Satyam began with two villages a year ago and plans to scale up to 150. 
 There is enough bandwidth now, even reaching big Indian villages, to parcel out this work, and the villagers are very eager. ''The attrition level is low, and the commitment levels high,'' Mr. Raju said. ''It is a way of breathing economic life into villages.'' It gives educated villagers a chance to stay on the land, he said, and not have to migrate to the cities.
 A short time later I was interviewing Katie Jacobs Stanton, a senior product manager at Google, and Krishna Bharat, founder of Google's India lab. They told me that Google had just launched Google Finance, but what was interesting was that Google Finance was entirely conceived by the Google team in India and then Google engineers from around the world fed into that team -- rather than the project's being driven by Google headquarters in Silicon Valley.
 It's called ''around sourcing'' instead of outsourcing, because there is no more ''out'' anymore. Out is over. 
 ''We don't have the idea of two kinds of engineers -- ones who think of things and others who implement them,'' Ms. Stanton said. ''We just told the team in India to think big, and what they came back with was Google Finance.'' Mr. Bharat added: ''We have entered the generation of the virtual office. Product development happens across the global campus now.''
 Last story. I'm in gray Newark speaking to local businessmen. I meet Andy Astor, chief executive of EnterpriseDB, which provides special features for the open-source database called PostgreSQL. His primary development team, he tells me, consists of 60 Pakistani engineers in Islamabad, who interact with the New Jersey headquarters via Internet-based videoconferencing. 
 ''The New Jersey team -- software architects, product managers and executives -- comes to work a couple of hours early, while the Islamabad team comes in late, and we have at least five to six hours per day of overlap,'' Mr. Astor said. ''We therefore have multiple face-to-face meetings every day, which makes a huge difference for communication quality. We treat videoconference meetings as if we were all in the same room.'' 
 What all these stories tell me is that we are seeing the emergence of collaborative business models that were simply unimaginable a decade ago. Today, there are so many more tools, so many more ideas, so many more people able to put these ideas and tools together to discover new things, and so much better communications to disseminate these new ideas across the globe. 
 If more countries can get just a few basic things right -- enough telecom and bandwidth so their people can get connected; steadily improving education; decent, corruption-free economic governance; and the rule of law -- and we can find more sources of clean energy, there is every reason for optimism that we could see even faster global growth in this century, with many more people lifted out of poverty.

HEADLINE: Coming Down To Earth

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Um, wasn't the stock market supposed to bounce back after Wednesday's big drop?
 We shouldn't read too much into a couple of days' movements in stock prices. But it seems that investors are suddenly feeling uneasy about the state of the economy. They should be; the puzzle is why they haven't been uneasy all along.
The rise in stock prices that began last fall was essentially based on the belief that the U.S. economy can defy gravity -- that both individuals and the nation as a whole can spend more than their income, not on a temporary basis, but more or less indefinitely. 
 To be fair, for a while the data seemed to confirm that belief. In 2005, the trade deficit passed $700 billion, yet the dollar actually rose against the euro and the yen. Housing prices soared, yet houses kept selling. The price of gasoline neared $3 a gallon, yet consumers kept buying both gas and other items, even though they had to borrow to keep spending (the personal savings rate went negative for the first time since the 1930's).
 Over the last few weeks, however, gravity seems to have started reasserting itself. 
 The dollar began falling about a month ago. So far it's down less than 10 percent against the euro and the yen, but there's a definite sense that foreign governments, in particular, are becoming less willing to keep the dollar strong by buying lots of U.S. debt. 
 The housing market seems to be weakening rapidly. As late as last October, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index, a measure of builders' confidence, was still close to the high point it reached last summer. But on Monday the association announced that the index had fallen to its lowest level since 1995.
 Finally, there are preliminary indications that consumers, hard-pressed by high gasoline prices, may be reaching their limit.
 The National Retail Federation, reporting on a new survey, warns that ''while consumers have seemed resilient in the face of higher energy costs, a tipping point may soon be in sight.'' 
 I can't resist pointing out that the Bush administration's response to the squeeze on working families has been, you guessed it, to accuse the news media of biased reporting.
 On May 10 the White House issued a press release titled ''Setting the Record Straight: The New York Times Continues to Ignore America's Economic Progress.'' The release attacked The Times for asserting that paychecks weren't keeping up with fixed costs like medical care and gasoline. The White House declared, ''But average hourly earnings have risen 3.8 percent over the past 12 months, their largest increase in nearly five years.'' 
 On Wednesday Treasury Secretary John Snow repeated that boast before a House committee. However, Representative Barney Frank was ready. He asked whether the number was adjusted for inflation; after flailing about, Mr. Snow admitted, sheepishly, that it wasn't. In fact, nearly all of the wage increase was negated by higher prices.
 Meanwhile, the return of economic gravity poses a definite threat to U.S. economic growth. After all, growth over the past three years was driven mainly by a housing boom and rapid growth in consumer spending. People were able to buy houses, even though housing prices rose much faster than incomes, because foreign purchases of U.S. debt kept interest rates low. People were able to keep spending, even though wages didn't keep up with inflation, because mortgage refinancing let them turn the rising value of their houses into ready cash. 
 As I summarized it awhile back, we became a nation in which people make a living by selling one another houses, and they pay for the houses with money borrowed from China.
 Now that game seems to be coming to an end. We're going to have to find other ways to make a living -- in particular, we're going to have to start selling goods and services, not just I.O.U.'s, to the rest of the world, and/or replace imports with domestic production. And adjusting to that new way of making a living will take time.
 Will we have that time? Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, contends that what's happening in the housing market is ''a very orderly and moderate kind of cooling.'' Maybe he's right. But if he isn't, the stock market drop of the last two days will be remembered as the start of a serious economic slowdown.

HEADLINE: Apple, a Success at Stores, Bets Big on Fifth Avenue

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Shortly after Ron Johnson joined Apple Computer in 2000, his new boss, Steven P. Jobs, summoned him to a room at the company headquarters. Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive and impresario, pointed to a conference table with just four computers on it. 
 ''Here's our products,'' Mr. Johnson remembers Mr. Jobs telling him.
''How big is the brand?'' Mr. Johnson asked.
 ''Apple is one of the biggest brands in the world,'' Mr. Jobs replied. 
 Then, Mr. Johnson said, Apple's retail stores should be big and spacious, a physical embodiment of the Apple brand.
 That early opinion set a framework for Apple's store strategy, according to Mr. Johnson, a retailing executive who stepped off the fast track at Target to come to Apple.
 ''We had to design an experience that was as big as the space,'' said Mr. Johnson, 47, who is senior vice president in charge of the stores. ''When your product line is the size of a conference table, that is a real risk.''
 Taking that risk has paid off handsomely so far. Since it opened its first two stores five years ago today, the Apple chain has become a retailing phenomenon. Necessity and inspiration led Apple to toss out the conventional textbook on computer stores and to ignore the rules of location, design, staffing and services provided.
 Revenue for each square foot at Apple stores last year was $2,489, compared with $971 at Best Buy, the big computer and electronics retailer, according to Forrester Research, a market research firm.
 This evening, Apple is opening a showcase store in Manhattan that will burnish the company's reputation for clever design. The entrance to the store, on Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, is a glass cube, 32 feet on each side, with a suspended Apple logo inside. Customers walk down a circular staircase -- or take a cylindrical glass elevator -- to the 10,000-square-foot store below. The store will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- a first for Apple and an acknowledgment of New York's status as a round-the-clock city.
 ''We wouldn't do that in Palo Alto, but this is New York,'' Mr. Jobs remarked in an interview. 
 Apple now has 147 stores -- all but 14 in the United States -- and is adding new ones at the rate of 40 a year. Sales at the stores more than doubled last year, to nearly $2.4 billion, and same-store sales, those open at least a year, increased 45 percent. But in the most recent quarter ended in March, same-store sales fell 18 percent from a year earlier. That prompted some to ask whether Apple was running out of gas.
 Apple says that the slippage was an aberration, caused mainly by its announcement in January that it was shifting to Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers, though the new machines were not yet in the stores. It says that the problem is mostly behind it now.
 Intel processors also power most machines running Microsoft Windows, the dominant PC operating system, and using Intel chips makes it easier for Apple users to also run Windows programs. 
 Apple holds less than 5 percent of the personal computer market, and is often cast as the innovative underdog in a Windows world. The stores are crucial in turning Windows users into Apple fans because they allow them essentially to test-drive machines, with plenty of assistance from store personnel. The company says that nearly half of the people buying Macintosh computers at Apple's stores are converted Windows users. 
 ''The dip in the March quarter was not unexpected,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''We knew there would be a bump during this transition. But the longer-term objective here is that Apple stores are the place people are going to go to switch, to buy their first Mac. We've got to be ready for that.''
 At first glance, some of the company's moves seem, in stark financial terms, to be costly indulgences. Almost half of the store staff is there not to sell but to provide free help on how to use Macintosh computers, iPods, software and third-party accessories like digital cameras. Nearly all of the computers have Internet access, and the stores are crowded with people checking their e-mail, browsing the Web or listening to music on the iPods. 
 Staff members receive salaries and do not depend on sales commissions, as such employees do at most other computer stores. And the stores are organized around different uses of computing technology: organizing music, editing digital photos or movies, creating podcasts and blogs -- all done with Apple's software.
 ''The Apple stores are selling digital experiences, not products,'' said Ted Schadler, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''Its stores can be seen as solutions boutiques. And that's the direction that selling technology to consumers, from cellphones to HDTV's, has to go to be successful.''
 At Apple, Mr. Jobs is the guiding hand behind most of the big decisions and many of the small ones as well. But Mr. Johnson, analysts say, deserves much of the credit for the success of Apple's stores.
 ''He's a truly innovative merchandiser and a great manager,'' said Charles R. Wolf of Needham & Company.
 After earning an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1984, Mr. Johnson was offered a job in investment banking by Goldman Sachs, but turned it down. Sitting on a stool at another Apple store, in the SoHo district of Manhattan this week, he explained that he thought retailing would be more stimulating. He started at the Mervyns store chain, working on a loading dock at a branch in suburban Los Angeles. ''Fill a 40-foot trailer in 40 minutes -- that was the goal,'' he recalled.
 Mr. Johnson then spent 16 years at Target, where he rose to vice president for merchandising. He forged a partnership with Michael Graves, the interior designer, that helped build Target's image as a marketer of affordable yet stylish goods.
 The lesson from his Target years, Mr. Johnson said, was that ''if you have great products that are merchandised and marketed clearly, the impact can be almost unlimited.''
 He saw the same kind of opportunity at Apple when Mr. Jobs approached him. Other computer stores were giving Apple short shrift, Mr. Jobs thought, in part because they lacked skilled employees that could explain why Apple was different. ''Steve felt with every bone in his body that Apple had to do retailing,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It was not an experiment for him. He saw it as an essential business strategy.''
 To develop the concept, Apple built a prototype store in a warehouse near its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. The work, like much at Apple, was a secret, and for his first year at the company Mr. Johnson was given an employee alias: John Bruce. 
 The first two Apple stores opened in McLean, Va., and Glendale, Calif., 17 months after Mr. Johnson arrived.
 The conventional wisdom of retailing is that when selling expensive products that are purchased infrequently, like cars or computers, stores should stand alone on cheap land. The assumption is that shoppers will drive a distance for such special shopping trips.
 But Apple decided that it could not afford to have its stores be out of the way. Instead, it opened in more expensive sites, like malls and downtown areas, where shoppers were gathered already.
 ''Steve's view was they'll never drive 10 miles to look at us, but they will walk 10 feet,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 In retrospect, success has a way of looking inevitable. But there was considerable skepticism at the outset about what Apple was doing. And others have failed; Gateway closed its retail stores two years ago. 
 One worry Mr. Jobs and Mr. Johnson had at the start was whether the stores could attract enough skilled people to explain Apple technology to nonexperts. 
 As it turned out, there were plenty of young Apple enthusiasts who wanted to work for the company: 5,000 applied for the 300 jobs at the Fifth Avenue store.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Reinforce Idea That Growth Is Slowing

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
An important gauge of the nation's future economic activity dipped in April, once again suggesting slower growth in the months ahead.
 The Conference Board, a private research group, reported Thursday that its index of leading economic indicators fell by 0.1 percentage point, to 138.9, last month. Economists were predicting a small rise. In March the index climbed by 0.4 percentage point, to 139. 
The index predicts economic activity three to six months in the future.
 Economists said the decline reinforced the Federal Reserve's forecast that economic growth, which has been brisk, would most likely moderate to a more sustainable pace in the coming months.
 In the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at a 4.8 percent pace, the fastest in two and a half years. Analysts expect growth will slow to a pace of 3 percent to 3.5 percent in the second and third quarters.
 Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Investment Strategies Group, said: ''The index is flashing not a recession but a slowing in growth, which is a welcome sign. Unfortunately, we are not seeing an accompanying moderation in inflation yet.''
 The decline in the index comes as the housing market is slowing, energy prices are high and consumer confidence is sagging. April's index reading was weighed down by, among other things, a drop in building permits, a dip in consumer expectations and a rise in claims for jobless benefits.
 The Labor Department said the number of people signing up for jobless benefits rose sharply last week, mainly because of the lingering effects of a partial government shutdown in Puerto Rico, which has now been resolved. New applications filed for unemployment insurance shot up by a seasonally adjusted 42,000, to 367,000, for the week ended May 13. That was the highest level of claims since early in October.
 The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week for the 16th time in two years, an effort to keep inflation from accelerating. Fed policy makers left future rate decisions open as they grapple with whether the economy is more likely to slow or high energy costs are more likely to ignite price and wage rises. After the Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices increased by 0.6 percent in April, many economists said the odds were now increasing that the Fed would bump up rates again at its next meeting on June 28 and 29.

 BODY:

303 Gallery
525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
Through May 27
 In her third solo show in New York, the British artist Ceal Floyer continues to flirt with the long tradition of the empty-gallery exhibition, and to prove that more than expected can be eked out of almost nothing at all. This show contains four works that add up to a bit of sound, two bits of light and a bit of wall. 
In ''I Do/I Would'' a few seconds of a song pass back and forth between two CD players, forward on one, backward on the other, creating what sounds like different expressions of assent. ''Highlight'' might be an innocuous blue balloon resting on the floor, except that its surface catches the light from a distant, nonexistent window, disorientingly implying a completely different, possibly outdoor space. ''Apollinaris'' is a video screen dark except for arcs of bouncing light that suggest falling stars or distant fireworks; gradually you realize that they are simply the effervescence on the surface of a glass of sparkling water. 
 ''Restricted Area'' marks an indentation in the gallery's longest wall with a line of small plastic signs saying just that; they fill it perfectly. On first glance this show encourages a quick in-out, U-turn visit. Stick around and you may appreciate Ms. Floyer's sense of economy and her belief that beauty is in the details hovering at the edges of perception. ROBERTA SMITH

HEADLINE: Money Is A.L.'s Thumb on the Power Scale

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THE American League has won 7 of the last 10 World Series. The American League has won the last 8 All-Star Games played to a decision and 14 of the past 17. Last season, the American League gained a 136-116 edge in interleague games. Do we see a trend here?
 Or asked another way, whatever happened to the National League? 
''We were talking about this two weeks ago,'' said Jim Duquette, a Baltimore Orioles executive formerly of the National League. ''No doubt in my mind, the American League has gotten stronger.''
 Gerry Hunsicker, another National League emigre, offered a similar view. 
 ''I think there are a lot of very average teams in the National League that have a number of issues, maybe more so than I can remember in recent years,'' said Hunsicker, a Tampa Bay Devil Rays executive who was formerly the Houston Astros general manager. ''I think the same thing holds true in the American League, although probably not to as great an extent.''
 By themselves, the results of the World Series, All-Star Games and even interleague games might not establish a case for American League dominance, but taken together, they portray a trend that is difficult to ignore. 
 And if National League enthusiasts want to take exception, they should recall the years when N.L. All-Star teams were dominant, winning 11 straight and 19 of 20. They boasted of N.L. superiority, and they were justified in their claims. It was enough to make a grown man (A.L. president Lee MacPhail) cry.
 The question is, why has that dominance shifted? Some people say it is cyclical, and developments support that theory. But as the interleague phase of this season's schedule begins tonight, why is Major League Baseball in an American League cycle now?
 Maybe money, for one answer. 
 Led by the free-spending Yankees, A.L. teams have four of the five biggest payrolls in the majors this season. The Yankees perennially have the largest payroll, prompting their competitors to spend along with them. This year's Toronto Blue Jays are a case in point.
 Desperate to join the Yankees and the Red Sox in the A.L. East race, the Blue Jays inflated their payroll to $72.9 million this year from $45.4 million last year. Their 2006 payroll is not one of the largest, but the 61 percent increase is easily the largest. Then there are the World Series champion Chicago White Sox, who fattened their payroll by $25 million.
 Over all, 11 of 14 A.L. payrolls went up this year, but only 9 of 16 N.L. payrolls did the same, according to figures compiled by the commissioner's office. Only two A.L. payrolls but six N.L. payrolls went down.
 Oddly, the Yankees' and the Mets' opening-day payrolls went down, the Yankees to $195.4 million from $200.4 million, the Mets to $101.6 million from $103.8 million. 
 Economic expenditure has played a role in another way. Teams willing to spend the most usually get the best free agents and the best players available in trades, and those are the players who help teams get to the playoffs. 
 ''New York and Boston are the two biggest markets,'' said Dave Dombrowski, the Detroit general manager. ''Usually that correlates to larger expenditures.''
 Among players acquired in the past several years, the Yankees signed Jason Giambi, Gary Sheffield, Hideki Matsui, Johnny Damon and Mike Mussina as free agents and traded for Alex Rodriguez and Randy Johnson.
 The Red Sox signed Manny Ramirez, Edgar Renteria and Bill Mueller as free agents, and traded for Curt Schilling, Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell. With their infusion of spendable cash, the Blue Jays signed A. J. Burnett, B. J. Ryan and Bengie Molina. 
 Not all of those players came from the National League, but Sheffield, Johnson, Schilling, Beckett, Lowell and Renteria did, and players of their caliber can make a difference in postseason, All-Star and interleague games. 
 Vladimir Guerrero, whom the Angels snatched from the N.L., certainly has made an impact in and for the A.L., and Jim Thome is threatening to do the same with the White Sox, though he began his career in the A.L.
 ''I don't feel there's some sort of seismic shift in the universe,'' Mark Shapiro, the Cleveland Indians' general manager, said. ''I think there's been a cyclical shift in some of the markets. A larger proportion of free agents has moved to the A.L. the last two off-seasons.''
 But the National League has engaged in the acquisition game, too. The Mets have signed Pedro Martinez, Carlos Beltran and Billy Wagner and traded for Carlos Delgado and Paul LoDuca. Martinez came from the A.L., Delgado was a year removed from the A.L. and Beltran was half a season removed from the A.L.
 Among other impact players who have moved from the A.L. to the N.L. are Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Jason Isringhausen. 
 Money is not the only element that creates winning teams. Front-office management is just as important, if not more so. Two low-revenue teams, Minnesota and Oakland, have performed better than other low-revenue teams, and both are in the A.L.
 The only two N.L. teams that have won the World Series in the past 10 years, Florida and Arizona, are N.L. expansion teams that have dismantled themselves or at least reduced their payrolls after winning. They have not fared as well with lower-paid players.
 Shapiro related a recent telephone conversation in which he teased the Diamondbacks' general manager, Josh Byrnes, a former colleague in Cleveland. ''How does it feel playing in the National League?'' Shapiro said he asked him.

HEADLINE: Downtown Miami in Midst Of a Building Explosion

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 12 

 BODY:
People driving into downtown Miami these days need to allow extra time for losing their way. At least three major streets -- 13th, 14th and 15th -- are closed for construction. In fact, the whole area around Biscayne Boulevard is essentially a sprawling, reverberating construction site, creating a skyline of high-rise skeletons that keep poking above the city's palm trees.
 Miami is in the midst of a major building explosion, one that will almost certainly bring thousands of new residents into the downtown area. Like many cities around the country, Miami is trying to remake its business district into a place where people live, shop and play around the clock, instead of just coming and going from work, leaving the area dead at night. Anchoring this effort is the immense Miami Performing Arts Center, due to open in October, which includes a 2,200-seat concert hall and a 2,400-seat opera house.
 ''Cities like Manhattan, Boston, San Francisco -- these are the examples we are using to move our downtown forward,'' said Johnny L. Winton, a member of the City Commission, adding that some 90,000 housing units were in various stages of construction citywide. 
 But many residents, environmentalists and even developers believe that the growth has been too rapid and undisciplined to support an influx of new residents. They say that buildings are going up without adequate mass transit, parking and water systems or a workable street grid. 
 Moreover, critics say, truly successful downtowns grow organically over time and cannot simply be created overnight. So far, the condo development has not been accompanied by a comparable spurt in support services, like restaurants, grocery stores and dry cleaners.
 ''Big is not better -- I don't know if it's even logical, having that density,'' said Michael Y. Cannon, a Miami real estate analyst. ''You can't just build on every square inch of land.''
 Nancy Liebman, president of the Urban Environment League of Greater Miami, which argues for the preservation and enhancement of public space, agreed. ''If we're going to be left with a bunch of empty condominiums, I don't think it will bode well for the future of that area,'' Ms. Liebman said.
 Mayor Manny Diaz said the building trend was an overall healthy sign for the city. 
 ''Is what is going on too much? I don't think so,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''The developers building in that area that I know are responsible folks.''
 He added: ''Could you stop everything from happening and say, let's do a master plan and tell developers to come back in five years? That is not reality.''
 Developers say the demand is there. Many of the condominiums under construction are expected to be bought up by foreigners as investments or second homes in the sun.
 ''We have plenty of buyers,'' said Tibor Hollo, chairman of Florida East Coast Realty, who is developing Villa Magna, two towers on Brickell Avenue, which he said was the last available waterfront parcel. Since his first building opened for sale in February, Mr. Hollo said, 167 of the 787 units have sold, each at more than $1 million. 
 Dana Nottingham, executive director of the Miami Downtown Development Authority, an independent agency that focuses on downtown economic strategy, said: ''In a boom market, development always outpaces planning. We've been underserved in terms of retail, arts, culture, entertainment -- all of those things are coming on line. This place will be completely transformed.''
 The building upswing has been fueled by several converging factors, local officials say, including a drop in crime, better interest rates and a local government more friendly to development. Mr. Diaz said: ''This city was languishing for a very long time. There is a lot of pent-up demand from people who want to move into the urban core.''
 Even as he defends Miami's growth, the mayor has initiated Miami 21, a project to develop a long-range master plan for the city that will address zoning, economic development, transportation and open spaces. 
 Some residents are concerned that the development is going to tax the city's natural resources. ''Many of these permits basically beat the efforts of the planners,'' said Alan Farago, the director of the Everglades Defense Council. ''You've got this huge crush of construction and building that came in.'' 
 Some object, for example, to a plan to put two museums, the Miami Art Museum and the Miami Museum of Science and Planetarium, in Bicentennial Park across the expressway from the performing arts center.. ''We're at the bottom of the list in terms of park space,'' said Steve Hagen, the former chairman of the parks committee for Miami Neighborhood United, a coalition of 28 neighborhood associations. ''There's no comprehensive plan for how these areas are supposed to work together.''
 Mr. Diaz said the museums would take up only 8 acres out of a total of 29. ''It's not just about grass,'' he said. ''There are plenty of examples of great museums in parks.''
 Other say the development is squeezing out the residents of surrounding neighborhoods, like Overtown, Miami's historic black area, with little concern for including low-cost housing. ''The development that's happening is gentrifying the current residents right out of the neighborhood,'' said Denise Perry, director of the Power U Center for social change, a local nonprofit advocacy organization. ''These buildings are being built for a richer, whiter class of people.''
 The $446 million performing arts center features two buildings designed by Cesar Pelli & Associates connected by a pedestrian walkway over Biscayne Boulevard. ''We're certainly hopeful that the neighborhood is one where people will be living, working, shopping, walking on the streets,'' said Robert M. Heuer, general director of the Florida Grand Opera. ''We feel strongly about creating a neighborhood.'' 
 There are questions about whether the halls can stay filled -- the concert hall is only 38 percent booked so far, the opera house 80 percent, Mr. Heuer said -- and the lack of designated parking for the center. Mr. Farago asked: ''Have you looked at parking lots in that area? How are people going to get to the performing arts center? We have a city that has never been friendly to pedestrians.''
 Mr. Diaz acknowledged that the performing arts center needed parking. But he also said that mass transit improvements were in the works, like a streetcar that would circle downtown Miami, to be completed by the end of the decade. The existing Metro Mover, which circles the city, is underused, the mayor's office said. 
 Mr. Winton talked about making the intersection of Biscayne Boulevard and Interstate 395 ''the epicenter for art, entertainment, culture, jobs and living,'' a place ''where everybody wants to be.''
 ''We want to create density, to give people alternatives to getting in the car and going somewhere,'' he added. ''This isn't a single-family residential neighborhood area.''

HEADLINE: Robert Schwartz, 88, Broker And Promoter of Social Causes

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Robert J. Schwartz, a stockbroker who was an early advocate of using investment choices to foster social change and environmental awareness, died May 9 in Manhattan. He was 88.
 The cause was heart failure, his grandson, Mathew Schwartz, said.
''Bob was the grandfather of socially responsible investing,'' said John Harrington, the founder of Working Assets, a group of mutual funds that back companies that adhere to its political principles. ''He advocated that you could be a prudent investor and still take social and human rights issues into account when you made investment decisions.''
 Mr. Schwartz began his campaign for principled investing in the 1950's when he left a job with the Treasury Department and went to work for the Amalgamated Bank in New York. 
 While at Bache & Company and what became Shearson Lehman Hutton, Mr. Schwartz worked as a stockbroker helping union and church funds invest in ways consistent with their values.
 In 1983, while at Shearson, he started the Trust for Balanced Investment, a nutual fund that was to invest in companies that demonstrated commitment to workers' rights, environmental protection and other social aims. Leonard Woodcock, the former president of the United Automobile Workers union, agreed to serve as the fund's chairman.
 Shearson required that Mr. Schwartz raise $75 million in investments for the fund to be introduced, but before he could achieve that goal, the project was canceled by executives at American Express, which had acquired Shearson.
 Mr. Schwartz retired from Shearson in 1989 but continued to work at the firm part time investing money for some longtime clients. 
 After earning a bachelor's degree in economics from City College and a master's in the same field from Columbia, Mr. Schwartz joined the Treasury Department in 1941 in the office of Foreign Funds Control, working on Puerto Rico. 
 He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1944 and near the end of World War II, he served on the staff of the Marine Corps Air Command for the Okinawa campaign.
 In 1947, he returned to the Treasury Department, serving as the chief of the international statistics division. But he was forced to leave, his grandson said, as McCarthy-era politics made his political views unwelcome. 
 ''He was not a communist, but he was what a lot of people would call a fellow traveler,'' Mathew Schwartz said.
 In 1988 he founded the organization that became Economists Allied for Arms Reduction, which sought to document the economic costs of military activities. The group is now called Economists for Peace and Security. He was also active in Peace Action for a Sane World, a disarmament organization. Mr. Schwartz was married twice, first to Beatrice Ross Schwartz, and then to Josephine Martin, a psychiatrist active in human rights campaigns. Ms. Martin died in 2000 and Ms. Schwartz died in 2002.
 He is survived by three grandchildren and one great-grandson. 
 Mr. Schwartz was an early opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1966, he ran unsuccessfully on an antiwar platform for the Democratic nomination for the seat in New York's 17th Congressional district, which was vacated by John V. Lindsay when he was elected mayor. 
 Mr. Schwartz helped organize protests against Dow Chemical, the producer of napalm, and he organized a group called Wall Street Executives Against the War.
 ''Initial attitudes on Wall Street ranged from unfriendly to hostile,'' Mr. Schwartz wrote. ''Not only was I opposed to the Vietnam War, but I was also opposed to the very profitable war industries.
 Mr. Schwartz, who had the backing of Shearson's powerful chief Sanford I. Weill, reveled in the controversy.
 ''I was considered a maverick of Wall Street (a designation I enjoyed),'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Silverstein Says Insurers Might Not Pay $4.6 Billion

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; David W. Dunlap contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Less than a month after a new financial plan was put in place at ground zero, the developer Larry A. Silverstein raised the specter yesterday that insurers might renege on their obligation to provide a total of $4.6 billion to build the Freedom Tower and three other office buildings there.
 Mr. Silverstein said that lawyers for some of the two-dozen insurers of the World Trade Center complex had indicated that the companies might use the new plan put together by government officials as an excuse to evade their responsibility. 
Under that plan, Mr. Silverstein, who had leased the trade center six weeks before it was destroyed, will no longer build all five towers there. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the property, will take control of the Freedom Tower and a second site, leaving Mr. Silverstein with three towers on the east side along Church Street.
 The developer said that on Monday he and the Port Authority, which owns the 16-acre property, had written to the chief executives of 16 insurance companies demanding that they provide assurances that the new deal would not ''reduce, bar or limit the insurance recovery.'' 
 ''We cannot allow the insurance companies to hold up the revitalization of Lower Manhattan,'' he said.
 The authority's executive director, Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., expressed some concern yesterday, but did not appear to be as alarmed.
 Jacques E. Dubois, chairman of Swiss Re, the largest insurer at ground zero, said that his company's stance had not changed, although his company needed to analyze the final agreement between Mr. Silverstein and the Port Authority before determining whether the deal would have any effect on insurance payouts. Some insurers are also appealing related court decisions. 
 Mr. Silverstein's comments came during his testimony at a State Assembly hearing to determine the extent of the rebuilding progress. 
 It was held at 7 World Trade Center, the 52-story skyscraper that he recently completed that offers a view of the state of the recovery, including the rapidly advancing work on the $2.2 billion PATH station, the excavation for a new Goldman Sachs headquarters, and the scarred and gloomy husks of Fitterman Hall and the former Deutsche Bank building.
 Mr. Silverstein called on Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who had called the meeting, for help in dealing with the insurance companies.
 Mr. Ringler said the Port Authority had a strong legal position because it was a ''co-insured'' party at the trade center and had won an earlier court challenge by the insurers. So far, they have paid about $2.2 billion of the total. About $1.6 billion has been spent to pay mortgages, $120 million a year in rent, architects' fees and more than $100 million in legal expenses.
 Mr. Silver opened the hearing yesterday saying that the sense of urgency at ground zero seemed to have evaporated. He said he wanted to ensure that the ''delays of the past do not continue to plague us.'' He has been critical of Gov. George E. Pataki, and to a lesser extent Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, about the lack of progress.
 ''New Yorkers, particularly the residents of Lower Manhattan, should be back here a year from now, asking us what is happening and why there has been no progress,'' he said.
 Mr. Brodsky said that the purpose of the hearings was to ''lift the veil of secrecy'' around the rebuilding of the office towers, the plans for a 9/11 memorial and demolition of Fitterman Hall and the Deutsche Bank building.
 Although rebuilding has been plagued by a seemingly endless series of political squabbles, delays and missteps over the past four years, city and state officials testified that they were close to fixing many of the problems.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, the first to testify, unleashed a waterfall of dollar figures and statistics illustrating both recent public investments in Lower Manhattan and the improving economic conditions. He cited more than $10 billion in current construction, from transit links to the rebuilding of West Street, new schools, a $27 million investment in Chinatown and thousands of new apartments. Mr. Silver and Mr. Brodsky pointedly questioned the deal by which a shopping center operator, Westfield America, has the right to make the first offer on a new lease for retail space even after its interests were bought out by the Port Authority for $140 million in 2003. Westfield ran the trade center mall.
 And Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal criticized the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's handling of the Deutsche Bank building.
 The recurring theme from the assembly members was their frustration over the lack of public accountability and the absence of visible progress, in spite of one ceremony after another.
 ''I wouldn't do any more groundbreaking right now,'' Mr. Brodsky said.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies on May 18 about the appointment of Kevin M. Rampe as chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding of downtown, misspelled the name of a building damaged on 9/11. (The error was repeated in an article in some copies on May 19 about the progress on rebuilding at ground zero.) It is Fiterman Hall, not Fitterman.

HEADLINE: Group's Study of School Financing Stresses Need for More Aid From Albany

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 18 

 BODY:
When local districts spend more money on schools, their students tend to graduate at higher rates, according to a report released on Thursday by an education advocacy group.
 While the findings may not be surprising, the group, the Alliance for Quality Education, said they illuminated the need for more state aid for schools, particularly in poorer districts without the tax revenues to increase spending on education. 
School districts with a graduation rate of 90 percent spend an average of about $18,500 per student, while districts with a graduation rate of less than 50 percent spend about $13,600, the analysis found. 
 The group is lobbying the Legislature to overhaul the state's school financing formulas and settle a longstanding lawsuit that orders billions more dollars for New York City schools. 
 While the report focused on hundreds of school districts outside New York City, the education advocates said it showed how major spending differences affect student achievement. 
 ''We have this very sad state of affairs where the more money you need, the less money you have,'' said Karen Scharff, the chairwoman of the group's steering committee. 
 Using data from recent decades, the report also found that school districts had increased property taxes more in years when they did not get large increases in state aid. 
 In districts that got state aid increases averaging 7.5 percent, property taxes rose less than 4 percent, while districts with state aid increases of about 6.6 percent raised property taxes more than 10 percent, the report found. 
 The report was released weeks after an analysis from the state comptroller's office found New York's local property taxes to be the highest in the country. Property taxes and school financing have both become political hot potatoes this year. Several candidates for governor have made property taxes a top issue. 
 While the education advocates criticized reliance on local property taxes to pay for schools, they did not weigh in on the debate about precisely how the taxes should be collected or the money distributed. 
 Trudi Renwick, a senior economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal watchdog group, said, ''What we have now is property-rich and income-poor places that cannot afford to pay the rising taxes.'' 
 Although the Legislature approved a record increase for schools statewide this year, it did not do enough to change the basic problem in the state, Ms. Renwick said.

HEADLINE: Seizing Land Is Too Easy In New Jersey, Official Says

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 18 

 BODY:
New Jersey's laws allowing local governments to use eminent domain for private redevelopment are so broad that they are prone to misuse and often fail to protect the people and businesses that are displaced, according to a study released on Thursday by the state's public advocate.
 Wading into one of the most contentious issues in the country, the public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, said that the use of municipal condemnation power has ''expanded to the point where it provides virtually no limitation on taking private property for redevelopment, in apparent violation of the constitutional intent to limit this power.'' The law has become so permissive that no other state gives local government more leeway to interpret what constitutes a ''blighted area,'' the legal basis upon which property can be taken, the report found. 
Under New Jersey's eminent domain laws, even Drumthwacket, the governor's residence in Princeton, could be subject to eminent domain, the report said.
 Eminent domain has unnerved residents across America ever since a ruling by the United States Supreme Court last June upholding the authority of New London, Conn., to condemn older homes near the Thames River to make way for a private development. (So far, no people have been forced from their homes.) 
 But almost immediately, an unlikely collection of liberal urban groups and conservative property-rights organizations attacked the ruling. And since then, lawmakers in several states have passed laws or proposed ballot initiatives, aiming to curb the power of eminent domain.
 For instance, new laws in six states -- Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin -- tighten the definition of blight. And bills in Indiana, Kansas and Michigan would require more compensation for those displaced by eminent domain, said Larry Morandi, director of state policy research for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 New Jersey has always attracted an inordinate amount of attention because it is, according to Dana Berliner, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm in Washington, one of the worst ''abusers'' of eminent domain. But Thursday's report was particularly valuable and unusual, Ms. Berliner and other experts said, because it came from a state's executive branch and not a legislative body.
 ''I think the public advocate -- particularly on points about how redevelopment plans and blight are designated under New Jersey's laws -- was spot on,'' Ms. Berliner said. ''Unless you're already in that system, and benefit from that system, anyone outside would say, 'What on earth is going on in New Jersey?' '' 
 The report is careful not to embrace the sentiment that eminent domain for any private development should be abandoned, as was the case with a recent law passed in South Dakota. Instead, it states that ''redevelopment of truly blighted areas is a legitimate public purpose that serves the greater good by helping revitalize communities and create more opportunities for residents.''
 But in often blunt language throughout the report, Mr. Chen found that the state's eminent domain laws were so poorly worded that they gave insufficient notice to affected property owners and offered few chances for appeal or public input. The report also found that the laws often provided so little compensation to owners of condemned properties that they were priced out of their communities.
 In particular, the report cited a 1992 law as being instrumental in making it easier to use eminent domain, by virtue of a few changes in the definition of ''blight.''
 So among other recommendations, the report urged the Legislature to revise or update some of those definitions and strengthen ethics rules to ensure that government officials working on a redevelopment project, and those working for them, do not benefit personally. It also urged the Legislature to give property owners more time to appeal, and more money for being displaced.
 When asked about the report, Gov. Jon S. Corzine, who criticized Supreme Court decision last year during his campaign for governor, said he had not read the full report. But he expressed confidence in Mr. Chen, whom he chose to lead the new office.
 ''At least on the early briefings that I had that were leading up to the publication of the report, it didn't seem like he was overstepping the line,'' he said. ''But I haven't read this report and the specifics of how it gets translated into specific actions.''
 After the report's release, Mr. Chen discussed it before the Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee. He got a warm reception even when he gave technical responses.
 ''I'm a professor, not a lawyer -- I give you an A,'' said Assemblywoman Amy H. Handlin, a Republican from Monmouth County.

HEADLINE: In a Southern Foray, Giuliani Helps a Friend but Skirts an Issue

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 18 

 BODY:
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani glided over his support for gay civil unions and declared heterosexual marriage to be ''inviolate'' on Thursday as he helped raise money for a former leader of the Christian Coalition, Ralph Reed, who is in a tough fight to become lieutenant governor of Georgia.
 For Mr. Giuliani, who is considering a run for the presidency in 2008, the political foray into the South allowed him to pocket a campaign chit from Mr. Reed that could be useful if the former mayor tries to build a national coalition that includes religious-minded Republicans, who are a core part of Mr. Reed's voter base. 
Mr. Giuliani was warmly received at a Reed fund-raiser here, though advisers to Mr. Reed noted that most of the donors were politically moderate business people, and that a truer test of Mr. Giuliani's appeal among more conservative Southerners would come in rural counties.
 The Giuliani-Reed embrace came five days after another possible Republican candidate in 2008, Senator John McCain of Arizona, appeared alongside the Rev. Jerry Falwell and invoked God several times in a speech at Liberty University, an avowed evangelical institution in Virginia. 
 Georgia Republicans said on Thursday that Mr. Giuliani's visit had been scheduled weeks ago, though they acknowledged that both he and Mr. McCain were seeking to make inroads to the Southern and religious wings of the party.
 Mr. Giuliani did not mention Jesus Christ or his childhood interest in becoming a priest, but instead preached from the bible of fiscal conservatism. 
 Aligning himself closely with the Bush administration, he called for more federal tax cuts as a means of creating jobs and stimulating the economy, and argued that tax cuts would invigorate business and ultimately yield greater total tax receipts, thereby helping to reduce the deficit.
 ''President Bush understands that, the Republican Congress understands that, Ralph understands that, and the Democrats don't,'' Mr. Giuliani told the audience of about 250 people. ''We can take a big step back, either state by state or nationally. And this election in 2006 is going to determine if we keep seeing our economy grow, or we take a real step backwards.''
 Introduced by Mr. Reed as ''a great conservative,'' Mr. Giuliani urged Republicans to look toward the political landscape with optimism and to enthusiastically support President Bush, whose approval ratings are low.
 ''We shouldn't be going to the American people with our heads down,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''We should be going with our heads up -- our policies work.''
 In a brief news conference afterward with reporters from Atlanta and New York, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged his support for some gay rights while reiterating past comments that ''marriage should be between a man and a woman.'' Gay marriage has been in the news in Georgia this week after a judge struck down, on procedural grounds, a state constitutional amendment banning such unions.
 ''I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, that it should remain that way, it should remain that way inviolate, and everything should be done to make sure that that's the case,'' Mr. Giuliani said in response to a reporter's question. ''But I also believe that you should allow for the protection of legal rights for people who are gay and lesbian.''
 Mr. Giuliani said it was not unusual for him to support a former leader of the Christian Coalition like Mr. Reed.
 ''On some of these social issues, we have disagreements that are very, very broad,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It's no different than any other candidate -- there are things I agree with, things I disagree with -- but in Ralph's case, I know him, and I think he's going to be a really effective leader.''
 Asked if he would seek Mr. Reed's help in a possible run for president, Mr. Giuliani replied, ''When you run for president, you ask for everybody's help.''
 Mr. Reed declined to answer reporters' questions about whether he could support Mr. Giuliani for president, given that they disagree on abortion rights and gay rights, or if he thought the former mayor would make a good president.
 ''We're really focused on 2006,'' Mr. Reed said, adding, ''I learned a long time ago an 80 percent friend is not a 20 percent enemy.''
 Mr. Reed is competing for the Republican nomination against a veteran state senator, Casey Cagle, who has piled up endorsements from many legislative leaders and elected Republicans. The primary is July 18.
 Mr. Reed has drawn fire from opponents for his ties to Jack Abramoff, a onetime Reed mentor and a former Washington lobbyist who has confessed to trying to bribe members of Congress. Mr. Reed has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: Ex-Giuliani Aides Criticize City Handling of 9/11 Claim

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Diane Cardwell and Patrick Healy contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Several associates of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani took the rare step of publicly criticizing the Bloomberg administration yesterday as they reacted with anger and confusion to the city's handling of a workers' compensation claim filed by a former deputy mayor who served Mr. Giuliani for eight years. 
 New details emerged yesterday about the claim filed by the former deputy mayor, Rudy Washington, 51, who has asserted that he has severe respiratory ailments, requiring prescription drugs and emergency hospitalizations, as a result of his work near ground zero on Sept. 11, 2001, and afterward. 
On March 14, a state administrative law judge ruled that Mr. Washington was entitled to health-care benefits because he had been injured on the job. On April 10, lawyers for the city appealed, arguing that Mr. Washington was not entitled to the benefits because he did not file his claim within two years of the injury.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he believed the appeal was based on ''a technicality'' and that the lawyers had erred. ''A lawyer was probably reading the law too closely and shouldn't have done that,'' he said. 
 Yesterday afternoon, city lawyers requested a meeting with Mr. Washington's lawyer ''to discuss the claim'' and present any supporting documentation, so that we may move forward,'' the Law Department said in a statement. It stopped short of saying that it would drop the appeal. 
 Mr. Bloomberg emphasized that Mr. Washington had not sought special treatment and was not getting it. 
 ''Rudy Washington happened to be in my office about two months ago, and he told me that he had a medical problem, and I said, 'Is there anything I can do in helping you with City Hall, with bureaucracy?' and he said no, things were fine and he was going through the normal process,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 He added, ''The next thing I knew was, one of our lawyers -- on a technicality, I thought -- was trying to appeal a court decision, and when I heard it, I thought that it was wrong and that we should just go ahead.'' 
 Three former deputy mayors who served Mr. Giuliani said that while they appreciated Mr. Bloomberg's comments, they were irritated by the city's handling of the case.
 ''Policy should not be made by mid- to low-level people within the Law Department,'' said Joseph J. Lhota, who served as budget director, finance commissioner and deputy mayor for operations. ''Policy is made at City Hall.'' 
 Randy M. Mastro, who preceded Mr. Lhota as deputy mayor for operations, said Mr. Washington had won his case and should not have to wait any longer for medical benefits. ''The issues here were potentially so sensitive -- and the right thing to do so obvious -- that it's surprising to me that someone in authority in city government didn't get this case properly resolved long before today,'' he said. 
 Robert M. Harding, who was budget director and then deputy mayor for economic development, noted that police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers -- who are all exempt from the state workers' compensation system -- have more generous benefits than noncareer civilian employees like Mr. Washington. ''He's not entitled to a pension, he's not entitled to health insurance, and now he has suffered a work-related injury,'' Mr. Harding said.
 Mr. Giuliani, who was in Atlanta yesterday afternoon for a fund-raiser, said he was glad that Mr. Washington's case appeared to be near a resolution. ''He was a true hero of Sept. 11,'' Mr. Giuliani said. 
 Robert E. Grey, a lawyer for Mr. Washington, said the former deputy mayor filed his claim on Dec. 20, 2004, after his respiratory problems began. Over four hearings -- on June 22 and Nov. 2, 2005, and Jan. 11 and March 8, 2006 -- an administrative law judge with the State Workers' Compensation Board considered the evidence, including witness testimony and medical reports. 
 Although workers generally must file their claim within two years of an on-the-job injury, there is an exception if the employer has already paid wages or medical expenses related to the injury. Mr. Washington missed four days of work after 9/11 and the city paid his wages for those days, Mr. Grey argued, because it had acknowledged that the missed days were related to the attack. 
 It was on that point that the city's lawyers appealed. They argued that Mr. Washington did not qualify for the exception.

HEADLINE: A Primary for Governor Fights for Voter Attention

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 18 

 BODY:
It seemed a cinch not long ago. A Republican governor had resigned in a corruption scandal. His interim replacement had no experience as a chief executive and had never led a statewide campaign. Democrats, absent from the governor's office for 15 years, surely would be in a strong position to win it back in 2006.
 Yet as Democrats gather to nominate a candidate for governor this weekend at their state convention, they are facing two unexpected complications. One is a surprisingly formidable Republican incumbent, Gov. M. Jodi Rell. The second is an unexpected development that has drawn attention away from the governor's race: a potential primary battle for the seat held for three terms by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. Many say the challenge to the senator, prompted by his support for the war in Iraq, has eclipsed, at least for now, the fight for control at the Capitol. 
 ''This election is not about Hartford,'' said Bill Curry, a Democrat who lost the governor's race twice, in 1994 and 2002, to John G. Rowland, who resigned in 2004 amid an impeachment inquiry. ''The country is so upset with Bush and so distrustful of the Republican crowd running Congress that all of its attention is there. Getting people just to switch topics is a tough trick.'' 
 But the two mayors competing for the gubernatorial nomination, John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven and Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford, are pressing hard to redirect public attention. Each points to improvements in the city he has run for at least a decade, like declining crime and downtown development. Together they have raised nearly $6 million, and Democrats hope that whoever becomes the nominee will surprise Governor Rell, Mr. Rowland's successor, in November.
 The convention vote tomorrow, to be cast by 1,607 party delegates, is expected to be close, and both sides are claiming narrow leads for now. The winner of the party's endorsement, however, has not always won the primary, scheduled for Aug. 8 this year. 
 Democrats say the time between now and then will help the candidates overcome low name recognition and polls that show Mrs. Rell with commanding leads over any potential challenger. The governor has not faced the criticism that Republicans have faced on the national level. On Thursday, she announced her running mate, Michael Fedele, a former state representative from Stamford who now runs an information technology business, before a room of cheering supporters at the Capitol.
 The Democrats note that 653,055 registered voters are enrolled as Democrats, compared with 427,803 enrolled as Republicans; unaffiliated voters are the largest group, at 867,761. Democrats dominate the legislature. 
 Regardless of Mrs. Rell's high job approval ratings, Democrats say that since she took office in July 2004 she has presided over a decline in job growth, increasing property taxes and ethical lapses in her own administration even as she has cast herself as a reformer. They also say she is unproven on the campaign trail. 
 ''I think Governor Rell's popularity exists in isolation,'' said Donald E. Williams Jr., the Democratic Senate president pro tempore, who this week endorsed Mr. DeStefano. ''When we get to September and people start to see real contrasts, this will be a different race.''
 Mr. DeStefano, serving his sixth two-year term as the mayor of New Haven, has collected endorsements from dozens of labor groups and other officials. By March 31, he had raised nearly $3.3 million, a record for a Democratic candidate for governor in Connecticut. 
 But Mr. Malloy, who was elected mayor of Stamford in 1995, has led Mr. DeStefano in fund-raising for each of the last three quarters and has also collected prominent endorsements, including those of Mayor Eddie Perez of Hartford and James A. Amann, the speaker of the House.
 Mr. Malloy, who has raised more than $2.7 million over all, had about $1.4 million left in the bank at the end of the first quarter, while Mr. DeStefano had $2 million, their campaigns said.
 Both men say they support creating a statewide universal health care system and want to repair an education spending system that relies heavily on local property taxes. Both cite sluggish state job growth and talk frequently about their records as mayors in a state whose larger cities have struggled. 
 Asked what differentiated him from Mr. DeStefano, Mr. Malloy said ''leadership style,'' not their positions on any one issue.
 Roy Occhiogrosso, a Democratic consultant who is advising both Mr. Malloy and Senator Lieberman, said that Mrs. Rell's unexpected momentum and the primary challenge to Senator Lieberman from Ned Lamont, a cable executive from Greenwich, had altered the landscape for Democrats in the governor's race, but not necessarily fatally.
 ''Two years in politics is like two centuries in real life,'' he said. ''So much can happen. So much has. That's the bad news. The good news is there's so much time between now and November.''

HEADLINE: Off Broadway Play About H.I.V. Is a Hit in Africa 

BYLINE: By TREY GRAHAM

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
At first, Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter were worried about how Africans might react to their Off Broadway hit, ''In the Continuum,'' which tells the story of two women, one in Los Angeles and one here, who discover they are infected with H.I.V. 
 ''I didn't know if I'd alienate them,'' Ms. Salter said. Zimbabwe, with its official censors' board and sometimes colonial-era sense of propriety, can be quite conservative. ''My characters are lewd and raw,'' she added. ''They curse, they make references to genitalia.'' 
Ms. Salter had traveled with her co-author and co-star, Ms. Gurira, to Africa for a theatrical tour, starting with the Harare International Festival for the Arts in April, and ending with the Market Theater in Johannesburg, where they are performing until June 4.
 But the play was as big a hit here as it had been in New York, where it was directed by Robert O'Hara and produced by Primary Stages. The Zimbabwean half of the show, she added, ''came to life like never before.''
 Ms. Salter, who is from Los Angeles, plays a variety of characters from that city, including Nia James, a teenager who finds herself pregnant, H.I.V. positive and abandoned by her basketball-star boyfriend. Ms. Gurira, who grew up mostly in Zimbabwe, creates a parallel story line there about the destructive sweep of AIDS in the life of a newscaster for Zimbabwe's state-run television network. 
 Their African trip proved that ''In the Continuum'' ''has two very distinct homes,'' said Ms. Gurira, as she sat with Ms. Salter and their production crew at breakfast between performances at the Harare festival. 
 ''The beauty of doing it in the U.S. and doing it here is that we see the specific resonances in both cultures come to life,'' Ms. Gurira said. Here ''there were so many responses that I never get in the States,'' she said, from the knowing laughter at an upwardly mobile character's references to Edgars and Truworth (two upscale department store chains in Southern Africa) to an understanding of the role of traditional healers.
 American audiences have asked whether such ''witch doctors'' still exist, Ms. Gurira explained. (They do: her uncle Gordon Chavunduka is the head of the Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association, and his guidance helped her shape a character whom local audiences clearly recognized.) So it was meaningful, Ms. Gurira said, when an audience member from Harare wanted to speak with the authors ''about how we only go to our traditional healers when we're in the most desperate situations.''
 ''Here, people are talking about the elements of that reality,'' Ms. Gurira emphasized, ''whereas in the States, people are questioning its reality. There are just so many elements that are real to Harare and to Zimbabweans that aren't real to Americans.''
 What is distressingly real as well for Zimbabweans are the dire economic conditions and political misrule that have resulted in 1,000 percent inflation, crumbling government services and omnipresent unemployment.
 Both women participated in workshop play readings with political overtones during their stay, as part of Hi-Five, a play-development initiative that paired young Zimbabwean writers with mentors from the Royal Court Theater and the National Theater in London. Ms. Salter appeared in one that touched on Zimbabwe's economic collapse, its controversial land-reform effort and a widely condemned slum-clearing campaign that left hundreds of thousands of poor Zimbabweans homeless and unemployed last year. 
 Ms. Gurira performed in ''Hill View,'' one of several plays dealing with the collision of old and new ways in modern Zimbabwe, especially in the spiritual world, where Western-style evangelical Christianity is increasingly challenging animist theology.
 Ms. Gurira and Ms. Salter, who met as postgraduate drama students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, were enthusiastically welcomed at the first stop on their trip. A planned theater workshop for 15 people in Chitungwiza, an impoverished dormitory community half an hour outside Harare, morphed into a chaotic two-hour empowerment session with an audience of more than 100 young men and women aged 15 to 25, none of them theater students.
 ''It turned into 'American Idol,' '' Ms. Gurira joked. ''We just had to go with what they were willing to express. All the improv things we had planned just weren't gonna fly.''
 Later they arranged for 20 young women from the Chitungwiza group to attend the final ''Continuum'' performance; another, smaller theater workshop matched the Americans with five members of a fledgling company established by the Zimbabwean actor Craig Peter, a longtime friend of Ms. Gurira's. Zimbabwe has a substantial theater tradition, Ms. Gurira explained, but aspiring actors don't have much access to intensive training in core elements of stagecraft like voice, movement and scene study.
 During the festival the cast and crew joined Ms. Gurira's family for a celebratory dinner featuring sadza, a cornmeal dish, at the home of her parents, Josephine and Roger Gurira, who had just seen ''In the Continuum'' for the first time. 
 Ms. Salter and Ms. Gurira, who are scheduled to appear in ''In the Continuum'' in August at Woolly Mammoth in Washington for the beginning of their American tour, are already thinking about other projects, including television pilots and a play about fashion-plate female freedom fighters in Charles Taylor's Liberia.
 ''People are interested in us as writers,'' Ms. Salter said, ''in the ideas we have, the way we collide the subject matter with humanity and humor.'' 
 Ms. Gurira added that it was fantastic to be sought after, ''but to me it's all a means to an end for stuff I want to do here.'' She added, ''If I can get TV work, film work, great. It all helps me, makes me grow, teaches me a lot, and I can bring it here.''

HEADLINE: Home Insurers Embrace The Heartland

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Homeowners in Michigan have been getting some surprising news lately from their insurance companies -- their premiums are going down as insurers fight for their business.
 Not so for the owners of homes on the coast from Texas as far north as Cape Cod -- their premiums are going up, if they are lucky enough to keep their policies.
Call it the Katrina effect. As the nation's home insurers prepare for an expected onslaught of powerful hurricanes over the next decade or so, they are trying to woo new customers in the heartland of America, where hurricanes rarely if ever tread, to make up for lost revenue from the tens of thousands of customers they are abandoning on the coasts. 
 Rates have begun to drop in the Midwest and West, and insurance experts say they expect the trend to spread across most of the interior of the country. Allstate, for example, has cut rates in Michigan by an average of 16.5 percent in the last six months and lowered rates in Montana by 14.8 percent. 
 But in places like Long Island and Cape Cod as well as the coasts in the Southeast, insurers are doubling prices for some customers and refusing to sell new policies or renew old ones. Recently, State Farm, the largest home insurer, sought an increase averaging 71 percent for home insurance in Florida. 
 The insurers have been raising prices and cutting back coverage for homes in Florida and the Gulf Coast for years. But now, they have begun to apply the same measures in coastal areas that have not experienced a devastating storm in decades. 
 ''The insurers simply can't bet the entire farm on insuring the coastal areas,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. They ''are looking to the rest of the country as an opportunity for profitability.''
 The changes are the most sweeping in the home insurance business in decades. For the first time, the insurers are effectively creating a two-zone system, with homeowners along the coast struggling to get coverage at any price while those inland choose the least expensive among competing offers. The insurers' measures are infuriating consumer advocates, who say the cutbacks and price increases are unnecessary. ''They're overreacting,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America. The risk suddenly seems greater to the insurers, Mr. Hunter said, partly because they have begun to base their calculations on short-term projections rather than long-range weather patterns. 
 ''They're supposed to bring stability, but that's not happening,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''They're putting short-term profits ahead of people. It's because of hurricanes. But some people haven't had a hurricane for years and they're being dumped. That's not right.'' 
 Until recently, it would not have occurred to the insurers to look inland for profits because they were losing money on home insurance everywhere. In fact, home insurance used to be sold as a loss-leader to attract customers for more lucrative auto insurance. But after a surge in fraudulent claims pushed auto insurance into the red, the insurers decided to overhaul the two lines of coverage. 
 So, in the last few years, the home insurers raised rates and reduced benefits all across the country. 
 Claims fell in many places, according to Jeff Rieder, the president of the Ward Group, a national insurance consulting company in Cincinnati, as some customers chose policies with higher deductibles to offset the increased prices. Also, he said, some homeowners decided not to file claims for routine damage, worried that their policies might not be renewed. 
 Now, home insurers are making money everywhere but in hurricane territory. Auto insurance is also doing well. So strong has the home insurance business become that the insurers ended 2004 with a profit, even after $15 billion in hurricane losses. The losses from Hurricane Katrina and other storms in 2005 were almost double, $28 billion, and still, insurance experts say, the business is expected to show a profit. Mr. Hartwig of the Insurance Information Institute said about half the hurricane losses were covered by reinsurance that insurers bought to protect themselves. 
 Now, the strategy on home insurance is to stanch the coastal losses and stoke the inland profits. From the insurers' perspective, even though tornadoes and hailstorms are common in the Midwest, the damage pales in comparison with that from a major hurricane.
 Mr. Rieder said he found in an informal survey that home insurers were reducing rates in a dozen states, including Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and the Dakotas. 
 Nationwide Insurance said it had dropped its rates an average of 3.9 percent in Indiana and 3.15 percent in Michigan. 
 Michael Trevino, a spokesman for Allstate, said his company, saw ''good opportunities to grow our homeowners' business in the central part of the United States.''
 Himanshu I. Patel, a senior vice president dealing with home insurance at the Liberty Mutual Insurance Group in Boston, said in an interview, ''In Illinois, we want as much business as we can write.''
 For 25 years, from 1970 to 1995, few big hurricanes hit the United States. During that time the coastal economies boomed with new houses, apartment buildings and office towers. Now, meteorologists say, the country is in the midst of a 20- to 40-year cycle of more and stronger hurricanes that puts all those buildings, and insurance company finances, in jeopardy. 
 Storm experts are debating whether the increase in hurricane activity is a result of global warming or a shift in warm ocean currents that have historically alternated in the Atlantic Ocean over at least the last century. But they are unanimous that the country is in for a long run of powerful storms. 
 This season, from June to November, nine hurricanes are expected, five of them major, compared with a historical average of two major hurricanes in a season going back to 1950. 
 When insurance companies refuse to provide coverage, the states offer bare-bones policies through insurance pools or state-run companies. But in Florida and Louisiana, the state-run companies are on the verge of collapse. In Mississippi, the officials who run the state insurance agency have told regulators they need to raise rates fivefold to remain in operation.
 Edward Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate, and Florida officials have been campaigning for a federal program to take the strain off insurers and provide guarantees that home insurance will remain available to everyone.
 The insurers are taking the toughest measures in Florida, which has been hit by more hurricanes than any state. On May 12, in addition to requesting a sharp increase in rates, State Farm said it was eliminating hurricane coverage for 39,000 customers near the beaches and getting out of the business of insuring condominium and co-op complexes in the state. At the same time, Allstate said it was cutting back on its exposure in the state by transferring 215,000 customers to two other, smaller companies.
 Even before Hurricane Katrina, the insurers had been cutting back on coverage on Cape Cod, the nearby islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket and the rest of the Massachusetts shore. This spring, they began pulling back from Long Island and New York City. 
 Even though New York rarely gets hurricanes, the upturn in hurricane activity and the recent heavy losses have reminded insurers of a 1938 storm known as the Long Island Express, which leveled stretches of Long Island and went on to hit several New England states. 
 Mr. Trevino, the Allstate spokesman, said his company believed that the chances of a major hurricane hitting Long Island in the next few years have greatly increased. ''We're the largest insurer in the state,'' he said, ''and our exposure to catastrophic loss in New York is higher than we'd like it to be.''
 As a result, Allstate is refusing to renew 28,000 policies in Long Island, Westchester County and the five boroughs of New York City and is no longer taking on new home insurance customers there. 
 Beginning in June, said Joe Case, a spokesman for Nationwide, ''we are not writing new policies in eastern Long Island or on any property within 2,500 feet of the coast'' in the rest of the state. Other companies are pulling back on their coverage in New York, too. Mr. Case said Nationwide was also cutting back on sales of new policies to residents near the coasts in Maryland and Virginia.
 The cutbacks are disruptive for customers, and some say the insurers may be hurting themselves. Jeffrey A. Hornstein, an investment banker at Peter J. Solomon, said that when Allstate told him it was not renewing coverage on his home in Sagaponack on Long Island, he called another insurance agent and three days later shifted coverage on the house plus his two cars and his apartment in the city to the American International Group. 
 ''I don't think this was a good business decision for Allstate,'' he said. ''They're going to lose a lot of other business. They didn't lose one policy in my case, they lost four. I'm a mile from the beach. What's the potential for loss out here if the last big hurricane was in 1938? This isn't South Florida.''
 For the insurers, which rely on computer models of likely hurricane strikes, the danger is very real. 
 But a broad swath of the United States will never see a hurricane. ''You can have bad years in the Midwest,'' said Mr. Patel of Liberty Mutual. ''But they will not bring you to the brink of catastrophe. The risk is different, an order of magnitude different.''

HEADLINE: Never Mind the Clip-On Ties, Geek Squad Can Fix Your PC

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Robert Stephens, the founder of the Geek Squad, has made a very good living solving the problems of technophobes and people who thought they were technically adept.
 So it may have seemed a bit odd to interview him at the recent Maker Faire in San Mateo, Calif., a weekend festival of technology tinkerers who play polo on Segways or build steam-engine robots and pool heaters out of barbecue grills. These people, after all, are ardent do-it-yourselfers, people who derive real joy from never ever having to hire help.
''The do-it-yourself crowd is a dying breed,'' Mr. Stephens said as blasts from a nearby flamethrower mounted on an old fire truck periodically punctuated the conversation. He wasn't being nasty, because his technicians were at the ready to support the fair exhibitors just in case. He made that statement because it explains why the company he founded as a college student in 1994 has grown and grown. 
 When he sold the Geek Squad to Best Buy in 2002, his computer repair company had 60 employees, or agents. Today, it has 12,000 men and women dressed in black pants, white shirts, a black clip-on tie and white socks who arrive at customers' homes in black and white Volkswagen Beetles. 
 The conversation with Mr. Stephens, who is chief inspector of the Geek Squad for Best Buy, helps to explain the success and, indeed, the proliferation of services that do what most Americans are unwilling to do themselves. It is not confined to oil changes, maid service or hiring a gardener or handyman. Almost every time you buy electronics you are offered a service contract either by the manufacturer or the retailer. 
 Beyond service contracts, though, consumers need some insight into how to be smarter about deciding when to call for help. It all boils down to the classic choice between time and money.
 Sure, one can point to another giant of retailing, Home Depot, and argue that there is better evidence that the do-it-yourself trend is strong. Mr. Stephens has economics on his side. Economists say people who call in a technician, even one who will charge, as the Geek Squad does, $159 to install a wireless network or $229 to wipe out a computer virus, can be acting rationally. These tasks may not be worth your time. Indeed, Home Depot has hedged its bets and is increasingly marketing its installation services for contractors to hang your kitchen cabinets or roof your garage. 
 Economists say industrialized societies are spending less on the basics of life -- food, clothing and shelter -- and more on leisure pursuits. Indeed, Robert Fogel, the Nobel-winning economics professor from the University of Chicago, has gone so far as to predict that by 2040 it will take the average American household only 300 hours of work a year to supply its basic needs.
 As leisure time becomes more valued, Americans are loath to give it up. We spend money to get more of it. How much we are willing to spend depends on what we make as well as a more intuitive process of how we measure what our leisure time is worth.
 The results from two online calculators that determine what your time is worth may surprise you. Try http://hughchou.org/calc/realwage.php or http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/calcs/n--time/main.asp. First, your hourly rate may be lower than you think. For instance, someone making $70,000 a year, but who puts in 50 hours a week and commutes an hour each way, may discover the hourly rate is not $33, but about half that.
 So does that mean you hire a handyman only when he costs less than $16 an hour? It's more complicated than that. With only about 12 hours of true leisure time a day, each precious hour is bought with more than 5 hours of work. According to the calculator, each hour of spare time would then be worth about $85.
 How an economist measures the value of leisure time is inexact because do-it-yourselfers sometimes have a stronger motivation than saving money. They enjoy the process. Because seeking joy is less understood than seeking money, economists are still struggling to decide whether growing tomatoes or making drapes is rational.
 Putting a little joy into repair work is what motivated Mr. Stephens. ''Computers were the best thing that happened to my generation,'' said Mr. Stephens, 37. As a student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1990's, Mr. Stephens said he didn't have a lot of money. ''So I started fixing things. I saw people buying computers, so that's why I went into tech support.'' 
 He had yearned to do something glamorous until he had an insight: ''The world is dominated by plumbers and drywall contractors -- the boring businesses,'' he said. ''What if a creative person went into a boring business?'' By age 24, he had created the Geek Squad. 
 ''The best thing that happened to me was that I had no money,'' he said. It forced him to be creative. The uniform, which pokes fun at the image of the socially awkward tech-proficient person, was a way to establish a brand and concept that would be harder for others to copy. ''I wanted it to look low-tech, like the guy at the service station, Ernie, who you knew all your life.'' 
 The flat fee for services, rather than an hourly rate, was an effort to avoid the expense of paperwork and monitoring the staff for fraud.
 Mr. Stephens sees the world of service moving toward flat fees. ''We are a flat-rate society because people are willing to pay for simplification,'' he said.
 It is easier for consumers to understand and they are less likely to feel cheated, he said. ''People hate the hourly rate. They hated it when it applied to cellphones and Internet service.''
 Not all on-call technicians work that way. Rescuecom, a franchise of computer technicians with 100 offices nationwide, charges hourly rates between $88 for an appointment and $250 for an emergency call. ''Support is in an abysmal state,'' said David A. Milman, the chief executive and founder. ''You have manufacturers slicing and dicing the price of computers. There is no way they can afford to provide free support.''
 Both Dell and Hewlett-Packard, the top PC sellers, provide enhanced customer support for a fee. Dell, for instance, will walk you through setting up a home network for $99. 
 Mr. Milman said he thought consumers ought to make the decision to seek professional help not on the value of their time, but on the value of the data that is on their computer. 
 The Geek Squad divides the world into three distinct sets of consumers. One is, of course, the do-it-yourselfers. Another is the ''do it for me'' crowd, those who have made the calculation that they have better use of their time. And the third set, which Mr. Stephens calls the ''I thought I could do myselfers,'' holds some unrecognized potential. 
 This is the group that starts out calling customer service when faced with a technical stumbling block, only to find themselves sitting on the phone, immobile, for several hours as the problem is lobbed from one call center employee to another. After that, he said, they are more willing to consider an alternative. ''They've sat on the phone one time too many,'' Mr. Stephens said. 
 Many of the hardware makers offer service contracts, because they are quite lucrative. But they are lucrative only if they can avoid sending someone to your home to fix the problem. They are designed so you end up paying extra -- with your time. 
 That's not to say that a flat-fee service isn't also designed to help you part with your money. Mr. Stephens the Geek Squad, as part of Best Buy, turning into consultants who advise Best Buycustomers on products before buying. He said that's going to become more important as Americans try to figure out how to expand home networks to link the television, PC, stereo and storage devices. ''You'll see Best Buy pushing installation services,'' he said. ''For me, service is nothing but a profit center.'' 
 And what if, by some miracle, technology becomes easier to use? No worries, he said. ''The easier computers got, the more they needed us when they crash.'' That's because people did more things with their computers and sought help to do even more. 
 ''Sure you can do it yourself, but it is a lot like changing your oil,'' he said. ''Why would you?''

HEADLINE: When Is a Housing Boom Not Such a Boom? See Below for Answers

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
HOME builders in the United States are finally turning pessimistic, or at least that is what they say. The National Association of Home Builders reported this week that its monthly survey showed more pessimism than at any time since 1995. And the next day the government reported that housing starts in April were down 7 percent from March. 
 Housing start numbers can be volatile, however, and the number the government focuses on is a seasonally adjusted annual rate, which would be fine if weather did not have a way of distorting the statistics. So all that pessimism may yet prove to be false.
But if the housing boom is finally nearing an end, it is clear from the accompanying charts, showing regional activity in both apartment and single-family home construction, that it was an unusual boom. The 2001 recession had only a mild impact on apartment building and did not dent single-family construction. After it ended, the market took off.
 Outside of the Northeast, where condominium and cooperative apartments remain strong, it was also a boom with declining interest in multifamily housing, which includes everything from duplexes to large apartment buildings.
 The charts show actual starts over 12-month periods ended in the dates shown. The figures show the change over each 12-month period from the entire year of 1997 -- a period when housing starts were already relatively high.
 As can be seen, the strongest growth in single-family homes since then came in the South and West regions, with the recent 12-month totals more than 60 percent higher than the 1997 figures. In the other two regions, the gain has been less than 30 percent.
 In multifamily housing, the boom was in the Northeast, where the volume of starts peaked earlier this year at more than double the 1997 level. In the Midwest, apartment starts were down sharply, while they are running very close to 1997 levels in the other two regions. 
 Over all, that reflects a trend toward single-family housing. The record for annual housing starts in the United States is 2.36 million, set in the 12 months ended in November 1972. In that period, 44 percent of the starts were multifamily units; construction in that category was set to plunge in the recession that began a year later. Three years later, multifamily starts were down more than 75 percent from the peak.
 The peak 12 months of this boom, through March of this year, had just 2.09 million starts. But only 17 percent of them were multifamily units, while single-family starts set records.
 The speculative fervor back in the early 1970's was in apartments being financed by real estate investment trusts. This time it was in single-family homes, some of them being bought by investors seeking quick profits by flipping homes they financed with innovative mortgages that had not been thought of during previous booms.
 Will this boom end as badly for those speculators as the early-1970's one did for the real estate investment trusts, some of which went broke? Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: After Century, Room and Board in City Still Sting

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
A century ago, New Yorkers blew a lot more of their pay on drinks and smokes. They had their reasons.
 Their families were often packed into tenements with boarders and lodgers. Their children were sent out to work to help pay for the bare necessities. And even then, they borrowed more than Americans elsewhere to cover their expenses.
 From that bleak state at the start of the 20th century, New York City's economy has been transformed in almost every measurable way, a new federal study shows. Over the course of a hundred years, the city's families, on average, became smaller, wealthier and better fed. They also stopped devoting so much of their income to alcohol and tobacco. 
 The study, the first of its kind by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, presents a series of snapshots, sort of a flipbook, of earning and spending in the city compared with the rest of the nation from 1901 to 2003. 
 Over all, the century report, scheduled to be released on Monday, recounts a march toward prosperity, illustrating how New Yorkers -- who earned less than other Americans at the start of the last century -- became wealthier as their incomes grew faster than those of other Americans and much faster than the cost of living.
 But one fact of life has not changed for New York families: More than half of their spending still goes toward housing and feeding themselves, in contrast to Americans elsewhere who allocate more than half of their spending to discretionary items like cars, entertainment and health care.
 By 2003, food alone cost New York families more than $7,000 a year, on average, compared with an average of $5,350 for all American households. But it was New York's housing boom of the last two decades that widened the spending gap.
 Rent and other housing expenses cost New York households $18,919 a year, on average in 2003, or about 38 percent of their total spending. The typical American family allocated just $13,359, or slightly less than one-third of its total spending, to housing, the report states.
 During the century, the income of the typical New York household, adjusted for inflation, more than quadrupled, while annual expenditures did not quite triple. Nationally, household incomes tripled, while spending increased by a factor of 2.4. 
 ''There has been a tremendous increase in the standard of living in the country as a whole and in New York,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, the bureau's regional commissioner and a report author. ''The only thing that today's New York has in common with New York City at the beginning of the 20th century is its location.''
 To demonstrate that transformation, Mr. Dolfman and his co-author, Dennis M. McSweeney, the bureau's regional commissioner in Boston, compared the makeup, income and spending patterns of families in New York and Boston against a national benchmark in nine periods in the century. 
 Over all, Boston fell between New York and the rest of the nation in both income growth and the amount its families had to spend for housing and food. Incomes there quadrupled during the century, while total household spending rose by a factor of 2.2.
 Compared with the typical American household, New York families in 1901 were slightly smaller, earned less but spent more. Indeed, Mr. Dolfman said, New Yorkers back then spent 20 percent more than they reported earning, even though nearly one-quarter of the families sent children out to work. 
 And they drank nearly twice as much as other Americans, allocating almost $3 of every $100 spent to alcohol, in addition to $1.40 on tobacco. 
 ''Many of these men would stop off at grog shops on the way home and by the time they got home, they'd spent too much of what little they were able to make drinking,'' said Thomas Kessner, a professor of history at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York who has studied the city's immigrants. 
 For a gauge of a family's affluence, the report's authors looked at how much of income was consumed by basic necessities -- defined as food, housing and clothing -- and how much was left over to obtain other goods and services like health care, entertainment and education.
 At the start of the 20th century, the necessities accounted for 80 percent of the typical family's spending in New York and across America. Food alone took up nearly half of that, costing a New York family $356 annually. (By 2003, food consumed about 14 cents of every dollar spent by families in New York, compared with about 13 cents for the rest of the country.)
 Housing in 1901 cost an additional $191 a year and clothing $106 more. That left the 1901 New York household with just $22 a year to spend on other things. But discretionary spending averaged about $160, which meant families rang up bills that exceeded their $675 annual income by about 20 percent. To bridge the financial gap, Mr. Dolfman said, they relied far more on credit than other Americans. 
 ''The good ol' times weren't good,'' he said. ''Life was hard.''
 Mr. Kessner, like some other historians interviewed, questioned whether the typical New York family could have borrowed as much as 20 percent of its income long before the advent of credit cards. Still, he said, there is no doubt that finding steady work was a big challenge and more than half of the heads of New York households in 1901 were immigrants who had arrived with little or no cash.
 ''You had a whole population of individuals who were making money off of rag-picking, begging in the streets,'' Mr. Kessner said. ''It was a very different kind of city, certainly, for the lower class.''
 Since then, though, the lot of New Yorkers has improved steadily, interrupted only during the years surrounding the Great Depression, according to the report, which will be available on Monday on the bureau's Web site, at www.bls.gov/opub/uscs. The data show that 1934-36 was the only other period examined in which New York families could not make ends meet. In those years, their expenses exceeded their incomes by about 5 percent. 
 Even back then, housing costs were a problem. A 1934 spending survey, cited in the century report, found that ''competition for living space in this area not duplicated in any other part of the United States. The result is a level of rents which taxes the expenditures of families'' for ''relatively small dwellings.''
 The spending changes accelerated with the economic expansion that followed World War II. By 1960, housing had surpassed food as the biggest category of spending and the mass marketing of cars pushed transportation past clothing as an expense for American families, though not for New Yorkers. In the 1970's and 1980's, cities like Buffalo and Detroit that had been hubs of manufacturing fell into a downward spiral.
 But New York fought off that fate as it capitalized on its status as a world capital of finance, said Edward L. Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard University. ''That's really been the reason for New York's turnaround,'' he said.
 In the last two decades, the disparity between the incomes of New Yorkers and other Americans has widened. Twenty years ago, the average New York household income, which was just shy of $30,000, was about 25 percent higher than the typical American family's, the report states. By 2003, New York households were earning more than $66,000, on average, 33 percent more than the typical American family.
 The New York family's expenses in 2003 were about 25 percent higher, at $50,319, than the national average. The bulk of that money went toward housing, transportation and food, in that order. And, by 2003, New York families may have been healthier too. Of every $100 they spent, less than $1 went toward alcohol and only 50 cents to cigarettes.
 The trend over the century for alcohol was the opposite for Boston. Spending on alcohol there, as a share of all expenditures, nearly doubled. In 2003, the typical household there spent more on liquor than their counterparts in New York.
 Of course, over 100 years, the notion of basic needs had been redefined, said Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University. Whole new categories of everyday goods and services, like computers and telecommunications, have become indispensable. Meanwhile, the advent of luxury housing and luxury food has made much of the spending in those staple categories discretionary.
 ''We've made something that used to be a necessity into an event, a production,'' said Mr. Jackson, who referred to his own occasional visits to a high-scale grocery. ''I remember buying two steaks for $34 at Balducci's. Now, does that make me rich or poor?''

HEADLINE: Western Powers Disagree on Elements of Iran Proposal

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
The United States and Europe are divided over the latest phase of their negotiating strategy on Iran, with the Bush administration resisting a new European offer that includes a proposal for a Middle East security ''framework'' for Iran if it gives up its nuclear activities, diplomats from each side said Friday.
 The diplomats said the administration was also resisting the idea of protecting European companies from punishment by the United States for violating its sanctions if they did business with Iran, as called for in the European proposal. 
The disagreements on these issues are clouding the possibility of a deal with Iran on its nuclear program, even as tensions have increased over Tehran's refusal to change its behavior, the diplomats said. In addition, they said, Europe, the United States and Russia have not agreed on the need to impose sanctions on Iran if it continues to defy the West.
 The diplomats and other officials requested anonymity because, following diplomatic protocol, they are not authorized to speak publicly about ongoing negotiations.
 The European proposals for how to deal with Iran were transmitted to the United States only on Thursday, American and European officials said. A senior administration official said the proposals were being studied by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and others.
 ''The U.S. has received a European proposal but has not yet responded to it,'' said the official, adding that the American answer would be conveyed next Wednesday at a meeting of senior envoys in London. Also to be discussed are sanctions if Iran continues activities believed in the West to be part of a weapons program.
 ''What we have is a general agreement among the Europeans, Russians, Chinese and ourselves to make the Iranians choose between a positive path and a negative path,'' the official said, adding that both incentives and possible sanctions would be discussed in London.
 The United States, Europe, Russia and China are trying to negotiate an approach on Iran, a challenge made even more difficult by persistent rebuffs from Iranian leaders. This week President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was reported to have described what the West was preparing as akin to nuts and candy in exchange for gold.
 The envoys were supposed to have met Friday to discuss the European ideas, but disagreements on the details were said to have postponed the session until next week. Some European officials say talks may continue into the summer.
 Hardliners in the Bush administration and other countries, particularly Israel, are worried that time is wasting and that Iran is about to reach a ''point of no return,'' when it will have the technology and expertise to produce weapons on its own, even though that may take years. In the proposed European package for Iran, there is still no agreement with Russia on sanctions. Russia has said it will not endorse a United Nations Security Council resolution that would make Iran's compliance mandatory.
 According to several European officials, Russia's refusal was the focus of a testy exchange between Ms. Rice and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, when they met for dinner with other envoys on May 8 in New York. Previous accounts have described the heated nature of their exchange, but new details emerged Friday.
 According to two officials, Mr. Lavrov said statements about Iran by R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for political affairs, were ''pathetic,'' prompting Ms. Rice to come back and say such talk was unacceptable. Later, Ms. Rice was said to have asked Mr. Lavrov whether his comments meant an end to talks on the matter.
 Mr. Lavrov was said to have replied no, and European diplomats now say Russia may eventually support a threat of sanctions -- provided they are not imposed automatically if Iran defies the Security Council's demand for cooperation.
 European officials say there is a consensus among them that Mr. Lavrov was angry because of an earlier speech by Vice President Dick Cheney denouncing Russia for its increasingly authoritarian and bullying behavior. Several wondered whether Mr. Cheney, worried about the direction the Europeans were taking the talks, was not in fact trying to antagonize Russia to discourage it from cooperating on Iran. 
 American officials say that it is no secret that Mr. Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld are deeply distrustful of the European effort. Instead, they support efforts to topple the Iranian regime from within, though not through military action.
 Similarly, administration hardliners do not like any kind of security guarantees for Iran, including talk of a Middle East ''regional'' framework put forward by the Europeans. While details are sketchy, the Europeans said the plan would include some sort of guarantee that the government would not be overthrown, through either outside attack or subversion. Europeans say Ms. Rice has made it clear that she is more sympathetic to the idea. 
 The Europeans are also persisting in the view that there will eventually have to be talks between the United States and Iran on security matters. But both they and American officials say there is no call for such negotiations in the current proposal. Administration officials say that if such a proposal were in the European package, it would be rejected outright by the United States.
 The only contact likely with Iran would be through the United States ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, who is authorized to talk to Iranians about only the situation in Iraq. Mr. Khalilzad said in an interview Friday that he had not been in touch with Tehran and that he is not authorized to make contact until after an Iraqi government is formed.
 ''Since I've served as ambassador, I have not met secretly or openly with any Iranian official,'' said Mr. Khalilzad, who took office in April 2005. He was responding to speculation that had appeared in some news reports. ''We would be prepared to meet with them once the government of national unity is formed.''

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Group Thwarts Foes of Immigration Bill 

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
It was a rare sight in the modern, politically polarized Senate: a bipartisan core of Republicans and Democrats fending off killer amendments from the right and the left to preserve the central elements of their bill to overhaul immigration.
 ''That is what legislating is all about,'' declared Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, after a freewheeling week in a chamber where most fights these days are carefully scripted brawls between the two parties. 
In the days since President Bush endorsed comprehensive changes in immigration law in a nationally televised speech, Senate backers of that approach have prevailed on the crucial votes, clearing the way for the likely Senate approval of major immigration legislation next week.
 What happens next is anyone's guess. Many House Republicans are dug in against the call by a Senate majority and the president for a plan that could ultimately lead to citizenship for millions who have lived illegally in the United States for years. House Republicans deride that idea as an affront to the law-abiding public.
 And Republicans fear that even if they reconcile those seemingly irreconcilable viewpoints in House-Senate talks, Democrats will throw up new obstacles to deny Mr. Bush a legislative triumph close to crucial mid-term elections. The future of the legislation is unsettled to say the least.
 ''It is a jump ball right now,'' said Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois.
 In the Senate, the emerging legislation was toughened up during the floor fight. Senators agreed to cap the flow of low-skilled temporary workers at 200,000 annually and disqualified criminals and those who ignored deportation orders from receiving citizenship. They approved 350 miles of border fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers between the United States and Mexico, designated English as the national language and voted to require those seeking citizenship to demonstrate some English proficiency. 
 Conservative critics of the original bill say those additions were significant improvements and they promised to try to reshape the measure even more in the days ahead. But they still do not intend to vote for it.
 ''The Senate should be ashamed of itself,'' Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said Friday. He called the developing legislation flawed and said it would put the nation at an economic disadvantage by focusing mainly on low-skilled workers while other nations concentrate on attracting skilled newcomers. 
 ''It should never, ever, ever become law,'' said Mr. Sessions, who predicted the Senate measure would be completely rewritten in negotiations with the House or the entire effort would collapse.
 Both opponents and advocates of the legislation said the outcome would ultimately be determined by Mr. Bush and how much pressure he was willing to bring to bear in his weakened political state to force a final agreement. 
 In interviews Thursday as part of a visit to the border in Yuma, Ariz., Mr. Bush said he was determined to solve the problem. ''My job is to continue to find that common-sense way forward and continue to articulate it,'' he said in an interview broadcast by CBS News. 
 While the Senate bill underwent some changes, efforts by Mr. Sessions and fellow conservatives like Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas to make fundamental changes to the legislation were repeatedly defeated. Their foes were led by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who took aim at amendments they saw as major threats. 
 ''It strikes a dagger at the heart of what this legislation is about,'' Mr. Kennedy said Thursday night as he successfully fought a proposal by Mr. Kyl to prohibit those who enter the country as temporary workers from seeking citizenship. 
 The legislation has its Democratic doubters as well. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota failed in his effort to curb the guest worker program, an initiative that has drawn the scorn of organized labor. Mr. Dorgan and other Democrats also joined conservative Republicans in a failed bid to require the Department of Homeland Security to certify that the border was secured before any new programs for immigrants could start.
 Though the immigration issue was initially thought to favor Democrats since it could hurt Republican efforts to court Hispanics, some Democrats facing tough re-election fights in the fall are finding it cuts both ways. Almost as the votes were being counted on the Senate floor, Democrats like Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Robert Menendez of New Jersey were coming under fire.
 ''Stabenow Supports Social Security Benefits for Illegal Workers,'' said the headline over a press release issued by a challenger, Michael Bouchard, after Ms. Stabenow voted against a Republican plan to deny immigrants credit for payroll taxes paid while working illegally. 
 Tom Kean, a challenger to Mr. Menendez, issued a statement noting the senator opposed designating English the national language. ''While I respect the diverse heritage of our nation, English is the bond that binds us together,'' said Mr. Kean in a statement. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Menendez accused the Republican of trying to divert attention from his own shifting views on immigration. ''We listen more to our constituents than to Tom Kean Jr.,'' said the spokesman, Matthew Miller.
 Though backers of the broad measure are increasingly optimistic that they will win next week, Mr. Reid, the Democratic leader, warned it was too early ''to give high-fives'' with difficult votes ahead. ''This coming week we all have to keep our heads down and push hard,'' he said.

 ''Still Here? Rumors May Fly, but Treasury Chief Hangs On'' (front page, May 13) gave voice to the worst of Washington rumor-mongering. As Treasury secretary, John W. Snow has worked tirelessly as a steady and strong proponent of the economic interests of the American people. 
From achieving a historic agreement in the G-8 to relieve the debt of highly indebted poor countries; to his deft diplomacy, which has just recently yielded a further commitment by the Chinese leadership to allow the yuan to appreciate; to his advocacy of tax relief, which has contributed to stronger economic growth and five million new jobs, John Snow has gained the respect of his foreign counterparts and achieved real victories for the economic security of the American people.
 John Snow has fulfilled his duty as Treasury secretary in the rarest and best traditions of public service, seeking results rather than self-glorifying headlines.

HEADLINE: Inflation in Most Everything, Except the Dollar

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
HIGHER and higher: Whether it is consumer prices, raw material costs or the fines levied on miscreant corporations, all signs pointed up this week. One exception, besides stock prices, was the dollar, which continued to lose value against other currencies -- including China's yuan, which is all but pegged to the dollar.

PRICE SURPRISE -- Just a day after a barometer of wholesale prices suggested that inflation was under control, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices jumped unexpectedly fast in April, led by clothing, medical costs and air fares, as well as energy.
The Consumer Price Index leapt 0.6 percent, the biggest monthly rise since January, an increase from 0.4 percent in March and higher than analysts had expected. Without volatile food and energy costs, prices still rose 0.3 percent in the month. 
 Since January, so-called core prices -- which exclude food and energy -- have risen at a 3 percent annual rate, faster than the 2.2 percent rise for all of last year. 
 The Federal Reserve's open market committee has been raising interest rates for almost two years, seeking to curb inflation without stifling economic growth. After the Fed lifted its benchmark rate to 5 percent this month, some investors anticipated it might pause. That seems less likely now.
 Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet next at the end of June.

HUNTER IS HUNTED -- Federal prosecutors charged a leading class-action securities law firm and two of its partners with illegally paying people to serve as plaintiffs in more than 150 lawsuits.
 A federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the firm, Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman, for racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. The charges are based on government accusations that the firm paid clients more than $11 million to be named in lawsuits, a practice that gave Milberg Weiss a better chance of being named lead counsel in class actions and reaping more in fees.
 Melvyn I. Weiss, one of the firm's co-founders, denied all of the charges, as did lawyers for the two partners who were indicted individually, David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman.
 The indictment could open the door to a class-action suit against Milberg Weiss or to the reconsideration of settlements made decades ago.

RECORD FINE -- Seeking to resolve a pair of problems that had tarnished its reputation and endangered billions in federal contracts, Boeing agreed to pay a record $615 million in penalties to resolve a civil lawsuit and avoid a criminal indictment.
 In addition to paying a fine -- the biggest ever levied on a military contractor, prosecutors said -- Boeing agreed to ''accept responsibility'' for the actions of its employees in two widely publicized cases of corrupt practices. In the first, Boeing workers stole proprietary data from a rival, Lockheed Martin. In the other, Boeing agreed to hire an Air Force official who was still overseeing Boeing contracts at the Pentagon.
 J. Michael Luttig, a former judge on the United States Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., will succeed Douglas G. Bain as Boeing's general counsel in July.

PATENT DEPENDING -- The Supreme Court unanimously agreed that inventors were entitled to benefit from their ingenuity even if they did not use their patented ideas themselves, but added that courts should not automatically handcuff companies that infringe those patents.
 In a widely anticipated ruling sought to clarify the rules of patent law, the justices told lower courts to reconsider the particular facts in this case before deciding if it should bar eBay from continuing to use the ''Buy It Now'' feature of its online auction business.
 The matter returns to the district court to decide whether this case warrants an injunction against eBay while it negotiates a licensing agreement with MercExchange.

FUNGUS's TOLL -- Bausch & Lomb issued a worldwide recall for its ReNu With MoistureLoc cleaner for soft contact lenses after health officials in the United States linked the product to potentially blinding fungal infections.
 Bausch said it had no basis to think that the problems extended to other ReNu products, but skeptics said 19 of the 122 cases of infection had been linked to ReNu MultiUse -- five times the rate for products from Alcon or Advanced Medical Optics, Bausch's main competitors.
 The controversy appears to have hurt Bausch's sales. FTN Midwest Securities estimated that Bausch's share of the domestic lens care market was 43 percent at the end of March, but had tumbled to 26 percent recently.
 Analysts said it was too soon to know what Bausch's legal liability could be, although numerous lawsuits have already been filed.

RULES OF THE GAME -- As some Republican members of Congress introduced a bill to weaken audit rules adopted after a rush of corporate scandals earlier in the decade, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would begin applying the rules to more and smaller companies. The S.E.C. also moved to make the rules easier and less expensive to apply.
 The law, called the Sarbanes-Oxley Act after its principal sponsors, was passed after the Enron and WorldCom scandals. It established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to regulate the auditing profession, and it required corporate executives to report to shareholders on the adequacy of internal financial controls.
 Jurors in the trial of the two former Enron chief executives, Kenneth W. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, began deliberating about whether they defrauded investors by lying about Enron's financial condition. A verdict could come as early as next week.

CHINA RISING -- The Chinese currency, the yuan, crept up in value by one-tenth of a percent against the dollar -- a small change on its face, but symbolically huge because it meant that for the first time it took fewer than eight yuan to buy a dollar.
 China let its currency strengthen days after the United States Treasury stopped short of accusing China of manipulating the value of the currency. China has controlled the exchange rate of its currency since 1994, when it set the official rate at 8.7 to the dollar.
 Allowing the yuan to appreciate may help China keep inflation in check because it will make gasoline, diesel fuel and other commodities priced in dollars less expensive in yuan.

HEADLINE: Retailers in India Play Catch-Up 

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
INDIAN retailers are frantically expanding -- opening more stores and experimenting with new formats -- in an effort to gain a substantial lead before foreign competitors are allowed to enter the market.
 There is good reason for the fervor, Bloomberg Markets reports. Per capita income has risen 62 percent in the last six years and by 2010, there will be 65 million middle-class households, up from 40 million today, the magazine writes, citing McKinsey & Company estimates.
That makes India attractive to foreign retailers, as does the way most people there shop. 
 ''Right now, Indians do as much as 97 percent of their spending at small, independently owned neighborhood shops,'' Abhay Singh and Subramaniam Sharma report. ''People pick up lentils in one spot, towels in another and sandals in a third.''
 But major Indian retailers believe they can get those shoppers to migrate to the American-style department, grocery and discount stores as well as attract them to supermarkets and hypermarkets (a combined supermarket and department or discount store).
 And they are building all those formats as fast as they can, in anticipation of an influx of foreign competition.
 ''In January, India took the first step in opening retailing to foreign investors,'' the authors write. ''The government now allows overseas businesses to own 51 percent of companies that sell products under a single brand.''
 In other words, a company like Nike could open a store selling Nike-branded goods.
 Retailers like Wal-Mart that provide merchandise made by different manufacturers are still banned, but Indian retailers expect that to change, despite the opposition of local shops.
 THE UNCTUOUS AMERICAN -- Most American managers picture themselves as straight-talking, competitive leaders who are not shy about voicing their opinions.
 But that is not the way foreign professionals experience Americans when they are assigned to work in the states, Across the Board reports.
 ''They are stunned to walk into the office and find a covey of corporate cubicle drones obediently carrying out the orders of the autocratic, pointy-haired boss of Dilbert fame,'' Susan Davidson writes.
 Foreigners say we speak our minds outside the workplace, but not in it. There they say ''we are obsessed with being politically correct.'' They say Americans deliberately withhold honest opinions out of fear of ''embarrassment, disagreement and negative consequences.''
 Indeed, transplanted foreigners say American colleagues go out of their way to avoid face-to-face confrontation, firing off e-mail messages and voice mails when they have a problem, instead of addressing it head-on.
 WHO'S HAPPY? -- The cliche to the contrary notwithstanding, apparently money can buy happiness. Some 49 percent of people making more than $100,000 a year describe themselves as ''very happy'' as opposed to 24 percent who make less than $30,000 a year.
 The other findings from the Pew Research Center about happiness reported in Quick & Simple, a new weekly from Good Housekeeping, include:
 Married people (43 percent) are happier than those who are not (24 percent). 
 Regular churchgoers -- those who attend at least once a week -- are happier (43 percent) than those who seldom or never attend (26 percent).
 Republicans (45 percent) are happier than Democrats (30 percent) and independents (29 percent).
 FINAL TAKE -- Apparently, a gig's a gig.
 ''Have you ever dreamed that Elton John would serenade you with 'Your Song' as you walk down the aisle or that Beyonce would break into 'Bootylicious' at your reception,'' Modern Bride asks.
 It turns out it is more than possible -- providing you are willing to pay. A lot.
 ''Big stars are now performing a wedding for the right price,'' Cristi L. Hansen writes. That starts at $25,000 and climbs to over $1 million.
 No word if your favorite performer will include the ''Hokey-Pokey'' and ''The Bride Cuts the Cake'' as part of the fee. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Commodity Index Suffers Biggest Drop in Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Commodity prices had their biggest weekly drop in more than 25 years this week, led by metals and grains, on speculation that higher interest rates will erode the appeal of copper, gold and silver as alternative investments. 
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of 19 commodities fell 5.4 percent this week, the most since December 1980. The index reached a record on May 11, fueled by investor demand for gold and shortfalls of industrial metals like copper. Oil declined to a six-week low yesterday from a record last month as fuel supplies increased.
 ''The speculators are piling out of the metals,'' said James Vail, who manages natural resource stocks at ING Investments. ''There's been so much money made in this sector that people are trying to protect themselves. There was skepticism on the upside, and now there's panic on the downside.''
 This week, copper plunged 10 percent, the most since October 1994, and gold tumbled 7.6 percent, the biggest drop in more than 15 years. The CRB index dropped 19.46 this week, to 342.29. 
 ''You're just running out of new buyers'' for some commodities, said Michael Guido, director of hedge fund marketing and commodity strategy at Societe Generale. 
 Copper futures for July delivery slid 24.2 cents, or 6.5 percent, to $3.469 a pound in New York trading yesterday. 
 Gold futures for June dropped $23.40, or 3.4 percent, to $657.50 an ounce. Gold has still gained 27 percent this year. Silver futures for July fell 13 percent after climbing for nine consecutive weeks.
 Crude oil futures for June fell 92 cents, to $68.53 a barrel, in New York trading. Prices reached a record $75.35 on April 21 but have eased since Iran signaled it might allow greater access to United Nations atomic agency inspectors.
 Soybean prices fell to the lowest in four weeks, and corn dropped the most since August.
 ''Because of the volatility in all of the markets in the last week, people are beginning to be concerned about slowing economic growth and inflation picking up,'' said Stephen Briggs, an analyst at Societe Generale. ''That's not a good combination, notably for industrial metals.''
 Some analysts suggested that the commodities bubble had burst, and others said prices might rebound from this week's tumble.
 Barclays bank, which forecasts a surge in commodity investment demand through 2008, said prices would rebound because manufacturers needed to stock up on metals, and because inflation would spur demand for precious metals, led by gold.

HEADLINE: Panel Reverses Bush Cuts in Family Planning Aid

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
A House appropriations subcommittee yesterday approved a foreign aid budget for next year that would reverse the deep cuts President Bush proposed for international family planning programs he himself once described as among the best ways to prevent abortion. 
 The Republican chairman of the subcommittee, Jim Kolbe, of Arizona, and the ranking Democrat, Nita M. Lowey, of New York, also agreed to substantially scale back Mr. Bush's ambitious plans for his new foreign aid agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which provides large aid packages to poor countries considered to be well governed.
The two-and-a-half-year-old agency would get $2 billion, rather than the $3 billion the president requested. Both sums are far short of the $5 billion agency that Mr. Bush had originally envisioned.
 The federal budget process is far from over, but the aid package in the foreign operations subcommittee is often a good indicator of how the administration's priorities will fare in Congress.
 David Snider, a spokesman for Randall L. Tobias, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said yesterday that it was too early in the appropriations process for the administration to comment.
 The president's global health undertakings fared better than the Millennium Challenge, though the subcommittee steered the money to fight AIDS in a somewhat more multilateral direction. It fully financed the administration's request for the president's international AIDS program, providing $3.4 billion, $752 million more than this year. But it doubled, to $445 million, the proportion of the money that must go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
 .The administration's proposed cuts to programs that provide birth control and other family planning services to people in poor countries were particularly unpopular with Democrats and an array of nonprofit groups. On his first full day in office, when he decided to deny federal aid to overseas groups that help women obtain abortions, Mr. Bush committed to maintaining the financing of family planning programs at $425 million. 
 He moved away from that for the first time this year, proposing $357 million. The subcommittee has recommended $432 million.

HEADLINE: With President As the Guest, The Hostess Sends Regrets

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: HIGHLAND HEIGHTS, Ky., May 19 

 BODY:
President Bush came to Kentucky on Friday to talk up the economy and raise money for a fellow Republican, Representative Geoff Davis, who faces a potentially tough re-election battle in the fall. As expected, Mr. Davis showed up for the special visit. 
 But another Republican who had Mr. Bush as the star attraction of a fund-raising event earlier on Friday, Representative Thelma Drake of Virginia, did not.
At a time when Mr. Bush's approval ratings are at or near record lows and many party members have shown an inclination to distance themselves from him this election year, the Washington political classes are keeping careful score of who stands with him and who does not.
 Ms. Drake's office said she had no choice but to skip Mr. Bush's visit on her behalf because she had to be on Capitol Hill for an important appropriations vote involving $150 million in military spending for her district, much of it for veterans' health care. 
 The appropriations were approved 395 to 0.
 ''Faced with a decision of missing the vote to go to a fund-raiser or staying in Washington to do her job, she had to stay in Washington,'' said her campaign manager, Tim Murtaugh.
 Mr. Murtaugh said that as late as Friday morning Ms. Drake had been hoping that the vote would be postponed, and that she had readied a car to take her to Andrews Air Force Base in case she could make the trip with the president to Virginia Beach. She could not.
 White House officials said they wholeheartedly agreed with her decision. ''We understand her need to be there, working for constituents,'' said Erin Healy, a White House spokeswoman.
 The situation has been different for others who have clearly snubbed the president, like the Republican candidate for governor in Illinois, Judy Baar Topinka. One of her aides told the syndicated columnist George Will last month that she wanted the president's help to raise money only ''late at night'' and ''in an undisclosed location.''
 White House officials have sent strong signals that Mr. Bush will not help campaigns that throw such jabs. And they have said that whatever the president's poll numbers may be, he remains a formidable fund-raiser. 
 For instance, Mr. Murtaugh said of his boss, Ms. Drake, ''We raised about a half-million dollars today, and she certainly wanted to be here.''

HEADLINE: Future of Higher Education Is Divisive Topic for Panel

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
At one end of the table was the chairman of Kaplan Inc., complaining that he could not get Kaplan's for-profit, Internet-based law school accredited because it has no law library. At the other end was former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, white-haired and distinguished, pleading for more federal aid for needy students.
 The two are members of the Bush administration's Commission on the Future of Higher Education, which concluded a two-day meeting here on Friday. And the person keeping them all laughing was Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economist who suggested that some college students who take six years or more to graduate from college might be too lackadaisical to deserve government aid at all. 
 ''They're climbing rock walls, they're playing, they're drinking -- and they're getting Pell grants?'' Dr. Vedder said.
 The 19 members of the commission represent disparate opinions and interests, and finding common ground is not easy. Refereeing was the chairman, Charles Miller, a private investor and former head of the University of Texas Board of Regents, who wondered aloud how to build consensus among this cacophony of views.
 ''We may have to duke it out, or have a jump ball,'' Mr. Miller said.
 Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings established the commission last fall to study how to increase access, affordability and accountability in higher education. Its recommendations on these issues could be critically important for the country's 17 million college students and their parents.
 In an interview during the meeting, Mr. Miller said he hoped the commission's report would galvanize the Bush administration and Congress to legislate broad reforms in the nation's system for financing and regulating higher education. If it is punchy and well-written, he said, it could be as influential as ''A Nation at Risk,'' the 1983 report commissioned by President Ronald Reagan that inspired a movement for higher standards and accountability in America's 90,000 public schools. 
 The commission includes representatives of wealthy private colleges, underfinanced public universities, overcrowded community colleges and for-profit trade schools, as well as private industries that want colleges and universities to concentrate on preparing students for the workplace. The members have discussed thorny issues, including how to control skyrocketing tuition, the proper role in higher education of Internet-based classes, and whether government should use its leverage as a provider of billions in federal aid to require private universities to administer standardized tests. 
 Mr. Miller's frequent mention during the commission proceedings of ''A Nation at Risk,'' which excoriated the sorry state of America's elementary and secondary education, has left some members nervous. 
 ''We've talked in private to him about that,'' said David Ward, a commission member and president of the American Council on Education, the largest association of colleges and universities. ''If he means that 'A Nation at Risk' had a rhetorical flair that got people's attention, that's certainly true. But the pathology of the public schools in the 1980's is not comparable to higher education today. Our colleges and universities are successful -- just not successful enough to confront the challenges of globalization without significant change.''
 After eight months of meetings and hearings, the commission is to begin writing its report, Mr. Miller said, hoping to get it to Ms. Spellings's desk by mid-September. 
 The members have a congenial working style that has often masked profound differences. Mr. Hunt argued to his colleagues that to help more needy students attend college, the commission must ask for more government money, because Congress will not simply reallocate financial aid away from middle-class families to the poor.
 ''If you think you're going to go out there and take those tax credits away from middle-class families, you ought to re-enroll in Politics 101,'' Mr. Hunt said.
 Dr. Vedder said in an interview that his priorities were controlling costs and raising productivity. 
 ''If the report argues, front and center at the top, for large increases in government spending on higher education, then some of us will have trouble signing,'' Dr. Vedder said.
 Perhaps the commission's deepest conflict has been about how to measure student learning and compare it across institutions, a goal Mr. Miller has endorsed frequently.
 Charles M. Vest, president emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that some on the commission would like it to recommend one or several national tests to measure what postsecondary students have learned. Others, Mr. Vest said, would have the commission ask that every institution state its educational goals, and how it will measure progress toward meeting them. Using a single test to compare students at a community college with students at an Ivy League institution would be of little use, he said. 
 ''We mustn't fall into the trap of 'one size fits all,' '' Mr. Vest said. ''This is a critical moment for this nation. As the forces of change and globalization accelerate, I want this report to be a call to leadership and effectiveness, not an indictment of the current system. There's a difference in tone.''

HEADLINE: Turned Off by Global Warming

BYLINE: By Katherine Ellison. 
Katherine Ellison is the author of ''The Mommy Brain: How Motherhood Makes Us Smarter.''

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
BY now, only someone who has been hiding under a rock would need to see the new Al Gore movie, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' to learn that global warming is real. Even Time magazine caught up to the degree of the threat last month, with its cover story urging us to be ''very worried.'' Many of us have also winced at the slick new television ad, co-sponsored by the national nonprofit group Environmental Defense, that depicts global warming as a speeding train headed straight for a little girl standing on the tracks.
 Well, I for one am very, very worried. As the mother of two young boys, I want to do everything I can to protect their future. But I feel like a shnook buying fluorescent light bulbs -- as Environmental Defense recommends -- when at last count, China, India and the United States were building a total of 850 new coal-fired power plants. Clearly, it's time for some radical ideas about solving global warming. But where's the radical realism when we need it? 
 Here's the truly inconvenient truth: Scientists have long been warning that the world must cut back on greenhouse-gas emissions by as much as 70 percent, as soon as possible, if we're to have a fighting chance of stabilizing the climate. Yet even with full participation by the United States, the controversial Kyoto Protocol -- the only global plan in the works -- would hardly begin to do that. Its goal is to reduce emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. And so far, the best plan offered by American politicians -- the Climate Stewardship act sponsored by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman -- has an even more modest goal: it aims to cut emissions in the United States merely to 2000 levels by 2010. And the Senate has rejected it twice. 
 What we need is something more imaginative and daring. But where's the discussion of anything like that? The ''Take Action'' page on the Web site for Mr. Gore's movie offers no such vision -- the boldest action it suggests is to back the McCain-Lieberman bill. And when I recently asked David Yarnold, Environmental Defense's executive vice president, why his group wasn't offering solutions more dramatic than Congress has thought up, he replied, ''Why would you want to lobby for something that can't get done?''
 Last June, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California became one of the few elected politicians with the courage to talk about climate change in the language it requires by promoting a plan to reduce his state's greenhouse-gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050. But Mr. Schwarzenegger has since warned of the need to move slowly so as not to ''scare the business community.''
 While the California governor backpedals, a team of scientists, economists and business executives have put forward a potentially revolutionary plan. Outlined by Ross Gelbspan, a former Boston Globe reporter and editor, in his book ''Boiling Point,'' the so-called Clean Energy Transition would start by turning over an estimated $25 billion in annual federal government payments now supporting the fossil-fuel industry to a new fund for renewable energy investments. It would also create a $300 billion clean-energy fund for developing countries through a tax on international currency transactions, while calling on industry to get in line with a progressive fossil-fuel efficiency standard, forcing greenhouse-gas emitters to immediately work on conservation. 
 If megaproposals like the Clean Energy Transition, which would get the ball rolling on a global level, still strike us as romantic and implausible, it's only because our politicians, including the well-intentioned Mr. Gore, and smart, well-financed groups like Environmental Defense have denied us the leadership we need to achieve global warming solutions on par with the problem. Lacking such leadership, we're left with little more than our increasing anxiety and that scary, speeding train.

HEADLINE: Hamas Spokesman Is Caught Smuggling Cash Into Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 19 

 BODY:
A prominent spokesman for the ruling Hamas faction was caught Friday trying to smuggle some $815,000 into Gaza from Egypt to circumvent the economic blockade on the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority.
 The cash, which the spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, had in euros hidden under his clothes, was discovered by European officials who were working with Palestinian customs officials loyal to the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.
 It is illegal to carry more than $2,000 cash into Gaza without declaring it, but the Palestinian Authority has been unable to find a bank willing to risk lawsuits in the United States for transferring money to a Hamas-run government. Mr. Abbas's office asked for an inquiry into the episode. 
 Tensions between Mr. Abbas's Fatah movement and Hamas have been increasing in Gaza. The two sides have deployed separate police forces in the last few days, and a series of shootings have taken place, with four more armed men wounded early Friday morning.
 Mr. Abbas, encouraged by the United States to show his authority as commander of all Palestinian forces, controls the Rafah crossing, where the incident occurred, but his order to disband the new Hamas-led militia has been ignored.
 Mr. Zuhri told reporters later that the money was given by Palestinian expatriates to help the people of Gaza, because Israel has stopped transferring some $50 million a month in tax and customs receipts and most of the West has cut off direct budgetary support to the government controlled by Hamas, which has refused to recognize Israel.
 ''I was bringing a sum of money donated by our people abroad for the Palestinian people, but unfortunately some people working at the crossing confiscated the money,'' said Mr. Zuhri, who was returning to Gaza from Qatar. ''Contacts are under way with the relevant authorities to solve the problem,'' he said, at a time ''when the Palestinian people were under siege and are being starved.''
 It is unclear what will happen to the money, which was taken under guard to the office of the Palestinian public prosecutor. But given the tensions and politics of the moment, Palestinians in Gaza expect the money to end up in the hands of the Hamas government.
 Julio de la Guardia, a spokesman for a European Union contingent that monitors the crossing, said travelers crossing through Rafah must declare all sums over $2,000 and explain their origins. ''He did not declare that money; he tried to smuggle it,'' Mr. de la Guardia said.
 About 100 Hamas gunmen went to the crossing and initially demanded that Mr. Zuhri be allowed to leave with the cash, but they left soon afterward without clashing with the presidential forces, who called in reinforcements.
 Since February the Palestinian Authority has been unable to pay salaries for its 160,000 or so employees -- at least 70,000 of them belonging to armed groups or security forces of some kind --and the Gazan economy, starved of cash, is rapidly slowing.
 A few thousand Palestinians rallied Friday in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a Hamas stronghold, to show their support for the government. Carrying the green flags of Hamas, the protesters shouted, ''Down with the siege!'' and other slogans. In Gaza City, hundreds more gathered in the main downtown square, where Hamas leaders collected donations.
 Speaking at Friday Prayer services, the prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, rejected calls by Mr. Abbas to disband the new Hamas-led security force and said he was prepared to increase its size. ''We do not intend to make one step backward,'' he said. ''The force will stay and will be integrated into the police force. Their task is to protect internal security, and if there will be a need to increase its number, we will do it.''
 On Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the rival Palestinian security forces in Gaza caused ''a very dangerous situation'' that Palestinian leaders must confront and control. ''We obviously will leave that to President Abbas, who we believe has the confidence of the Palestinian people and should be able to exercise his responsibilities as president of the country,'' Ms. Rice said.
 The Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who leaves Sunday for Washington, is under pressure from the United States and the European Union to help Mr. Abbas and to resume meetings and negotiations with him. 
 Mr. Olmert is likely to meet Mr. Abbas after returning from Washington, but on Sunday, the Israeli vice prime minister and foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, and deputy prime minister, Shimon Peres, are expected to meet Mr. Abbas at an economic conference at Sharm el Sheik, Egypt.

HEADLINE: Gambling on a Weaker Dollar

 BODY:
For some time now, shortsighted lawmakers in Congress have been threatening China with tariffs for what they call its unfair currency practices. The Bush administration, to its credit, has generally resisted the protectionist rant, most notably by refusing to brand China a ''currency manipulator'' in an official report to Congress last week. 
 China responded to the administration's responsible policy and diplomatic courtesy this week when it loosened, a bit, the tether that binds the Chinese currency, the yuan, to the dollar. A stronger yuan implies a weaker dollar, as does the general strengthening so far this year of the euro and the yen. By making foreign goods sold here more expensive and American goods sold abroad cheaper, a weaker dollar would, in theory, eventually help reduce the United States' huge trade gap.
The problem is this: unless a falling dollar is paired with reductions in the federal budget deficit, it could do more harm than good by driving up interest rates, perhaps sharply. That's because the foreign investors who finance the administration's ''borrow as you go'' budget are likely to demand higher returns to invest in a depreciating dollar. 
 But if budget deficits declined over the long run, the government's reduced need to borrow would help keep interest rates low as the dollar depreciated. Then, after a lag, the falling dollar would shrink the trade deficit without risking big increases in interest rates in the process. 
 Unfortunately, the incessant tax cutting of the past five years precludes any serious attempt to reduce the budget deficit. So to keep interest rates in check as the dollar falls, the administration would have to persuade investors not to believe what they see: a dollar that is declining even as the United States does nothing to curb its borrowing. 
 That would be a difficult trick even for a Treasury Department that commanded respect. It will be especially difficult for Mr. Bush's Treasury team, which has suffered a diminution of esteem and credibility. 
 The Bush tax cuts also make it harder for Americans as a nation to bail themselves out of the trade deficit by saving more. Higher personal savings would allow the government to finance its budget deficit without outsized foreign borrowing -- another safe route to a cheaper dollar and a smaller trade gap. But the Republicans who control Congress let a tax credit for low-income savers expire this year to free up room in the budget for nearly $70 billion in additional tax cuts for high-income Americans over the near term. 
 That tax cut bill, signed into law this week by President Bush, also commits an estimated $53 billion through the middle of the century to help those same high earners shift their existing savings into tax shelters. This adds not one cent of new savings and presages big deficits far into the future.
 A weakening dollar, on top of intractable budget deficits and a chronic savings shortfall, is a recipe for recession. The question now is whether the country will change direction in time. The portents are not good.

HEADLINE: Military Bill Is Cut Back in House

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
House conservatives, rejecting protests from fellow Republicans who said they were depriving troops of needed support, stripped $500 million in military construction projects from a veterans' spending bill on Friday. 
 Democrats blamed Republican-backed tax cuts and a tight budget passed two days earlier for creating a financial crisis leading to the cuts, most of which were for new installations at various military bases. The bill also provides a 10 percent increase for veterans' programs.
''I don't know why they should be stuck in the middle of a family squabble within the Republican Party,'' said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, referring to the troops. Mr. Obey is the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.
 The conservatives, led by Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, used parliamentary procedures to delete about 20 projects worth $507 million from the $94 billion spending bill for the 2007 fiscal year, which will begin Oct. 1. The overall bill passed 395 to 0.
 Writers of the legislation, seeking to meet limits outlined in the budget, had taken the money for the 20 projects from a $50 billion war reserve meant to finance urgent projects, a move characterized by both conservatives and Democrats as a budgetary gimmick.
 Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican and a fiscal conservative, asked how $18.1 million for quarters for enlisted bachelors at Camp Pendleton in California could be considered emergency spending.
 Representative Hensarling said, ''The ink is not even dry on the budget, and we are already attempting to violate it, and that's simply not right.'' 
 Representative James T. Walsh, a New York Republican and chairman of the subcommittee that wrote the bill, criticized Mr. Hensarling, saying, ''He does not understand that we are at war.''

HEADLINE: Seeking United Latin America, Venezuela's Chavez Is a Divider

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; James C. McKinley contributed reporting from Mexico City for this article, and Paulo Prada from Rio de Janeiro.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 19 

 BODY:
As Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, insinuates himself deeper in the politics of his region, something of a backlash is building among his neighbors. 
 Mr. Chavez -- stridently anti-American, leftist and never short on words -- has cast himself as spokesman for a united Latin America free of Washington's influence. He has backed Bolivia's recent gas nationalization, set up his own Socialist trade bloc and jumped into the middle of disputes between his neighbors, even when no one has asked.
Some nations are beginning to take umbrage. The mere association with Mr. Chavez has helped reverse the leads of presidential candidates in Mexico and Peru. Officials from Mexico to Nicaragua, Peru and Brazil have expressed rising impatience at what they see as Mr. Chavez's meddling and grandstanding, often at their expense. 
 Diplomatic sparring has broken into the open. Last month, after very public sniping between Mr. Chavez and Peru's president, Alejandro Toledo, the country withdrew its ambassador from Caracas, citing ''flagrant interference'' in its affairs. 
 ''He goes around shooting from the hip and shooting his mouth off, and that has caused tensions,'' Jorge G. Castaneda, a former Mexican foreign minister, said by phone from New York, where he is teaching at New York University. ''The difference now is that he's picking fights with his friends, not just his adversaries.''
 Some of Mr. Chavez's gestures, like his tendency to tweak the Bush administration, or the aid projects he has bankrolled with Venezuela's oil money, still leave him popular, particularly among the poor. 
 But increasingly, the very image of the Venezuelan leader has come to stand for a style of caustic nationalism that many in the region fear, as the divisions provoked by the man who professes to want to unify his region have widened. 
 ''He is beginning to overreach, wanting to be involved in everything,'' said Riordan Roett, director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. ''It's a matter of egomania at work here.''
 Mr. Chavez, for instance, has taken the uncompromising stand that governments must choose either his vision of continental unity or free trade with Washington, which Mr. Chavez blames for impoverishing the region. ''You either have one or the other,'' he said. ''Either we're a united community or we're not.'' 
 In late April, he exasperated Colombia, Ecuador and Peru by declaring that Venezuela would drop out of their trade group, the Andean Community of Nations, because the other three members were seeking free trade agreements with the United States. He has instead formed a trade bloc with Cuba and Bolivia's new Socialist government. 
 While the move was filled with political symbolism, analysts say it offers few real prospects for trade and threatens badly needed integration among Andean countries, which still depend on United States markets.
 ''Chavez's idea of sovereignty seems pretty selective,'' said Michael Shifter, a senior policy analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue policy group in Washington. ''Chavez has been saying, in effect, 'You're either with us or against us.' For most Latin Americans that hubristic message doesn't go over very well, whether it comes from Washington or Caracas.''
 The sparring with Peru's government erupted last month after President Toledo said it made no sense for Mr. Chavez to criticize his Andean partners for dealing with Washington when Venezuela sells most of its oil to the United States. 
 But he saved his strongest words for Mr. Chavez's general involvement in Peruvian affairs.
 ''Mr. Chavez, learn to govern democratically,'' Mr. Toledo said. ''Learn to work with us. Our arms are open to integrate Latin America, but not for you to destabilize us with your checkbook.'' 
 When Alan Garcia, a candidate in Peru's June 4 presidential election, also took Mr. Chavez to task, the Venezuelan president responded with, among other things, an endorsement of his opponent.
 ''I hope that Ollanta Humala becomes president of Peru,'' Mr. Chavez declared, backing Mr. Garcia's nationalist opponent, who has modeled himself on the Venezuelan leader. ''Go, comrade! Long live Ollanta Humala! Long live Peru!'' 
 Mr. Chavez called Mr. Garcia, a former president whose tenure was marred by corruption scandals, ''shameless, a thief,'' and warned that if he were elected ''by some work of the devil,'' Venezuela would withdraw its ambassador. 
 But it was Peru that made the move first. Venezuela soon followed, and the Chavez government responded by calling Mr. Toledo an ''office boy'' for President Bush. Mr. Garcia benefited handsomely, taking a long lead in the polls. 
 Surveys showed Peruvians had little patience for Mr. Chavez's interference. Only 17 percent of Peruvians said they had a positive view of the Venezuelan leader, the Lima-based Apoyo polling firm found. 
 In Nicaragua, Mr. Chavez has thrown his support behind Daniel Ortega, the former leader of the communist Sandinista revolution, who is running for president in November elections. 
 ''I shouldn't say I hope you win because they will accuse me of sticking my nose into Nicaraguan internal affairs,'' Mr. Chavez told Mr. Ortega, who was invited on his radio show in late April. ''But I hope you win.''
 Mr. Chavez pledged to supply cheap fuel to a group of Sandinista-run towns. The gesture was interpreted by opponents as a naked ploy to influence the vote and criticized as a backhanded way to funnel money to the Ortega campaign. 
 Nicaragua's government called on Mr. Chavez to stay out. ''We hope this partisan support comes to an end so that Nicaraguans can freely choose who we want to be the next leader of Nicaragua,'' Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told Nicaraguan television this month.
 The American ambassador to Nicaragua, Paul A. Trivelli, speaking to Nicaraguan media, accused Mr. Chavez of ''direct intervention,'' but analysts said it was too soon to say what effect Mr. Chavez would have on the vote. 
 In Mexico, the leftist candidate in the July presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has labored to distance himself from Mr. Chavez, to no avail. 
 When he made a slip of manners recently, calling President Vicente Fox a chattering bird and telling him to shut up, his conservative opponent, Felipe Calderon, ran a series of attack advertisements intercutting the gaffe with images of Mr. Chavez, whose tendency to hurl insults is a trademark. (He has called Mr. Bush a drunkard and Mr. Fox a ''puppy dog of the empire.'')
 In recent weeks, Mr. Lopez Obrador's lead in the polls has evaporated, and he now trails his opponent. 
 The disputes are not limited to politics, however, but also touch important national interests. 
 Mr. Chavez, for instance, encouraged and quickly supported Bolivia's nationalization of its energy sector this month, a move that infuriated Argentina and Brazil, which depend on Bolivian natural gas. 
 Though Venezuela was not a party to the dispute, Mr. Chavez joined a meeting of leaders from Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia aimed at calming the crisis, and dominated a news conference afterward, upstaging even his Bolivian protege, President Evo Morales.
 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, steward of South America's largest economy and nominally a left-wing ally of Mr. Chavez, was particularly humiliated. Celso Amorim, the foreignminister, was called before senators and quizzed about Brazil's weak response. He said Mr. da Silva had admonished the Venezuelan leader in a private phone call, telling him that the Bolivian move could jeopardize Mr. Chavez's dream of a 5,000-mile pipeline to carry Venezuela's gas to Argentina.
 Mr. da Silva also rebuked Mr. Chavez, he said, for involving himself in a dispute that Brazil is having with Uruguay and Paraguay over their trade bloc, Mercosur, saying Mr. Chavez's role was ''a stimulant to activities incompatible with the spirit of integration.'' 
 The wounds have yet to heal. Jorge Viana, the governor of Acre state in Brazil, and a crucial ally of Mr. da Silva, told Brazilian radio last week that Mr. Chavez's meddling was ''lamentable.'' He criticized Mr. Chavez's ''precipitated decisions to interfere in the internal affairs of Bolivia, Peru and, by extension, those of Brazil.'' Mr. Chavez, he said, ''needs to calm down.''

HEADLINE: Can Hillary Win? Can Any Woman? 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Hillary Can Run, but Can She Win?'' (column, May 18), Bob Herbert raises an important issue about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's potential run for the presidency -- her gender. While Mr. Herbert claims that it will be difficult for a woman to get elected in the United States, recent evidence proves otherwise. 
Over the last year Chile, Liberia, Germany and Jamaica have all sworn in their first female heads of government, and the United States is poised to do the same. A recent poll shows that nearly 92 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief.
 And in a Roper Public Affairs poll that the White House Project commissioned last fall, nearly 80 percent felt that a woman would do better than or as well as a man on foreign policy, homeland security and the economy.
 If the concern is about gender being a handicap, then we should be recruiting more women to run for the presidency, so that we can choose a leader based strictly on her agenda, and not her gender.

HEADLINE: Family-Focused Web Sites Become Friendlier

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MOST travel-related Web sites have for years taken a one-size-fits-all approach to family vacations: offer up a few destinations or resorts featuring a few ''kid friendly'' activities, include some common-sense tips for traveling with children, post the latest Disney deals, and call it a day.
 But anyone who has planned a vacation with kids knows that few parenting tasks have stakes as high as this, especially if the planning involves a wide range of ages. Articles that treat all kids as a homogeneous group satisfied by mouse ears, pizza and sand castles fall woefully short.
Some travel-related Web sites, though, are starting to fill the breach. WeJustGotBack.com was introduced in February, bringing to the market an authoritative voice on family trip planning. GoCityKids.com recently expanded its site to cover 20 cities, up from 13, and at TripAdvisor.com, which harnesses the collective voice of thousands of travelers, family-vacation tools are being refined. 
 These initiatives, along with a growing inventory of family-related articles on Expedia, SmarterTravel, About.com's Travel With Kids section and lesser-known sites like FamilyTravelForum.com could well ease the dread with which many parents approach the summer vacation season.
 ''Online planning for family vacations is getting better, as it needs to,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology research firm. ''This is an enormous market, and it hasn't been effectively served until recently.''
 According to a Forrester survey last year of people who have used the Web to search for travel-related services, 25 percent take vacations with their children. Over all, 37 percent of leisure travelers in the United States who take vacations of four or more days bring along kids under age 18.
 The most recent addition to the family vacation category, WeJustGotBack.com, is largely the product of Suzanne Rowan Kelleher, the former Europe editor for the defunct Travel Holiday magazine. Ms. Kelleher, the Web site's cofounder and editor in chief, writes each of the site's destination reviews with a depth often missing from articles on sites like TravelForKids.com and TravelWithYourKids.com. Each starts off by grading the destination and suggesting the best children's age group for the trip. Articles then give details about recommended places to eat, night life, accommodations and, of course, children's activities. (You must register before browsing the site.) The site recently added a ''search by child's age'' feature.
 Ms. Kelleher recruits families to fill out extensive questionnaires during their vacations, then culls those notes into a no-holds-barred evaluation. For instance the Club Med Sandpiper in Port St. Lucie, Fla., earned a B+ rating over all (they deemed the food ''excellent''), but its Junior Club Med program earned poor marks. The week the site's reviewers visited with their 13-year-old and twin 10-year-olds, the Junior program lacked a designated staff member. ''This was presumably due to understaffing, but inexcusable in any case,'' the review read. If only there were more reviews to read. The site produces three to five new articles a month and had posted a dozen or so reviews as of early May. 
 The same goes for TripAdvisor.com, the second most popular travel Web site (after Expedia.com), which posts traveler reviews of hotels and vacation destinations. According to Michele Perry, a TripAdvisor spokeswoman, the company will offer a feature later this year that allows users to sift through the site's four million reviews and opinions and find those best suited to families. 
 That feature would piggyback on another service introduced last year, in which reviewers issue ratings according to how suitable a place is for certain types of travelers. (''Families with teens'' and ''families with small children'' are among the categories listed.)
 Difficult though they may be at the moment to sort, TripAdvisor's ratings are still useful for family-trip planners. Ms. Perry would not say how many people contribute reviews, but the site boasts 3.5 million registered users and, according to some analysts, offers the most traveler reviews online. Flawed hotels and resorts rarely escape unnoticed, and because reviewers tackle a seemingly infinite range of topics, one can often find reviews by someone with a family makeup similar to one's own.
 Some mainstream sites that rely more heavily on staff-written articles are worth a detour -- most notably, Expedia.com and SmarterTravel.com. (Travelocity doesn't have a section devoted to family travel, and Orbitz provides just a modicum of such information.) Expedia, SmarterTravel and TripAdvisor also allow users to book directly on the site or click on a link to find a booking engine. 
 ON Expedia's Family Travel section, found under the ''Shop by Theme'' window on the home page, parents can browse three types of kid-friendly destinations: budget, luxury and all-inclusive resorts. Each section provides overviews, suggested hotels and user reviews, including some frank assessments of the hotels' weaknesses. In late April, a review of the Buena Vista Palace at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, for example, cited a dirty room with ''damp bedding and damp floors.'' 
 ''Not impressed,'' the reviewer wrote. ''Would not go back.'' 
 SmarterTravel, meanwhile, is useful not only for an ''Editors' Family Travel Deals'' section filled with bargains turned up by the site's staff, but also for its ''Taking the Kids'' articles by Eileen Ogintz (click on ''Travel Advice''). That section features dozens of well-written articles on a wide variety of topics -- some related to specific destinations (like ''Kid-Friendly'' San Francisco), others related to activities (like ''Visiting a Spa With Your Teen'').
 Some lesser-known sites can also yield critical information, depending on your target city. Take GoCityKids.com, which was bought by Nickelodeon late last year. The site focuses on 20 different cities in the United States, listing family-friendly accommodations and restaurants, safe playgrounds and ''non-touristy attractions.''
 In the ''Parks and Playgrounds'' section of the San Diego guide, for instance, GoCityKids offers a review of the La Jolla Recreation Center, including a range of activities for various age groups, hours, prices and contact information. At the end of the review is a tip for parents who might not think of everything when they mobilize the family for a day's outing: ''The playgrounds tend to get very hot and there is little shaded area,'' GoCityKids points out. ''Bring hats for the kids and wear sunscreen.''

 BODY:
I am told that the Star Alliance has great deals on round-the-world fares. How can I get information on this? -- Y. J. Kim, Toms River, N.J.
 
 The three main airline alliances -- Star Alliance (www.staralliance.com, with 18 carriers, including United, Singapore, Lufthansa, Air New Zealand), Oneworld (www.oneworld.com, with 8 carriers, including American, British Airways and Qantas) and Skyteam.com (10 carriers, including Continental, Delta, Air France, KLM and Alitalia) -- offer round-the-world opportunities with a raft of options, based on the number of continents visited or miles traveled. Prices depend on itinerary (a Northern Hemisphere routing traveling east or west taking in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok or Tokyo will cost about 30 percent less than a southern routing via Australia or the South Pacific) and the number of stopovers.
 Most alliance round-the-world trips are made with two airlines; for example, British Airways across the Atlantic to a variety of gateways and on to Sydney, and Qantas back home across the Pacific. 
 You must travel in a continuous direction with no backtracking, stay away at least 10 days, and make at least three stopovers. You can often buy your ticket at any time before you depart and change the dates of most flights and even destination cities for a fee. The tickets are typically valid for one year; usually allowing two stopovers in Asia, two in the Pacific and three in North America. Compare prices and conditions for the places you want to go. Travelers can both earn and redeem frequent-flier miles among member airlines of each alliance.
 Round-the-world tickets, like most multisector trips, are too complicated to book online. Check out the options on an airline alliance site, then call a member airline or a travel agent to make reservations. 
 If you already need to fly halfway around the world, it makes sense to fly all the way around on a ticket that can save up to 40 percent on the cost of a conventional round-trip fare. (Fly westward and you beat jet lag because you extend your natural day, whereas flying east, you exacerbate it by shortening your natural night.)
 In general, expect to pay from $2,400 for a ticket in economy class, $7,000 in business class and $12,000 in first. Travelers who make at least one trip a year to Europe or Asia may want to buy a round-the-world fare somewhere along the way, which could save 30 percent over buying in the United States. Thus if you were to fly to London, you would need a ticket to get there; but though you end your itinerary back in, say, New York, you would normally have 12 months in which to use the part of the ticket to return to London.

HEADLINE: Summer Bargains Seek to Fill Ships Sailing in Europe 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
Weak demand for some European sailings is leading to some deep discounts for summer cruises in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe. 
 Earlier this month, Holland America Line, which has five ships in Europe this year, one more than in 2005, cut prices by 30 percent or more off brochure rates on four Baltic cruises departing May through September. For example, most of its 12-day Best of the Baltic voyage on the Rotterdam, right, sailing from London to Copenhagen in June and July, now start at $1,499 a person based on double occupancy, down from $2,349. Information: 877-724-5425; www.hollandamerica.com.
For its 15 inaugural Seven Seas Voyager cruises in Europe, Regent Seven Seas Cruises (formerly Radisson Seven Seas) is offering a choice of free round-trip economy-class air fare from 86 North American gateways, a $499 business class upgrade with the purchase of an economy fare, or $1,000 off the cruises, which start at $3,298; 800-285-1835; www.rssc.com.
 To spur demand on its 10-day voyage from Athens to Barcelona beginning June 21 on the Silver Wind, Silversea Cruises cut the price by 40 percent, starting at $4,527 a person; 877-215-9986; www.silversea.com.

HEADLINE: Caviar Dreams

BYLINE: By Christopher S. Stewart

 BODY:
It's 1:30 in the morning, and reality is really starting to blur. Inside the sprawling 19th-century mansion that was once the home of a Russian trade mogul and now houses the club XIII, scantily clad women in razor heels and would-be oil oligarchs in fancy suits groove to house music in shattered rainbow light. Tomorrow is so far away from this glitzed-out place.
Garey Tchagleysean, the club's American owner, raises a Champagne glass to his lips, loving what he sees. Standing at the edge of the convulsing dance floor, he sports a blue suit with knife-sharp creases in the pants, to go with the sinister smile permanently plastered on his very round face. It's Saturday. Supermodel look-alikes in black sell $500 bottles of vodka, while outside a babushka in a kiosk peddles shots for a buck and change. ''People come to get lost,'' Tchagleysean hollers over a thumping bass, as two model types in bikinis gyrate on pedestals above us.
 When Tchagleysean opened XIII in 1998, its outrageousness and glamour immediately drew comparisons to Studio 54. Since then, Tchagleysean has been behind some of the most extravagant and talked-about parties in Moscow, a city that, after almost half a century behind the Iron Curtain, is still new to hedonism. 
 Tchagleysean, who speaks in a sort of lazy California surfer drawl, describes the XIII crowd as ''royals,'' by which he means hip and moneyed Muscovites. Moscow may boast the second highest billionaire count in the world (New York ranks first), but much of the city subsists on about $480 a month. ''We don't just let anyone in,'' he says. ''You're either part of this party or you're not.''
 Models, mobsters, diplomats, tennis starlets, aspiring oligarchs, leggy molls -- they all make their way here at some point. And it's this combustible convergence that, even after closing for two years of renovations and reopening last spring, makes the place feel less like New York in the 1970's than like Chicago in the 20's: glitz, guns and truckloads of green. ''We have to watch out for the guns,'' Tchagleysean admits. ''It's necessary. Because of what's going on in this country.''
 David Morales, a New York-based D.J., has played XIII several times. ''Garey's the man -- the man,'' he enthuses. ''What he has is not some lounge place happening for five minutes. People go there dressed to the nines -- and dance. It's dangerous!''
 Tonight, the club is celebrating Tchagleysean's 39th birthday -- which is actually not for another month, but who's counting? ''I felt like having a birthday party,'' he says. Tchagleysean is making the rounds, kissing cheeks, bear-hugging.
 ''When people are around me, they're feeling cool,'' he boasts. 
 Outside, late-model luxury cars and S.U.V.'s, most with private drivers, are double-parked. A sleek crowd is waiting on the front steps for the linebacker-size security guys in polar jackets to let them through the social divide of the velvet rope. Plebeian or cool?
 Tonight's theme is the Scorpion, for Tchagleysean's assumed astrological sign. And everything is draped in shimmering gold, like a movie set for ''Dune.'' Women in shiny scorpion masks roam the mansion's two floors. On the winding marble stairwell, fey-looking actors in gold gowns and headdresses pray over burning candles and incense while a woman in translucent wings and stiletto heels swings overhead.
 XIII is all about theater. One night, it might be ''The Nutcracker''; another, Mikhail Bulgakov's novel ''The Master and Margarita''; and another, the orgy scene from Stanley Kubrick's movie ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' complete with some actors dressed in black cloaks and others naked but for their feather masks. For gangster night, Tchagleysean hauled in vintage cars from the 30's and dressed actors in period costumes with toy machine guns. ''People are always asking me, 'What are you going to do next?''' he says.
 Tchagleysean is short and stocky, and when he moves, his thick shoulders roll like a wrestler setting up for a match. Born in Armenia, he is an American citizen and got his start after high school in Southern California, promoting parties in the 1980's at the Roxy and Vertigo in Los Angeles. When the L.A. scene dimmed, he headed to Moscow, first as a tourist and then as an itinerant lunch-truck owner who served up hamburgers and hot dogs.
 He set up the promotion company Organized Kaos and then opened Papa John's (now known simply as Papa's), a restaurant at the city's center with a music space downstairs. Minutes before the Russian economy tanked in 1998, he bought the decrepit yellow two-story mansion across the street, built sometime in the 19th century by one of Russia's richest merchant families. XIII was named for its address, 13 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa. ''I also liked the idea of the number 13, a kind of secret society,'' he says.
 When he opened the club, he charged entry fees upward of $40, which were then unheard of. And unlike in the egalitarian days of Communism, there was a highly selective door policy, which persists today. Tchagleysean offered weekly masquerades and sometimes brought in real circus performers. Props were borrowed from the national opera house or local movie studios. Major D.J. acts like Fatboy Slim, Paul Oakenfold and Sasha & Digweed came to XIII before they played any other spot in Russia, he says.
 The dance floor, half the size of a basketball court, is lighted by a cascading crystal chandelier. At each end are swishy V.I.P. rooms with leather banquettes. After long nights in the summer, the party usually spills out onto the balconies. When Tchagleysean decided that it was time to close the place down in 2003, people were stunned. But after extensive renovations, he reopened last May, and unveiled his new idea: burlesque nights.
 Almost every month, Tchagleysean brings in burlesque and cabaret stars, mainly from Britain, with names like Lucifire, Empress Stah and Kittie Klaw. Shows feature whips, chains, leather and fire. Tchagleysean describes it as a sexual revolution, where anything goes. ''I'm teaching the city about new things,'' he says with a laugh.
 It's close to 4 a.m. now. In a V.I.P. banquette, a guy is laid out on his girlfriend's lap, completely intoxicated. A new D.J. is just coming on, the third of the night.
 ''What we do here is illegal,'' one reveler with a girl on his arm says to me.
 ''What?''
 He nods toward the crowded dance floor, the nearly naked girls in cages, the pretty ballerinas twirling on the pedestals. He laughs. ''You can't do 
 this in America,'' he says, getting up real close to my ear, as if he's about to tell a secret. ''You understand? 
 We're having fun.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Houses, Longer Commutes

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
ON weekdays, Julie Kroloff sets the coffee maker for 5:45 a.m., then speeds through her kitchen in Hopewell Junction, N.Y., and grabs a cup to fortify herself for the long drive ahead. If Ms. Kroloff, a self-employed consultant, is on time, she backs out of the garage just before 6 and makes the trip from Dutchess County to her office in Midtown Manhattan in just under two hours. If traffic is heavy, Ms. Kroloff's 54-mile commute can take two and a half hours or more.
 About the same time, in Burlington, N.J., south of Trenton, Ronny Byrd, a vault custodian for the Bank of New York, boards a bus bound for Wall Street. If the New Jersey Turnpike and the Holland Tunnel are not backed up, Mr. Byrd will reach his destination in two hours.
 In Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Atul Ramayani, a computer analyst, boards Metro-North's increasingly crowded 7:10 express bound for Grand Central Terminal. In all, Mr. Ramayani's commute takes close to two hours, including the 20-minute drive to the station and a 10-minute walk from Grand Central before he clocks in for the day. 
 Priced out of an increasingly expensive real estate market in close-in areas like Westchester, Bergen and Nassau Counties, some workers are pushing their commutes up to the two-hour mark, and even beyond.
 It is the price they are willing to pay to own the home of their dreams, said Alan E. Pisarski, the author of a series of books titled ''Commuting in America'' (the third is being published by the National Academy of Sciences' Transportation Research Board). 
 ''In essence, what this group of commuters is doing,'' Mr. Pisarski explained, ''is contributing to their house payment with travel time.''
 Or as Mr. Byrd, who used to live in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn with his wife, Valerie, and their four children, said, ''We never could have afforded a home big enough for all of us that was closer to New York.'' In September, the couple bought a six-bedroom house in Burlington, 75 miles south of Midtown, for $250,000.
 With the cost of residential real estate rising sharply in recent years, the geographical boundaries of the New York metropolitan area are being redrawn. Bulldozers are clearing farmland once considered too far away for a commute to Manhattan, real estate agencies are opening offices in outlying areas, and elected officials in once-rural communities are being pressured to contain the encroaching sprawl.
 Meanwhile, public transportation providers like Metro-North are adding service earlier in the morning and in the evening to accommodate their riders' changing needs. And many of those riders are changing their routines, optimizing the increased travel time to and from work by opening their laptops and BlackBerries en route. 
 ''They're charging their batteries from the outlets that were meant for vacuum cleaners and our polishing equipment,'' said Dan Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman. 
 Other commuters like Ms. Kroloff who rely on their cars for the long haul to work say that the drive gives them a chance to be alone and to gather their thoughts. ''I can be in my own world without anyone bothering me,'' she said. ''Sometimes when I'm driving, I just let my mind wander. Sometimes, I listen to music. I can create my own space in the car, and that helps me prepare for the day ahead.''
 She and her daughter, Rita, 8, and her son, Steven, 7, moved into a new five-bedroom, five-bath house last fall. It cost around $750,000.
 According to the latest statistics from the Census Bureau, the migration outward and the trend toward longer commutes to New York City intensified during the 1990's. In Dutchess County, for example, the number of people who commuted to the city rose 46 percent in that decade, to 5,798 from 3,975.
 In New Jersey, the number of people commuting from Warren County, due west of Manhattan at the Pennsylvania border, was up 39 percent, rising from 539 in 1990 to 748 in 2000. 
 In New Haven County in Connecticut, the increase was 25 percent, from 1,797 to 2,243.
 But in Suffolk County, the eastern part of Long Island, the numbers increased by only 2 percent, rising to 80,003 from 78,291 in 1990.
 Nassau County to the west and Westchester County to the north are still home to the largest numbers of New York City commuters -- 197,864 in Nassau and 117,839 in Westchester -- although their numbers dropped, by less than 2 percent, in the decade. 
 The Census Bureau has not updated its 2000 figures. But real estate offices and rail and bus lines report that the residential real estate market has been in high gear north and west of Westchester, in southern New Jersey and near Philadelphia.
 It is a trend that Mark S. Jaffe, the president of the Greater New York Chamber of Commerce, calls worrisome. ''If people have to travel so far, how can they still be alert and productive on the job?'' he said. ''Very few people want to commute long distances, but the lack of affordable housing closer in forces them to do that.''

To the North
 Interstate 84, which crosses southern Dutchess County just above the Putnam County line, used to be considered the boundary for most commuters to New York, said William J. Lavery, a regional vice president in Houlihan Lawrence's Dutchess County offices. But that is no longer the case.
 ''Suddenly, the gates have opened up, and half a dozen new subdivisions are going in,'' he said.
 Clearly, the migration to Dutchess is being fueled by the high cost of housing to the south. In Westchester at the end of 2005, the median price for a single-family house was $640,000, according to the Westchester County Board of Realtors. By comparison, it was $342,500 in Dutchess.
 The areas of highest growth in Dutchess, Mr. Lavery said, include Pawling, East Fishkill, Beekman, Uniondale and LaGrange, towns in the southern part of the county. 
 Orange County, northwest of Westchester on the other side of the Hudson River, has also become an alternative for prospective homeowners, among them police officers and firefighters who have been priced out of markets closer to Manhattan, said Greg Rand, the managing partner in Prudential Rand Realty, which has offices in Westchester, Putnam, Rockland and Orange Counties. ''Seven years ago,'' Mr. Rand said, ''Orange was just a rural upstate county, not a bedroom community for New York City. But then people saw what they could buy in Orange for the money, and they changed their thinking.'' The median price in Orange at the end of 2005 was $320,000.
 Rob Parahus, a group president of Toll Brothers, the construction company active in 21 states, has six new developments in Dutchess County, including Arlington Hunt in Poughkeepsie where Mr. Ramayani has bought a house, and another development in New Paltz in Ulster County. Prices range from the high $300,000's to the mid-$700,000's. ''Until fairly recently these locations wouldn't support this kind of development,'' Mr. Parahus said. 
 Mr. Parahus said zoning boards were welcoming to builders in rural areas. But Joan A. Pagones, the supervisor of the Town of Fishkill, which covers 32 square miles in southwestern Dutchess, had a somewhat different view. She said elected officials were taking a tough, although not unfriendly, stance on development.
 ''My first question to a developer is 'How can you make our town better?' '' Ms. Pagones said. '' 'Will you provide sewer and water, a fire truck, a snowplow?' '' 
 ''We're not afraid of growth,'' she added, ''but we have to manage it smartly.'' 
 Toll Brothers recently gained approval to build in the town only after it agreed to grant 32 acres to the Wappingers Central School District.
 In response to the new developments, Metro-North Railroad expanded its train service in April, adding express runs on its Hudson, Harlem and New Haven Lines. From Poughkeepsie, for example, a train now leaves at 4:15 a.m. and arrives at Grand Central at 5:50. And New Haven now has a train departing at 5:12 a.m., arriving in Manhattan at 6:47. Ridership on the northern part of Metro-North's Hudson Line, from Croton-on-Hudson to Poughkeepsie, increased 85 percent from 1990 to 2005, from 2.4 million a year to 4.5 million annually. On the Harlem Line between Dover Plains and Wassaic in Dutchess County, ridership was up 274 percent from 1990 to 2005, rising from 140,900 to 526,000. On the New Haven Line, the increase was 34 percent, from 9.4 million to 12.7 million.
 In order to serve the increasing numbers of commuters from Orange County, which used to be considered ''never-never land,'' Mr. Brucker, the Metro-North spokesman, said, the railroad has contracted with New York Waterways for 10-minute ferry service across the Hudson from Newburgh to Beacon, and back again in the evening. Riders now number 280 a day, up from 200 when service began in January.
 Beacon, on the Harlem Line, is one of the fastest-growing stations in the Metro-North system, Mr. Brucker said, in large part reflecting the increasing numbers of people commuting from Orange. Beacon now has 1,330 customers a day, he said, 45 percent from Orange, and ridership to Manhattan is up 50 percent from five years ago. The first ferry leaves Newburgh at 5:40 on weekday mornings; in Beacon, passengers can connect with a southbound train and arrive at Grand Central at 7:17 a.m. 
 Commuters are not only traveling farther, but they are also getting to work earlier, Mr. Brucker said. ''The worldwide economy means that people have to interact with workers in other countries at different times of day,'' he said.
 And instead of reading or sleeping, commuters are often working en route. Mr. Ramayani, for example, said he extends the workday by using his laptop on the train ride from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central and back again at night.

To the South
 Reports of the growth in the number of people commuting from the outer reaches of New Jersey and from Philadelphia are mostly anecdotal -- there seem to be few statistics to support what real estate agents and builders are calling a trend.
 Orleans Homebuilders in Bensalem, Pa., is expanding its reach into New Jersey, in Monmouth, Middlesex, Hunterdon and Burlington Counties, said Gary Schaal, the executive vice president for sales and marketing. In Burlington County alone, he said, the company has six new residential developments. Among them are Covington Manor, where 4,200-square-foot homes with four bedrooms and three-car garages on one-acre lots are selling in the low $700,000's. 
 Mr. Schaal could not say how many of his buyers were commuting to New York on the buses that run to the Port Authority terminal or by train from Trenton. 
 Mr. Byrd is typical of some of the buyers from New York City who are acquiring older houses in Burlington, said Anna DeCristofaro, a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Elite. ''We're seeing more and more of this,'' she said. ''They buy a place and then fix it up over time as they can afford to.''
 But transportation companies -- among them Greyhound Lines -- reported that ridership has not increased enough to justify added service, said Anna Folmnsbee, a spokeswoman.
 Glenn Petsch, the manager of Coldwell Banker Elite's Cherry Hill office, described the movement outward as the beginning of a ripple effect. ''House prices are causing the move south and west,'' he said, ''but it's not a huge onrush.''
 Michael Galdi, an agent for Century 21 Advantage Gold in Philadelphia, is feeling some of that ripple. Commuters are buying row houses and multifamily houses in the Northwood and Castor Gardens sections of the city. From there, they can take elevated trains downtown, where they can change to Amtrak trains headed for Manhattan, or they can drive to work.
 But Mr. Galdi noted that as the residential real estate market slows, interest in the Philadelphia neighborhoods appears to be diminishing as well, and prices, which reached the mid-$100,000's for attached houses last year, are coming down.

HEADLINE: A High Price in Harlem

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
A SALE on Convent Avenue in Hamilton Heights appears to have smashed the record price for a town house above 110th Street, although the new owner says the transaction may not be all that it appears. 
 A deed filed with the city states that the five-story house changed hands on March 15 for $3.89 million. That would be nearly $1.3 million more than the previous record for a town house in Upper Manhattan.
But maybe not. 
 ''It sold for significantly less than that,'' said the buyer, John Geanakoplos, whose signature appears on the property transfer report below what the document calls the ''full sale price'' of $3.89 million. 
 The buyer is the James Tobin professor of economics at Yale University and a managing director of the Ellington Management Group, an investment firm. In his younger days, in 1970, he won the United States Junior Open Chess Championship, according to an online biography posted by Yale. 
 Professor Geanakoplos, 51, said the deal for the Convent Avenue house was structured with a contingency that could, in some way that he would not explain, result in a lower price than the one shown on the deed. ''That's the maximum price it could rise to,'' he said of the $3.89 million figure.
 He would not say what the contingency was nor would he reveal the lower price. The documents indicate that $54,460 in state taxes were paid at the closing, the correct amount for a $3.89 million sales price. Professor Geanakoplos said that if the price is adjusted, he expects part of the taxes to be refunded. 
 Sam Miller, a spokesman for the city's Finance Department, said that buyers and sellers were required to supply accurate information when reporting sales to the city. ''Whatever's on the deed is the official price,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 The house was owned by Robert F. Van Lierop, a lawyer who has represented Spike Lee, the movie director, and has served as the representative to the United Nations for Vanuatu, an island nation in the South Pacific. Mr. Van Lierop has also gained recognition as a filmmaker, having made two documentaries in the 1970's about Mozambique's fight for independence from Portugal. 
 City records show that Mr. Van Lierop bought the Convent Avenue house for $292,500 in 1993. He refused to discuss the sale to Professor Geanakoplos.
 Two of the brokers involved in the deal, Brian Phillips of Sotheby's International Real Estate, and Shelley Rankin of the Warburg Realty Partnership, said they were bound by confidentiality agreements that barred them from talking about the transaction. 
 The previous record price for a town house sale north of 110th Street was $2.6 million for a house on 138th Street that sold last May, according to Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist at Halstead Property. 
 Listing information for the Convent Avenue house, which is nearly 20 feet wide, said it had eight bedrooms and five bathrooms. A broker who had toured the house said that much of the original detail was intact but that most buyers would want to update the kitchen and bathrooms. 
 Professor Geanakoplos refused to say what his plans were for the house. 

Made to Measure
 TOMMY HILFIGER, the fashion designer, has agreed to pay about $18 million for a five-bedroom house with 4,700 square feet and a swimming pool on Further Lane in East Hampton. 
 ''I took one look and said I'll take it,'' said Mr. Hilfiger, recalling his first visit. ''It's like a resort-type home right on the water; a lot of glass, very modern, very clean, great appliances, great attention to detail. I thought it would be fantastic. It's an ideal location, sitting right on the water, with a pool and Jacuzzi.''
 Mr. Hilfiger said that he expected to close on the house on Monday and that after some redecorating, it should be ready to use this summer. He is creating his own furniture, for both indoors and out, with Jason Lamberth, a furniture designer. ''We went to Bali together and designed a whole line of furniture for the house,'' Mr. Hilfiger said. 
 For the last 15 years, Mr. Hilfiger has spent his summers on Nantucket, where he owns a home. (He also has a house in Greenwich, Conn.; a Manhattan apartment; a Vermont ski house; and an island getaway on Mustique in the Caribbean.) But he has been wishing for a summer house closer to New York. 
 He said his broker, Deirdre Jowers of Allan Schneider Associates, ''has probably shown me all the waterfront in the last few years, and they were either too big, too small, in need of too much work or not my style.'' 
 He came close to buying houses a few times: one deal fell through, he lost another in a bidding war, and one other time he walked away when the seller raised his asking price after Mr. Hilfiger made an offer. 
 The current owners of the house are Robert Marc and William Roach. Mr. Marc's name is on a chain of fashionable optical shops in Manhattan and Boston. Elaine Stimmel, a broker for the Corcoran Group in East Hampton, who was not involved in the sale, said the house was desirable, in part, because the pool is on the ocean side, which is often not permitted in newer houses.
 In April, Mr. Marc and Mr. Roach sold a four-story town house they owned in Manhattan, at 66 Charles Street, for $4.4 million. Robby Browne of the Corcoran Group was the listing broker. 

Changing Horses
 AS the real estate market becomes less frenzied, the competition among Manhattan's top brokerage firms for exclusive sales agreements on new condo developments is becoming more intense. And as the number of new condos entering the market increases, some developers may be showing signs of anxiety when sales are slower than anticipated. 
 Prudential Douglas Elliman this month took over sales at the TriBeCa Summit, a new condo at 415 Greenwich Street, which had previously been handled by the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. 
 The defection comes after the developer of the Cipriani Club Residence at 55 Wall Street paid $500,000 in February to break an exclusive sales agreement with Corcoran Sunshine to shift its business to Elliman. Pam Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said that the agreement with TriBeCa Summit's developer had expired and that Corcoran was not interested in remaining on the job.
 The Sunshine Group, which merged with Corcoran last year, has been a leader in marketing new developments, a field in which Elliman is eager to increase its presence. 
 ''For certain firms looking to build a large book of new development business, they can be less choosy about the projects they take on,'' Ms. Liebman said, referring to her competition. 
 Howard Lorber, the chairman of Douglas Elliman, disagreed. ''They're in a defensive mode, trying to hold on to what they have,'' he said. 
 But Elliman is also feeling pressure. Kathleen M. Sloane, a senior vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, took over sales this month at 823 Park Avenue, a condo conversion that had been an Elliman exclusive. It has about a dozen units, including a $35 million penthouse. Ms. Sloane said only two units had been sold before the developers changed brokers. ''There's a lot of shifting going on,'' she said. 

The SoHo Portfolio
 ANDRE BALAZS, the hotelier and developer, has another apartment to sell in SoHo. 
 Mr. Balazs, who is building luxury condos designed by Jean Nouvel at 40 Mercer Street, has decided to put the loft apartment he lives in on the market. He will be asking $10 million for the apartment above the New Museum at 158 Mercer, three blocks north of the new condos.
 Mr. Balazs paid $5.75 million for the apartment in 2003 and then worked with the architects Enrico Bonetti and Dominic Kozerski to design the interior. 
 Mr. Balazs said he was unsure where he would move next, although he may eventually take an apartment at 40 Mercer. The Mercer Hotel, which Mr. Balazs also owns, is across the street from the New Museum apartment, so he has no shortage of places to stay in the neighborhood. 
 Mr. Balazs's apartment has five bedrooms and about 4,500 square feet. It will be listed with Robby Browne and Wilbur Gonzalez of the Corcoran Group.

HEADLINE: A Corner of Greenwich, but Without the Prices

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
TALK of Greenwich inevitably leads to the price of real estate. The average price of a single-family home here has surpassed $2.5 million. Downtown, now the province of hedge fund managers, commercial space rents at rates comparable to Midtown Manhattan. Upscale condominiums for ''downsizers'' are fetching $3 million or more.
 Frequently left out of this discussion are the comparably nominal prices for property in the neighborhood of Byram, a densely populated, beak-shaped square mile bounded by Long Island Sound on one side and the Byram River on the other.
 Originally developed in the 19th century for Italian, Slovak, Polish and German immigrants who worked the foundries and factories along the river, the community is often more closely linked with Port Chester, N.Y., its similarly postindustrial neighbor on the opposite shore. 
 ''Years ago, there was kind of a conflict where people from Greenwich never wanted to be associated with Byram, and the people of Byram always said they lived in Byram,'' said Michael Bocchino, 34, a lifelong resident of Byram and chairman of its active neighborhood association. ''People here felt slighted because the town put less money into Byram.'' 
 The Greenwich cachet may soon envelope this southwestern corner, however, as local developers move into one of the few areas of town yet to be gentrified. Most recently, the area received a nod from Antares Investment Partners, owner of the opulent Delamar Greenwich Harbor Hotel and other major properties, with the purchase of a large apartment complex in Byram for conversion into million-dollar condominiums. 
 The Byram riverfront is also poised for a transformation, as town planners and the neighborhood association complete a master plan for improvements that include a boardwalk and parks along the length of the river. A 20-unit town house community and marina has been approved for construction on two riverfront acres previously reserved for industrial uses on South Water Street. Called Greenwich Landing, the high-end development replaces a heating oil company. 
 ''This is pretty much setting the tone for up and down the Byram River,'' said John Wahba, a Byram native who is developing the project with his brother James. 

What You'll Find
 Interstate 95 bisects Byram, effectively creating two very different areas, one containing some of the town's most expensive homes, and the other some of its most affordable.
 Above the highway and away from the shoreline, the hilly terrain is covered with modest single- and multifamily homes set on small lots. The narrow, winding streets and closely set houses give this end of Byram a distinctive village feel, and residents regularly walk to the Byram Shubert Library, which serves as the community hub, and the small shopping district along Mill and Water Streets. 
 Below the highway, Byram Shore Road follows the shoreline. This avenue dates to the era of the great industrialists, and their grand ''summer cottages,'' some hidden behind gates, are still interspersed among newer palatial properties. 
 ''I find that people new to Greenwich, and those with new money, have trouble saying they live on Byram Shore Road; they say they live in Greenwich,'' said Kaye Lewis of Kaye Lewis & Associates, a real estate brokerage firm. ''But there was an $18 million sale on that road last year. I mean, this is not for the faint of heart.'' 
 In the village area, residents tend to be fiercely loyal to their Byram roots, and old-timers abound. The large number of rental properties have attracted Hispanic immigrants, some of whom are buying multifamily homes to live in, and renting the other units themselves. 
 Young couples discouraged by the out-of-reach prices elsewhere in Greenwich are also giving Byram a second look. ''This is the only area of town that we could afford,'' said Amy Repik, who bought a three-bedroom home in Byram with her husband, Josh, in December. The couple had previously rented in Greenwich, and spent two years shopping for houses as far up the shoreline as Norwalk. But Mr. Repik, a municipal employee and Greenwich native, was reluctant to leave his hometown. 
 They bought their 1929 colonial for ''close to $600,000,'' said Mrs. Repik, who commutes to work at Gartner Inc., a market research company in Stamford. The tradeoff was a small yard, she noted, but not so small that they can't have a few friends over for a cookout. The planned revitalization of the riverfront also figured into their purchase. The town has allocated about $1.5 million for design and development of the parks and boardwalk. A second phase calls for the addition of trees, landscaping and benches in the commercial district. 
 ''This side of town has been neglected until now, and this is going to bring the value up,'' Mrs. Repik said. 

What You'll Pay
 While the average price of a single-family home in other areas of Greenwich has shot up more than 30 percent in the last two years, ''Byram is still under $1 million for a single-family home,'' said Roberta Jurik, an agent with Prudential Connecticut Realty. 
 Primarily colonials and Capes built in the early 1900's, these small homes start at around $600,000; multifamily homes start at around $800,000. Many have been improved upon over the years. 
 ''You won't see many houses being torn down because they're over the current allowable floor-area ratio for the lot size, and you couldn't replace them with as big a house,'' said Paul J. Pugliese, president of the Greenwich Land Company, a real estate company, and chairman of the town's architectural review committee. The new condos will broaden the housing opportunities in Byram and add a little luxury, he said. 
 The town homes at Greenwich Landing will feature custom kitchen cabinetry and granite countertops, master bedroom suites, three-car garages and 20 boat slips. Priced at about $2 million, each unit will have three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths. The setup is convenient for boaters, said Kathryn Clauss, an agent at Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage. ''It's a five-minute boat ride from there to the Sound, but you're in a safe harbor while your boat is docked in the river,'' she said. 
 Sales have just begun on the converted condominiums at Greenwich Place, formerly an apartment complex known as Putnam Green. Antares is renovating the exteriors of the buildings and upgrading the interiors with new kitchens, bathrooms, flooring and doors. Prices start at $600,000 for a studio and range as high as $2 million for a three-bedroom. Greenwich Fine Properties is handling the sales.
 At Greenwich Shore, an apartment complex completed in 2004, all 55 units are rented, and turnover so far has been minimal, Ms. Lewis said. Situated on a ridge high enough to allow some units glimpses of the Long Island Sound, the apartments start at $1,975 a month for a one-bedroom. The largest unit, at roughly 2,400 square feet, rents for $5,100. 

What to Do
 Greenwich is known for its many parks and beaches, and one of its gems is the 30-acre Byram Shore Park. Located on the Long Island Sound, the park's many shady areas entice picnickers, while the beach boasts the only public swimming pool in town. Public boating facilities have slips for 300 small boats and 90 moorings for larger crafts. 
 The busy Byram Shubert Library offers special programs, from preschool story hours to Spanish-language forums on first-time home buying. The library is about to undergo a $3.8 million expansion that will double its size, providing space for more computers, a community room and separate areas for the children and teenagers who flock to the library after school. 
 Byram's commercial district, once pocked with vacancies, has begun to attract some architects, boutiques and salons. There are also banks, delis, a pet shop, an upholsterer, and a popular restaurant called That Little Italian.
 Shopping opportunities have expanded considerably since the opening of a big-box retail complex with a movie theater just across the bridge in Port Chester. Dining options on the riverfront include Sam's Bar & Grille, which attracts young crowds in the evening, and the Black Bear Grille. 

The Schools
 The Greenwich school system, which rates among the state's highest-performing districts, is a major draw for families. Byram's New Lebanon School is the smallest of the town's 11 elementary schools, with about 240 students in kindergarten to Grade 5. About 40 percent of the student population is Hispanic. The average class size is 18 students. 
 Nearly 600 students in Grades 6 to 8 attend Western Middle School, also in Byram. About 70 percent of the school's students in eighth grade met the state goal on the Connecticut Mastery Test in reading and mathematics in the 2004-05 school year, compared with about 80 percent for the district as a whole. 
 Greenwich High School is one of the largest in Connecticut, but manages its size by dividing the roughly 2,780 students into four houses. The school has extensive programs in music, athletics and the visual arts. Average SAT scores for the class of 2005 were 563 for verbal, and 586 for mathematics. Statewide averages were 508 for verbal and 520 for math. Eighty-eight percent of graduates went on to higher education. 

The Commute
 Byram is the section of Greenwich closest to Manhattan. The 30-mile commute by car can take as little as 45 minutes on I-95, or twice that, depending on the time of day. 
 The Port Chester train station is closest. Metro-North Railroad trains to Midtown take about 40 minutes. The one-way peak fare is $14; a monthly pass is $197. 

The History
 Known by several names since Colonial times, Byram acquired its present name only in 1947. Just before that, the area was known as East Port Chester, which makes sense given the community's economic reliance on the foundries and other industries that rose on both sides of the river during the 19th century. One of the well-known industries was a granite quarry, which eventually became what is now Byram Shore Park. 

What We Like
 This is a truly walkable community with the feel of an old New England fishing village. 

Looking Ahead
 Redevelopment on the Port Chester riverfront is aggravating cut-through traffic, which empties into Byram residential areas off the I-95 exit ramp. ''The trucks rumbling down Mill Street are the biggest issue,'' Mr. Pugliese said.

HEADLINE: Landing on Page 1 With Hardly a Wary Eye

BYLINE: By Byron Calame

 BODY:
AS the old journalism platitude goes, ''If your mother says she loves you, check it out.'' And when there's a story that's likely to make readers go ''Wow!,'' it should be checked twice.
 But such a story still made its way to The Times's front page last month while hardly meeting a skeptical eye -- despite crossing the path of a passel of editors at all levels, including those who run the paper.
The Wow! in the April 25 story was a standing-room-only ''seat'' for airline passengers. An attention-grabbing illustration depicted a standing passenger leaning back against a nearly vertical board and held in place by restraints. The headline couldn't have been clearer: ''One Day, That Economy Ticket May Buy You a Place to Stand.'' And the article explained that Airbus, the giant aircraft maker, ''has been quietly pitching'' the idea to Asian airlines. 
 It turns out this account was wrong. Airbus had abandoned the idea no later than 2004. There was no proof that the idea had been pitched to any Asian airlines. And the 853 passengers the stand-up concept supposedly would fit into an Airbus A380 was the same number that could be carried using regular coach seats. (The bulk of the article, it should be noted, was a solid assessment of seat technology.)
 The problems didn't stop there. Despite an immediate public denial by Airbus, the stand-up seat idea stood uncorrected for a week. And so, as often happens with nearly unbelievable stories, this one took on a life of its own. The concept grabbed headlines in scores of publications around the world and was even incorporated into illustrations on the cover of The New Yorker and on The Times's Op-Ed page.
 What caused this mess? My questioning of most of the key players suggests that numerous factors converged to create an almost perfect storm. But I think a major gaffe was that editors at various levels got caught with their skepticism down, fascinated by the story's Wow! factor. The seat was an idea that they apparently found bizarre yet believable in light of the airlines' continual efforts to jam more passengers into planes.
 The story's inception was ordinary. A Florida-based freelancer, Christopher Elliott, suggested a look at airline seat technology for the Business Day section. He had written almost 100 straightforward travel articles for The Times over the past two and a half years, plus regular first-person as-told-to pieces dictated to him by business travelers who get the formal byline. Only one had required correction. But he had never written for Page 1.
 As Mr. Elliott interviewed airline seat designers and manufacturers, things got intriguing. He came across one source who reported seeing the stand-up seat ''inside an Airbus mock-up'' in 2004 and two others who said they had seen it ''within the past four years,'' he told me. Some sources suggested the concept was aimed at short-haul routes in Asia.
 Getting specific comment from Airbus was critical, but it never happened before publication. Imprecise questions to Airbus elicited mushy responses. And there's no written record to refute the Airbus claim that The Times failed to ask specific questions on whether the stand-up seat idea was alive.
 When the reporter turned in the article, he had decided to lead with the jaw-dropping angle. ''Coming soon: a standing-room-only economy class cabin?'' it began. ''Airbus is quietly pitching the concept of upright seating to Asian carriers on its new double-decker A380, according to aircraft design experts. Such a configuration would allow it to squeeze as many as 853 passengers on a plane -- the maximum that would be permitted -- for short-haul flights."
 The Business Day editor going through the story in the days before publication, Phyllis Messinger, cautiously moved the material about stand-up seats down to the fifth paragraph. But the same essential assertions, while moved around, appeared in the published article. 
 A couple of facts that were known could have raised flags. For one, the article never noted that the reporter was aware that a stand-up seat mock-up had not been seen by any of his three key sources since 2004. That increased the need to get specific confirmation that the concept was still alive and being presented to Asian airlines.
 And the suggestion that an Airbus A380 with stand-up seats ''could conceivably fit in 853 passengers'' should have also raised questions. Just four weeks earlier, an item edited by Ms. Messinger had made clear that an A380 filled with regular coach seats was capable of carrying 853 passengers.
 The article glided through the gamut of The Times's editing process on Monday, April 24, facing little or no headwind. Lawrence Ingrassia, the business editor, and Ms. Messinger decided that morning to give it feature display on the front of the Business Day section rather than use it on an inside business travel page. Mr. Ingrassia's summary of his plans at the daily noon meeting of editors reflected that intention.
 But the interest of the top editors was piqued after Mr. Ingrassia described the story and the illustration of the seat was shown, and the possibility emerged that the story could land on Page 1. The final decision to put it there came at the 4:30 p.m. Page 1 meeting. At some point, the stand-up seat segment was moved back up to the second paragraph.
 ''I had interest in it,'' recalled Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, referring to the stand-up seat concept. ''I thought it seemed like a bold move,'' she said, but one that could be consistent with the airlines' desire to squeeze more passengers into their planes. 
 Did the concept strike any of the top editors in the two meetings that Monday as too good to be true? Ms. Abramson said she didn't think so. But, she told me in an interview 10 days ago, ''I can say now, it should have.''
 The news desk, where experienced editors do a final read of most Page 1 articles each night, had only ''routine questions'' about the article, said Chuck Strum, an associate managing editor. ''The news desk treated this piece as a light feature,'' he said. ''It was a thin piece and seemed harmless enough.'' 
 Yet the news desk didn't question why the final version of the story provided no attribution at all for the assertion in the third paragraph that ''Airbus has been quietly pitching'' the standing-room-only seats to Asian carriers. That assertion turned out to be wrong and had to be corrected. ''In general,'' Mr. Strum said in defense of the news desk, ''we don't assume that the various desks submit articles in which the central premise is wrong.''
 The mishandling of this story continued after it was published.
 Times editors were finally forced to probe the article's flaws more intently when Airbus denied the story within hours of publication. But The Times still left the incorrect story unaddressed publicly for a week. A brief follow-up news story reporting the Airbus denial, and noting that the paper was looking into it, was called for. But such a move was not even considered.
 The May 2 correction did not go far enough in clearing up the issue, and top editors heard complaints from inside the newsroom. So on May 4 an Editors' Note essentially corrected the correction, adding that the article would not have appeared on Page 1 if the paper had known the seat research had been abandoned.
 One victim of the delayed correction was The Times's Op-Ed page. Unaware of the Airbus denials circulating on CNN and elsewhere, the page published an illustration on May 1 that was a parody of the stand-up seat. An added complication was this language in the illustration, which comes from the news article and has been formally declared incorrect: ''It was reported recently that Airbus was considering standing-room-only 'seats' for its planes. '' (There has been no correction of the parody's language.) 
 What The Times really had, without the Airbus idea, was a solid Business Day article on new seat technology. But the article managed to make it to the front page because of the sexy seat. Like other readers of the paper, I enjoy a good Wow! story. I just expect a vigorous skepticism that spurs editors to check it twice.
 That this mess could splatter across the newsroom of such a fine newspaper moves me to be blunt. Times editors at all levels -- especially on the news desk, where front-page and other important articles get a final review -- need to pick up each story with the assumption that the most fascinating anecdote, or even the central premise, could be wrong. Readers deserve no less.

HEADLINE: Don't Give Up the Diabetes Fight

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 When are we going to stop blaming people for their suffering and simply commit ourselves to alleviating it (''Beyond 'I'm a Diabetic,' Little Common Ground,'' ''Cost and Effect'' series, front page, May 17)? 
 Comments like that of a 15-year-old with Type 1 diabetes -- ''I really find it hard to take seriously the complaints of Type 2 diabetics, who, in my view, brought this on themselves'' -- are understandable but misguided.
 An economically privileged teenager has no concept of what it is like to choose food not for its nutritional benefits but for its affordability; cheaper food tends to be higher in saturated fat and sugar, which partly explains the higher prevalence of Type 2 diabetes among the poor. 
 Even in cases where illness is more directly a result of someone's actions -- lung cancer among smokers, for instance -- ill people suffer, and they deserve our sympathy and our research dollars. 
 Politicians would like us to think that there are finite resources to provide good medical care and finance cutting-edge medical research, and thus that we must choose between ''deserving'' patients and those who ''brought it on themselves.''
 When we have seemingly unlimited funds to wage pre-emptive and endless wars, these claims start to wear thin. Where are our priorities?

HEADLINE: 100 Years in the Back Door, Out the Front

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE Texas cotton lobbyist tried to reassure Congress that the tens of thousands of Mexicans who labored in the fields of the Southwest were not a threat to national security. There ''never was a more docile animal in the world than the Mexican,'' he told the Senate committee. 
 Then he offered a way around the political problem the congressmen faced in extending the program that had let the workers in.
''If you gentlemen have any objections to admitting the Mexicans by law,'' he said, ''take the river guard away and let us alone, and we will get them all right.'' 
 They did -- and that was in 1920. Almost a century later, the debate over illegal immigration from Mexico often makes it sound like a recent development that breaks with the tradition of legal passage to America. 
 Quite the contrary, say immigration scholars like Aristide R. Zolberg, who relates the anecdote about the Texas cotton grower in his new book, ''A Nation by Design: Immigration Policy in the Fashioning of America.'' A pattern of deliberately leaving the country's ''back door'' open to Mexican workers, then moving to expel them and their families years later, has been a recurrent feature of immigration policy since the 1890's. 
 ''Things are not the same today, but the basic dynamics do not change,'' said Mr. Zolberg, a professor of political science at the New School. ''Wanting immigrants because they're a good source of cheap labor and human capital on the one hand, and then posing the identity question: But will they become Americans? Where is the boundary of American identity going to be?'' 
 Nearly every immigrant group has been caught at that crossroads for a time, wanted for work but unwelcome as citizens, especially when the economy slumps. But Mexicans have been summoned and sent back in cycles for four generations, repeatedly losing the ground they had gained.
 During the Depression, as many as a million Mexicans, and even Mexican-Americans, were ousted, along with their American-born children, to spare relief costs or discourage efforts to unionize. They were welcome again during World War II and cast as heroic ''braceros.'' But in the 1950's, Mexicans were re-branded as dangerous, welfare-seeking ''wetbacks.'' 
 In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent Gen. Joseph Swing to ''secure the border'' with farm raids and summary deportations that drove out at least a million people. At the same time, growers were assured of a new supply of temporary workers through the ''braceros'' program, which soon doubled to 400,000 a year. 
 The pattern grew during the years between the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the quotas of 1929, as rising legal barriers drastically narrowed the nation's front door. The goal was to preserve the country's ''Nordic character'' against Italians and Eastern European Jews who had begun arriving in large numbers.
 Yet Congress refused to close the back entrance to a growing flow of Mexicans, even though by the lawmakers' own racial standards, Mexicans were even more objectionable than the ''degraded races'' of Asians and Southern Europeans whom they were increasingly replacing in fields, factories and railroad work. 
 A convenient way was found to reconcile the contradiction, said Camille Guerin-Gonzales, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin and the author of ''Mexican Workers and American Dreams.'' No quotas were necessary to keep Mexicans out because they were not going to stay. ''Not wanting to 'mongrelize the race,' but needing cheap labor, Americans constructed Mexicans as 'birds of passage,' '' she said, using the phrase coined to describe Italian immigrants. ''The proximity of the border made that even more believable.''
 The cotton pickers cited by the Texas lobbyist had arrived by way of a program intended to address World War I labor shortages. But as commercial agriculture created ''factories in the field,'' undocumented entry became the norm. Growers pointed out that no willing field hand could afford the ''head tax'' that went with legal entry. And employers regularly cited informal entry as a feature that made Mexicans more desirable than cheap foreign laborers like Filipinos, because they were easier to deport. As one rancher quoted in Mr. Zolberg's book remarked to a Mexican hand: ''When we want you, we'll call you; when we don't -- git.'' 
 The full, brutal weight of that formula hit in the Depression. Roundups of Mexican families in public places, summary deportations -- and well-publicized threats of more to come -- sent panic through Mexican-American communities in 1931. The tactic was called ''scare-heading'' by its architect, Charles P. Visel, the director of the Los Angeles Citizens Committee on the Coordination of Unemployment Relief. It worked. Even many legal immigrants were panicked into selling their property cheap and leaving ''voluntarily.'' 
 It was a time when crops went unharvested for lack of buyers and white families like those in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' poured West, desperate for work. ''They gave you a choice: starve or go back to Mexico,'' a resident of Indiana Harbor, Ind., recalled later, as Roger Daniels relates in his book ''Guarding the Golden Door.'' A Santa Barbara woman said she would never forget seeing trains organized by the railroad transporting families to the border in boxcars. The same rail lines had long been maintained by Mexicans who had settled not only in the Southwest, but in Indiana, Illinois and eastward. 
 ''I have left the best of my life and strength here, sprinkling with the sweat of my brow the fields and factories of these gringos, who only know how to make one sweat and don't even pay attention to one when they see one is old,'' said one worker, Juan Berzunzolo, interviewed in California in the 1920's by a Mexican anthropologist and quoted by Devra Weber in ''Dark Sweat, White Gold: California Farm Workers, Cotton and the New Deal.'' 
 At the other side of the border, Ms. Guerin-Gonzales said, an 11-year-old American-born girl who had been ''repatriated'' from California told an interviewer in the 1930's, ''I would be in the fifth grade there, but here, no, because I didn't know how to read and write Spanish.'' A boy recounted how a Mexican policeman upbraided him for speaking English. But by 1943, with the economy ascendant and employers crying of wartime labor shortages, the cycle began anew. 
 Today, the nature of the deal can no longer be disguised, said Marcelo M. Suarez-Orozco, co-director of Immigration Studies at New York University. ''It's a bad-faith pact,'' he said. ''We can't have it both ways -- an economy that's addicted to immigrant labor, but that's not ready to pay the cost.''
 And Mr. Zolberg said the old resort to mass expulsion is less likely, since the naturalization of millions of Latinos, including those from the 1986 amnesty, changed the rules of the game. ''Mexicans, and Latinos generally are more in the situation today that Italians and Jews were in the 20's and 30's,'' he said. ''They began to have some electoral clout, because there were more people of that national origin who could stand up.''

HEADLINE: The Three Faces of Ken Lay

BYLINE: By Mimi Swartz. 
Mimi Swartz, an executive editor of Texas Monthly, is the author, with Sherron Watkins, of ''Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron.''

DATELINE: Houston 

 BODY:
A FEW years ago -- mid-2002 seems like another lifetime now -- I was researching a book on Enron, and met a company executive for lunch. He was like so many people who worked there back in the good times: articulate, sophisticated, not just smart but astute about people in a way that would make the company's collapse all the more astounding when it occurred.
 The most interesting piece of information he handed me was this: that he would much rather have been stranded on a desert island with Jeff Skilling, the company's brusque chief executive, than with Ken Lay, its well-liked founder. Up close, he promised, Jeff Skilling was good company; Ken Lay was not. 
 The jury that witnessed Mr. Lay's testimony last month and is now deliberating his and Mr. Skilling's fate on a combined 34 fraud charges might not be surprised by that assessment, but back then it was difficult to digest. I had been a Houstonian since 1976, and Ken Lay had emerged from the oil bust of the 80's as nothing less than a corporate visionary. 
 Enron, for instance, was a groundbreaker in prohibiting smoking inside its shimmering high-rise office tower. So when you drove down Smith Street and caught sight of those nicotine addicts exiled to the sun-scorched pavement, the scene seemed to augur something new and advanced -- a better way to live than that proffered by the old wildcatters who liked their whiskey, cigarettes and handshake deals. 
 If there was trouble among the colossal egos of local business leaders, Ken Lay brought them to the table and forced a compromise. If the African-American or arts community needed a hand, Ken Lay -- and Enron -- were there, insisting that a world-class city needed equal opportunity and edgy refinement to attract business, as opposed to bidness. When the Summit of Industrialized Nations was held here in 1990, Ken Lay was the man President George H. W. Bush tapped to make sure Houston put on a good show, and we did. The heat even broke. 
 That was the Early Ken Lay: the guy who knew what was best for you. Certain other facts -- that Mr. Lay drank his coffee only from a particular kind of china cup, that he had a company plane's interior repainted during a layover because he didn't like the color, that in myriad ways he suggested that rules were for lesser beings -- were all washed away in the sea of Enron's profits.
 Once Enron imploded, we had to adjust to a different Ken Lay. The problem, former Enron executives explained, was that he didn't like to tell people no. Someone even told me, with a straight face, that Mr. Lay didn't have a head for business. Mr. Lay had been disengaged toward the end, they said -- he wanted to be energy secretary, or work on a Middle East peace plan. 
 So Ken Lay held on to his public reputation as a good guy. It was assumed that the dark prince, Jeff Skilling, had played him. 
 Then came the tsunami of news reports, investigations and books: the ones that described, in detail, the so-called Valhalla Incident, in which Mr. Lay in the 80's refused to punish two traders who had made illegal transactions because their revenues had saved the nascent company. The ones that contained accounts of all the executives who had warned him in vain that his company was in trouble, not just economically but morally. As we saw the embattled Mr. Lay on TV -- on his way to church, carrying a Bible -- we were left to wonder: is this man an idiot or a crook?
 But if you sat in the courtroom during Mr. Lay's testimony, alas, you stopped asking yourself that question. For those who ascribe to the old saw holding that the personality of a company reflects the personality of the chief executive, well, the win-at-all-costs Ken Lay was there for all to see. 
 As one of his former executives, Mike Muckleroy, noted in his testimony, Mr. Lay tended to shade the truth under pressure as a businessman; and here Mr. Lay was, under pressure again, revealing the impatience, the imperiousness, the ungraceful eliding of unpleasant facts that matched the prosecution's earlier descriptions of his company. 
 When the government lawyers showed evidence of his desperate attempts at self-preservation (tens of thousands of dollars in bills for antiquing trips and birthday parties while his company was tanking; announcing that he was buying more Enron stock while quietly selling $4 million worth), well, Ken Lay didn't look like a guy you'd want to be stranded on a desert island with, especially with one last coconut between you. 
 As the lead prosecutor, Sean Berkowitz, pointed out, the trial wasn't a litmus test of whether Ken Lay was a good person; it was about his character at Enron. Maybe Ken Lay will never be able to see himself for who he was, but by the time the jury took to their deliberations, most people in Houston felt they knew Ken Lay all too well.

HEADLINE: Democrats Endorse Malloy For Connecticut Governor

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 20 

 BODY:
Mayor Dannel P. Malloy of Stamford narrowly won the State Democratic Party's endorsement for governor here on Saturday, prevailing over Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven by just four votes in a bruising convention in which votes were challenged and delegates were openly pressured after the first round of voting. 
 Mr. Malloy won 799 votes -- just one more than the number required to win the endorsement. Mr. DeStefano garnered 795 votes, well over the 15 percent of the 1,594 delegate votes required for a primary. 
Mr. Malloy's victory came as a surprise to Mr. DeStefano's supporters, who had predicted he would lose by as many as 100 votes to Mr. DeStefano, a six-term mayor who began campaigning two years ago.
 ''They said it couldn't be done and we did it,'' Mr. Malloy shouted through a megaphone while standing on a chair in the middle of the convention floor. ''We won the nomination fair and square,'' he said even before all of the technical challenges to the votes had been addressed. 
 A subdued Mr. DeStefano described the vote as a ''new definition of close.'' He brushed aside the loss and advocated party unity. ''The real issue is that people leave here not feeling squeezed or angry with one another,'' he said. 
 The two candidates are strikingly similar. Both are in their 50's, with wives who have the same name. And both of their campaigns have focused on creating jobs, revitalizing moribund cities by reducing crime and spurring downtown development. The men also support a statewide health care system and want to repair an education spending system that relies heavily on property taxes.
 Some supporters of both candidates had expected a photo finish, but many said they were surprised at the closeness of the final tally. ''I've never seen anything like this, and I've been to eight conventions,'' said Larry Brick, a delegate from West Hartford who backed Mr. DeStefano. ''It's very exciting but frustrating.''
 With the victor unclear at the conclusion of the roll call vote, Mr. DeStefano, 51, disappeared behind closed doors with his advisers. But Mr. Malloy plunged into the crowd on the convention floor, pointing his fingers at delegates and reminding them of their promised votes, as DeStefano supporters chanted, ''Don't be a bully!'' Several times, Mr. Malloy, 50, jumped atop a rickety folding chair, fists pumping as his supporters roared his name.
 In one such instance, Mr. Malloy repeatedly shouted, ''Help me! Help me!'' pointing to Adam Feldman, chairman of the Monroe Democratic Town Committee. ''I can't,'' Mr. Feldman shouted back, pointing to his yellow DeStefano T-shirt.
 After the first roll call vote, Nancy DiNardo, the state party chairwoman, asked whether any delegates wanted to change their votes. Mr. DeStefano later said that at that point he was ahead by three votes. Because of delegates who switched their votes and the other votes that were challenged on technical grounds, the vote changes were so numerous that even candidate staffers stopped counting.
 Several here said such a tense battle did not bode well for party unity.
 ''To have the top of the ticket razor thin and have people switching their votes, is not going to set a comfortable tone for August,'' said Tom Foley, a delegate from West Hartford.
 But political observers said a primary had the potential to galvanize the state's Democrats. 
 ''It will probably be a bruising fight but it will keep the attention focused on the party,'' said Gary Rose, a chairman of the department of government and politics at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield. ''Then they'll heal and come together. The Democrats will be able to suggest that theirs is an inclusive party, one that allows for interparty competition.''
 The governor's race is one of two primary contests Connecticut Democrats will decide this summer. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a three-term incumbent, will face Ned Lamont, a Greenwich millionaire cable company executive and political novice, who won one-third of the delegates' votes on Friday night. Mr. Lieberman easily won the party's endorsement for the seat. 
 On Friday before the convention opened, Mr. Malloy announced that he had selected Mary A. Glassman, a lawyer and former first selectwoman from Simsbury, as his running mate. 
 Shortly before the convention ended early Saturday evening, Mr. DeStefano announced that he had selected Mayor Scott Slifka of West Hartford as a running mate. But on Saturday morning, Mr. DeStefano's confidence brimming, he extended an olive branch to Mr. Malloy, offering him the lieutenant governor's spot. He declined.

HEADLINE: Darfur's Fleeting Moment

BYLINE: By Anthony Lake and Francis Fukuyama. 
Anthony Lake, a professor at Georgetown, was a national security adviser to President Bill Clinton. Francis Fukuyama, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins, is the author of ''America at the Crossroads.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
FOR three years, despite the official rhetoric and the growing public support for bold international action to end the first genocide of the 21st century, Darfur has largely remained a neglected tragedy. 
 Until now. With the signing of a peace agreement in Nigeria on May 5, Darfur, in western Sudan, faces a new and more hopeful prospect. Although two of the main rebel groups did not sign the accord, the Sudanese government and the largest insurgent faction did. President Bush's support of the peace process deserves applause, as does Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick's leadership at the negotiating table.
But as recent fighting between the rebel factions makes painfully clear, this significant achievement is in reality a window of opportunity that could close soon, leaving Darfur still more gravely afflicted. If the piece of paper signed in Nigeria does not quickly produce tangible progress toward peace, including protection for Darfur's people from both the government-backed janjaweed militia and the rebels, more than diplomatic momentum will be lost. Deepened anger and despair could defeat future efforts at peace and provide fertile ground for the seeds of military conflict and even terrorism, as demonstrated by Al Qaeda's recent threat to take jihad to Sudan. 
 Last Tuesday, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution supporting the peace agreement and created a team to prepare for a peacekeeping mission that will take over from the African Union force in Darfur. 
 To seize the moment, the Bush administration should go beyond calling for urgency at the United Nations in planning a peacekeeping force. It should also give the government of Sudan a brief time in which to accept such a force. Sudan has said it would do so once there was a peace agreement, but has waffled in recent statements. It must be held to its words.
 Mr. Bush should also now get ready the logistics, intelligence and headquarters assistance that the United States could provide to such a force. Showing we are prepared to act quickly should help persuade the United Nations to move smartly itself.
 President Bush could join President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, who was instrumental in pushing through the peace agreement, in personally soliciting pledges of troops for a United Nations force. While NATO itself will not be accepted by the Sudanese government, why not include alliance members in a United Nations operation?
 And Washington should make it clear that if Sudan refuses to accept a United Nations force, we will press NATO to act even without the consent of the Sudanese government -- including a no-flight zone to ground the Sudanese aircraft that have provided support to the murderous janjaweed. And we would bring further sanctions to bear. 
 While recent sanctions by the United States and the United Nations against four Sudanese men involved in the genocide are a step in the right direction, far more expansive measures should be taken against the high-level propagators of genocide based in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, if they block a United Nations force. Beyond multilateral sanctions, the United States could work with countries where Sudanese officials have assets or hope to travel to impose penalties on them.
 Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis grows more desperate. As the needs grow, money to meet them has dwindled. The World Food Program is halving daily rations to Darfurian refugees to a dangerous 1,050 calories a day. Unicef is being forced to scale back its operations, including its nutritional programs for children. The president has asked Congress to increase food aid to Sudan by $225 million. That request must be put on a fast track.
 And the many Americans who have voiced their outrage at the dithering of the international community should and can act as well as speak -- by contributing to humanitarian organizations like Unicef, the International Rescue Committee and Doctors Without Borders. 
 At the United Nations World Summit meeting last September, the United States and other participating governments agreed that the international community has a responsibility to protect innocent civilians when a government is unwilling or unable to do so. In a letter organized by the Stanford chapter of Students Taking Action Now: Darfur and personally delivered to one of the president's aides last month, we, along with 16 of our colleagues, called on President Bush and Secretary Rice to lead the international community in honoring this pledge.
 A failure of international will has allowed Darfur to bleed into another year of rape, slaughter and starvation. Only strong leadership and urgent, resolute action can save lives before this moment of hope is lost.

HEADLINE: Price Report Sends Stocks Into Reverse

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Stocks plummeted on Wednesday, and despite a rebound on Thursday and Friday, the big one-day slide propelled the major market averages to hefty losses for the week. 
 The sell-off on Wednesday began after a Labor Department report on April consumer prices, which rose much faster than Wall Street had expected. That suggested to many traders that the Federal Reserve would keep raising interest rates, throttling economic growth and corporate profits.
The price of oil dropped nearly 5 percent during the week, closing at $68.53 a barrel in New York. Gold declined more than 7.5 percent for the week, to $657.60 an ounce, and other commodities fell sharply as well. Shares of Alcoa, the aluminum company, fell more than 8 percent, the biggest weekly drop in the Dow.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 236.93 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 11,144.06. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 24.21 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 1,267.03. The Nasdaq composite index lost 49.90 points, or 2.2 percent, to close at 2,193.88.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 5.06 percent from 5.19 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

THE stock markets got spooked last week, falling around 2 percent on fears that inflation might spoil all the fun that equity investors have been having of late. Is the bull market that began just over a year ago a goner, or is it simply taking a breather?
 James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, is a good go-to guy for such a question because he has been spot-on recently about both the economy and the financial markets. In 2002, for instance, he was among the first to make the case that the economic recovery would be stronger than many people thought and that consumer spending would continue to roar along. 
Regarding the stock swoon last week, Mr. Paulsen said that while he predicts an increase in consumer prices -- and interest rates -- in coming months, he thinks that stocks may climb as well. Even if core inflation rose to around 3 percent, as he expects, he said that stocks could shake it off. The bond market, however, is another matter.
 ''I am very sensitive to the fact that this is the first move since the October run that showed a notable change in leadership in the market -- away from small-cap stocks to large, away from stocks to bonds, and emerging markets taking their first hit,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''But while I think stocks are priced for 3 percent core inflation, the bond market is not and that's why it's struggling.''
 A fashionable view among prognosticators these days is that commodity price increases are not seeping into the broader economy as they have in previous periods, making them -- so the argument goes -- less reliable leading indicators of inflation. But Mr. Paulsen demurs. Rising commodity prices do show up in the Consumer Price Index but just not immediately, he said. For instance, he said that we are in the midst of the second broad commodity price climb since 2003. When the first spike began that year, it did not have an impact on the C.P.I. until 2004, causing the index to move from a 1 percent rate to more than 2 percent. ''That move had very little impact on people,'' Mr. Paulsen said, ''because the inflation rate was still so low.''
 Commodity prices rose for about a year after 2003 before they flattened out. The second pop in commodities, which began last fall, is what the markets are digesting now. ''It's not new; it's just that people are noticing this time,'' he said. ''Not only because it's going from 2 to 3, but also, you have a new Fed chairman that says 2 is what he's comfortable with at the high end.''
 This, of course, has the bond market rattled. Treasury yields are well into 5 percent territory, their highest in five years. And because he expects consumer price inflation to rise to 3 percent and maybe a bit higher in the next 12 to 18 months, Mr. Paulsen suspects that bond yields will reach 6 percent in coming months. 
 Core inflation of 3 percent will not similarly damage stocks, Mr. Paulsen said. In fact, the Dow Jones industrial average may reach new highs, in part because companies will be able to dodge inflationary pressures by passing along some price increases to consumers. Forecasters expect the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to earn $85 a share in 2006; that would put the current price-to-earnings multiple in the overall market at less than 15, not an enormous premium. 
 ''Top-line growth in this cycle has been stronger than it ever was in the 90's, and a big reason is pricing has been better,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''If companies could pass on a little bit of these price increases, profits could outpace what people think. We forget that's one way companies made money for a good part of the postwar era.'' 
 Could inflation get out of control? It's a risk, but one that Mr. Paulsen said was significantly blunted by emerging-market economies like China and India. ''I think we're still very much in a disinflationary globe,'' he said. ''One big offset to all the dollar liquidity and massive fiscal stimulus out there is the inclusion of all these other economies and their resources. It's hard to see where you get runaway inflation with that going on.''
 Instead, Mr. Paulsen says that we are likely to encounter cyclical inflation, not secular inflation, as occurred in the 1970's. 
 And what of the overleveraged consumer and his reliance on a buoyant housing market to keep spending? Rising interest rates surely won't help there. 
 ''I share the same fears that everybody else has about how vulnerable the consumer is if at some point they hit the wall,'' he said. ''I just think that's not the most likely outcome.'' 
 Here's how he explains it: In the early part of this decade, jobs were few but consumers survived on mortgage equity withdrawals. Now the home equity cash machine is gone, but jobs are more plentiful. ''The reckoning for the consumer will come after rates have gone up, mortgage equity withdrawal is gone and jobs roll over, too,'' Mr. Paulsen said. ''I don't think that's a this-year event.'' 
 It certainly is remarkable, not to mention disconcerting, how the final reckoning for the excesses of the 90's is still being pushed down the road. The stock market bubble was so quickly followed by the housing market boom that it seems the bill will never be paid. In the real world, of course, the bill is always paid -- it's just a question of when.
 But if Mr. Paulsen is correct, and he has been plenty perspicacious of late, then the United States economy -- and the nation's stock market -- may continue to confound the skeptics. That would give consumers another, much-needed opportunity to get their balance sheets in order. A good thing, to be sure.

HEADLINE: Can the Dollar's Loss Become Your Portfolio's Gain?

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
AFTER the dollar's recent slide, some investors may be feeling a bit like deer caught in the headlights. But if you were unprepared for the dollar's fall, don't panic, several Wall Street strategists say. You may want to react by changing the composition of your portfolio, but fluctuations of the dollar shouldn't be your only concern.
 ''Buying stocks just because of a falling dollar is not a good strategy,'' said Henry McVey, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. ''But buying stocks based on good fundamentals, and getting the tailwind from a falling dollar, that is a good strategy.''
For instance, Mr. McVey said, a weaker dollar would benefit two stocks that were already among his favorites: Aflac, a health and life insurer based in Columbus, Ga., and the energy giant Exxon Mobil. Both companies derive about 70 percent of their sales abroad, and that revenue is worth more in dollars if the currency weakens. 
 Several investment advisers who are bearish on the dollar recommend that investors load up on shares of large domestic companies that derive more than half their revenue from abroad, as well as on foreign stocks and, in some cases, foreign bonds and money market funds. 
 Foreign stocks have outpaced American stocks for more than three years, so many Americans have already plowed money into foreign shares. Individual investors have poured almost $75 billion into foreign stock funds so far this year, according to AMG Data Services.
 A growing chorus on Wall Street predicts further weakening of the dollar, although some people disagree. Since the beginning of April, the trade-weighted dollar has fallen more than 5 percent this year against the currencies of the United States' major trading partners, according to Morgan Stanley. Last Wednesday, a Labor Department report on consumer prices in April alarmed Wall Street, setting off concerns that inflation was rising and that the Federal Reserve would continue raising interest rates. Stocks sold off in many global markets, and the dollar rallied briefly.
 Whatever the direction of rates in the United States, the dollar's biggest woes are still the federal budget and trade deficits, said Richard Bernstein, the chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch.
 ''Global imbalances matter,'' he said. ''The reason it seems like they don't matter now is because monetary and fiscal policy in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were specifically geared to make the imbalances worse.''
 To dampen Americans' appetite for foreign-made goods, Mr. Bernstein said, policy makers in Washington could raise taxes, raise interest rates or allow the dollar to weaken. ''Politically,'' he said, ''it's more palatable to weaken a currency than to raise interest rates or taxes.''
 Mr. Bernstein said he expected the falling dollar -- combined with a cooling housing market -- to dampen domestic consumption eventually. ''When your currency falls, your standard of living drops,'' he said, pointing out that through Wednesday, the price of a barrel of oil had risen about 12 percent this year in dollars, but only 6 percent in both euros and Japanese yen and only 3 percent in British pounds. He said American companies that rely on discretionary consumer spending might feel the brunt of a weaker dollar -- for instance, clothing retailers, cruise lines, automakers and home improvement stores. So he is advising investors to focus on big American exporters in industries like electrical equipment and aerospace and military contracting. Some of Merrill Lynch's top stock recommendations in these industries include Honeywell International, the electronics and aerospace company, and Raytheon, the military contractor.
 Mr. Bernstein has put a heavy emphasis on bonds in recent years. But this month, he sliced his recommended bond allocation to 30 percent from 45 percent of an investor's total portfolio. He now recommends leaving 20 percent in cash and the remaining 50 percent in equities, divided between domestic and foreign stocks.
 Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist for Oppenheimer & Company, is even more inclined toward foreign assets, advising investors to put half of their portfolios into foreign stocks and bonds.
 ''There's been an enormous consumption boom in the United States fueled by leveraging, not from rising real incomes,'' Mr. Metz said. He expects domestic economic growth to slow to something closer to the rate of increase in American incomes, which he predicts will be less than 3 percent.
 Mr. Metz says he likes the industrial sector of the American stock market but does not recommend picking individual stocks. Instead, he suggested buying exchange-traded funds that focus on industrial, energy and raw-materials stocks. He also said E.T.F.'s were the best way to buy foreign stocks; for example, he called the iShares MSCI Japan Index fund a fair proxy for the Japanese stock market.
 Over all, Mr. Metz recommends that individual investors put 25 percent of their total portfolios into domestic stocks, particularly large exporters in the industrial, materials and energy sectors. He recommends putting 5 percent into short-term American bonds, while leaving 20 percent in a money market account. And he recommends investing 40 percent in foreign stocks, with the remaining 10 percent divided equally between foreign bonds and foreign money markets.
 Mr. Metz says American investors typically have 7 to 10 percent of their portfolios in foreign assets. He does not advise investors to go to 50 percent overnight; instead, he says investors should move gradually into more foreign stocks and bonds.
 Compared with his counterparts at other firms, Mr. Metz recommends an unusually large allocation of foreign stocks. Stuart A. Schweitzer, the global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, says it wouldn't be a bad idea for investors to move the dial closer to 25 percent, or even a bit more if they are really worried about a further decline in the dollar.
 But Mr. Schweitzer cautioned that individual investors should put up to a quarter of their portfolios in foreign assets only if they understood the risks, ''and are willing to ride out what could become unsettling conditions.'' Foreign investments can be more volatile, precisely because they are affected by currency exchange rates. Emerging markets can be particularly rough in the short term. With that caveat, Mr. Schweitzer says that he does see brighter growth prospects overseas, particularly in Europe and Japan. He says he is particularly bullish on Japan, where he predicted the economy could grow by 3 to 3.5 percent this year.
 ''Unlike previous bursts of growth that Japan had in the 1990's, this growth is being led by private-sector spending,'' he said. 
 Whereas five to six years ago the Japanese government bolstered the economy with vast public works, Mr. Schweitzer said, this time the growth in private-sector spending is occurring without this stimulus.
 NOT all strategists agree that the dollar will weaken further. Edward E. Yardeni, the chief investment strategist at Oak Associates, says he thinks that the currency may retest its lows from last year sometime this summer, but he expects the dollar to strengthen later in the year.
 ''The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are talking tough, but let's not forget that the Japanese have zero interest rates, literally,'' he said. ''They have a long ways to go before coming anything close to U.S. rates.'' 
 And Mr. Yardeni predicted that the Federal Reserve was not yet done raising interest rates.
 ''If the Fed pausesin June, that's just to avoid embarrassment,'' he said, adding that he believes it may raise rates in August.
 Ultimately, though, Mr. Yardeni's portfolio advice isn't markedly different from that of strategists who expect further weakness in the dollar. Mr. Yardeni said he thought that sector selection was the key to successful investing now. 
 ''I'm not sure that playing the S.& P. 500 index will be a winning strategy for some time,'' he said. The materials, industrial and energy sectors are likely to be among the strongest in the American stock market,he said, no matter what happens to the dollar.

HEADLINE: Duck! It's Another Inflation Number

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF you think you can make it through the week without fretting about another inflation statistic with the power to knock the stuffing out of stocks, you may have to think again. 
 The core personal consumption expenditures deflator is an arcane piece of data, but one that the Federal Reserve focuses on intently. The core deflator measures fluctuations in prices for domestic personal consumption (excluding food and energy). If the April reading, to be reported on Friday, matches the 0.3 percent increase in the core Consumer Price Index, reported last week, the Fed may find it necessary to raise interest rates again next month, said Anthony Karydakis, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.
''We got an uncomfortable reading on the core C.P.I.,'' Mr. Karydakis said. ''Per se it doesn't mean anything; it happens once in a while.'' 
 He warned, however, that ''if we do have another three-tenths increase now, it creates a situation for the Fed where they will have to raise at the end of June; it's not just one noisy number.''
 The core P.C.E. deflator does speak loudly. One reason that the Fed pays special attention to it is that it captures consumer spending patterns more accurately than the more widely reported Consumer Price Index.
 Mr. Karydakis emphasized that he did not expect a 0.3 percent increase and that ''0.2 percent is a better bet.'' The 0.2 figure is also the forecast in a Bloomberg News poll of economists.
 But Mr. Karydakis pointed out that ''very few people were predicting 0.3 percent for the core C.P.I.'' when that number came out last Wednesday. After that report, the stock market suffered its biggest loss in three years.
 Mr. Karydakis cautioned that a more benign climb of 0.2 percent in the core P.C.E. deflator would not ensure that Fed policy makers would stand pat next month -- or after that.
 ''Their finger remains on the trigger, and it is likely to be pulled once again in June,'' he said. ''Even then, I don't think they can remove that finger until they see some cooling in the next couple of months.''

DATA WATCH -- The P.C.E. deflator is included in a government report on personal income and spending. Income is estimated in the Bloomberg News poll to have risen 0.7 percent last month, after climbing 0.5 percent in March. Spending is predicted to be up 0.6 percent, the same gain as in the previous month.
 The Fed may see one sign of economic cooling on Wednesday, when April sales of new homes are reported. A decline is forecast, to an annual rate of 1.150 million units from 1.213 million. On Thursday, the report on April sales of existing homes is expected to show a decline to an annual rate of 6.78 million units from 6.92 million.

HEADLINE: The Fight Against V1@gra (and Other Spam) 

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
TO the antispam researchers at MessageLabs, an e-mail filtering company, each new wave of a recent stock-pumping spam seemed like a personal affront.
 The spammers were trying to circumvent the world's junk-mail filters by embedding their messages -- whether peddling something called China Digital Media for $1.71 a share, or a ''Hot Pick!'' company called GroFeed for just 10 cents -- into images.
In some ways, it was a desperate move. The images made the messages much bulkier than simple text messages, so the spammers were using more bandwidth to churn out fewer spams. But they also knew that, to filters scanning for telltale spam words in the text of e-mail messages, a picture of the words ''Hot Stox!!'' is significantly different from the words themselves.
 So the bulk e-mailers behind this campaign seemed to calculate that they had a good chance of slipping their stock pitches past spam defenses to land in the in-boxes of prospective customers. 
 It worked, but only briefly. Antispam developers at MessageLabs, one of several companies that essentially reroute their clients' e-mail traffic through proprietary spam-scrubbing servers before delivering it, quickly developed a ''checksum,'' or fingerprint, for the images, and created a filter to block them. 
 Advances in spam-catching techniques mean that most computer users no longer face the paralyzing crush of junk messages that began threatening the very utility of e-mail communications just a few years ago.
 But spammers have hardly given up, and as they improve and adapt their techniques, network managers must still face down the pill-pushers, get-rich-quick artists and others who use billions of unwanted e-mail messages to troll for income. ''For the end user, spam isn't that much of a problem anymore,'' said Matt Sergeant, MessageLabs' senior antispam technologist. ''But for the network, and for people like us, it definitely is.''
 Shortly after MessageLabs created a filter to catch the stock spams, the images they contained changed again. 
 They were now arriving with what looked to the naked eye like a gray border. Zooming in, however, the MessageLabs team discovered that the border was made up of thousands of randomly ordered dots. Indeed, every message in that particular spam campaign was generated with a new image of the border -- each with its own random array of dots.
 ''That was kind of cool and kind of funny,'' said Mr. Sergeant, a soft-spoken British transplant who spends his days helping to douse spam fires from his home office outside Toronto.
 During a recent meeting at the company's New York office, in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Sergeant and a colleague, Nick Johnson, an antispam developer visiting from MessageLabs' headquarters in Gloucester, England, expressed both amusement and respect over the sheer creativity of the world's most prolific spammers, who continue to dump hundreds of millions of junk messages into the e-mail stream each day.
 ''It was almost like they knew what we were doing,'' Mr. Sergeant said.
 SEVERAL surveys -- from AOL, the Pew Internet and American Life Project and others -- have indicated that the amount of spam reaching consumer inboxes has at least stabilized. 
 That is true for users whose networks are protected by off-site, third-party filtering services like MessageLabs', as well as those protected by network software or in-house equipment that filters messages before they hit a company's e-mail server. 
 If individual users also have personal spam filters installed on their computers, their in-box spam count can be reduced to a trickle.
 But spam continues to account for roughly 70 percent of all e-mail messages on the Internet, despite tough antispam laws across the globe (including the Can-Spam Act in the United States), despite vigorous lawsuits against individual junk-mail senders and despite the famous prediction, by Bill Gates at the World Economic Forum in 2004, that spam would be eradicated by 2006.
 The continuing defiance of spammers was demonstrated last week when one of them forced Blue Security, an antispam company based in Israel, to shut down its services. The company gave customers the power to enact mob justice on spammers by overloading them with requests to be removed from mailing lists. A spammer in Russia retaliated by knocking out Blue Security's Web site and threatening virus attacks against its customers. Blue Security said it would back off rather than be responsible for a ''cyberwar.''
 While there are some indications that the growth rate of spam has plateaued or even slowed, experts say that spikes are always looming. That is partly because spammers can hide themselves or their operations in countries where law enforcement is lax, from Russia and Eastern Europe to China and Nigeria. Because some spammers can churn out 200 million or more messages a day, and because less than 1 percent of those need to bring responses from naive, click-happy users to turn handsome profits, there is little incentive to stop.
 ''That's really just the daily battle,'' said Mr. Sergeant, who routinely shares intelligence on individual spammers with other antispam organizations and with the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies. ''That 1 percent is the wall, really -- it's the spammers creating something new that we just haven't seen before. And for us it's a matter of how quickly we can deal with it.''
 There is plenty to deal with. Most spam is still just, well, spam: low-rent pitches for stocks and penis-enlargement pills. But there are also the more immediate menaces, including attempts to trick consumers into giving up bank and credit card information -- or the use of spam to deliver viruses and other malicious software. 
 From an industry perspective, antivirus and antispam scanning are virtually inseparable, and MessageLabs is among many companies jockeying to position themselves as full-service contractors, offering to filter, scan, scrub and archive both incoming and outgoing mail.
 It's a lucrative strategy.
 IDC, the research firm, estimates that the global market for ''messaging security'' will grow to $2.6 billion by 2009, from $675 million in 2004. The category consists mostly of antispam services, but also covers outbound filtering -- something that employers now demand and all vendors include, according to Brian Burke, an IDC analyst. 
 IDC estimates that the larger market for ''secure content management,'' which folds in virus protection, Web filtering and spyware protection, will grow to $11.4 billion by 2009 from $4.8 billion in 2004.
 In 2005, about 60 percent of businesses were using software to combat spam, with the rest split between using managed services and antispam hardware, according to Osterman Research, which conducts market analysis on the messaging industry. But the percentage of businesses moving to managed services is expected to double, to almost 40 percent, during the next two years.
 In that context, it may not be surprising that Microsoft recently acquired FrontBridge, the third-largest provider of managed e-mail services. MessageLabs and Postini, based in San Carlos, Calif., have long been the leaders in the category.
 While much growth in this field will be driven by the threat of viruses and other bugs attached to messages, the wave of simple but inventive marketing spam remains a big concern -- and, in many ways, is the harder thing to catch. Consider the stock spam using random dots in the borders.
 ''We actually developed some technology to detect borders in images and figure out the entropy -- that is, to figure out if the border was random,'' Mr. Sergeant said. ''So that was fine.'' Of course, shortly afterward, ''they decided to stop using the borders,'' he added.
 From there, the senders began placing a small number of barely perceptible and, again, randomly placed dots -- a pink one here, a blue one there, a green one near the bottom -- throughout the images. Then they shifted to multiple images, with words spelled partially in plain text and partially as images, so that the content, when viewed on a common e-mail reader like Outlook or AOL, would look like an ordinary message.
 ''There are loads of different kinds of obfuscation,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They've realized that people are looking for V1agra spelled with a '1' and st0ck with a 'zero' and that sort of thing, so they might try some sort of meaning obfuscation, like just referring to a watch as a 'wrist accessory' or something like that. So they say something like, 'Drape your wrist with this elegant accessory.' 
 ''Any way not to say 'Rolex,' '' he added, ''so it's quite cryptic.''
 Sitting in a windowless conference room, Mr. Sergeant alternated his gaze between the conversation at hand and the streams of filtered e-mail subject lines slithering down his laptop screen. 
 The lines were feedback from the company's ''radar'' system, which allows team members to test a new ''rule'' or ''signature'' that they have devised on a slice of the incoming torrent of spam. If the rule is too broad and general, legitimate e-mail messages -- dreaded ''false positives'' in the parlance of spam assassins -- will begin showing up on the radar.
 Mr. Johnson plugs into the radar himself and highlights a common obfuscation technique he calls ''gappy text'': words with spaces between the letters, to fool filters designed to look only for whole words. The example was in a message advertising a work-at-home opportunity out of ''T u l s a , O k l a h o m a .''
 ''That's something that we might consider signaturing, that whole line there, with the spaces,'' he said, ''because it's not very common behavior for someone to want to write like that.''
 Mr. Johnson began reading from a customer testimonial included in the same message: ''I was skeptical at first. I made money. I couldn't believe it!''
 Mr. Sergeant erupted in laughter.
 ''It's a classic joke in our office,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''If it's advertised in spam, it must be true.''
 MR. JOHNSON described another trick that a spammer had recently deployed so that messages peddling Viagra would move into recipients' in-boxes.
 By default, most modern e-mail software can display messages that are written with the same text formatting code used to create Web pages -- known as hypertext markup language, or HTML. Like viewers of Web pages, e-mail users never actually see the underlying code, or ''tags'' used to make some words appear, say, bold or italicized. But spam filters scan this code, too, looking for ''spammy behavior,'' as Mr. Johnson put it.
 In this instance, a clever spam writer slipped a Viagra message past many filters by spelling the word with several I's, then using HTML code to shove all of the I's together. ''Whenever you view this in your e-mail program,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''the letter spacing is set to minus-3 pixels, so it will show all these I's on top of each other, and it will look like one I.
 ''That was quite an impressive one, actually,'' he said.
 And vexing, Mr. Sergeant added. Without a special rule created by the team, it would have been virtually impossible for a machine to examine the source code of a message and determine that this was the word ''Viagra.''
 ''The word appears on screen as it should,'' Mr. Sergeant said. ''But if you actually are examining the HTML, you just couldn't pull out a word from it. So while a computer can't figure out what the words are in the e-mail, the human eyes can.''
 A company like MessageLabs tries to avoid examining messages at this level. Instead, it prefers to stop much of the junk at the door, using what is called I.P. blocking. This prevents the receipt of messages from a particular Internet protocol address already identified as a spamming source. 
 This technique is sometimes frowned upon by Internet purists, because it can punish innocent users by blacklisting a whole range of addresses from a single host. But Mr. Sergeant said that I.P. blocking had become more refined since the early days of spam fighting. ''It's very, very important to us,'' he said. ''It's our first line of defense, really.''
 Still, spammers can often get around this by turning to zombie bots. These are vast networks of personal computers that have been surreptitiously infected with malicious software, permitting a spammer to use their computing power, without the owners' knowledge, to spew or relay spam, viruses, keyloggers, phony ''update your bank account'' messages and other dark payloads.
 Zombies now deliver half to three-quarters of all spam, according to a Federal Trade Commission report to Congress in December on the state of the spam problem. Among the zombies' many advantages is an ever-shifting collection of I.P. addresses.
 Another trump card was handed to spammers just over a year and a half ago, when VeriSign, the security and services company that controls the dot-com and dot-net network domains, unveiled a quicker way to update domain names. 
 Although a boon to people setting up their own sites, the new system decreased the time needed for a newly registered domain name to be activated, to 5 minutes from about 12 hours. That put spammers, armed with stolen credit cards and a willingness to buy and quickly abandon domain names, at a new advantage.
 VeriSign updates its domain information every 12 hours. ''But a spammer can register a new domain and have it live within 5 minutes,'' Mr. Sergeant said. ''So he's got a big window where nobody has any information about his domain. They make use of that window.''
 MESSAGELABS' filtering database tries to discover new zombie bots by studying the behavior of e-mail messages from new addresses. Normally, for instance, a machine looking to deliver a message to another machine essentially says ''hello'' by passing an identifying string of code. Most legitimate mail servers will say ''hello'' with the same string over and over, for every message.
 ''When a machine communicates with us in two, three, four different ways within a small time frame,'' Mr. Sergeant said, ''that makes the sending machine look kind of weird.'' That behavior can indicate ''it's not a real machine, it's just one of these drone armies.''
 Some low-end spamming software, too, may leave characteristic fingerprints -- for instance, the telltale way in which it forges the header information -- that spam fighters gradually add to their cumulative antispam wisdom.
 For all the algorithmic derring-do, however, sooner or later the game turns not on I.P. addresses or software fingerprints, but on the content of the message. It's the approach that MessageLabs researchers like least, but one that spammers constantly force on them.
 Nigerian e-mail scams are a particular nuisance in this regard. Familiar to any e-mail user, these are the ones seeking an advance payment from the recipient to help rescue a deposed prince or to collect a percentage on some elaborately portrayed fortune. They are difficult to weed out because the senders often use Web-based e-mail services like Yahoo or Gmail, so I.P. blocking is impractical. 
 The language used in the e-mail messages, too, is often common enough that no particular string lends itself to safe rule-making; the risk of filtering out legitimate communications would be high.
 MessageLabs has spent a year compiling a database, ''Scam DNA,'' of 15,000 Nigerian scam messages, and used pattern analysis to build a family tree of the scams. It has found that most of the pitches are derived among a few hundred templates.
 ''Scam DNA basically codifies this into an algorithm,'' Mr. Sergeant said, ''where, hopefully, we can detect this going on and find new scams based on the old scams.''
 But even if it works, the amount of spam it would eliminate from the overall deluge would be negligible by almost any measure, and Mr. Sergeant and his team will still be forced into encounters with ''C i a l i s'' and ''st0x'' and ''Viiiiagra.'' The researchers are certain that the last, with multiple I's shoved together, is the handiwork of Leo Kuvayev.
 Mr. Kuvayev is No. 3 on the list of the world's most prolific and notorious spammers, maintained atSpamhaus.org, a London-based watchdog group. The listing is not undeserved.
 In Massachusetts last October, a Suffolk Superior Court judge, D. Lloyd MacDonald, levied $37 million in penalties on Mr. Kuvayev and six other people after deciding against them -- in absentia -- in a lawsuit brought by the state's attorney general, Tom Reilly.
 The suit contended that the defendants, who once worked out of Newton, Mass., and Boston, used ''a complicated web of Internet sites and domain names selling a variety of illegal products,'' including counterfeit drugs, pirated software, pornography and phony designer watches.
 Spam watchers say they believe Mr. Kuvayev is now in Russia -- still very much in business and employing a team of spam writers to continue poking holes in the world's filters.
 ''They must be pretty good HTML gurus,'' Mr. Sergeant said, ''who must really know their stuff.'' 
 Mr. Sergeant said that just two men -- Mr. Kuvayev and Alex Blood, a Ukrainian who is rated the No. 1 junk mailer by Spamhaus -- hammer the world's e-mail systems with five million messages an hour. ''You're talking about being responsible for something like 10 percent of all e-mail on the Internet,'' Mr. Sergeant said, ''from just two guys.''
 Two guys who, along with plenty of others, may keep antispam outfits like MessageLabs in business.
 ''A lot of people would say, 'Why would you want to have these spammers prosecuted and why give information to the F.B.I., because surely you want there to be more spam?' '' Mr. Sergeant said. ''But with the volumes these guys are sending, it would actually help us more if there were less of it.
 ''We're just not going to kid ourselves and say we believe that spam is ever going to go away,'' he added. ''It's always going to be a prob-lem.''

HEADLINE: One Reason to Care About Dividends 

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SHOULD a stock price drop if management chooses to plow profits back into a company rather than pay a dividend? It's an urgent question, because the proportion of the average company's earnings that are paid as dividends -- the dividend payout ratio -- recently dipped to its second-lowest level since 1871. It was lower only in late 2000, early in the bear market.
 A longstanding theory of finance says that we shouldn't worry about how much a company pays out as dividends. But several researchers are not so sure. If their findings are correct, the long-term outlook for the stock market is now bleak. 
The theory that investors shouldn't care about dividend payout ratios traces back to the June 1958 issue of The American Economic Review, to an article written by Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller, then finance professors at Carnegie Institute of Technology. Both men were later Nobel laureates in economics, Professor Modigliani in 1985 and Professor Miller in 1990.
 The professors' argument has always struck many people as counterintuitive. Other things being equal, shouldn't a company's stock become less attractive when it has a lower dividend payout ratio? The professors' response, in effect, was that other things are never equal. When a company retains earnings and invests them in future growth, its earnings should grow faster than they would otherwise. This benefit should more or less offset the negative impact of the lower payout ratio, they said.
 As a result, according to the theory, the only real effect of today's low dividend payout ratios should be to increase the proportion of future equity returns coming from price appreciation and to reduce the proportion from dividends. The overall return should be more or less the same.
 What does history say about this theory? Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, says he finds strong support for it. He contrasts two periods of United States economic history: 1871 through 1945 and 1946 through 2001. The average payout ratio for companies was 67 percent in the first period but just 52 percent in the second. As the theory would predict, the growth rate for earnings per share climbed, to 2.1 percent in the second period from 0.7 percent in the first, adjusted for inflation.
 But Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, a quantitative asset management firm, and editor of the Financial Analysts Journal, argues that we should not place too much weight on Professor Siegel's results, since they are ''in effect based on a sample size of just two observations.'' When the period since 1871 is divided differently, according to Mr. Arnott, the inverse relationship between dividend payout ratios and earnings growth rates disappears. 
 Mr. Arnott and Clifford S. Asness, the managing principal at AQR Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., conducted a study that focused on 10-year intervals since 1871. That study, published in the December 2002 issue of the Financial Analysts Journal, found that lower dividend payout ratios -- like those we have today -- were actually associated with lower earnings growth rates over the subsequent decade. 
 Might these results have been skewed by the marked increase in share repurchases that began in the 1980's, since those repurchases have the effect of lowering the dividend payout ratio? Mr. Arnott and Mr. Asness believe not. They found that since 1980, the relationship between payout ratios and earnings growth rates has been broadly similar to what it was in previous decades.
 A more recent study, focusing on the stock markets of 11 foreign countries, had results that were similar to those Mr. Arnott and Mr. Asness found for stocks in the United States. It appeared in the January-February 2006 issue of the Financial Analysts Journal, and its authors were Owain ap Gwilym, a finance professor at the University of Wales, and Stephen Thomas, a professor of financial markets at the University of Southampton in England, and two Ph.D. students at that institution, James Seaton and Karina Suddason.
 In an interview, Professor Siegel said he found it hard to believe that lower payout ratios actually led to slower earnings growth rates, because that would essentially mean that the management of the average company was doing an awful job investing any retained earnings. But Mr. Arnott and Mr. Asness say that corporate managements often do foolish things with such money. If those companies paid more of their earnings as dividends, they would have to go to the market to raise funds to finance any expansion, making it less likely that they would do something ridiculous. 
 MR. ARNOTT and Mr. Asness point to one more factor: managements hate to cut dividends. As a result, they are unlikely to increase dividends unless they are confident that there will be profits to pay them into future years. Higher payout ratios are thus a signal that management is bullish about earnings growth. It shouldn't be surprising that such companies outperform those with lower payout ratios (whose managements are presumably less sure of future profits).
 Even without a consensus among researchers, investors can draw some lessons from the debate. First, they should place a heavy burden of proof on management when it is considering whether to pay out more of its earnings. Only if its plans for reinvesting earnings are particularly compelling should investors hold onto the stock, Mr. Arnott recommends.
 Second, investors may want to reconsider their confidence that stocks' future returns won't be influenced by today's puny dividend payout ratios. It's sobering that a growing number of studies have concluded that such confidence is misplaced.

HEADLINE: More Than Just Your Standard Classical Hero

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
FOR a few years David Hallberg seemed ever-so-slightly too perfect. He is 6-foot-1, with a body that is ideally proportioned for a dancer -- broad shoulders, narrow waist, long-muscled tapering legs -- and his natural abilities as a dancer are no less evident. Mr. Hallberg, a newly anointed principal dancer with American Ballet Theater, has almost improbably arched feet, a perfect turn-out (the rotation of the hips that is the primary principle of ballet technique), a springy, floating jump and a natural ability to turn. His elegance in motion is reminiscent of noble, refined dancers of another era, like Eric Bruhn or Anthony Dowell, and his delicate features and blond hair are perfectly suited to the ballet princes he was destined to dance.
 ''He is what we call in Russia 'hero-lover,' '' said Irina Kolpakova, a company ballet mistress with whom Mr. Hallberg has worked closely. 
For a while he seemed pigeonholed in exactly that romantic, classical persona. From the time he joined Ballet Theater at 19, in 2001, after a year in its junior company, he was given soloist roles, finding himself onstage with established ballerinas like Irina Dvorovenko in George Balanchine's ''Symphony in C'' and Gillian Murphy in Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' both exercises in classical virtuosity. In 2003, newly promoted to soloist, he danced the prince in ''Swan Lake'' and soon went on to other heroic roles in ballet's traditional canon.
 But over Ballet Theater's last three seasons Mr. Hallberg, who just turned 24, has revealed a grittier side to his dancing, going beyond academic perfection in William Forsythe's knotty ''workwithinwork,'' reaching into character in Antony Tudor's ''Pillar of Fire'' and, most significantly, taking fearless possession of the stage as Death in Kurt Jooss's ''Green Table.''
 ''There had been some fretting that the young David Hallberg, heretofore seen mostly in elegant, even willowy roles, might underplay the commanding power of this creature,'' John Rockwell wrote in a review for The New York Times.
 ''Not to worry,'' wrote Mr. Rockwell, who went on: ''He caught the stiff, scary angularity of Death's movements, like a scythe mowing down souls. He was terrific.''
 In a talk with Mr. Hallberg between rehearsals for Ballet Theater's spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, it soon became clear that a thread of steel underpins his apparently easygoing, all-American-boy personality.
 He was born in Rapid City, S.D., but his family moved to Phoenix when he was 8. At that point, he said, he became obsessed with Fred Astaire and persuaded his parents to send him to jazz and tap classes. He began to study ballet only at 13 -- late for a classical dancer -- after he went to the newly formed Arizona School of the Arts. There, Kee-Juan Han, a former Boston Ballet soloist, recognized his ability and spent the better part of Mr. Hallberg's first year at the school persuading him to begin.
 ''It was very difficult at first,'' Mr. Hallberg said. ''The others had been learning ballet for years, and I don't think I've ever worked as hard as I did during those three or four years.''
 ''The others'' were all girls, and Mr. Hallberg said he was terrified when he first joined a class of male students at a Bolshoi Ballet-run summer school in Vail, Colo. The next summer he was accepted for Ballet Theater's highly competitive summer program and was assured by the company's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, that there would be a place for him after he had graduated from high school.
 But at this point Mr. Hallberg's less conventional side surfaced. Having decided he would like to spend his senior year at a professional institution, he auditioned for the Paris Opera Ballet School, perhaps the ballet world's most rarefied training ground, and was accepted. (No, he didn't speak French.) ''I thought, if you're going away, you might as well really go away,'' he said, laughing.
 The reality was tough. ''There were a few other foreign students when I arrived, and they dropped like flies.'' he recalled. ''We lived in dorms with no cellphones or TV, and I was in academic classes with 11-year-olds because I had to learn the language. It was very hard to fit in. But it was an amazing experience. I learned to speak French, I watched the Paris Opera Ballet every weekend, and I saw a range of work that I would never have seen in the U.S.''
 That year at the Paris Opera Ballet School explains much about Mr. Hallberg's precise, classically pure style and his speed -- unusual for a tall man -- in the small beaten jumps known as petit allegro. It may also account for his unusual economy of movement, as well as his concentration, particularly evident during the company's morning class.
 Like any other dancer he nonetheless has weak spots. ''Partnering did not come easily to me,'' Mr. Hallberg said. ''That is one area where the company has gone beyond being patient. It has taken me a long time not only to become physically strong but also strong as a partner. Having, and showing, a real relationship with the woman you are dancing with hasn't come so easily to me, and it's probably the evolution I'm most proud of.''
 Mr. Hallberg has his share of ''hero-lover'' roles in the ballets that underpin Ballet Theater's run at the Met: in addition to making his debut in ''Cinderella,'' there will be New York debuts in ''Le Corsaire,'' ''Sylvia'' and ''Romeo and Juliet.'' He will also perform the title role of Balanchine's ''Apollo,'' which he worked on with Ib Andersen, a former New York City Ballet principal who now runs the Phoenix Ballet. 
 Any ballet dancer would be thrilled to be dancing these parts, and Mr. Hallberg is no exception. But he displays a certain humility when asked what he hopes to dance in the future.
 ''I fit the classical mold, I've learned that,'' he said. ''But I feel like I'm going to hit a point in my career where I'll want more than the classics. I love where I am as a dancer now, but working with someone like Pina Bausch or Jerome Bel would be an unbelievable experience. You have to be a mature, nurtured artist to work with people who push the limits like that, and hopefully, one day, that is what I will be.''

HEADLINE: Battle for Biloxi

BYLINE: By Jim Lewis. 
Jim Lewis last wrote for the magazine about soldiers on R.&R. in Qatar. His most recent book is ''The King Is Dead,'' a novel.

 BODY:
I first heard the words ''disastrous opportunity'' from a man named Gavin Smith. In the weeks after Hurricane Katrina, Smith worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (he now heads the Mississippi Office of Recovery and Renewal), and the phrase, though it seems like an oxymoron, is apparently not uncommon in emergency-management circles. ''On the one hand,'' Smith explained, ''you've got catastrophic loss. You're almost starting from scratch again; the housing stock is just gone. To some degree, you can step back and say, 'This is a chance to rebuild better than it was.''' 
In Biloxi this past March, the disaster part of the phrase was not just evident but inescapable. The city sits at the eastern end of a piece of land that juts out into the Gulf of Mexico like an upside-down T. At night, bonfires burned in fields and yards; six months after the storm, there were still thousands of tons of debris to be removed, and in many cases the easiest way to dispose of it was simply to incinerate it. By day, the city looked as if it had been on the wrong end of a long war. Entire neighborhoods of pretty coastal homes had been swept away, leaving nothing behind but the footprints of the houses that once stood there, and sad little clusters of FEMA trailers. Mixed in with the rubble were stands of oak trees looking blasted and bare. On both ends of the peninsula, the bridges joining it to the mainland had collapsed. 
 The opportunity part was a little harder to find. A few stores were open here and there amid great stretches of retail wreckage. There were herds of volunteers roaming the quiet streets in groups of 20 or 30: college kids on spring break, church groups from around the country, plumbers, contractors, mold-removal experts -- all pitching in. Before Katrina, there had been casinos on enormous barges a few feet out into the gulf; during the storm, they were heaved up onshore (one of them landed on top of a Frank Gehry-designed museum that had yet to open, crushing it to the ground); afterward, they were allowed to rebuild on solid ground, like Darwinian fish growing legs and coming on land. The two or three that had reopened seemed booked to capacity, full of glazed-eyed gamblers who played the slots as if nothing had ever happened, even as the debris from the old barges was being cleaned up outside. In the lobby of one of them, the Isle of Capri, the racket of gaming machines made it impossible to think; in the lot outside, a stream of vehicles jockeyed for parking. Once you got off the property and back into Biloxi, everything was quiet again.
 Katrina hit Mississippi harder than it did Louisiana, and the destruction there was more complete. If the state has received less attention in the aftermath, that's partly because it has no coastal city the size of New Orleans and partly because it has been less politically paralyzed. Within two weeks after the storm, Gov. Haley Barbour put together a commission to jump-start the rebuilding and asked Jim Barksdale to be its chairman. Barksdale is an Ole Miss graduate who went on to become C.E.O. of Netscape in the late 90's and then came home to Jackson, where he ran an investment and advisory firm. He agreed to head the commission and donated $1 million of his own money to finance it. The Knight Foundation donated another million, and it was up and running, charged with a task of boggling magnitude: 45,000 homes and businesses in three counties damaged or destroyed -- and all of it needing to be redesigned and rebuilt, as Gavin Smith suggested, ''better than it was.''
 One of Barksdale's first advisers was Leland Speed, a dapper man with a vivid manner, who had retired from the real-estate investment funds he managed and had gone to work for the Mississippi Development Authority. ''They want to tell me how it's going to be,'' he said by way of explaining how the M.D.A. interacts with local governments. ''I say: 'I got filthy rich in the real-estate business. Now you're going to tell me something about it?' And then they tend to listen to me.'' Barksdale listened, too, and Speed persuaded him to consider a new way of thinking about cities and how they function, a movement in zoning and planning that emerged about 25 years ago and goes by a handful of informal names -- ''smart growth,'' ''sustainable development,'' ''form-based code'' -- and, more formally, by one: New Urbanism. 
 New Urbanism arose as a reaction to sprawl, the default American landscape of highways lined with strip malls and big-box stores and suburban subdivisions populated by a homogeneous and insulated middle class. The New Urbanists proposed higher-density, pedestrian-friendly communities: old-fashioned neighborhoods with schools and shops, parks and offices, single-family homes and low-income apartment buildings, all mixed together and connected by shady streets and wide sidewalks. Seaside, Fla., was the first real New Urbanist project, and it remains the most famous, in large part because the movie ''The Truman Show'' was filmed there. But the Congress for the New Urbanism, which was founded in 1993 by six like-minded architects, now has 2,500 members who have built scores of communities. Leland Speed convinced Barksdale that the New Urbanists had a vision for how cities should look and had experience designing huge parcels of land. They also had access to hundreds of architects and designers and a knack for preserving land values. ''You see, it works,'' Speed told me. ''It's good. It makes money.'' 
 Speed called in Andres Duany, a founder of the Congress for the New Urbanism and its unofficial spokesman. Duany is a small, energetic and hortatory man in his mid-50's, with Cuban roots and an American education and a rare gift for persuasion: Speed describes him as ''silver-tongued as all get-out.'' Duany flew into Jackson from his office in Miami last September and met Barksdale; they hit it off immediately and went to Governor Barbour, who gave them his blessing. 
 And so it was that on Oct. 12 last year, only six weeks after Katrina struck, about 200 people gathered at Duany's behest in a conference room at the Isle of Capri for the Mississippi Renewal Forum. There were architects from around the country, engineers, traffic specialists and FEMA workers, all mixed in with their local counterparts. Over the next six days and nights, they crashed the project, dividing the coast into 11 communities, with responsibility for Biloxi assigned to Liz Moule and Stefanos Polyzoides, a husband-wife architecture-and-planning team based in Pasadena, Calif.
 As radical as New Urbanism is, its principles are relatively straightforward and easily applied. Most of them are formalized in a book called ''SmartCode,'' a zoning manual that breaks the built environment down into six zones, or ''transects,'' of various densities, from wilderness to urban core. Each transect comes with its own building code, specifying everything from permissible architectonic elements (rooflines, porches, stoop heights) to the width of sidewalks and the style of street lights. Identify the transects, make some allowances for local building traditions, apply the code and, in theory at least, the community emerges. 
 It took six days for the Congress for the New Urbanism to come up with a rough set of recommendations for the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast -- six exhausting and exhilarating days spent hashing out everything from highway relocations to affordable housing. To add local flavor, the architects scoured old books of photographs and put together a ''pattern book'' for builders, portraying traditional Gulf Coast architecture: Creole cottages with gabled roofs and louvered windows, Victorian houses with dormers and narrow-columned porches. 
 When it was done, the plan for Biloxi showed a picturesque little city, with graceful boulevards and pretty streets flanked by neat houses and stately mansions and even the casinos concealed in stylish towers. The Back Bay harbor, where shrimpers moored their boats, had been augmented with a seafood market and a waterside promenade for tourists. A rail line had been moved, and so had one of the bridges. There were parks and squares everywhere and, according to the architects' elegant renderings, tall trees lining almost every road (though, in fact, the hurricane had destroyed many of the city's trees, and it would take decades to grow new ones). It looked like a quintessential sleepy Southern city, or perhaps a parody of one. 
 The forum presented its 11 plans to the 11 communities of the Gulf Coast, and many of the smaller, wealthier towns, like Ocean Springs and Pass Christian, were enthusiastic about adopting them; New Urbanism, after all, reconstructed the kind of life they'd been living all along. But Biloxi is bigger and more diverse: it's perched on the end of the peninsula, so hurricanes roll over it regularly, and the city's casinos generate a lot of cash. Playing posthurricane politics in Biloxi is like trying to sword-fight on a rolling log, and as the months wore on, almost everyone found something to object to in the Congress for the New Urbanism's plan. 
 In East Biloxi, the problem was money. About 12,000 people lived in that part of town, about 50 percent of them white, 30 percent black and the rest predominately Vietnamese. Most of the area is just a few feet above sea level, most of the houses are one-story cottages and most of the people are poor. Katrina came through on a 30-foot surge, destroying about 3,500 homes -- perhaps 60 percent of the housing. 
 Main Street runs through the center of East Biloxi. Tyrone's Barber and Beauty Shop stands about halfway down Main Street. Tyrone Burton has been cutting hair in Biloxi since 1962, and when I stopped in one morning, there were a half-dozen or so people waiting for a haircut or a style. They hadn't seen the rebuilding recommendations, and most of them hadn't even heard about them, so I went back to my car and fetched a copy and showed it around. 
 There were two women at Tyrone's, Renee Scott and Bernice Catchings. Before Katrina wrecked it, they had both worked at the Boomtown Casino, Scott as a wardrobe clerk and Catchings as a cook; each had been making $8.75 an hour and taking home about $6 after taxes -- $12,000 a year for a full-time job and the jobs had disappeared six months previously. I flipped to the part of the plan that covered affordable housing, and they looked at it skeptically. ''Affordable to who?'' Scott said. ''It won't be me, I can assure you of that.''
 ''Affordable to who?'' That's the first question, and the most difficult to answer. There used to be a lot of ways for people to get by in Biloxi: the communities were stable, houses were old and often passed down through generations and rental properties were plentiful and inexpensive. Now that much of it needs to be rebuilt, everything is going to cost a great deal more. I asked Andres Duany what he meant by ''affordable,'' and he said: ''$140,000. We can make a really nice three-bedroom house for $140,000, working with mobile-home manufacturers.'' When I asked Bill Stallworth, a black councilman whose ward includes about half of East Biloxi, he was just as blunt. ''That's not affordable for this area,'' he said. ''Affordability is $65,000 to $95,000.'' 
 Besides, Moule and Polyzoides's plan had come down from above, and it felt like a decree. New Urbanism appeals to a broad group of decision makers -- from conservative politicians, who believe that its old-fashioned approach to neighborhood development helps strengthen ''family values,'' to Henry Cisneros, Clinton's H.U.D. secretary, who endorsed it as an alternative to the obvious failure of towering inner-city housing projects. But it's one thing to build a housing subdivision on greenfield and invite prospective homeowners to buy in if they want to, or to transfer people out of monstrous high-rises and put them into H.U.D.-built row houses. It's quite another to take a great swath of the Mississippi coast, still reeling from the largest natural disaster in American history, and suggest that the whole thing can be subject to a new sort of code. 
 The New Urbanists like to point to their inclusiveness and respect for regional traditions. Liz Moule told me several times that they had gone out of their way to bring local people into the forum. But judging from the list of invitees, that meant ''local designers.'' Movement throughout Biloxi was significantly limited that week, with National Guardsmen stationed along the highway leading up to the Isle of Capri. Any unaffiliated citizen who wanted to stop by would have been turned away, and in any case, a lot of the evacuees hadn't come back to town yet. In the weeks that followed, there were public meetings to discuss the rebuilding, but many people didn't hear about them or were too busy picking through the debris that had once been their homes. Stallworth, the councilman, described a process that was already well under way before any of the residents were asked how they wanted to rebuild: ''It took into account a lot of great planners and their ideas, but not very much from the people. At the town meetings, they pulled out all these plans and said, 'Isn't that nice' and 'What do you think about that?' But the time to ask these questions is on the front end, before you draw up all these plans.'' The working people of Biloxi -- the shrimp fishermen, the bus drivers, the men and women who clean the casinos -- weren't consulted, and there was no way to know what the plan might have looked like if they had been.
 New Urbanism is like Whole Foods: it's meant to be good for you, but it's expensive, at least on the front end, and it comes with a set of cultural connotations that generally play best among the prosperous and the self-consciously progressive. At Tyrone's Barber and Beauty Shop, Bernice Catchings had flipped through the plan, with its spiffy little houses and tasteful storefronts, and said: ''A poor lady like me, what the hell am I going to do with that? Walk by it and admire it? We can't buy it. The white man will always have us pushed to where we have to just . . . go by and admire it and then go home somewhere and eat them old beans and bread and be thankful.'' 
 A number of people involved in the Mississippi Renewal Forum referred to the Gulf Coast as a blank slate, but of course it wasn't, exactly. There were lives and mores at work there, which persisted even when most of the buildings were leveled. There are, for example, several thousand Vietnamese in Biloxi: they came to work on the shrimp boats and stayed to build houses and raise families. According to Uyen Le, who works for a Vietnamese community organization, many of them left behind a world where only poor people walk everywhere and a car is a sign of success. ''That's the American dream: you get your own lot, and you get your own little house, and you get your own car,'' she explained. ''And now you're talking about these walkable neighborhoods, and some people will say, 'I came to America so I could drive.' Some of these New Urbanist ideas don't really match up for this area.'' In the 65-page, 28,000-word ''Reconstruction Plan for Biloxi,'' the word ''Vietnamese'' appears just once.
 In the wealthier sections of Biloxi, the problem was control. Most of the New Urbanists I talked to seemed vexed by the very idea that anyone could disagree with a creed they found self-evident, but the movement does have its critics, especially among architects. They find its principles overbearing and the result sentimental -- a mawkish nostalgia for a middle-class, middle-American life that never really existed and wouldn't be worth yearning for even if it had. To its adversaries, New Urbanism is regressive, authoritarian and hidebound. SmartCode, for example, calls for the regulation of elements that most zoning laws leave up for grabs -- how trees may be planted or what shape windows can be. One section of the SmartCode reads: ''Pitched roofs, if provided, shall be symmetrically sloped no less than 5:12, except that porches may be attached sheds with slopes no less than 2:12.''
 Moreover, the movement can come across as faintly cultish, with converts rather than mere adherents, proselytizers instead of spokesmen and an air of Manichaeism that can seem both self-aggrandizing and somewhat paranoid. Leland Speed, who is neither, nevertheless put it plainly: ''I have drunk the Kool-Aid,'' he said cheerfully. But not everyone drank from the same cup. One city councilman, Mike Fitzpatrick, was immediately suspicious of the New Urbanist style and reluctant to take its commandments to his constituents. ''You know,'' he said to me, ''that's that person's property. I would never say you have to build this way. You can build what you want, because that's the American way.''
 This, too, is the American way, and it served the Congress for the New Urbanism no better: if you want to build anything at all where hurricanes are common, you have to build the way FEMA says. 
 FEMA elevation maps are derived from complex calculations based on past weather events, but in essence they specify how high a house needs to be in order to ride out the kind of storm that might be expected to occur. It's a standard actuarial practice: they figure out what's a reasonable risk and what's a reasonable price to pay for it. Then they issue flood insurance policies -- $600 billion worth, covering more than four million homes -- and pay out claims if something goes wrong. It's been this way since 1968, when the National Flood Insurance Program was established.
 But unlike most private insurers, FEMA has the means to compel compliance. If you live in a flood plain, it's next to impossible to get a mortgage unless you have FEMA flood insurance, and you can't get the flood insurance -- nor, in the event of a disaster, are you supposed to receive federal money for reconstruction -- unless you build to FEMA's height requirements. Around Biloxi, the height had been set at 13 feet above sea level: taking into account land elevations, that meant most houses had to be a few feet off the ground. But that figure was 20 years old, and the weather has gotten considerably worse in the interim. 
 Clearly, the elevation maps had to be revised. So as the Mississippi Renewal Forum started, FEMA mappers began plowing through years of data. What happened next is a matter of some dispute. According to the architects, FEMA held them at arm's length. ''They literally would not give us the information,'' Liz Moule complained. ''They wouldn't even give us part of the information. They were keeping it very close to their chest. They were very cagey.'' 
 Almost everyone else involved in the Renewal Forum disagrees. ''That's absolutely untrue,'' said Gavin Smith, then a FEMA liaison. ''FEMA came up with maps faster than had ever been done before. She just didn't like the information that was being provided; it didn't fit into her way of seeing the world as an architect.'' Todd Davison, who headed the remapping effort, explained things this way: ''We had 20 of our staff over there, discussing flood elevations, working with the maps. We have been straight up with the news on this, that the flood elevations are going to go up.'' 
 At the very least, it was a culture clash, a matter of the architects' energy coming up against the disaster agency's caution. At worst, it demonstrated a certain hubris on the part of the New Urbanists and their tendency to finger-point when things go wrong. ''Initially, when FEMA flew the new maps in from Atlanta, we rejected them,'' Andres Duany told me. ''We said they were graphically incoherent. Then they had a little trouble with a multiplier that had to do with wave action above the surge.'' But FEMA is not a local planning board; it is an enormous federal agency, with a budget of $5.5 billion and control over many more billions in federal aid. It doesn't bargain, and it doesn't yield to pressure from architects. Moreover, the mitigation division operates independently of the response and recovery divisions, and the blame that accrued to the agency as a whole in Katrina's aftermath did little to undermine the mappers' confidence in their own data. Despite what Duany said, the New Urbanists were in no position to reject the mappers' efforts. As Jim Barksdale -- a neutral party -- put it, ''I felt like the New Urbanists were being almost rudely pushy at a time when diplomacy would have been better.''
 In November, FEMA came out with provisional elevations. About two and a half square miles of land, which had once escaped FEMA regulation altogether, was now in the flood plain. What's more, the new maps set the base elevation at 21 feet, which meant that the vast majority of new construction would have to be raised well into the air. 
 Moule and Polyzoides had made some drawings that would take new elevations into consideration, but they also believed they could lobby the agency. There was, for example, the question of the ''submersible'' house. Why, they asked, was elevation the only answer? Why not simply make houses that can get wet? ''We need to design houses that can go for a swim every 8 or 10 years,'' Duany told me. ''There was evidence that such houses exist. They're strong enough to sustain the surge. You dry them out: you move back in.'' 
 FEMA said no. According to Davison: ''Every time we get a big flood, we get people who say, 'We can build a flood-resistant house, which can get submersed and come out relatively damage free.' But the economic damage to that building may not be lessened very much, because the contents are damaged, the drywall has to come out, the electric's gone.'' And again, the architects received little support, even from the people who had hired them. ''Andres was just dead wrong,'' Barksdale said. ''Submersible houses? That's [expletive]. Architects are impractical sometimes.'' In the meantime, he pointed out, people were still living in trailers. ''We need to be putting up some lumber now.''
 It was a standoff, and not one the Congress for the New Urbanism was going to win. Still, Moule and Polyzoides held out; an eight-foot rise in mandatory elevation is an architectural disaster, especially for an area like East Biloxi. No one would want to take a stroll through block after block of shotgun shacks on 12-foot stilts. Who could be expected to want to live there? And anyway, there was the question of cost: according to Duany, raising an 800-square-foot house to the new elevations would add $30,000 to $50,000 in labor and materials to the price. 
 To Moule and Polyzoides, then, the new elevation maps effectively spelled the end of Biloxi, at least in any recognizable form, and as it became clear that FEMA wasn't going to budge from its position, the architects grew increasingly flummoxed -- surprisingly so, for an organization that prides itself on its ability to work within the system. They were furious with FEMA and bitter about the way things had gone. ''You have to start thinking that these people are frauds,'' Polyzoides told me. ''They should have nothing to do with people. They know nothing about architecture, nothing about urbanism. Hell, they know nothing about emergency management. All they know is how to set a standard, and play Soviet-style politics.''
 For its part, FEMA insists that it was simply doing its job: evaluating risk and enforcing compliance in the interests of safety and economic good sense. ''Do you let your constituents knowingly rebuild in harm's way?'' Davison asked. 
 I read him a quote from a Biloxi councilman named David Fayard. ''We survived Katrina,'' Fayard had said to me. ''But I'm not sure if we're going to survive FEMA.''
 Davison seemed genuinely distressed at the idea. ''It's not FEMA,'' he said. ''The Gulf of Mexico is going to destroy East Biloxi. These maps are just representing the risk, and to ignore them only sets us up for a repeat of what we just went through.'' Or, as Barksdale put it, ''God made the elevations, not FEMA.''
 As for Duany, he sounded like Achilles sulking before the walls of Troy. ''What's going to happen,'' he told me ''is that once the houses start getting built and looking ridiculous, or there is a great deal of hurt and pain, and the results of the FEMA decision are clear, then there will be an opening and we can try again. I fully expect they'll come back to us in two years, when people start screaming about it.''
 A.J. Holloway, Biloxi's mayor, has a different prediction. ''I think that you'll see, in 10 years, probably 18 casinos,'' he told me in his office one morning. He is a small, expressionless man, 65 years old and serving his fourth term. I'd heard that he played his cards very close to his chest, and indeed it was hard to tell what he was thinking. But maybe that was just exhaustion; he'd been up since 3 a.m., as he has been every morning for the past six months.
 To Holloway, and those who side with him -- which on any given day includes about half of Biloxi's seven-man City Council and many of the local businessmen -- the casinos are Biloxi's ticket back to solvency and rebirth. So in February, the mayor announced his own commission, with a retired Air Force general named Clark Griffith to run it and Gordon Brigham, from a foundation-backed urban-renewal consulting firm called Living Cities, serving as his chief adviser. They were going to start all over again, and they were lukewarm about the New Urbanist plan. ''There are some good ideas in there,'' the general told me. ''It kind of got off into la-la land, but that's what thinkers and people like that do.'' 
 Instead, the mayor's commission is going to focus on persuading residents to pool their small lots together to make room for sturdy, multi-family buildings, which can exist side by side with vacation condominiums and so-called ''condotels,'' an especially controversial form of development that provides time-share hotel rooms for regular casino patrons. (In a council meeting, one city councilman waggishly suggested that they be called 'ho-condos,' instead). It's an imperfect solution, Griffith admits, but it's the best one available.
 Katrina has delivered Biloxi into the hands of the casinos, and no one is naive enough to believe that it isn't going to transform the town radically, least of all the casinos themselves. When I spoke to Anthony Sanfilippo, president of the central division of Harrah's, which is spending as much as a billion dollars on a Biloxi casino, he was unsentimental about the fate of neighborhoods like East Biloxi. ''Change is going to create some discomfort for people,'' he said, and he went on to point out that Harrah's was expecting to create as many as 3,000 new jobs. But when I asked him where all those employees were expected to live, he replied that casinos, like any other business, relied on market forces to take care of such things. ''You can still have homes that are part of the community,'' he went on. ''It's just not likely to be in the same areas.'' 
 With the casinos sounding such ominous tones, the mayor's commission, in effect, thanked the New Urbanists for their services and invited them to leave. Moule and Polyzoides, having already lost their battle with FEMA, decided there was nothing left for them to do, and they resigned angrily. One designer who was involved in the Renewal Forum took up the Kool-Aid metaphor where Leland Speed had left it. ''There will be some people who drink the whole glass,'' he said, ''and some who just take a sip. Biloxi sipped it and spit it back out again.''
 That would seem to be the end of it, but cities don't die so easily, and the poor, in particular, often find means of their own to get what they need. There's one maneuver left to the residents of East Biloxi, one last remaining move. The new FEMA maps are technically still advisory: they won't become binding until sometime later this year. To be sure, almost all federal aid is tied to the new elevations: if you're going to use taxpayer money to rebuild, your house has to be 21 feet above sea level, regardless of whether the maps have been formally adopted. But if you want to rebuild on your own dime, you have a few months to do so, a few months to put things back the way they were and get grandfathered into the Flood Insurance Program before the new regulations come in and change everything.
 It's a loophole, and Bill Stallworth, the councilman from Ward 2, is exploiting it for all it's worth. Down in East Biloxi, he has a relief center set up in a church on Lee Street: a couple of offices, some telephones, a wall covered in maps and a lot of volunteers. When I stopped by there in March, it was a busy and bustling place: in one room, a woman was coordinating reconstruction projects, making her way through a stack of handwritten forms on her desk while a black-and-white television played silently across the room. A contractor from a church group in Michigan came in; he had just finished pulling a boiler out of a house and was wondering where he was needed next. 
 Stallworth showed up a half an hour later. He's a big man, an ex-high-school teacher with a smooth manner and an abundance of confidence, and he looked surprisingly refreshed and almost deliriously energized, albeit in the way one imagines Davy Crockett was energized at the Alamo. Stallworth is holding everybody off: FEMA and the mayor's commission, the casinos and the developers, while he rebuilds East Biloxi one house at a time.
 We sat in a little room with plywood walls, and he explained what he was doing. ''The gulf and the neighborhoods have been here since 1699,'' he pointed out. ''But FEMA is close-minded when it comes to elevation. They don't care who they displace. It's just, Raise it.'' You could hear the stops coming out in his voice, the controlled outrage and defiance as he cursed a federal agency in absentia. ''So I don't care what they say,'' he continued. ''The fact that these people have been safe for the past hundred years says more than a computer model does.'' In a few months, the FEMA maps will become the new standard, and there's nothing Stallworth can do about that. ''I will meet them at that finish line,'' he said. ''But until then, all bets are off.'' 
 Everyone I spoke to who isn't part of his program expressed a profound ambivalence about what Stallworth was doing. On the one hand, it's the only real effort being made -- and it may be the only real effort possible -- to save East Biloxi, and technically there's nothing illegal about it. If it succeeds to any degree, it will be a triumph of grass-roots urbanism. If, on the other hand, FEMA is right and another storm comes through and washes away all the houses Stallworth and his army of volunteers are frantically rebuilding, it will look like negligence or worse. It seemed as if Stallworth was playing a game of chicken with FEMA, and I suggested as much to him. ''I'm playing a game of survival,'' he said. ''I'm playing a game that says that until you put this gun to my head and are ready to pull the trigger, I can do what I can do to help people.'' But how much, really, can they get accomplished, without official sanction and federal aid? ''We've got 150 homes rebuilt now,'' Stallworth said. ''How many can we get in the coming months? A lot. I may not get all of them, but I'll get a lot of them. And they'll be safe.'' 
 Stallworth is certain, but the Gulf Coast is a very uncertain place. Scientists say the weather there has been getting worse for the past few decades and can be expected to get worse still in the decades to come. Demographers say Americans are moving closer to the water, and oceanfront property is getting more valuable. In the middle stands Biloxi, which has one of the few remaining working-class coastal communities in the country. It's hard to say which trend threatens it more or which is more immediate. At every City Council meeting, another condo project seems to find its way onto the agenda, and the 2006 hurricane season begins in 10 days.

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
COME 7 a.m. the hard-core types have already been and gone, the ultramarathoners in training, the laser-focused triathlete working toward another Ironman, the body-image compulsives and exercise-bulimics with their sinewy limbs and the telltale coating of downy forearm hair. Let us not omit mention of the onetime male porn star, the guy with the bloated Popeye muscles and nipples so distended they resemble elevator buttons: Floor please!
 Most every weekday the Lafayette Street outpost of Crunch Fitness is that place of New York fable, an establishment that remains open 24 hours. Contrary to all the Sinatra hype about the city that never sleeps, sidewalks tend to get rolled up by midnight in most parts of town. Yet while ordinary folks might have long since nodded off watching Letterman or washed down an Ambien and yanked the covers over their heads, gym people can still be found pumping and cycling and sweating at every hour. This I discovered after deciding recently to stage an ultramarathon of my own: that is, to see what it was like to spend 24 hours at a gym. (In two shifts, to be truthful; I tried it in one stint and could not go the distance.) 
My reasons were various, random in some sense and also derived from a decades-long curiosity about a locale social scientists refer to as ''the third place,'' a fixed place in a psychic triangle whose other points are work and home. Gyms figure in the lives of at least the 41.3 million Americans who currently belong to some kind of fitness club. They are places of refuge, escape, self-improvement or abasement and, for those who never get past the sign-in phase, rebuke. Yet, although membership numbers have not stopped climbing in the 19 years since the fitness industry began counting, Americans are slouching ever couch-ward toward epidemics of disease linked to sins the Puritans would recognize, like indolence and sloth. 
 ''The sedentary culture that has emerged in this country in the last 30 years has had a devastating effect on our nation's health,'' said John McCarthy, the executive director of the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, alluding in part to alarming current rates of childhood obesity and also to a creeping rise in the adult-onset diabetes that medical science links to being overweight. 
 Last week, for its third consecutive year, the group sponsored an initiative (www.getactiveamerica.com) in which 1,200 participating health clubs opened their doors free to the public for a day. Simultaneously, association members went to Capitol Hill to lobby for the Workforce Health Improvement Program Act, a proposed extension of tax benefits provided by the government to employers maintaining fitness programs. 
 ''The current tax laws allow for on-site fitness facilities to be tax deductible, but not offsite,'' said Brooke Correia, a spokeswoman for the organization. 
 This perhaps explains the Pilates class held every Wednesday in certain corporate auditoriums. The proposed law aims to make it easier for employers to subsidize health club memberships through tax cuts, thus making a dent in the roughly $77 billion spent yearly on medical problems related to inactivity. 
 As recently as 1987, a mere 17.3 million Americans were members of a health or fitness club. As it happens, that was about when I myself joined a gym in the hope of effecting a personal physical transformation from weedy scribbler to supertoned manly man. 
 Much has changed in the years since then, both culturally and about my suit size. In the beginning the goal was to bench some fairly grotesque poundage. But these days, except among hypertrophied knucklehead rappers like LL Cool J, who recently boasted to the morning radio personality Miss Jones that he routinely benches ''three and change,'' that style of cave-man lifting has dwindled in appeal. Not the least surprising of the evolutions I have witnessed in the gym over time is an almost total alteration in tastes for certain body styles. 
 ''The hulking, monolithic look that was in fashion for my generation seems old now,'' said Michael Manchino, a 49-year-old personal trainer whose clients include the designer Narciso Rodriguez.
 With a low-double-digit body-fat ratio and a pectoral shelf that brings to mind the busts on Mount Rushmore, Mr. Manchino said he gets called Rambo a lot when he travels abroad. 
 ''I dated a guy once who said, 'I don't want to lift weights. I don't want a big chest like yours because it doesn't go with the clothes,' '' Mr. Manchino explained. And it's true that the pumped Armani-clad hustler Richard Gere played two decades ago in ''American Gigolo'' would look more than passe in a skinny suit by Hedi Slimane for Dior. He would look like he'd borrowed Pee-wee Herman's clothes. ''Everybody now wants the retro 70's rock star body, the yoga body, the Jesus look,'' Mr. Manchino explained. 
 Well, perhaps not everyone does. The value of spending a full day inside a gym is that it gives one the opportunity to survey a rich gallery of human types: the male gymbots with their proud bosoms and stick legs, the flesh mountains, the solitary ponytailed hippie who passes hours leisurely pedaling a recumbent bike while meandering through ''Within a Budding Grove,'' the aging rockers with taut bodies and faces like Salvador Dali clocks, the young men and women -- New York University students, at a guess -- in the first flush of adulthood, their flesh firm, their carriages still limber because the ravages of serial hangover, student loan terror and mortgage payments for closet size co-ops have not yet made inroads on their faces and physiques. 
 There are the ramen-thin fashion models, perennially in the company of a personal trainer, a kind of duenna always struggling to spark tiny model brains long enough for them to hoist toy weights and pump out a few effortful curls. There are the Hells Angels with necks as thick as oak stumps, useful for accommodating Gothic-lettered Harley tattoos.
 The corporate koan at Crunch Fitness has long been ''No Judgments,'' a philosophy that in one sense is accurate (all these disparate types actually do seem to get along) and in another is a quaint delusion. The reality is that no one, Hells Angel included, who crosses the threshold of a gym has not at some time been tried and probably convicted in the bathroom mirror by his own private kangaroo court. 
 Clearly it is no longer just women who are plagued with body-image paranoia. If the widely trumpeted feminization of men has demonstrated anything, it is that the world is now a place where all are free to obsess about belly bumps, crepey knees or the cruel Newtonian joke that gravity eventually makes of everyone's aging rump. 
 ''If I could change one thing about myself, it would be the self-consciousness about my body,'' said the quite acceptably fit ''Lost'' actor Josh Holloway recently in Star, which (ahem) I picked up from a treadmill lectern. ''I feel like I'm out of shape at all times,'' Mr. Holloway added. ''Eventually I'm going to have to quit trying to be Brad Pitt in 'Fight Club.' I just ain't that, you know?''
 Who is? This is the question I find myself asking as I wander the ground floor at Crunch, where it strikes me that most of the people one finds in a gym can stand to be there. And there is something bracing in the realization that the gym is not axiomatically a temple of narcissism, a default for the solipsistic, the lonely and the bored. 
 To call the place communal would be overreaching. Yet in the cycles and the confines of a gym are found predictable and reassuring rhythms, familiar faces and also recognizable habits of being. One can set clocks by some of the Type A performers of early morning, the driven, the compulsive, the competitive bodybuilders, 10-egg-white-omelets-for-breakfast types for whom this slot is an opportunity to hoist massive hunks of iron without causing bystanders to huddle in corners, whimpering in fear. One can recognize, too, in the late-night warriors, the hospital workers, taxi drivers or junior lawyers who show up past midnight, elements of one's own need to carve out room in which to pace the miles of a psychic marathon. 
 During my hours at Crunch Fitness -- a place I chose because its demographic profile is more racially and economically various than some fancier spots in town and also, full disclosure, because it is my home gym and thus the place I know best -- I did as one might in assembling a jigsaw puzzle. I put down the edge pieces first and then worked to fill in the center of the image.
 The thicket of chrome and steel, the infinitely mirroring perimeter walls, the ceiling-hung photomural of disembodied animals and people, the purple and yellow and pink and silver color scheme suggestive of a dungeon decorated by the Easter bunny came gradually into focus. 
 Only then could I begin to identify the particulars within the overall scheme: here was the editor of a major city magazine, there the architect who designed 200 Gucci stores. Over on the Roman chair was the sexily scrawny Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha cranking out leg lifts. Skulking around amiably in sweats was the ''Grey's Anatomy'' actress Sandra Oh. 
 I failed to score a sighting of Matt Damon, although I often have in the past, Mr. Damon being an easy puzzle piece to find because his protective incognito is so studiedly anonymous it becomes a form of ostentation. 
 ''He comes in with the knit cap low, and surrounded by buddies, like he doesn't want anyone to notice him,'' said Morena Saenz, an artist whose day job involves pulping bananas, bone meal and other even less appetizing substances in the weary blenders at the gym's juice bar.
 ''I don't know why he bothers since no one's paying attention anyway,'' Ms. Saenz added. ''When Calvin Klein comes in he just works out like anyone else. He's just low-key and famous.''
 Her observation helps tease out the reasons gyms in New York occupy the status they do, as social free zones, leveling places rare in a city where most of us squander countless Gawker hours diagramming the minutiae of hierarchy and caste. 
 At any given moment at Crunch, as I found, one is likely to stumble across a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist drenched in sweat during Matt Pestorius's 6:45 Spinning class or a hedge fund Master of the Universe prancing happily to Marc Santa Maria's hip-hop mixed tapes in a Crumpin' & Clownin' class or a prime-time television hunk, walking half-naked to the showers, a sight that must be related to a recent strict ban on cellphones (with their pesky cameras) in the locker room. 
 The sense that, in the gym at least, all people are the same person owes something to the anonymous universality of droopy shorts and sweat-stained T-shirts. And that, too, is another great thing about gym culture: despite the best efforts of Polo or Dolce & Gabbana, fashion has never yet found a way in. 
 ''What I love about coming here is that it's like my living room and the people who come here are like my little crowd whether I know them or not,'' said Joshua Suzanne, a downtown store owner who spends two hours, five days a week at Crunch before heading to her vintage clothing shop Rags-a-GoGo. With her sailor tattoos, lip piercing, bleached sideburns and lovingly coiffed Mohawk, Ms. Suzanne may not be the most obvious exponent of the gym as a laboratory of Platonic ideals. 
 But there she was last week, exercising her philosophy between sets of pull-ups and arm curls.
 ''All of us are in here going through our changes, getting fat or skinny, getting nose jobs or boob jobs, getting muscles or not, changing our bodies or not, and it's all, like, kind of abstract,'' Ms. Suzanne said. ''But what's cool is that there's this larger thing going on, where everybody is working toward a better self.'' 
 Whether the ideal is remotely attainable matters less, Ms. Suzanne said, than the pursuit. ''The dream is what counts,'' she said. ''If you pay attention, you can watch how the physical changes translate in people's psyches. We're all in here. We keep coming back. For some reason or other, we believe.''

HEADLINE: Is That a Tinge of Green on New York's Yellow Cabs?

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
LIKE many drivers, Israfil Islam is feeling the pinch of high gasoline prices. But for Mr. Islam and the thousands of New York taxi drivers whose incomes depend on driving as many miles as possible, the pain is especially acute. 
 ''A year ago, we still used $20 to $30,'' he said, his speech, 22 years after arriving in New York, still tinged with the cadences of Bangladesh. ''Now, it's more -- now almost minimum $40 to $50 for gasoline every day.''
But some days -- when he is lucky enough to find himself behind the wheel of a Ford Escape S.U.V. hybrid taxi rather than a Ford Crown Victoria sedan -- Mr. Islam saves up to $15 over his 12-hour shift. The savings offered by the Escape's gasoline-electric powertrain are deeply appreciated, because in addition to the daily cost of leasing the cab, Mr. Islam pays for the gas he uses out of his pocket. 
 Cleaner air, not saving money, was the original motivation for introducing hybrids to the city's taxi fleet. The Taxi and Limousine Commission, under pressure from the City Council, approved six hybrid models for taxi service last fall. The first batch entered the fleet in November; there are now 27 hybrid taxis on city streets. 
 While the environmental rewards of an all-green taxi fleet may be far off in the future, an independent driver who owns a hybrid cab would benefit each time the tank is filled. At 36 m.p.g., the E.P.A. rating of a front-wheel-drive Escape Hybrid doubles the mileage of a Crown Victoria cab; with each one covering 64,600 miles a year on average, and nearly 13,000 taxis in the city, total gas savings would amount to tens of thousands of gallons each day.
 The miles gained on each gallon in city driving would also help to offset the added cost of buying a hybrid -- $4,000 to $5,000 more for an Escape than for a Crown Victoria, according to a Ford spokesman. 
 But it is less clear whether hybrids are a good investment for fleet owners. For example, the Escape Hybrid's durability in taxi duty is less well known, while the ubiquitous Crown Victoria is a proven workhorse.
 Evgeny Friedman, who manages three taxi fleets in the city, including the one for which Mr. Islam drives, said saving gas was part of the hybrids' appeal. ''As a fleet manager, I live under the theory: happy driver, happy public, happy fleet manager,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''If the drivers are happy, I'm ecstatic.''
 Mr. Friedman's fleets, with about 650 cars in all, include 22 hybrid Escapes. The remainder of New York's hybrid taxis are two Lexus RX 400h's, two Toyota Highlanders and one Toyota Prius, according to the taxi commission.
 Matthew W. Daus, chairman of the commission, cited the discounted price of taxi medallions for hybrids -- auctioned in 2004 at about $170,000 less than the nearly $400,000 that medallions have sold for -- as one incentive for fleet owners to buy hybrids. He said a decision on whether the discount would be offered at the next medallion auction in June had not been made. Mr. Daus also mentioned a one-time federal tax credit --$650 to $3,150, depending on the model -- for increasing interest in hybrid taxis. 
 Mr. Friedman played down the appeal of those incentives. Since last fall he has added four hybrids to his fleet with full-price medallions, and noted that it was nearly impossible to qualify for the tax credit. Hybrid parts and maintenance, though more costly now, were more important reasons for Mr. Friedman's purchase of the Ford hybrids. 
 ''If I have a problem, I know the dealer to take it to,'' he said. ''I know the engineer to call at Ford. I know the regional guys that will help me track down parts if I need to.'' 
 Another attraction for Mr. Friedman was the Escape's four-cylinder engine, which is less powerful than the V-8 in a Crown Victoria. ''If it's less aggressive, I have less accidents, I have less wear-and-tear,'' he said. 
 Drivers seem happy with the performance of the Escapes. Mr. Islam said that acceleration was not a problem and that the Escape's driver's seat was more comfortable than the Crown Victoria's. The biggest adjustment was the feel of the brake pedal, which activates the regenerative charging system to replenish the battery each time the cab slows down. In addition, the engine shuts itself off at stoplights to help save fuel. 
 Among the few customer complaints, Mr. Islam said, is the Escape's step-in height, which makes it difficult for some passengers to board. Another is legroom in the back seat, which is less spacious. Otherwise, Mr. Islam said, passengers love it. ''The first time they ride in a hybrid, they ask a lot of questions. How's the hybrid? How's the gas?'' he said. 
 Despite the enthusiasm of riders, it is unlikely they would wave off Crown Victorias while waiting for a hybrid the way riders held out for spacious Checkers in the 1980's. Charges for a ride in a hybrid are the same as those for conventional cabs. 
 There are some added costs to make the approved hybrid models suitable for taxi service. Bumper guards and running boards are added to the Escapes, and the dark-tinted side windows are replaced with clearer glass. Because of the limited space in the rear seat, security partitions are not required (though on cars without the partitions, security cameras are added).
 Mr. Daus of the taxi commission said he hoped the hybrid was the first step in the evolution of alternative-fuel taxis. 
 ''With hybrids and other alternative fuels there's going to be survival of the fittest,'' he said. ''No. 1, who's going to give you the best fuel efficiency for your bottom dollar? And No. 2, how is your vehicle going to perform 24 hours, 7 days a week as a cab on the streets of New York City?'' 

SAVING UP SOME HEAT
 Everywhere the Prius goes, a thermos goes along. But this feature of Toyota's pop-star hybrid is not on board to keep a driver's coffee warm. Instead, the stainless-steel tank under the hood stores engine heat for reuse. 
 Each time the Prius's gasoline engine warms to operating temperature, about three quarts' worth of hot coolant is pumped to the tank, where it is stored at more than 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The well-insulated tank can keep coolant warm for as long as three days, even when temperatures are freezing outside. 
 When a cold engine is restarted, hot coolant is pumped back to speed the warm-up, helping to reduce emissions when the engine would normally be at its dirtiest. What drivers will notice most, though, is a heater that blows warm more quickly.

HEADLINE: Saving the Jersey Shore

BYLINE: By Frank Pallone. 
Frank Pallone, a Democrat, is a United States representative from New Jersey's Sixth District.

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, the most serious threat to the New Jersey coast came from medical waste washing up on our beaches and toxic waste dumped in the ocean. Today, that threat comes from something slower and quieter but no less threatening: rising sea levels caused by global warming. 
 A report issued last November by three Princeton University researchers found that global warming could raise the sea off New Jersey nearly 4 feet by the end of the century. Such a rise would put 3 percent of the state underwater and reduce our shoreline by almost 500 feet, meaning that houses and businesses close to the ocean would be forced to move or get washed away. 
This rise in sea level would also come with substantial increases in flooding and related disasters, especially during northeasters and hurricanes. More than 9 percent of the state would be subject to periodic coastal flooding. 
 To prevent this nightmare from becoming a reality, we need a sensible energy policy focused on conservation and efficiency. Conveniently, this approach would also help stabilize gas prices, reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve air quality. 
 New Jersey has certainly taken strong steps toward developing such a policy. In 2001, the state started its Clean Energy Program, which offers rebates and other incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient appliances or other equipment for homes or businesses. More recently, Gov. Jon Corzine signed an executive order to increase efficiency and to lower energy use by the state government. 
 The state has also tried to tackle global warming by passing the Clean Cars Act, which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars 15 percent to 18 percent by 2020. Even better, New Jersey was one of the original states to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a compact among eight Northeastern states setting mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.
 But New Jersey can't do it alone. The looming threats posed by global warming -- and the necessary responses -- are national and international in scope, and they will require leadership at the highest levels.
 Unfortunately, the energy bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush last year demonstrated none of that leadership. It was filled with giveaways to the fossil-fuel industry, but lacked serious measures to develop more energy-efficient technologies or ease our addiction to oil.
 We need to ditch that approach and develop a new federal energy policy that builds on efforts like New Jersey's recent programs. Such a policy would be a critical building block to a new commitment from the United States to work domestically and engage internationally to reduce greenhouse emissions and slow the pace of global warming.
 A critical component of this policy would be to increase the fuel economy of the cars and trucks we drive, which are responsible for nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. If Washington got serious about improving fuel economy standards, you might only need to fill up your car every other week rather than every week. Collectively, then, we would slow the pace of global warming by drastically decreasing the amount of fuel needed to drive the same distances without forcing New Jerseyans to move closer to where they work or make other disruptive lifestyle changes. 
 We also need to make the houses we live in, which are responsible for about 20 percent of our nation's greenhouse gas emissions, more efficient. Federal programs promoting energy-efficient appliances, lighting and heating and cooling systems would go a long way toward reducing the amount of electricity we use in our homes. This electricity is too often produced from coal-fired power plants, which produce the most greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the fact that New Jersey has some of the worst air quality in the country.
 If we brought efficiency technologies into our homes and our businesses, we could still have every modern comfort we've come to expect -- at a cost of only pennies a day -- while also helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.
 It's frustrating that we haven't done so already, since America has the technology, the innovative drive and the know-how to move from an energy policy that encourages unrestricted consumption toward one that emphasizes efficiency. Individual states and companies have already started taking these kinds of actions, but we need a bipartisan energy summit meeting to develop a national policy. 
 These bold actions are critical to preventing the effects of global warming from washing away the Jersey Shore.

HEADLINE: Jobs the Revolution Passed By 

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin. 
This column about the intersection of jobs and personal lives appears every other week. E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WHEN I was in seventh grade at Brookside Junior High School in Bellmore on Long Island, the girls took home economics and the boys took machine shop. More out of a distaste for sewing than a burning desire to learn woodworking, I raised an adolescent fuss, and became the first girl allowed to hammer and saw with the boys. That my choice of project was a very domestic napkin holder, and that it came out crooked, is beside the point. I was giddy to break new ground. 
 One would think the groundbreaking would be over by now. And yet, as Danica Patrick races to make history next week in the Indy 500, the fact is that there is still a diverse cluster of professions ceded almost completely to men. Only 11 percent of top executives in auto-related companies are women, along with just 14 percent in railroads and 15 percent in mail and freight delivery. Only 9.8 percent of American engineers are women. An estimated 95 percent of exterminators are male; the percentage is about the same for video game developers. When was the last time you saw a woman loading furniture onto a moving van? Or performing neurosurgery? There are just a dozen women traders on the floor of the New York Board of Trade, and only one woman doing regular commentary on Major League Baseball games. 
''There was a vile response to my being on the air,'' says that woman, Suzyn Waldman, who broadcasts Yankee games simultaneously on WCBS-AM in New York and XM Satellite Radio nationwide. She started in the business 20 years ago, on the fledgling all-sports station WFAN, and ''to my colleagues I was the woman who was taking the job of a 'real' reporter, as someone said to me once.''
 She is now a fixture at Yankee Stadium, but she is puzzled that her success hasn't led to more women doing the same kind of job. ''The paradigm is that you keep going and eventually the world catches up,'' she says. 
 Ms. Waldman is clear that she does her job exactly like any man, but others who spend their working days surrounded by Y chromosomes say they have changed the way jobs are done in keeping with their gender-tinted perspective. 
 ''I sent one of my managers out to buy a pair of size 12 high-heeled pumps at Payless,'' recalls Mary Sipes, the vehicle line director for full-size sport utility vehicles at General Motors. Then she had male engineers, dressed in skirts, heels and press-on fingernails, use the cars they designed. 
 ''They had to take a doll out of the stroller, put it in the car seat, pack away the stroller and climb in and drive,'' she says. The result was a new appreciation of things like how awkward it is to climb into an S.U.V. in a narrow skirt. ''I don't think that men in the vehicle business try to ignore women's needs,'' she says, ''it's just that they're different than us.''
 Caroline Markham, a horse wrangler at the Rancho de los Caballeros in Wickenburg, Ariz., agrees that she brings something different to the job. Early in her career she happened to work on an all-female crew, she remembers. ''The crew leader said: 'If I had to do it all over again I would hire an all-girl crew. I never had such a dependable, on-time, jolly, get-it-done crew in my life. There's a different way that gals approach this kind of work. If a horse is off its game, I would bet my bottom dollar that 9 times out of 10 it's a gal who notices.' '' 
 So what creates these pockets of testosterone in the working world? In some jobs the legacy is physical (women have traditionally not seemed strong enough for the work) and in others it is attitudinal (women are looked at as not aggressive enough). 
 The first barrier is much easier to overcome. ''I can do it all,'' Ms. Markham says of her days hauling bales of hay and building fences and herding 110 horses. ''If I couldn't, I wouldn't do this job.''
 Far more exclusionary are the macho traditions in some fields that make women think twice about whether the fight to bring change is worth it. That would help explain why there are relatively few women on Wall Street and none yet in the Oval Office.
 Katrina Firlik, who is one of about 225 female neurosurgeons in the country, compares surgical training to military duty in her book ''Another Day in the Frontal Lobe'' (Random House, 2006.) During her interview for her residency she was asked, ''How do you know you can handle the big drills?'' -- the ones used for cutting into the skull. Once accepted, she spent years napping in an on-call room decorated with posters of bikini-clad women. 
 There were only small drills in my shop class three decades ago, and I remember some not-so-friendly teasing when I botched the use of them. Somewhere, I think, I still have that napkin holder. An artifact of how much things have changed. And, much more surprisingly, of how much they haven't.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Life's Work column in the Job Market section on Sunday, about professions that are still dominated by men, misstated the location of Brookside Junior High School, where the writer was the first girl allowed to take machine shop with the boys. It is in North Merrick, N.Y., not Bellmore.

HEADLINE: Is It Last Call for the City?

BYLINE: By David Rabin and Robert Bookman. 
David Rabin, the co-owner of the nightclubs Lotus and the Double Seven, is the president of the New York Nightlife Association. Robert Bookman, a lawyer, is counsel to the association.

 BODY:
IMAGINE a Manhattan where there are practically no new restaurants. None at the new Moynihan Station nor at the expanded Javits Center nor adjacent to the refurbished High Line. 
 That's what will happen if proposed legislation working its way through Albany becomes law. The proposed law, which has already passed one committee, will immediately freeze the number of liquor licenses that can be issued in New York City and any other city with a population over 20,000. By this striking government intrusion into the free marketplace, it will become impossible for a new establishment to obtain a license to serve alcohol if there are at least three existing licensed premises within 500 feet, or about two to three city blocks. That will mean no one will ever open a restaurant or nightclub, because without a liquor license, the economics don't make sense.
This new prohibition will hurt commercial development and tourism. Over time, it will destroy the food service and hospitality industry and with it, the state's economy. In the city alone, more than 225,000 people are employed in this industry, making it the largest private employer in the city. More new jobs were created by restaurants and drinking establishments in March than any other industry. 
 Together, these establishments account for more than $20 billion in annual economic activity and $1 billion in tax payments to the city and state. Our group's research shows that the city's nightlife establishments alone have more annual admissions than all the Broadway theaters, all of New York's sport teams and the Metropolitan Museum of Art combined.
 With so much at stake economically, why, you might ask, is this legislation being considered? Because in a few neighborhoods in the city, residents are complaining that the streets are too busy and noisy at night. 
 There is no question that the number of these complaints has risen in the last few years, but it's not because of an explosion in the number of establishments licensed to sell liquor. In the past five years, the increase in liquor licenses citywide has averaged only 3 percent a year. In Manhattan, it has been even less, averaging just 2.3 percent per year. 
 What, then, are the true reasons for this legislation? First, there's been gentrification of commercial and manufacturing areas. This residential encroachment has brought million-dollar apartments into areas that are zoned for late-night uses. 
 Second, the smoking ban instituted three years ago has forced thousands of patrons onto the streets late at night. We warned, as did many community boards, that this would increase noise and tensions and we offered reasonable compromises but were rebuffed. Every bar is now unfairly considered rowdy since smokers can be found congregating under apartment windows at 2 a.m. 
 Third, the New York Police Department refuses to work with the industry to solve quality of life issues by placing officers on the streets late at night to keep the peace. They have even blocked a City Council proposal, supported by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, many community boards, a majority of the Council members and the chairman of its public safety committee, to permit late-night establishments to pay for officers to walk a beat nearby, reducing quality of life violations, just as is done outside Madison Square Garden and in many cities around the state and the country.
 Finally, the 311 system has led to an increase in the number of complaints. Because the phone calls are anonymous, many of the complaints are by the same people. For example, supporters of the legislation have been urging people to call 311 as often as possible with every complaint. These complaints force the police and other agencies to respond with violations that are then dismissed in court. 
 While admittedly there are always some owners who ignore legitimate neighborhood complaints, flout zoning requirements and fail to control their customers, passing overly broad, antibusiness legislation is not the way to go. A legislative assault like this one will destroy the very character of New York City that attracts the most innovative and creative young minds in America, and that draws millions of tourists from around the world.

HEADLINE: It's a Dump, But People Can Dream

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
Oak Point is a dump's dump. Successive owners in the 1960's, 70's and 80's buried the 28-acre tract, in the Bronx at the western border of Hunts Point, in about 15 feet of construction debris. Scrubby young ailanthus and poplar trees have grown among the bricks and excavated dirt that cover the site, which has been unused since 1990. 
 So the city probably expected little opposition last month when it announced plans to build a 2,000-bed jail on 11 acres of Oak Point.
''This site is bounded on one side by train tracks and on the other by a sludge factory,'' said Martin F. Horn, commissioner of the city's Department of Correction. ''It's not likely that it's going to be appropriate for other uses.''
 Few local politicians or nonprofit groups would agree. It's almost impossible to toss a No. 2 pencil in the neighborhood without hitting an organization that nurses serious, long-studied plans for Oak Point. Like an enormous empty canvas, the site seems to have invited dreamers. 
 Josephine Infante, director of the Hunts Point Economic Development Corporation, would prefer to see the site used for the food distribution business, which includes the sprawling Hunts Point Terminal Market and provides most of the jobs in the neighborhood. ''This is a first-class food center, and prisons do not help that reputation,'' she said. 
 The Oak Point site, on the East River, also figures in long-term plans by local nonprofit groups and the city for a necklace of waterfront parks, known as the South Bronx Greenway, to be strung around Hunts Point. Two of those parks are already being built. 
 Indeed, Oak Point's decaying piers shelter a surprisingly peaceful section of waterfront, lined with high grass and skimmed by cormorants. ''It completely takes you to another place,'' said Kellie Terry-Sepulveda, managing director of The Point, a neighborhood group.
 Other nonprofit groups, especially Sustainable South Bronx, have been exploring the possibility of establishing a recycling center at Oak Point. And Representative Jose E. Serrano has asked the Department of the Interior to determine whether the land can be designated as a memorial because of its connection to the worst civilian maritime disaster in the country's history. In 1904, the General Slocum, a steamship, caught fire 300 yards offshore during a Lutheran church outing, killing more than 1,000 residents of the Lower East Side. 
 Some neighborhood advocates said they would lobby the city against the jail. They contrasted the project with the infusions of public money into Highbridge for the rebuilding of Yankee Stadium and the construction of the Gateway Center retail complex. 
 ''The city's response is, 'Oh, we're going to spend $400 million here, too, but we're going to use it to put you guys in prison,' '' said Majora Carter, executive director of Sustainable South Bronx. ''It's really telling. They need to recognize the irony of that.'' ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: Partners In Culture

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
THE Acting Company of Greenwich has always relied on news releases and word of mouth to spread information about its productions. But just this year, the company decided it was time to advertise. That's tough without an advertising budget. 
 Like a child asking a parent for change to buy candy, the company looked to the state for help.
That may seem ludicrous at a time when the state has cut back aid to cities and towns and to institutions of all kinds, including those in the arts. But the State Commission on Culture and Tourism, whose own tourism budget has been chopped in half, has looked for creative ways to make a dime act like a dollar. 
 One of them is a small-grant program, the Arts Partnership for Stronger Communities, that prods arts organizations to work with community groups, restaurants, hotels and other commercial and nonprofit entities to increase their audiences. The program awards up to $3,000 for any collaborative effort, if the state approves, and also brings together groups that may not meet otherwise. 
 ''All kinds of things happen when you work with somebody on a project, all kinds of things you don't anticipate,'' said Dominick Grant of the Oddfellows Playhouse in Middletown, a community youth theater group started by Wesleyan University students in 1975 that has won three small grants. ''The state is encouraging people in a community to work together for a common goal.'' 
 The playhouse was awarded $3,000 for a program last November that combined the efforts of the Russell Library in Middletown, the playhouse and local restaurants. The grant money helped pay for transportation to Middletown and a small fee for Eric Coble, an Ohio playwright who wrote ''Gold in the Bones,'' a stage adaptation of three stories by Washington Irving that the playhouse presented last November. The performers from area high schools were able to meet Mr. Coble at the library for workshops on playwriting and screenwriting. The money also helped pay for an exhibition at the library on Washington Irving. 
 The playhouse also worked with local restaurants to distribute discount meal coupons for those who attended the show or the workshops at the Russell Library. That kind of effort is precisely what the state commission had hoped would happen, said Jennifer Aniskovich, executive director of the culture and tourism office.
 ''We realized early on that we needed to encourage industries that had not collaborated before to collaborate,'' she said. ''Lodging could talk to a visual arts museum, restaurants could talk to the historic house down the street.''
 The Acting Company in Old Greenwich has combined with two arts groups from neighboring towns, Curtain Call, a Stamford theater group, and the Darien Players, to put on Neil Simon's trilogy, ''Brighton Beach Memoirs,'' ''Biloxi Blues'' and ''Broadway Bound.'' Curtain Call will do the first play in the fall, the Darien Players will stage the next in the winter, and the Acting Company will stage the final play in the spring. All three theater groups will sell tickets for all the plays as part of the collaboration and will join with restaurants in their communities to offer a dinner-theater package to audiences. 
 Each group planned to split the money equally, said Pat Larrabee, president of The Acting Company. The company's $1,000 will go directly to advertising, she said. 
 ''This helps us to get our name out to a larger audience,'' Ms. Larrabee said. ''As much as we've tried, we still find people in town who say, 'We've never heard of you before.' We haven't been good enough with publicity and we're trying to step it up now.'' She also applauded the state's efforts to encourage groups to collaborate with other entities.
 ''I'm glad the grant forced us to partner with a local restaurant,'' she said. ''I think that is going to be a happy alliance. Some people really like a dinner-theater package, and we're certainly hoping that will work, that it will benefit both ways.''
 Such thinking is necessary at a time when the culture and tourism commission has seen its office budget cut to $5.5 million in fiscal 2006 from $5.9 million in fiscal 1995, and its tourism districts consolidated to a low of 5 from a high of 19 before 1995. Those districts had their own budgets, which totaled $11 million before 1995. Now they are working with about $5 million, a cut of more than 50 percent. 
 ''We're cooking up marketing ideas with limited tourism dollars,'' Mrs. Aniskovich said. ''We were always giving out arts and history grants, and we were spending marketing dollars. The challenge was to create a new tourism product. We saw that these cultural institutions were having trouble growing their audiences. By simply taking grant money and making grants that encouraged collaboration, we got the double benefit of a new tourism product and new strategies for these institutions to grow their audiences.''
 The state has awarded about $150,000 each year to hundreds of arts groups through the grant program. For fiscal 2007, it has awarded 57 grants to 202 organizations, said Mary Donohue of the culture and tourism commission.
 ''This program has allowed for-profit entities to be included,'' she said. ''This has broadened the take of the smaller history and arts groups.''
 She listed several groups that had never collaborated before, including nine museums that combined to form Connecticut Historic Gardens, developing a heritage garden tour and using the money to create a brochure publicizing the effort.
 ''Every year they think of a new twist,'' she said. ''And every year, they get a grant.'' 
 Artspace, an alternative arts center on the corner of Crown and Orange streets in New Haven, recently received a grant for a proposal to create art exhibits in the vacant storefronts that line Orange Street. Artspace planned to use six vacant spaces for the project and already has been creating temporary art installations in a now-vacant space where a building was torn down.
 ''It provides additional life and activity,'' said Helen Kauder, the executive director of Artspace. ''We're very much interested in economic development. All these activities have as an end goal the renaissance of downtown. Take a liability -- these underutilized vacant storefronts -- and turn them into assets for the community. These projects are not about ivory-tower art in a rarefied environment, but about putting the art where the general community and all the residents can see it.''
 Part of the proposal calls for Artspace to collaborate with New Haven's special taxing district, the Town Green Special Services District. The district has been a regular in the grants application process for three years, winning a grant last year with the New Haven Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Council of Greater New Haven and the Greater New Haven Convention and Visitors Bureau for the reopening of the Long Wharf Visitors Center. The groups used the money to publicize the center's opening, said Scott Healy, the executive director for the Town Green Special Services District. 
 ''In the case of the Long Wharf, it became a way for us to close some financial gaps to keep the visitors center open in the summer,'' Mr. Healy said. ''The center is a real launching point for visitors to this part of Connecticut, so the state's investment went well beyond the city. And it's a good way to capitalize on collaborative energy. There's nothing better than lighting a fire under groups that might not be collaborating, get them to think a little bit outside the box, outside their organizational boundaries, and I think that's an important part of what the state does.''
 The extra cash helps, too, said Ms. Larrabee of The Acting Company. The company prides itself on keeping ticket prices low, yet manages to cover its costs from ticket sales, she said. 
 ''We're a very low-budget operation,'' she said. ''We run very lean, and we rarely do a fund-raiser. So for us, this grant is a lot of money.''

HEADLINE: Penguin Rep Gives Its Audience What It Wants

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
WHEN Peter and Kari meet at their Minnesota high school reunion this weekend, 20 years after he abandoned her when she was pregnant with his baby, they won't be alone. Their recollections and reflections will be interpreted by an ''Our Town''-style narrator who also portrays all the other people at the reunion. 
 They are the characters in Craig Wright's comic drama ''The Pavilion,'' which was scheduled to open the Penguin Repertory Company's 29th theatrical season Friday night. And the happiest man to see them there may be Joe Brancato, the company's founder and artistic director.
For Mr. Brancato, this is the culmination of a half-year of work developing four full-fledged stage productions for Penguin Rep's 108-seat converted barn on Crickettown Road in Stony Point. And before that, he has to decide -- considering all the old and new comedies, tragedies, musicals and hybrids floating around -- what those four productions will be. 
 ''I know what my audience wants,'' Mr. Brancato said a week and a half before opening night. ''I know that they respect a challenge, and they come for that. We do like to make them laugh but also stir the gray matter.''
 Audiences are not shy, he said, about telling them what they think. ''They say, 'Joe, this was wonderful' or 'Joe, what were you thinking?' I have to be prepared for that.''
 They told him early on that they didn't care for musical revues. (Mr. Brancato declines to name a specific show.) ''They felt they wanted more book,'' he recalled. ''That was a clue for me that my audience wants storytelling.'' 
 The worst audience reaction that he can recall over the years was in response to ''Baby With the Bathwater'' by the professionally irreverent Christopher Durang. Other productions of that play have been received with a certain amount of horror. This is a comedy, after all, in which a nanny gives an infant a rattle made of asbestos, lead and Red Dye No. 2. 
 None of this year's selections sound quite that radical. ''The Pavilion'' will be followed, at the end of June, by the world premiere of ''Centennial Casting,'' a comedy by Gino Dilorio and Nancy Bleemer about an actress who mistakes an iron-casting business for a theatrical-casting agency. Theresa Rebeck's ''Bad Dates,'' a one-woman comedy (Julie White originated the role in New York) about a single mother who believes she should start going out with men again, follows in mid-August. 
 The most sensitive piece will wrap up the season in October. In the witty but very serious ''Adopt a Sailor,'' by Charles Evered, a New York couple invite a young sailor from Arkansas to dinner during the first Fleet Week after Sept. 11, 2001, and find that his presence brings all sorts of issues to the surface.
 That production ''is precisely what defines Penguin Rep,'' Mr. Brancato said: taking chances on new work. Last winter Mr. Evered submitted a draft of the play, which was rejected, but he was willing to rework it. A very short version of ''Adopt a Sailor'' was staged at an event commemorating Sept. 11 in New York in 2002. It starred Bebe Neuwirth, Neil Patrick Harris and Michael Nouri.
 ''I have a responsibility to encourage and trust playwrights,'' Mr. Brancato said, adding that Mr. Evered ''is brilliant, full of surprises and, well, we shall see.'' 
 He is confident about the effort for two reasons. He has directed Mr. Evered's work before. In 1994, Penguin Rep did his ''Size of the World,'' about an unemployed professional public speaker who moves in with an older New Jersey couple. And he has scheduled a production based on a draft before, ''A Strange and Separate People'' by Jon Marans. It was well received despite its fairly daring subject: an affair between two Orthodox Jewish men, one married. 
 Mr. Brancato also has high hopes for ''Bad Dates,'' which he chose because he considers the subject relevant -- ''Most of my female friends are addicted to finding Mr. Right and the perfect pair of shoes,'' he said -- and because he loves Ms. Rebeck's work. He was particularly taken with ''Spike Heels,'' her 1992 romantic-triangle comedy of sex-role reversals. 
 ''Centennial Casting'' comes to the schedule by an unusual route: the company's ''Play With Your Food'' series. Last summer, Penguin Rep began sponsoring Monday night readings of plays on the lawn, accompanied by brown-bag dinners. It was so successful that this year a local restaurant is catering the meals. Last year, they just ''made a hundred chicken salad sandwiches,'' said Andrew Horn, Penguin Rep's executive director.
 Mr. Horn, who has another career as a lawyer in New York, describes his role as looking at what Mr. Brancato wants to do and figuring out whether it is possible. ''This year we're trying to be a little ambitious,'' he said, adding that the company is growing and the subscriptions are up. Subscriptions for the company's four-play season are $90, compared with $120 for four tickets bought separately, and Mr. Horn estimates that about half the audience members are subscription holders. He would love to see that increase to two-thirds.
 ''You don't want more than that,'' he said. ''You want new people, fresh blood.'' 
 Almost 70 percent of Penguin Rep's revenues comes from ticket sales, and the rest from grants and individual donations. Costs include salaries for the actors and a half-dozen staff members, so Mr. Horn is pleased to see the company continue to produce shows with small casts, which he sees as an overall economic trend in theater. A five-person cast is considered huge at Penguin Rep; a one-person show like ''Bad Dates'' is a dream come true. 
 In the very beginning, Mr. Brancato recalled, the company did Anthony Newley's sprawling musical ''The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd.'' But Mr. Brancato soon decided that wasn't the direction he wanted to take, not so much because of the gigantic cast (all those urchins) but because of his desire to work with newer material. 
 That has meant endless research, reading new and little-known plays and, of course, going to the theater whenever and wherever possible.
 Mr. Brancato doesn't really mind that part. In an e-mail message, he reported, ''I am never happier than sitting in the dark just before curtain of a production I haven't directed.''

HEADLINE: Neighborhoods Vs. Developers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''Adding More Urban to Suburbia'' (May 14) and other articles discuss problems that the Brooklyn-based developer Forest City Ratner is having imposing two ambitious proposals on well-organized communities in Brooklyn and Yonkers. In both cases, the people who will be most directly affected by the developer's proposals are demanding the right to shape the future of their neighborhoods and are mobilizing in creative ways to make their voices heard. 
Despite recent legal setbacks and fierce community opposition, Forest City Ratner is pushing forward with plans to construct the Ridge Hill ''Village'' on 81 acres of hilltop property along the New York State Thruway in Yonkers. 
 The neighborhoods on the project's perimeter want the proposal changed to address concerns that increased traffic will overwhelm already congested roads. They also want more specific information about the economic benefits and burdens the project will bring their financially challenged city.
 As a lawyer who has represented a group of concerned business owners in downtown Yonkers, I hope that developers like Forest City Ratner are realizing that using money and political connections to bulldoze their way over community concerns is no longer the best way to make their visions a reality. As neighbors become more educated about the development process, developers must learn how to treat them as partners rather than impediments.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Hear God's Word, In Chinese, by Conference Call

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Just before midnight, the calls start coming in to the church on Allen Street in Chinatown. They come from Chinese restaurant workers across the United States.
 Chen Yingjie, 25, is one of those on the other end, dialing the Manhattan church, the Church of Grace to Fujianese, on a recent night from his room above the China Garden in Dowagiac, Mich., a town of 6,000. ''Every time I call in, I know that the Lord is alive and that there are brothers and sisters by my side,'' Mr. Chen said. ''I don't feel as empty.''
The callers -- more than a hundred crowd the line on many nights -- are for the most part like Mr. Chen, illegal immigrants from the Fuzhou region of Fujian province, coming off bone-wearying 12-hour shifts as stir-fry cooks, dishwashers, deliverymen and waiters at Chinese restaurants, buffets and takeout places. 
 For the next hour, led by a pastor sitting in front of a speakerphone in Chinatown, they will sing praises to God over the phone and study shengjing -- the Bible -- together. 
 With limited English and even less time, often isolated in small towns across the country, most Fujianese Chinese restaurant workers find it impossible to attend church on Sundays. But strung together by cellphones and free night-and-weekend minutes, these workers have come to form a virtual church on Monday through Thursday nights, deriving spiritual sustenance and companionship from an unusual conference-call Bible study organized by the Church of Grace.
 ''It's like there is a giant net, connecting people from all different places together,'' said Mr. Chen, speaking in Mandarin. 
 The Bible study is the brainchild of the Pastor Paul Chen, a minister at Church of Grace, and himself an emigrant from the Fuzhou region, which has become China's leading source of illegal immigrants smuggled into the United States. Three years ago, he said, he had been praying about how to tend to the thousands of Fujianese working in Chinese restaurants across the country.
 ''In the Bible, it states that you are never to stop gathering together,'' he said, speaking in Mandarin. ''For those who are out of state, having fellowship and being together, it is not that easy.'' 
 The conference-call idea came to him, he said, when he saw someone at the church use the three-way calling feature on his cellphone one day. Early on, the gatherings over the telephone were organized haphazardly, with one restaurant worker calling into the church and then conferencing in a friend; the friend would in turn conference in another friend. The chain expanded, growing to 20 or 30 people on the line at once. Sometimes it would take 20 minutes just to get everyone together. 
 Different parts of the Bible are studied on different nights: Psalms on Tuesday; New Testament on Wednesday; Old Testament on Thursday. On Mondays, there is a short devotional and then a time of prayer.
 Eventually, the church bought conference call lines able to handle 40 callers at a time. When that proved too few, they expanded to 100 lines. 
 Although reliable numbers are difficult to come by because most Fujianese are here illegally, it is estimated that 300,000 immigrants from the Fuzhou region are in the United States, with the largest concentration, about 60,000 to 70,000, in New York City, said Kenneth J. Guest, a Baruch College anthropology professor who wrote the book ''God in Chinatown'' (New York University Press, 2003).
 By all indications, they are continuing to come. Church of Grace, the largest Protestant church in Chinatown catering to Fujianese, gets newcomers almost every week at its services. Last year, more than 500 visitors, most of them fresh from China, passed through the church, said Stanley Chan, a deacon. About 450 to 500 people attend services weekly. 
 New York City is the central node of a vast ethnic economy that provides labor to the country's Chinese restaurants, of which there are more than 36,000 -- more than the number of McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's outlets combined -- says the Chinese Restaurant News, an industry publication. 
 Fujianese workers line up at dozens of ramshackle employment agencies under the Manhattan Bridge. On the wall are postings advertising jobs available at restaurants across the country, generally paying $1,800 to $2,600 a month. After short telephone interviews, the workers are trundled off on van lines that drop them off at their new jobs.
 ''We've got this little diaspora in formation,'' Dr. Guest said. ''The workers are not settling in these places. The restaurant owners are going and establishing these outposts. The workers are still moving back and forth. It's really a working-class internal migration between New York and other parts of the country.''
 But the migration has a high cost for many workers, who often find themselves stranded in places with few other people like them and little ability to interact with the English-speaking world.
 ''They're particularly vulnerable and lonely,'' Dr. Guest said. ''The churches and temples serve as very important community centers for this very transient population. The conference calls are an extension of that.''
 Many Fujianese restaurant workers found yesu jidu, Jesus Christ, at churches back home in China, while others converted after coming to this country. Christianity is enjoying a renaissance in China. Among the areas where the greatest growth has occurred is in Fujian province and other parts of southeastern China. By early 2001, there were 1,500 registered churches and an additional 2,500 official meeting points in Fujian, Dr. Guest says in his book. Residents meet in underground churches, as well as open ones. There are also unregistered churches that simply function with the tacit approval of the local government.
 Mr. Chen's parents raised him as a Christian, although he rarely went to church. He paid human smugglers to sneak him into the United States two years ago, first flying to Guatemala and then making his way to Mexico, where he swam a river to cross the border. He declined to say how much he paid them, but the price these days is generally more than $60,000. It will take him at least two more years, he said, to pay off his debt. 
 Soon after he arrived in New York City, he sought out the Church of Grace.
 ''Coming to America, I just felt that I was really alone,'' he said. ''I saw something in the newspaper about the church, and I went.'' 
 Several months ago, seeking to move out of New York City, he found a job through an employment agency as a waiter at a Thai restaurant in Indiana. After a brief stint, he decided that being a waiter did not suit him, so he quit and went to Chicago. There, at another employment agency, he learned of an opportunity answering the telephone and working the cash register at China Garden, the lone Chinese restaurant in Dowagiac, in the southwestern part of the state.
 Dowagiac, which sit in the heart of the largest hog-producing county in Michigan, might seem an unlikely place for a Chinese restaurant. But located on the town's main thoroughfare, a few doors down from Bill's Vac Shop and Marci's Variety Store, China Garden draws a steady line of customers. General Tso's chicken is the most popular dish. On the wall, a framed certificate from a local newspaper honors the restaurant as having the best buffet in town. 
 Upon his arrival in Dowagiac in late April, Mr. Chen was assigned a 9-by-12 room upstairs from the restaurant. The restaurant's owners lived in an adjoining room; other employees camped out in the living room. 
 But Mr. Chen quickly soured on life in Dowagiac. (He left last weekend to go back to Chicago.) The restaurant owners locked the doors every night, making it impossible to leave. Even on his days off, without a car, he had few options other than walking to the public library down the street.
 ''It's like I'm living in a cage,'' he said.
 The Bible study offered him a lifeline, a rare chance to escape.
 ''For us brothers and sisters who are out of state,'' he said, ''the Bible study over the phone is central to our lives.'' 
 His favorite Bible verse? Psalm 49:20. ''A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.''
 Wu Jishu, 33, has worked in more than 10 states since he came to the United States five years ago and has been calling in to the Bible study since its early days. Now he works at a takeout restaurant outside of Pittsburgh.
 He appreciates the opportunity to ask questions about parts of the Bible that confuse him, he said. Occasionally, the pastor will also open up the line for participants to share news about their lives and to pray for one another.
 ''We can't see each other,'' Mr. Wu said. ''But we can hear each other.''
 On a recent night, Mr. Chen, of the Church of Grace, led the participants through a passage in the Gospel of Mark where Jesus heals the sick and demon-possessed in Galilee. He impressed upon them that their purpose in the United States was not simply to zhuanqian, earn money, but to spread the Gospel as well. 
 Like a preacher revving up his audience, he challenged his listeners to respond, hitting a button to open up the lines. 
 ''We're here to what?''
 ''Spread the Gospel,'' they said in a cacophony of Mandarin.
 ''We're here to what?''
 ''Spread the Gospel.'' 
 Later in the passage, Jesus calls on his disciples to come with him as he preached to other villages. Mr. Chen drew an analogy to the restaurant workers. They could go from buffet house to buffet house, planting seeds of faith wherever they went.

HEADLINE: Bringing Hope to a Bloodied City

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 18 

 BODY:
Kelvin Kelley, who was 16, was laid to rest on Monday, the gunshot wounds to his torso concealed by the crisp beige suit he had recently worn to a high school speech team competition at Harvard University. The following day, mourners said goodbye to his best friend, Hassan Ferguson, 16, who was killed alongside Kelvin in a Central Ward parking lot on May 9. 
 It was the same day that Newark elected Cory Booker as the city's first new mayor in two decades.
These two killings and another shooting on Wednesday brought the number of murders in 2006 to 40, 11 more than during the same period last year. Nearly half of those killed were under 21. 
 Hopes for a safer, saner city are squarely focused on Mr. Booker, a suburban-raised Rhodes scholar and former Newark council member who has promised to bring law and order to a city awash in illegal guns, gang violence and fear. A big part of his plan hinges on overhauling the city's troubled Police Department.
 ''Everything falls on my shoulders now,'' he said after attending Kelvin's funeral. ''The challenge is to switch from talking about solutions to implementing solutions.''
 Public safety, most everyone here agrees, is the issue that could make or break the mayoralty of Mr. Booker, a 37-year-old Democrat who is often mentioned as a national up-and-comer. He is to take office on July 1.
 In Mr. Booker's own polls taken during the campaign, more than 80 percent of residents cited crime as the No. 1 issue, far outstripping concerns over the city's beleaguered school system, a lack of decent jobs and a poverty rate that keeps Newark mired in the bottom tier of America's most battered municipalities. 
 The good news about overall crime dropping more than 50 percent in the last decade has been largely diluted by a spate of shootings and the killings in the last year of more than a dozen high school students who were caught in a numbing cycle of gratuitous bloodshed. 
 ''If people don't feel safe on the streets, even if it's just a perception, then the private investment and job creation that's needed to bring about the city's revitalization cannot move forward,'' said Ken Zimmerman, executive director of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, an urban research and advocacy group based in Newark. 
 Neither officials from the Police Department nor the office of Mayor Sharpe James, who declined to run for a sixth term, would respond to questions about the police, crime and the battle against lawlessness. In previous interviews, Mr. James and his police director, Anthony F. Ambrose, have defended the department's performance and blamed a flood of gang activity for the recent spike in violence. 
 In late 2004, Mr. James said he would create seven new precincts and hire 80 new officers. Construction has begun on two of the new precinct buildings.
 ''The Newark Police Department has made a lot of strides over the last 10 years but there's so much more that could be done,'' said Michael L. Wagers, executive director of the Police Institute at Rutgers University in Newark. ''What Cory Booker does with the department will make or break him as mayor.''
 Although he has proposed a raft of measures that touch on public safety, Mr. Booker is preparing to spend much of his political capital on bringing change to the Police Department, which has been plagued by low morale, a shortage of working vehicles and modern equipment, and the kind of dysfunction that makes local residents and outside observers cringe. 
 Examples of the department's troubles abound: Last month, officials suspended a veteran officer who was present at a local bar during two separate shootings that took the lives of four people. In both cases, one in 2003 and another in April, the officer was on duty but out of uniform and made little effort to intervene in the shootings, according to investigators.
 In another recent case, officers could not find the body of a 19-year-old man killed in a car accident last December. Five days later, the victim's father found his body on an embankment at the scene. 
 In interviews, residents say their calls to 911 are met with a sluggish response. Mr. Booker's brother, for one, said he waited four hours for the police to arrive after a stolen car flipped over and crashed into his house. Many crime scene investigations are bungled, prosecutors say, and the city has been beset in recent years by the slaying of witnesses who were set to testify in murder trials. 
 Msgr. William Linder, a founder of the city's largest social service organization, New Community Corporation, said his agency spends more than $3 million a year on private security, an expense he attributes to the failings of the Police Department. 
 The money, he said, pays for 125 guards who patrol the organization's residential projects, schools and a nursing home it operates. 
 ''A lot of people in Newark have just given up on the police,'' said Monsignor Linder, a critic of Mr. James who supported Mr. Booker in his two bids for mayor. ''The whole force needs to be reformed.''
 But beyond the claims of ineptitude is a widely held belief that the 1,043-member force is sorely lacking in integrity.
 In 2004, a group of rogue officers were convicted of robbing and terrorizing criminal suspects in the West Ward, and many residents were not especially surprised earlier this year when the department promoted a commander who was under investigation for having sex in his patrol car while he was facing sexual harassment allegations. 
 Last year two high-ranking officers were punished: the commander in charge of counterterrorism for collecting a pension and a salary for the same position and a deputy police chief for failing to disclose a conviction for recklessly causing the death of a woman two decades earlier. 
 Many of the department's problems, some critics say, start at the top. They cite the police chief, Irving Bradley, who was hired by Mayor James two years ago despite his 1999 guilty plea for leading Rahway police on a chase and assaulting an officer after they discovered him drinking in his car.
 In interviews, a half-dozen officers still in uniform described a police force in which promotions are based on political loyalties and an officer's willingness to make election-year contributions to the incumbent's re-election campaign. The officers, who were granted anonymity because they feared retribution, said many of the department's most important units, including homicide and narcotics, had been diminished by transfers that replaced seasoned investigators with recent academy graduates. 
 Augosto Amador, a council member who represents an area largely made up of Brazilian and Portuguese immigrants, said a handful of popular commanders in his ward were reassigned to other precincts after the 2002 election, when Mr. Booker received heavy support from the neighborhood and came close to beating Mr. James. 
 ''They were doing a great job but they were punished anyway,'' said Mr. Amador, a longtime supporter of Mr. James who says he switched to Mr. Booker's side after the transfers.
 Mr. Booker said he was well aware of the department's deficiencies and said he planned to end the tradition of politically based hiring. He would not comment on the futures of Mr. Ambrose, the police director, or Mr. Bradley, the police chief, but said they would be asked to submit their resumes for consideration. 
 His plans for the force are both simple and sweeping. 
 During an interview last week, he said he would put an additional 100 officers on the street by moving uniformed officers out of desk jobs. He wants wireless laptops in every patrol car to replace the 30-year-old typewriters that many officers now use to fill out crime reports. 
 Mr. Booker plans to go after gangs with more personnel and the aggressive use of federal racketeering laws. No quality-of-life annoyance, no matter how small, he said, will be overlooked. 
 But law enforcement, he said, is only one part of his plan for restructuring civic life in New Jersey's biggest city. He speaks of programs using mentors to keep teenagers from the embrace of gangs, alternative sentencing for drug addicts and local legislation to end the background checks that prevent former convicts from getting jobs as city clerks, trash collectors and bus drivers.
 ''There's no reason an entire segment of the population should be denied access to employment,'' he said.
 To pay for this municipal largess, Mr. Booker said he would chase the assets of drug dealers, increase the city's low rate of payroll tax collection and install cameras at intersections to squeeze money out of red-light runners. ''I'm also not going to make painfully wrong investments with our money, whether it's $300 million for a downtown arena or using housing authority dollars for plasma-screen TV's,'' he said.
 Such promises, if made real, are appealing to many Newarkers, especially the young people who have come to fear the space between school and their front doors.
 Packed into Whigham Funeral Home last week, hundreds of them, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the image of a smiling Kelvin Kelley, loudly wept or listened, numb, as preachers, relatives and friends spoke about the death of a young man who had dreamed of being an actor. 
 When Marques-Aquil Lewis, an 18-year-old antigang worker, took the microphone and urged the mourners to rally against violence at a downtown park, the crowd applauded. ''We've got to stop the killing,'' he said, turning toward the coffin, ''because I'm tired of putting pictures of black brothers on T-shirts.''

HEADLINE: Rough Summer Is on the Way For Air Travel

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY; Jane L. Levere contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 20 

 BODY:
Brace yourself for a summer of miserable air travel.
 Planes are expected to be packed fuller than at anytime since World War II, when the airlines helped transport troops. Fares are rising. Service frills are disappearing.
Logjams at airport security checkpoints loom as the federal government strains to keep screener jobs filled. The usual violent summer storms are expected to send the air traffic control system into chaos at times, with flight delays and cancellations cascading across the country.
 And many airline employees, after years of pay cuts and added work, say they are dreading the season ahead. Those workers -- and there are about 70,000 fewer of them than in 2002 -- will be handling more than 100 million more passengers this year than they did four years ago. 
 The friendly skies, indeed. 
 ''Everybody's stressed. Everybody's feeling it,'' said Bryan Hutchinson, a former baggage handler at United Airlines who now works in a joint airline-union program to counsel workers suffering from stress or other emotional problems.
 Above gate B-22 at Denver International Airport, with smells from the Quiznos sandwich stand below filling his office, Mr. Hutchinson receives a steady stream of burned-out looking United employees. 
 Easy days are rare. An arriving plane is delayed. United shifts an outbound flight to a smaller plane. Thirty passengers are bumped. Some become irate. 
 And at the end of the shift, a gate agent ''shows up in my office and says, 'I'm whacked out,' '' Mr. Hutchinson said. He refers some workers to mental health professionals, and offers others strategies for coping: Take a couple of deep breaths; go vent to a co-worker. 
 Passengers feel the stress, too. For some, the best coping strategy is to avoid flying. Randy McCroskey, a consultant who lives in Maryville, Tenn., grew weary of sliding his 6-foot-4, 300-pound body into the seats of the smaller regional jets that increasingly serve Knoxville's airport. 
 He says that he now drives to see clients as far away as 500 miles. His former limit was 100 miles. That cuts his air travel by more than half. 
 ''Rather than fight through security, not know if I'll get a seat on a flight, get bumped, it's easier to just get in my car,'' Mr. McCroskey said. ''When I pull into rest stops, I see the same guys in the bathroom I'd see at hub airports.''
 But the airports are still busier, as traffic has risen along with the stronger economy and the recovery from the sharp downturn that followed the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. About 207 million passengers are expected this summer, the Air Transport Association said, roughly 2 million more than a year ago.
 And the effects of that seemingly modest 1 percent jump are magnified by the fact that there will be 4 percent fewer flights this summer, according to American Express.
 Domestic flights are running at about 80 percent full, and that means that flights on popular routes are often fully booked. Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, said that advanced bookings suggest that planes, on average, should be close to 90 percent full this summer.
 ''It means flights will be sold out,'' he said. ''They're downgrading aircraft types, from wide to narrow bodies, narrow bodies to regional jets.'' 
 Airline executives say they try to prepare for the always-busy summer season. ''Look, load factors are higher than they've ever been, and thunderstorms occur,'' said Peter D. McDonald, executive vice president and chief operating officer at United. But United has spread out arrivals more evenly to avoid logjams, he said, and more flight crews will be standing by on reserve in the summer to handle scheduling mishaps.
 Mr. McDonald said that despite the many sacrifices employees at United have made to keep the airline in business, including steep pay cuts, ''there's no reason to believe they've lost focus here.''
 After 9/11, airlines parked hundreds of planes to cut costs. Financial problems mounted, leading several major airlines to file for bankruptcy-court protection. They laid off workers, cut frills and switched to smaller planes on many routes. 
 Six big airlines cut their fleets by about 700 planes, or close to 20 percent, since the peak in June 2001, the Air Transport Association said.
 Airlines also shifted larger planes from domestic to international routes. With scant competition from low-cost competitors internationally, airlines can charge higher fares on such routes.
 Last summer, for instance, Delta Air Lines operated four big Boeing 767 jets, with 252 seats each, on routes across the country. 
 This July, those four 767's, reconfigured with 204 seats -- including business class seats with elaborate entertainment systems -- are flying to Edinburgh; Dusseldorf, Germany; Kiev, Ukraine; and Budapest. 
 Replacing the 767's on domestic routes are smaller 757's, seating 183 each. And that draws still smaller planes onto routes once flown by the 757's.
 Over all, Delta will have 81,692 fewer domestic seats to sell each day this July compared to the same month in 2005. That represents a drop of about 18 percent. But while the airlines were shrinking their fleets, business came roaring back, resulting in packed planes. ''Travelers longing for an empty middle seat are recommended to buy one,'' said Jamie Baker, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. 
 Airlines, still struggling because of high fuel prices, have been able to raise fares because of the tight capacity. David Strine, an analyst at Bear Stearns, said that he expected fares to rise about 8 percent this year. Fares are still not as high as they were in the late-1990's, though.
 Free rides are increasingly hard to come by. ''Using frequent-flier mileage is virtually impossible today,'' said Julius Maldutis, an industry consultant.
 Indeed, Mr. McCroskey, the Tennessee consultant, recently gave in and bought two $600 tickets for a Las Vegas vacation with his wife, leaving his pile of Delta frequent-flier miles untouched. ''You can't use them,'' he said. ''August was the first thing they were showing.''
 As air traffic increases, the security screening system becomes taxed, too, and those jobs become more stressful. The Transportation Security Administration is hustling to fill screener jobs for the summer crunch. Turnover runs about 20 percent a year.
 Los Angeles International Airport's screening staff is about 10 percent below a target of roughly 2,000 screeners. The New York area's three big airports have an aggregate screener crew of about 3,800, but even fully staffed that is ''inadequate'' to handle traffic, said Marc Lavorgna, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''They do a good job,'' he said, ''with what they have.''
 Still, Kip Hawley, the security agency's administrator, said in an interview that, approaching summer, ''we are going to be ready in terms of our work force.'' Local managers have hiring authority to speed the staff buildup.
 New procedures are likely to slow some travelers. The agency says it plans to conduct more secondary screenings to check for traces of explosives. 
 Last month, at Atlanta's airport, a computer-generated image suggesting an explosive-- not from an actual bag being screened -- was flashed to test a screener's alertness.
 The screener, after identifying the threat, is supposed to be told it was only a test. This time, that didn't happen, and a frantic search ensued for a bag that did not exist.
 The terminal was shut down for about two hours, Mr. Hawley said, and the bomb squad was called. The glitch that caused the panic has been fixed, he said. 
 ''We do recognize the economic damage'' of shutting a terminal down, he added. ''That won't happen again.''
 It's impossible to measure air rage accurately, but most experts think there is more of it these days. Joyce A. Hunter, a former Delta marketing official who is now an assistant professor at Saint Xavier University in Chicago, started researching air rage in 2001 with the hypothesis that it is caused by poor customer service, such as a lack of communication about delays and other problems. While that contributes to it, she said, she has concluded that alcohol is the main culprit.
 Bars, of course, line airport terminals and drinks aloft can potentially send an already angry flier into a fit.
 Front-line workers -- flight attendants and gate agents -- usually bear the brunt of problems. Sara Nelson Dela Cruz, a United flight attendant and union official, said a lot of senior flight attendants schedule vacations ''so they don't have to work the summer crowds.''
 Onboard this summer, people are likely to feel ''kind of like sardines,'' said Reenie Prine, a customer service supervisor for Southwest Airlines at Midway Airport in Chicago. Angry passengers are just part of the job, she said. ''I don't let it get to me,'' she explained. ''An apology goes a long way: 'I'm so sorry for your difficulty.' ''
 With airlines generally not expanding and traffic rising, is ''fully loaded'' the new normal in a business that for decades flew planes at 60 to 70 percent capacity? The ability to compare fares easily on the Internet has driven down ticket costs but also helped airlines to sell the very last seat. 
 For now, it seems that only rising prices could dampen demand. Some travelers, particularly business managers who are not paying for the seats out of their own pockets, may even find it a relief to be charged more if it would lead to less-crowded planes.
 ''The thing that's starting to bother travelers more than anything else is the comfort factor, not the fare factor,'' said Kevin Maguire, the in-house travel manager for Applied Materials, a technology company based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''The airlines, federal government, general public need to sit down collectively and find a way to get the transportation system back in order,'' he said. ''I've never seen it this bad.''

HEADLINE: VOTERS RE-ELECT NAGIN AS MAYOR IN NEW ORLEANS

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 20 

 BODY:
C. Ray Nagin, the unpredictable mayor who charted a sometimes erratic course for his city through Hurricane Katrina and after, won a narrow re-election victory here Saturday.
 Mr. Nagin, who will now lead the city through four crucial rebuilding years, fended off a strong challenge from Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu, the scion of one of Louisiana's leading political families, in a vote that see-sawed all night. With all of the city's 442 precincts reporting, Mr. Nagin had 52 percent of the vote, while Mr. Landrieu received 48 percent.
Mr. Nagin, an African-American, won about 21 percent of the votes of whites, as well as over 80 percent of the black vote, according to a local elections analyst and political consultant, Greg Rigamer. Mr. Landrieu appeared to have lost black votes that he picked up in last month's primary, Mr. Rigamer said in an interview.
 In claiming victory before his supporters tonight, Mr. Nagin said it was time to end the arguments over how to rebuild the city and to begin the arduous task. ''It's time for this community to start the healing process,'' Mr. Nagin said, adding that he intended to continue working with his opponent. 
 Mr. Landrieu, who is white, called on residents in his concession speech to unite behind the mayor in rebuilding a city that has barely begun to recover from the flooding.
 ''I want to congratulate Mayor Nagin,'' Mr. Landrieu said. ''This was a hard-fought campaign. The people of New Orleans conducted themselves in a dignified and thoughtful way.''
 Mr. Nagin raised far less money than Mr. Landrieu did and had little of the business and establishment support that helped him take office four years ago. But he appeared to benefit from a surge of votes cast by those displaced from the city by the hurricane, who were encouraged to vote with absentee ballots and at satellite polling stations set up around Louisiana. 
 Mr. Nagin retained the strong allegiance of black residents here, who are still in the majority, albeit more narrowly than before the hurricane. They did not blame him for missteps during the storm and afterwards, and many said they simply wanted the man who led the city during the last hurricane to continue leading it through future ones.
 For months, Mr. Nagin played on that underlying loyalty and remade his political persona, going from a candidate originally favored by whites to one making an overt appeal to black unity and pride.
 A speech in January in which he vowed that New Orleans would once again be a ''chocolate city'' outraged whites, but brought a smile to many black voters.
 In addition, conservative whites who have long mistrusted the Landrieu family have consistently found Mr. Nagin's business background --he was a cable television company executive here -- appealing. 
 Other white voters, in interviews, unfavorably contrasted Mr. Landrieu's stiff delivery with the mayor's resonant New Orleans colloquialisms. And during Mr. Nagin's administration, in notable contrast to those of his predecessors, there have been no patronage or other scandals.
 In his victory speech, Mr. Nagin pointedly thanked President Bush, of whom he had previously spoken critically.
 ''To President Bush, yeah, I want to thank you, Mr. President,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''You and I have probably been the most vilified politicians in the country. But I want to thank you for moving that promise in Jackson Square forward. You are delivering on your promise, and I want to thank you for delivering for the citizens of New Orleans.''
 Mr. Nagin came out on top in an April primary, but opponents collectively received a majority of the votes.
 With Mr. Landrieu and Mr. Nagin taking the same muted position on the central issue facing this city -- both refused to rule out rebuilding in any area, no matter how badly damaged by flooding -- the race was about who was most competent to lead New Orleans out of its current predicament.
 Mostly unspoken was the larger reality: that the federal money destined for the city, as much as $10 billion that would perhaps arrive by late summer, would have far more influence on its recovery than the actions of any mayor.
 Mr. Landrieu accused Mr. Nagin of botching the recovery. He said he had failed to put into place a rebuilding plan and to get ruined cars, garbage and debris off the streets.
 ''This race only comes down to leadership, competence and performance,'' he said Thursday. ''The rebuild's got to start sometime, and it's not happening.''
 Mr. Landrieu repeatedly suggested that the city's finances were in disorder and that New Orleans might need to declare bankruptcy, as some civic groups here have suggested.
 Then, earlier this week, Mr. Nagin announced a $150 million loan from a consortium of banks, two French and two American, to keep the city going through next year -- a deal that turned out not to have been fully completed.
 Throughout the race, Mr. Nagin used his opponent's connections against him, suggesting that the election of Mr. Landrieu would perpetuate a family ''dynasty.'' (Mr. Landrieu's father, Moon Landrieu, was the city's last white mayor, and his sister Mary is the senior United States senator from Louisiana.) He characterized Mr. Landrieu's record as sketchy, after 16 years in the Legislature and two as lieutenant governor.
 ''I think Mitch is a good guy,'' Mr. Nagin said Friday. ''I love him to death. But he's not really an implementer.''
 The choice was not clear-cut, though, and residents often expressed confusion over it in the days leading up to the election. Above all, the election sometimes seemed merely a distraction in the context of a city still facing questions over its survival. 
 Still, as the election neared and increasingly began to seem like a referendum on the city's future, attention began to focus on it.
 Saturday was a clear, hot day, and in the areas that did not flood during the hurricane, volunteers stood at street corners waving signs, while flatbed trucks and even a fire engine passed by packed with cheering supporters. In the flooded areas, piles of debris stood outside empty houses still showing last August's water line, and there was little life. The medians of the broad, silent boulevards in Mid-City were crowded with signs for the candidates.
 Among voters on Saturday there was unease, dissatisfaction over the recovery, and -- for those who had been displaced -- a longing to return. Still, African-Americans voters for the most part said they were standing by Mr. Nagin.
 ''The city is starting to show a little progress, but only a little progress,'' said Idoshia Gordon, reciting the list of family members -- cousins, siblings, aunts -- who had lost houses to the hurricane. 
 Despite these reservations, she said was going to vote for Mr. Nagin. ''I want to see him carry it through,'' she said. ''I want him to finish it out.''
 Many whites were openly angry at the mayor.
 ''We've got to change the situation,'' said David Castillo after voting at Jesuit High School in Mid-City, where construction workers were busy on a building that was badly flooded. ''It's a bad situation.'' 
 Others were more forgiving of the mayor, who voted at the school.
 ''You did everything you could, my darlin', '' said Theresa Graffin, embracing Mr. Nagin, who buttonholed as many people as he could and appeared cool and collected.
 Less than half of the city's population of 455,000 has returned, by most counts.

HEADLINE: At Unforgiving Arizona-Mexico Border, Tide of Desperation Is Overwhelming

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: ARIVACA, Ariz., May 18 

 BODY:
All the talk in Washington about putting walls and soldiers along the border with Mexico did not stop Miguel Espindola from trying to cross the most inhospitable part of it this week with his wife and two small children.
 Their 6-year-old daughter, Karla, clutched her mother's back pocket with one hand and a bottle of Gatorade with the other as the family set out across the Sonora Desert on Thursday. Miguelito, 7, lugged a backpack that seemed to weigh almost as much as he did.
 ''Yes, there is risk, but there is also need,'' said Mr. Espindola, explaining why he had brought his children on a journey that killed 464 immigrants last year, and a 3-year-old boy this week.
 Looking out at the vast parched landscape ahead, Mr. Espindola, a coffee farmer, talked about the poverty he had left behind, and said: ''Our damned government forces us to leave our country because it does not give us good salaries. The United States forces us to go this way.'' 
 Here at ground zero for the world's largest and longest wave of illegal migration, about the only thing that is clear is that easy answers do not apply. During a drive along a narrow highway that runs parallel to the line, it is hard to see how increased law enforcement and advanced technologies will stop an exodus made up predominantly of Mexicans willing to risk everything. 
 Meanwhile, it becomes easier to understand the conflicting attitudes about migrants that have not only strained relations between the United States and its neighbors to the south, but also tested America's identity as a melting pot.
 In the last five years, Arizona has become the principal, and deadliest, gateway for illegal migrants. It accounts for nearly one-third of the 1.5 million people captured for illegally crossing the border last year, and nearly half the migrants who died, according to the United States Border Patrol.
 Those figures have inspired competing responses. 
 After the 3-year-old boy was found dead this week in the desert, some local law enforcement authorities called for charging his mother, Edith Rodriguez Reyes, with reckless endangerment. The authorities at the Mexican consulate here said Ms. Rodriguez was a victim of smugglers and demanded that she be released.
 The mesquite-covered landscape here was a base for the Minuteman militias, who have threatened to take the law into their own hands in defense of America's southern border. 
 It is also home to so-called border Samaritans, who scour the desert in search of migrants in distress to deliver water, medical attention and, sometimes, advice on how to avoid detention.
 ''This is a token deployment of unarmed and grossly inadequate numbers of National Guardsmen,'' a Minuteman spokeswoman, Connie Hair, told The Arizona Daily Star. Ms. Hair said the troops would be placed in the ''same demoralizing position as the Border Patrol, outmanned and outgunned against international crime cartels.''
 Jim Walsh, a volunteer with the Samaritans, was not optimistic either, but for different reasons. ''With this president and this Congress,'' he said, ''it's not going to be too humane.''
 Worried about the enormous drain on taxpayers, voters here passed a ballot initiative intended to limit immigrants' access to public services. Meanwhile, economists like Marshall Vest at the University of Arizona said the illegal immigrants were an important source of labor for the booming construction and tourism industries that had helped make Arizona the second-fastest growing state, after Nevada.
 When Mr. Bush deploys an estimated 6,000 National Guard troops to the border, it is expected that most will be sent here in an effort to seal off the desert. So this is likely to be the place where the successes and failures of the policy will unfold.
 Arizona has been hurt by ''bad immigration policies,'' said Laura Briggs, an associate professor of women's studies at the University of Arizona, and a member of the border Samaritans. ''There is a long tradition of hospitality in the borderlands, and this rising death toll is stressing everybody out.''
 Those conflicting interests, and growing frustrations, come to life on Arivaca Road, which runs about 14 miles west of Interstate 19, on the way to Sasabe, Mexico. 
 Once a bucolic settlement of horse and cattle ranchers, the area around the highway has been overrun, according to residents, by illegal immigrants who move in groups of up to 80 at a time, and up to a thousand a day in the peak winter season. Residents must also contend with the buzz of Border Patrol agents in trucks and helicopters.
 Frank Ormsby, a rancher, and his brother, Lloyd, said that after living for more than a decade in the middle of the buildup of the Border Patrol and the growing waves of immigrants, they were just plain sick of all of it. There are more backpacks littering the desert than rocks, they said, and enough money is being spent on equipment for the Border Patrol to rebuild New Orleans.
 To them, illegal immigration is a huge business managed by powerful interests to make money and political careers. Among the beneficiaries, Frank Ormsby said, were immigrant smugglers, whose fortunes increased every time a new law enforcement effort was announced, and the Border Patrol, whose budget has increased fivefold in 10 years.
 ''There are so many agents they could stand hand-in-hand across the border and stop illegal immigrants if they really wanted to,'' said Mr. Ormsby from beneath a wide black cowboy hat. ''The money we are spending on the Border Patrol, in gas, in equipment, in technology, what do we have to show for it?''
 ''I see so much waste,'' he added. ''Ray Charles could see it.''
 A couple miles down the road, two sunburned men, their clothes tattered and their lips severely chapped, look the image of needy. Raul Calderon, 60, and his 22-year-old son Samuel, had been walking in the desert heat for four days. 
 Natives of the western Mexican state of Michoacan, they said they had been abandoned by the smuggler -- known among immigrants here as ''coyotes'' -- they had hired on the second day of their journey.
 On the third night, the men said, they lost track of the 10 other people traveling with them in the darkness. And by the fourth morning, they had run out of food and water.
 ''Our government has forgotten about us,'' the father said. Then nodding toward his son, he added, ''Each generation stays as poor as the last.''
 Mr. Calderon said his native town of Churintzio had been nearly emptied by migration to the United States. He himself had gone back and forth across the border for much of the last two decades. But he said he had spent the last five years in Mexico, trying to start his own restaurant. 
 His son, on the other hand, had made enough money working in restaurants between San Antonio and Corpus Christi to return to Michoacan and build a home. Now the two of them were off to the United States again to seek more work, this time in California.
 Mr. Calderon said he had heard that President Bush ''is going to give work permits, and so I have come to get one.''
 He would not, however, get one this day. Border Patrol helicopters buzzed overhead. A few minutes later came the trucks. And without much of an exchange, Mr. Calderon and his son were taken away.
 ''It's like saying we're going to stop crime,'' said a Border Patrol spokesman, Gustavo Soto, when asked whether the presence of the Guard would stop undocumented immigrants from coming. ''It's hard to say that we will be able to stop all people fromcoming across the border. But we can achieve better control.''
 On the Mexican side of the border, Mexican immigration agents said they felt helpless in stopping the immigrants, even though the law prohibits citizens from leaving through unofficial ports.
 Hundreds of people, carrying backpacks and gallon jugs of water, filed into the desert on Thursday. Among them, were Karla and Miguelito, neither one of them more than four feet tall. 
 In a speech cut short so that the migrants could be on their way before sundown, Mario Lopez, an agent in Grupo Beta, a Mexican government agency that seeks to protect the migrants, advised the men, women and children about the dangers of their illegal journey and advised them of their rights in case they were apprehended by the Border Patrol.
 ''This is a sad reality,'' he said. ''We hate to see our people leaving this way. But what can we do, except wish them luck.''

Bush Presses for Legislation
 WASHINGTON, May 20 (Reuters) -- President Bush on Saturday again encouraged the Senate to pass an immigration overhaul bill before its Memorial Day break.
 Mr. Bush used his weekly radio address to increase pressure on senators debating legislation that couples tighter border controls with a guest-worker program and gives a path to citizenship to millions of illegal immigrants.
 ''The House started the debate by passing an immigration bill,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Now the Senate should act by the end of this month, so we can work out the differences between the two bills and Congress can pass a bill for me to sign into law.''
 Democrats, in their weekly radio address, criticized the immigration plan. ''At a time when our country needed a detailed, long-term solution, we instead received short-term window dressing fixes,'' said Representative Michael M. Honda of California, who delivered the address.

HEADLINE: With $4 Billion, Columbia Raises Fund-Drive Ante

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The University of Virginia will announce a $3 billion fund-raising drive in the fall. New York University is in the middle of a $2.5 billion campaign. And officials at Columbia University say they are moving ahead with plans for the largest university campaign so far, a push to raise $4 billion over seven years.
 These efforts are a sign of the fierce competition among major universities as they look to improve their rankings and images, attract students and grab star faculty members. Officials at elite institutions nationwide say that simply to keep up they must build athletic facilities and science centers, pursue research grants and donors, court big-name faculty members and stave off raids, and lay the foundation for eye-popping fund-raising campaigns.
 ''The whole higher education world is in a constant race,'' said Stephen J. Trachtenberg, president of George Washington University and a Columbia alumnus. ''Money is the mother's milk of academic quality, because it pays for the people, which is to say professors and students, through salaries and scholarships, and it pays for the stuff, which is to say computers and libraries and laboratories and classrooms. Everybody needs more all the time.'' 
 Nearly every institution of higher learning feels the pressure, several university executives said, from public universities to the most elite. But for Columbia, competing against the wealthiest institutions of higher education in the nation, pressure is particularly acute.
 Columbia's campaign would be the largest to date, said John Lippincott, president of the Council for Advancement in Support of Education, though he added that he thought a $5 billion campaign could not be far away as institutions' costs continue to rise and as the wealth of potential donors increases. Stanford University completed the first billion-dollar fund-raising drive in 1992.
 ''You almost can't not do this, if everybody else is doing it,'' said David W. Breneman, an economist and the dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. ''The right way to think about campaigns is that these kinds of schools are going to be in one forever.'' 
 According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, which tracks university fund-raising, 22 universities are in drives to raise $1 billion or more.
 The City University of New York is two years into a $1.2 billion fund-raising campaign. Even Harvard, with the largest endowment in the nation, had been planning a new campaign until the resignation of its president, Lawrence H. Summers, put the plans on hold.
 While tuition at elite institutions continues to rise, that income covers less than half the cost of a student's education, said Gordon C. Winston, a professor of economics at Williams College who has studied the finances of higher education for years. ''The subsidies being given to students at the wealthy schools are huge,'' he said, and that is another reason that fund-raising matters.
 Columbia's campaign, which has been quietly under way, but will be announced formally in the next academic year, is part of a drive by its president, Lee C. Bollinger, to overcome the institution's longstanding constraints: space and money to grow. 
 Columbia, which at year's end had an endowment of about $5.2 billion, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers, had far less than Harvard, with $25.5 billion; Yale, $15.2 billion; and Stanford, $12.2 billion.
 ''All these things weave together: larger student body, larger faculty, more space in which to conduct our work,'' said Mr. Bollinger, who wants the campus to expand into Harlem over the next 20 to 30 years, spreading into an area bounded by Broadway to the east, 12th Avenue to the west, 125th Street to the south and 133rd Street to the north. 
 This initiative, known as the Manhattanville expansion, requires the approval of the city and faces strong resistance from residents of the affected community, hundreds of whom gathered outside Columbia's main gate to protest the plan last month.
 Columbia officials also think the university must invest in higher-profile research, trying to protect a leading position in some areas and moving into new ones. To stand among the very best universities, Mr. Bollinger said, ''requires more international students, more courses, more opportunities for students to be exposed to the world, development of new kinds of research capacities.''
 Last year, Mr. Bollinger came under heavy criticism for the way he had handled a showdown in the Middle East studies department when pro-Israel Jewish students complained that they were being intimidated by pro-Palestinian professors. 
 But Mr. Bollinger has weathered that storm, said several professors, including some past critics, and is now likely to be judged on the success of the fund-raising campaign and expansion. To be critical of Mr. Bollinger's leadership at this point, said David Helfand, chairman of the astronomy department, ''would be extremely counterproductive.'' 
 John W. Morgan, a mathematics professor and chairman of the executive committee of the faculty of arts and sciences, said Mr. Bollinger's administration had reached out to include professors in the fund-raising campaign. 
 ''He has taken some steps to try to reassure the faculty, and this has done some good,'' Professor Morgan said. For example, he cited the creation of a faculty fund-raising committee to work with the university's development office to identify needs and speak with potential donors. ''It's a change in attitude.''
 In March, Columbia announced that it had received a $200 million gift to establish a neuroscience center that Columbia officials hope will be part of the Manhattanville expansion. The university also plans to put up a new science building above an existing athletic facility at the corner of Broadway and 120th Street.
 Columbia has also shown a new forcefulness in recruiting faculty members. Last year, to strengthen its economics department, the institution put into effect the expensive strategy of making nearly 20 offers at once to rising-star economics professors around the country. Ten came, some defecting from rivals like Princeton and Harvard.
 ''I don't know that there's any arts and sciences department anywhere, at any time, that has been allowed to be that aggressive,'' said Donald Davis, chairman of the economics department.
 But being aggressive was critical, he said; Columbia needed to be able to tell each prospective faculty member about the others, making the department more attractive. Now the university is preparing a similar push to strengthen the political science department.
 Mr. Bollinger said the university would also invite more professors from other institutions to visit, taking advantage of the fact that many professors would like to live for a period in New York City. 
 ''The New York City factor is worth billions in endowment,'' he said. ''You give me the names of the 10 best people in any field, and I know I can recruit 2 or 3 of them to Columbia.''

HEADLINE: For Many West Virginians, Leaving Is First Step Home

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WILLLIAMSTOWN, W. Va. 

 BODY:
For three decades, Donna Briggs has worked at the West Virginia Welcome Center here not far from the Ohio border, eagerly greeting visitors entering her proud state but wistfully watching as much of the traffic flows the opposite way.
 ''People leave because they have to, not because they want to,'' Ms. Briggs said. ''Looking over your shoulder and missing home is something West Virginians know a lot about.''
Ranked behind South Dakota as having the second smallest population growth of any state, according to 2005 Census Bureau estimates, West Virginia has struggled to hold on to residents since the early 1950's, when layoffs in the coal industry sent people elsewhere looking for work. 
 For West Virginians, the tension between the economic push to leave and the emotional pull to return plays a central role in the state's cultural identity. 
 Just ask a West Virginian about these pressures and they will probably tell you a joke. Like the one that asks why the governor of West Virginia has decided to resign. Answer: because Ford has called its workers back. Or the one about the capital of West Virginia being Akron because of all the West Virginians who moved to Ohio in the 1950's to work in the tire plants.
 But the joke they are most likely to tell is the one in which St. Peter is escorting a soul through heaven and is asked why there is a section that is walled-off. He replies: ''Oh, that's where we put the West Virginians. Otherwise they try to go back home on the weekend.'' 
 The novelist Denise Giardina, a native West Virginian, said the obituary page of The Charleston Gazette, the state's largest newspaper, was the best indicator of the ebb and flow. 
 ''I've lived a lot of places,'' Ms. Giardina said. ''And I don't think I've ever seen an obit page like the Gazette's with as many people who have lived outside their state their entire life but in death have come back home to be buried.''
 For added perspective, listen to traditional West Virginia music.
 In July, Scott Hill, a music historian, will release the second volume of ''The Road Home,'' a compilation of songs about West Virginians longing to return. 
 ''You see it in 'The West Virginia Hills,' which talks about leaving and longing and is the official state song,'' Mr. Hill said. ''You see it in 'Take Me Home, Country Roads,' which is our unofficial state song and is what we sing after major football games.'' 
 He added, ''Coal and people have been our two biggest exports for a long time, which has definitely shaped how we think of ourselves.'' 
 Officials have tried to convince natives to stay and to attract newcomers and investment. In 2001, the state set aside some $30 million to guarantee full in-state tuition to students who met grade-point standards and other testing requirements. 
 Last year, Gov. Joe Manchin III began changing a slogan on some state highway signs from ''Wild and Wonderful'' to ''Open for Business.'' 
 The state has attracted some retirees, but it has had less success in holding on to its young people.
 West Virginia has the oldest median population of any state, and from 1990 to 2000 it had a net loss of about 18,000 people in the 18 to 22 age group. 
 In every year since 1997, resident deaths have outnumbered births, although the population has stabilized around 1.8 million, down from a peak of 2 million in 1950.
 Students in the state often joke that in West Virginia the three R's stand for reading, 'riting and Route 77. The road is nicknamed Hillbilly Highway because over the years it has delivered so many people to surrounding states.
 ''They say that brown-haired people cross the border going one way and white-haired people cross it the other,'' said Bob Henry Baber, the mayor of Richwood. ''But the truth is that most West Virginians of all ages come back continually because they don't feel right anywhere else.'' 
 Richwood, a tiny town about 60 miles east of Charleston in south-central West Virginia, is famous for its Ramp Feed, a traditional feast celebrating the arrival of spring and featuring dishes made with pungent leeks called ramps that grow wild in the state. 
 Each year, the festival draws nearly 1,000 visitors, mostly native West Virginians returning from out of state, Mr. Baber said.
 After living in Pittsburgh for more than 35 years, Sylvia Ghaznavi, who sells used books, returned to her hometown Buckhannon two years ago, taking her bookstore with her.
 With more than 200,000 books, her store -- called Books Books Books -- almost seems out of place in Buckhannon, a town of about 5,800. Her sales are a quarter of what they were before the move, but Ms. Ghaznavi stands by her decision.
 ''I know this will sound odd to outsiders, but the air and the hills here make me feel like I'm where I belong,'' she said, unfazed as a lone customer drifted toward the exit without buying anything. ''I finally reached the point where I was willing to pay whatever price that cost.''
 A deeply rooted loyalty to West Virginia remains with those who move outside the state's boundaries. 
 A couple of years ago, Abercrombie & Fitch came out with a shirt depicting West Virginia as a haven for incest. The Charleston Gazette published an op-ed article denouncing the company and defending the state. It was written by a native West Virginian living in Massachusetts.
 ''It's like the rest of the country fell asleep during geography class,'' said Lionel Jordan, also known as 6'6 240, a popular rapper from Morgantown who now lives in Atlanta. West Virginian pride is one of his themes. 
 ''I say I'm from West Virginia, and they all tell me they have a cousin in Richmond,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''No disrespect to Richmond, but I'm trying to put my state back on the map.''
 Cynthia Olson, who has lived in Vienna, Va., for 11 years, said she and her husband, Steve, were going to put their house up for sale. With jobs that allow them to work from home, she and her husband plan to move to Hillsboro, W. Va., where they own a house on the Greenbrier River. 
 Mrs. Olson is a native of Richwood. Of her home in Virginia, she said, ''You take hiking trips here, and within an hour you are hitting cities and pavement. In West Virginia you enter the wilderness and it goes on and on for hundreds of miles.''
 As for the jokes and negative images, Irene McKinney, West Virginia's poet laureate, said the stereotypes led natives both to leave and to return. 
 Many writers, she said, feel that to be taken seriously by publishers they need to live outside the state. ''But at the same time,'' she said, ''these stereotypes lead many West Virginians to be defensive about their state, which contributes to an us-against-the-world sense of identity.'' 
 ''We're like hound dogs,'' she said. ''We want to roam, but we feel guilty and lost if we stray.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about native West Virginians returning to their home state after time away misidentified the state that had the smallest growth in population from 2000 to 2005. It was North Dakota, not South Dakota. (West Virginia ranks 49th.)

HEADLINE: The Manhattanville Project

BYLINE: By Daphne Eviatar. 
Daphne Eviatar has written widely about economic development. Her last article for the magazine was a profile of Jeffrey Sachs.

 BODY:
One evening in the spring of 2004, the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp attended a presentation at a community board meeting by the celebrated architect Renzo Piano. Unveiling preliminary sketches, Piano laid out his vision for the campus he's designing for Columbia University's president, Lee Bollinger. In contrast to the gated, stone Beaux-Arts-Renaissance campus built more than a century ago in Morningside Heights, the new West Harlem campus would tell a more contemporary story: filling almost 18 acres parallel to the waterfront, it would open Columbia to the surrounding community. Some buildings could reach 25 stories, and the streets would remain publicly accessible. A walkway would extend from 125th to 133rd Streets, cutting through the length of the campus. And in the center of a square of buildings there would be a large, open space. ''It is a piazza,'' Piano said, in his lilting Italian accent. ''The people will come, there will be discourse.'' 
Kooperkamp, the Kentucky-born minister of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in West Harlem, was skeptical. ''You're talking about being a 21st-century university,'' he recalls telling Piano. ''And this looks like 12th-century Christ Church Oxford. It's a quad. That's not a piazza. That's not open space for a community. If it were, it would be a big lawn on 125th Street or Broadway.''
 The dispute over Piano's piazza encapsulates a larger conflict Columbia is now having with its neighbors to the north. When Columbia announced its plans to build a much-needed new campus in a corner of Harlem called Manhattanville, it saw a gritty neighborhood of auto-repair shops, tenements and small manufacturers that would probably pose little obstacle to its ambitions. Columbia says that the project will advance a vital public interest and help revitalize parts of Upper Manhattan. Yet the university has met remarkable resistance. One man's urban improvement, it seems, is another man's urban debacle.
 The divergent views of the project may arise from the very different situations of its beholders. Since becoming Columbia's president in 2002, Bollinger has committed himself to restoring the international stature the university held half a century ago, when Columbia boasted such luminaries as Daniel Bell and Lionel Trilling and almost half the faculty of its physics department either had won or would win a Nobel Prize. To do that, Bollinger's administration has been recruiting hard, hiring, among others, some 10 star economists and 18 science and engineering professors. 
 ''As knowledge grows and fields grow, we need more faculty, you need a certain scale,'' Bollinger says. ''And we need places to put them. Now, a number of young faculty share offices. Our science departments have lab conditions that don't compare to what other top universities have.'' As Bollinger often points out, Columbia has 194 square feet per student; Harvard boasts 368.
 Certainly Columbia's plans are ambitious: across a large swath of Upper Manhattan, the university wants to create an academic enclave that will both nurture intellectual progress and revitalize an urban area. Piano's design aims to accomplish both. The campus will have wide, open streets that offer a broad view of the waterfront. Along the main thoroughfares, the lower floors of the academic buildings will be mostly glass -- ''they will be floating,'' as Piano puts it -- filled with shops, restaurants and arts spaces serving the broader public of Harlem and the Upper West Side. The designs are still preliminary, and plans for specific buildings have yet to be developed. But Piano, who also designed The New York Times's new headquarters, now under construction, and a well-received addition to the Morgan Library, is committed to designing the space to promote these integrationist aims. ''You will feel part of the community,'' Piano told me when we met at Columbia's Prentis Hall, a white-tiled former milk-bottling plant on Manhattanville's southern edge. Indeed, Piano's drawings, on display in the sunny ground-floor workshop, depict transparent skyscrapers lining ample boulevards with ethereal-looking pedestrians ambling along them.
 But in the eyes of many local residents, Piano's optimistic rendering obscures the fact that to fulfill its vision, the university will have to bulldoze almost everything that's already there. About 1,600 people are currently employed in this part of Manhattanville, and some 400 live there. Many residents are disturbed by the placement of the campus between a park being built at the West Harlem Pier and the community that fought for years to have that park created. Meanwhile, most everyone expects that the university's arrival will accelerate the gentrification that is already transforming the historically black neighborhood of Harlem -- to the benefit of some residents and the harm of others. 
 That places Columbia in an awkward position. ''If Columbia were like another private developer, most would say it has no responsibility,'' says Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planning at Columbia. ''Developers are private-sector entities whose purpose is to make money. But Columbia is a nonprofit institution. It gets substantial public benefits and thus has substantial public obligations as a property owner.'' Of course, those public obligations are hard to define. If a development creates thousands of worthwhile new jobs, mostly for outsiders, while eliminating hundreds of local jobs, has it served the public good?
 Bollinger came to Columbia with the respect of many in Harlem who had long regarded the university with suspicion. As president of the University of Michigan, he won renown for defending a challenge to its affirmative-action program all the way to the Supreme Court. And from the start, he presented Columbia's plan as promoting the integration of a public-service-oriented university with its diverse surroundings. ''There was a time when Columbia really turned its back on where it was located,'' Bollinger says. ''I wanted to take exactly the opposite approach.''
 That presented Columbia with a complex architectural challenge. ''A university is a place where young people take a step back from the world so that when they re-enter, they do so with great intensity, care and responsibility,'' says Mark Wigley, dean of Columbia's graduate school of architecture. ''So the university must be a defined space. The fascinating challenge is how to make that a space of withdrawal and reflection and at the same time integrate that space in the richest way possible in the very heart of vibrant New York City.'' In Bollinger's view, that sort of space benefits not only the university but also its neighbors. A hallmark of the new campus will be a center featuring Columbia's impressive array of neuroscientists. Bollinger also wants to bring the School of the Arts to Manhattanville, linking the arts with the physical and the social sciences. ''We're looking for a new kind of intellectual paradigm,'' Bollinger told me, seated in his spacious office in Low Memorial Library, an imposing domed edifice in the center of the Morningside Heights campus. ''Now we don't have the facilities to really achieve this intellectual ambition.'' 
 Columbia has promised to relocate residents directly displaced by its $7 billion plan, which it expects will create nearly 7,000 new jobs over 25 to 30 years -- including academic, technical, maintenance and support positions, plus those at any new restaurants and shops. It has reserved space on the campus for a public school specializing in math, science and engineering. And Bollinger says he's willing to negotiate other benefits, like local hiring preferences. But to Bollinger, who describes his approach to development as ''somewhere between the Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses views of the world,'' the interests of Harlem residents are only one concern among many. ''We are not a profit-making institution looking out for our own advantage,'' he said. ''We are trying to do things that help the world more broadly. The community is not everything.'' Above all, he seems unwilling to compromise on one thing: he wants the entire space. Indeed, Piano's design requires it. Much of the campus is to be built into a sort of bathtub that could reach seven stories underground. ''The factory,'' as Piano calls it, would hide the facility's more noxious needs -- like parking, loading docks and energy equipment -- allowing the campus itself to be serene. 
 Columbia has already purchased more than half the property it would need. But some owners have refused to sell, and Columbia says that eminent domain remains an option if negotiations fail. It's a dicey option, however. Throughout the country, public opposition to eminent domain has mounted since last summer, when the Supreme Court ruled that private property can be seized by local governments for private development. Virtually every state has considered changing its eminent-domain laws; at least 13 different bills on the subject have been introduced in Congress. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in his dissent in the recent Kelo case, concerning New London, Conn., an expansive definition of ''public use'' in the 50's and 60's permitted local governments to eliminate entire minority neighborhoods through eminent domain in the name of ''urban renewal'' -- soon known as ''Negro removal'' among blacks. Not surprisingly, Columbia's talk of seizing property does not go over well in Harlem. Still, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has come out in strong support of eminent domain -- which also figures in the developer Bruce Ratner's controversial efforts to construct a basketball stadium and condos in the Atlantic Yards area of Brooklyn. Without it, ''every big city would have all construction come to a screeching halt,'' Bloomberg said recently.
 It doesn't help Columbia's reputation in Harlem that it wants to use part of the space for a lab with a security clearance that would allow research on highly dangerous substances like anthrax. (Columbia says that it has no plans to actually do such research on the new campus.) Since Sept. 11, many people have warned that such labs could become terrorist targets. And given that Harlem has long been a depository for the city's unwanted environmental hazards -- including a sewage-treatment plant and three-quarters of Manhattan's bus depots -- many residents are immediately suspicious of large government-supported projects. ''You never know when an accident can happen,'' says Sarah Martin, president of the residents' association at a housing development in Manhattanville. ''Where do a lot of deadly viruses come from? They're airborne sometimes. I heard something about the AIDS virus being made in a dish. So that's a possibility.'' Indeed, many are quick to mention an outbreak last year of Legionnaire's disease at the Columbia-affiliated NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital or that Columbia has been fined for mishandling hazardous waste. Local residents also repeatedly reminded me that Columbia scientists participated in the original Manhattan Project -- leading some to dub Columbia's campus plan ''the Manhattanville Project.'' 
 Columbia hopes that the benevolent aims of the institution, and its modern campus featuring open spaces that local residents can enjoy, will eventually assuage local concerns. ''This is creating a neighborhood,'' says Bernard Tschumi, a former dean of Columbia's school of architecture. ''Students bring street life, they bring safety. Maybe not when universities built themselves as fortresses, like Columbia did a century ago. But the attitude today is very different. Renzo and Lee have exactly the right idea.''
 Still, other architecture critics are skeptical. ''If it's driving out existing businesses and driving up real estate prices, then the specific character of the architecture has very little impact,'' says Michael Sorkin, director of the Graduate Urban Design Program at City College. ''I don't think that glassy facades have much to do with the loss of low-cost housing.'' In Sorkin's view, Columbia will have to offer the community more than a pleasing design to address that: ''What they do to mitigate that disruption is a measure of the conscience and intelligence of the university.''
 The greatest fear of West Harlem residents is that they'll eventually be driven out. ''The central thing to understand is that Harlem is terrified of gentrification, and rightly so,'' says Herbert Gans, a Columbia sociologist. Columbia's arrival is only intensifying those fears. ''Columbia is an important cog in the wheel that is driving gentrification in Harlem,'' says Nellie Bailey, executive director of the Harlem Tenants' Council. ''This is not just a neighborhood struggle. What will happen to the city's mosaic if the working and middle class can no longer afford to live here?'' But many, including Gans, think that if the university handles the project well, Columbia could bring much-needed jobs, affordable housing and other improvements to Manhattanville -- an area Gans calls ''an industrial slum.''
 At a packed forum last fall at the Municipal Art Society in Midtown Manhattan, it was clear that Columbia's efforts to win over its neighbors were faring poorly. ''We welcome Columbia to our neighborhood, but not to bulldoze us,'' announced Anne Whitman, owner of a moving and storage business situated in the proposed construction site. It was not possible to know how representative those in attendance were of the Manhattanville community. That said, business owners, planning experts and West Harlem residents alternately described Columbia's plan as ''abysmal,'' ''criminal,'' ''greedy'' and ''heartless.'' At a city hearing a month later, 70 speakers stood up over a period of six and a half hours to denounce ''Hurricane Columbia'' for a plan many claimed would force out longtime residents, eliminate skilled manufacturing jobs, drive up Harlem housing costs and segregate the racially diverse neighborhood. Columbia has presented its new campus designs to a range of West Harlem community organizations. So far, though, the plans don't seem to have calmed their concerns. ''Columbia is going to be between the community and the park,'' says Peggy Shepard, executive director of We Act for Environmental Justice. ''Will people feel comfortable going over there, or will it be only for Columbia students?'' 
 In part, the problem may be that the general public -- and particularly the immediately surrounding neighborhood -- doesn't always view architectural designs the way architects do. ''In theory, a brilliant design can overcome social reservations on the part of the community,'' says Alex Krieger, professor of urban planning and design at Harvard. ''But such conflicts are as much emotional as they are rational. A neighborhood that feels itself disempowered by comparison to the power of a university is always going to have its guard up.'' 
 Given Columbia's history, that guard is particularly high here. In 1968, when much of the world was in turmoil, Columbia University had its own reckoning. Although campus protests were common for the day, the uprising at Columbia was striking for its scale and brutality. And the spark had much to do with a university expansion plan: to construct a gymnasium in Morningside Park in Harlem. In a concession to the community, the university agreed to provide gym facilities for local residents -- with a separate entrance on the Harlem side. 
 The so-called Gym Crow didn't sit well with Harlem neighbors, or with many students on campus. And it fueled tensions over other expansion efforts, as throughout the 60's Columbia had been purchasing apartment buildings all over Morningside Heights, displacing thousands of poor, mostly black and Puerto Rican residents.
 In April 1968, students took over five major campus buildings in protest. A week later, the standoff ended in bloodshed: police stormed the buildings, beating and arresting students. Nearly 200 were injured.
 ''It was a war, and it had devastating consequences,'' Bollinger told me recently. ''Many faculty left because they were bitter that the university had allowed an anti-intellectual group to take down the university; others left because the response was so brutal.''
 Community Board 9, composed of about 50 people appointed by the borough president who represent a broad cross-section of West Harlem residents, activists and business owners, does not oppose Columbia's expansion to West Harlem per se. But it wants Columbia to conform to a very different West Harlem plan that the board has developed -- after community meetings and consultations with urban-planning experts -- over the last decade. In Manhattanville, the board's plan would retain some manufacturing, preserve more historic architecture and allow current property owners to remain. The university would have to build around them. The city, now reviewing both proposals, has asked Columbia and the community board to try to reconcile their differences. 
 That may be difficult. Although Bollinger acknowledges that Columbia has an obligation to its surrounding community, he says he believes that Columbia's nonprofit status also works the other way around: ''We're not here to make money, we're here to discover knowledge. So there's a larger public interest here that's extremely important to keep one's eye on.''
 Columbia has agreed to negotiate with a development corporation and the community board over providing a broad range of benefits. Across the country, such agreements are increasingly encouraging private designs to encompass the concerns of public planning. If successful, the Manhattanville project could become a model for responsible urban development -- balancing the university's global ambitions with some of its neighbors' more immediate concerns. 
 Back when he was championing affirmative action, Bollinger described diversity as ''trying to understand what it is like to be in the mind of another person who has a different life experience.'' The success of his latest endeavor may depend on whether he can generate that kind of empathy now.

HEADLINE: A Company Town Contemplates Life Without the Company 

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: ROUSES POINT, N.Y., May 17 

 BODY:
It lies tucked in a charming neighborhood across from an elementary school, its 30 buildings occupying a large but tidy industrial site where white puffs rise almost discreetly from diminutive smokestacks.
 As much as any large manufacturing plant can blend into a village setting, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals managed it here for decades. As it grew, the company became an all-encompassing benefactor for this unassuming village on Lake Champlain, squeezed into the northeastern corner of New York State at the Canada and Vermont borders.
So when the company said last fall that it was leaving -- wiping out 1,250 well-paying jobs by the end of 2008 -- the news seemed to hit the 2,350 village residents (10 percent of them Wyeth employees) with the force of a hammer blow. Never mind that rumors had preceded the announcement. 
 ''I call it Rouses Point's 9/11,'' said the village's mayor, George A. Rivers. ''I worked there for 41 years as a maintenance supervisor. My wife worked there for 35 years as secretary to the director of research. It's an awful shot in the back.''
 It is hard to overstate the impact of Wyeth's departure on Rouses Point, not to mention the town of Champlain, which surrounds the village, or the wider region. Wyeth employed 1,700 people at its peak in 2000. Even last fall, with 1,250 employees, it was the largest private employer in Clinton County and one of the biggest in the North Country, the sparsely populated region north of Albany.
 Wyeth contributes $110,000 a year to the village in property taxes, representing a quarter of the tax base. But the village actually reaps far more than that each year in revenues because it sells Wyeth electricity and water. 
 Making matters worse, Rouses Point just incurred $7 million in debt to upgrade its electrical substation and replace its water tank to accommodate Wyeth's needs.
 But the blow goes far beyond taxes; it struck at the security that came with living in a company town. When the elementary school was flooded two years ago, Wyeth bought two area rugs to replace the ones that were damaged. Wyeth helped pay for the Fourth of July fireworks and let the firefighters on its payroll drop what they were doing to respond to emergencies.
 Many families are facing a double blow; 90 to 100 households are headed by a mother and father who both work for Wyeth. ''It was devastating,'' said Melissa McManus, the village's director of community development.
 A native of Rouses Point, Ms. McManus is fortunate that none of her relatives work for Wyeth, but she feels for her neighbors, her high school classmates and the parents of her children's classmates. ''Nothing has ever caused me to lose sleep, and both my parents had long illnesses,'' she said. ''But for weeks I couldn't sleep. It's overwhelming.''
 Remarkably, the village and town spent only a short time wallowing in self-pity. Local representatives enlisted state economic development representatives, state labor officials, state and federal lawmakers, local business leaders and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals itself to sit on a committee to address what is euphemistically called the transition. 
 In deciding to close its Rouses Point plant, Wyeth cited a decline in sales of Premarin, the estrogen therapy that has been made here for decades. A landmark study in 2002 found that hormone therapy had serious risks and did not protect against heart disease in postmenopausal women. 
 Virtually everyone here gives Wyeth high marks for the way it is handling the plant's closing. 
 The company has offered severance packages and retirement incentives and held workshops on emotional resilience and resume writing. It has let employees try out new jobs at the plant to develop skills they could use elsewhere when their positions are finally eliminated. In addition to posting job openings at its other plants, Wyeth has a tuition reimbursement program in which employees will be compensated for training or education up to a year after being laid off.
 The three-year phase-out -- which, for some, might feel like an excruciatingly long wake -- is generally viewed as a generous window of opportunity to lure a new company to town. Indeed, Wyeth is actively marketing its site, which expanded to one million square feet today from a single building in the mid-1930's. The plant was originally built by Ayerst, which later merged with Wyeth.
 ''The key for this whole transition is to give the employees and the community time,'' said Robert Vincent, managing director of Wyeth's plant in Rouses Point. ''We're talking with potential buyers, but it's very preliminary.''
 Still, businesses in town are anxious about the implications of Wyeth's closing, particularly if an equally large company fails to materialize. ''It has to impact us,'' said Justin Underwood, a cook at Ole Tymes Cafe in the village. ''People who are used to that lifestyle are not going to settle for lower-paying jobs. I think people will leave.'' 
 Rouses Point officials are not sure whether this is suddenly the worst time, or the best, to plow ahead with plans to revitalize the downtown business district and the Lake Champlain waterfront. 
 Nonetheless, they are busy readying the village for what they hope could be its next incarnation as a tourist destination. Workers are burying every overhead wire in the village, both to avoid a repeat of the power loss that came after a disastrous ice storm in 1998, and to enhance its visual appeal. 
 Envisioning Canadians, Vermonters and, of course, New Yorkers enjoying the lakefront, village leaders are also working with designers on a new pier and exploring the possibility of resurrecting an old swimming beach. They are installing period lighting and making facade improvements in the downtown, which is still dotted with 19th-century buildings. 
 ''Even with the best-case scenario of another high-value business coming in, the reality is you really don't want to have all your eggs in one basket,'' Ms. McManus said. ''The more we can diversify our downtown, the better off we'll be.''

HEADLINE: Stop the Clock. Keep the Problem.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT was only natural for President Bush to boast a bit last week as he signed a bill that locked in one of his biggest tax cuts through the end of 2010.
 ''We reduced taxes for every American who pays income taxes,'' Mr. Bush said in a Rose Garden signing ceremony. ''We doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, created new incentives for small businesses to invest. We put the death tax on the road to extinction.''
But before anybody sighs with relief that their tax cuts are not about to vanish, they may want to look more carefully at what Mr. Bush and the Congress did not do. 
 Lawmakers did not permanently extend any of Mr. Bush's tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 -- not the lower tax rates for individuals, the bigger tax breaks for families with children, a suspension of the estate tax on inherited wealth (the ''death tax,'' as Republicans say) or the tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains. 
 Instead, and only after months of intraparty indecision, Republican leaders extended Mr. Bush's signature tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains for two more years. By accident or by design, the tax cuts for stock investors are now set to vanish on the same day as most of Mr. Bush's other major tax cuts, on Dec. 31, 2010.
 Congress has long employed ''sunset'' dates for tax cuts, routinely renewing provisions year after year. But ''temporary'' tax cuts now occupy a larger share of the total federal budget than ever before. To the extent that the tax cuts are never supposed to expire, which is the way Mr. Bush views them, the sunset dates mask big budget gaps that lie just ahead.
 The problems come in both the short- and long-term varieties. The main short-term problem is the alternative minimum tax, a parallel income tax that is set to engulf tens of millions of middle-class and upper-middle class taxpayers over the next several years.
 The A.M.T. prevents families above a certain income level from using standard tax breaks -- exemptions for children, deductions for state and local tax payments. Because it is not adjusted for inflation and because of the way it interacts with Mr. Bush's own tax cuts, the alternative tax is now expanding at a furious pace.
 But the costs of preventing an expansion are huge, and rising every year. So instead of coming up with a permanent solution to the alternative minimum tax, a goal that Democrats and Republicans all support, Congress merely froze the tax for 2006 at a cost of $34 billion.
 Holding the alternative tax in place for 2007 would cost more than $50 billion, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center and Congressional analysts, and the costs snowball after that. 
 President Bush promised more than a year ago to come up with a comprehensive proposal to deal with the A.M.T. as part of an overhaul of the entire tax code. But even though a presidential advisory group came up with recommendations last fall, Mr. Bush has been so buried in other problems that he has put off any proposals of his own.
 ''We are not on any artificial timetable,'' said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, when asked about the issue in a meeting with reporters last week. ''You only get a chance to do this every couple of decades, so you want to make sure that you are doing it right.''
 But the mounting costs of temporary patches are coinciding with intense political pressure on Republicans to reduce the budget deficit. Despite surprisingly big jumps in tax revenue this year and last, the annual deficit is running at nearly $350 billion because of spending on the war in Iraq, on hurricane relief and on new entitlements like the prescription drug program.
 In a sign of the fiscal pickle that Congress is in, House and Senate Republicans are still haggling about how to extend a dozen crowd-pleasing tax breaks that expired at the end of last year. 
 The list of unfinished business has been pushed into a still-secret ''trailer'' bill that House and Senate Republicans have been negotiating for more than a month. It includes a renewal of tax credits for research and development (at a one-year cost of $10 billion); tax deductions for college tuition ($1.7 billion for one year); a ''saver's credit'' for low-income families ($2.9 billion for three years); and the ''Work Opportunity Tax Credit'' for companies that hire former welfare recipients ($1.3 billion for two years).
 The House and Senate have voted to extend all of those tax breaks. But Senate leaders could not fit them into their main tax bill, which was protected from filibusters under a special budget rule, if they were also to extend the tax cuts for stock investors and freeze the A.M.T. for one more year.
 REPUBLICANS are betting that Democrats will not dare to filibuster against a bill that extends the tuition tax break. But the Senate's wish list of tax-extenders would cost $42 billion over five years, and that is without so much as one extra year of protection from the alternative minimum tax.
 The choices become harder with each year of procrastination. By 2010, according to calculations by the Tax Policy Center, it will cost more to repeal the A.M.T. than it would to repeal the regular income tax. 
 By then, the nation's oldest baby boomers can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits -- the start of a surge in federal old-age entitlement costs that frightens budget experts across the political spectrum.


GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Postponing the Buck''Some of the biggest temporary tax breaks enacted in the first years of the Bush administration have been extended for a year or two, postponing final decisions on their fate. Other measures, like the alternative minimum tax, have also been dealt with on a temporary basis.

As the weather finally catches up with the calendar, it becomes pleasurable again to wander neighborhoods like the historic West Village, filled with charming little restaurants. While no single street there stands out as a restaurant row, West 10th is in the running with options like these. 


CAFE ASEAN
(212) 633-0348; 117 West 10th Street (Greenwich Avenue); $; Article: 10/20/00.
This engaging cafe combines the vogue for Pan-Asian menus with a pleasant, rustic American look and an eager-to-please staff. Indeed, the hardest thing to like about Cafe Asean is the name, pronounced AH-see-ehn, after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The menu is largely Vietnamese, with a scattering of Malaysian and Thai dishes; the Vietnamese are the best bets.

CAFE CONDESA
(212) 352-0050; 183 West 10th Street (West Fourth Street); $; Article: 4/19/06.
This spot opened last month for breakfast, lunch and dinner with a contemporary menu of appetizer-size dishes with Latino touches. The dinner menu offers braised halibut with puree of asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, fingerling potatoes and albondigas in a Spanish tomato sauce with saffron-pine nut rice.

DIABLO ROYALE
(212) 620-0223; 189 West 10th Street (West Fourth Street); $; Article: 7/6/05.
This taqueria with a well-worn look opened last year. The chef, Armando Condado, serves assorted tacos, including roasted pork and pineapple, and seared tuna, and other casual fare like grilled steak with tomatoes and onions.

I TRE MERLI BISTRO
(212) 929-2221; 183 West 10th Street (West Fourth Street); $; Article: 11/5/03.
The simple Italian menu at this tiny offshoot of I Tre Merli in SoHo includes homemade spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce and veal scaloppine Milanese.

JEFFERSON GRILL
(212) 255-3333; 121 West 10th Street (Greenwich Avenue); $; $25 and Under: 10/5/05.
Chef Simpson Wong's restaurant, formerly called Jefferson, reopened last fall with a simpler menu of small plates and lower prices. The serious menu language of Jefferson has been replaced by tongue-in-cheek descriptions. An explosively flavorful dish of scallops and chicken with onions and green peppers is billed as Kung Pow style.

MAREMMA
(212) 645-0200; 228 West 10th Street (Hudson Street); $$; Diner's Journal: 8/5/05.
Maremma lends new meaning to the term ''spaghetti western.'' It fuses cannellini beans and cactuses; bridges Tuscany and Texas; and finds a link between the culinary traditions of Italy and the comfort food of the American Southwest, with dishes like Sloppy Giuseppe, braised oxtail over fettunta; and slow-cooked short ribs with stone-ground grits.

HEADLINE: Searching for a Culprit in the Collapse of 2000 

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN

 BODY:
BECAUSE ''Bubble Man,'' by Peter Hartcher, has a picture of a pensive-looking Alan Greenspan on the book jacket, I figured that this would be an account of Mr. Greenspan's contribution to the 1990's stock market bubble. And for those not inclined to rely on a picture, there was the added clue of the book's subtitle: ''Alan Greenspan and the Missing 7 Trillion Dollars.'' 
 The $7 trillion refers to the recent hole in America's equity portfolio, and we are to infer that Mr. Greenspan, the retired Federal Reserve chairman, is the fellow who caused all that swag to go ''missing.'' 
And there he is on Page 5, warning that America's exuberance for stocks is tending toward the irrational. We have another Greenspan sighting on Page 19; he pops up again on Page 24. 
 Then -- poof! -- he is gone, like a marquee actor patiently awaiting his scene. Mr. Hartcher, meanwhile, indulges in a retelling of the stock bubble, which he terms ''the biggest speculative mania the world has seen.'' He also thinks that it was an ''aberration without precedent'' (which it was not) and ''the most costly event in the history of the U.S.'' -- a claim that would be hard to define, yet alone verify. 
 So back we are in the giddy years of hot stock offerings and piggish chief executives, but where did Alan go? Mr. Hartcher cites a familiar list of culprits, like the media and Wall Street. (He lets investors themselves off the hook.) On Page 74, his narrative finally chances upon the Federal Reserve. So this is when we get to Mr. Greenspan. But no. First (improbably): ''A word on Al Qaeda.'' 
 When, finally, the author encounters his subject, he has an interesting and novel thesis. His material is not, for the most part, original; he generously quotes from virtually everyone else (including me) who has written on the subject. But where he goes with it is his own.
 For Mr. Hartcher, the moment of truth came in December 1996, in a famous speech in which the Fed chief rhetorically asked whether stock prices were becoming ''irrational.'' His audience -- some 1,300 dinner guests of a Washington think tank -- missed his meaning and regarded the speech as a snoozer. But Wall Street got it; the market tanked the very next day. Mr. Hartcher demonstrates that this was no accident -- Mr. Greenspan had purposefully inserted the phrase in the hope of cooling off a market that he regarded, already, as worrisomely bubbly.
 Alas, after that brief flirtation with caution, the bull market resumed. Mr. Hartcher's central question is why Mr. Greenspan did nothing more to stop it. He quotes Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel economist and author: If Mr. Greenspan ''thought share prices were heading out of control -- if he feared the wider effects of a bubble -- why didn't he go ahead and act?'' 
 Arguably, to pre-empt then would have been premature. The Dow Jones industrial average was at only 6,400, the Nasdaq at a mere 1,300. The bubble to which Mr. Hartcher's title refers, and which ultimately elevated the Dow to 11,700, had, in hindsight, barely begun. 
 But this is a quibble. Admittedly, Mr. Greenspan should have put the brakes on at some point, probably late in 1998, when new technology issues, led by eBay, began to double in a day. This was when the new economy became crazy. 
 Mr. Hartcher says Mr. Greenspan, master politician and media manipulator that he conjures him to be, compromised his beliefs out of a politically expedient desire to retain the support of, variously, President Bill Clinton, Senator Trent Lott, the rest of Congress and the share-crazed public. 
 Even in that 1996 address, Mr. Greenspan observed that monetary policy independence ''is conditional on pursuing policies that are broadly acceptable to the American people.'' Thus, Mr. Hartcher argues, Mr. Greenspan suppressed his own deep misgivings about the bubble out of ''Machiavellian'' cunning. The author quotes a former Fed deputy, Alice M. Rivlin, as saying that ''Greenspan doesn't like to lose, and if he thinks he'll lose, he switches sides.'' 
 He was, in short, a coward. But this seems unlikely. The onetime dance band clarinetist was no shrinking violet, and as Fed chief, he bucked convention more than most. Nor did his faith in markets develop overnight. A youthful disciple of Ayn Rand and a free-market purist, Mr. Greenspan was ever skeptical of regulation, and this other, ideological Alan never disappeared from view. 
 While the prudent Alan was issuing a warning to traders, the exuberant Alan was already smitten with the conceits of the new economy. As early as his famous speech, the Fed chief was wondering -- thoughtfully and, at times, brilliantly -- how the 90's economy was able to grow at such an auspicious pace without stoking inflation. And because inflation -- not stock prices -- was his primary responsibility, he was hesitant to intervene. 
 The author rightly faults Mr. Greenspan for reassuring the public as the market climbed to the stratosphere, implicitly offering investors the false comfort that he could protect them from loss. 
 In a speech on March 6, 2000, four days from the peak, Mr. Greenspan celebrated both the technological and financial miracles writ in Silicon Valley and offered this clinker: ''I see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peter out any time soon.'' 
 Yet far from proving that Mr. Greenspan had all the answers and cynically disregarded them, as Mr. Hartcher maintains, such embarrassing quotations merely suggest that the Fed chairman was as wrong as everyone else. 
 Mr. Hartcher labors hard to show that Mr. Greenspan's mistakes caused enduring damage. The problem, of course, is that most of the $7 trillion is no longer missing and that the economy, too, has recovered. 
 Perhaps this explains Mr. Hartcher's long and curious preamble: first remind us how bad the bubble was, then indict Mr. Greenspan as its author. But it is one thing to ''cause'' a bubble, yet another to fail to prevent it while also presiding over 18-plus mostly prosperous years. 
 Mr. Hartcher suggests that the recovery is itself illusory -- purchased with foreign credit and stimulated by a new bubble in housing. And who can prove that a new crash isn't around the corner? I am in a real sweat over it myself. But in the meantime, this overwrought smear does not quite have the goods.

THERE is something terribly seductive about the notion of a mercenary army. Perhaps it is the inevitable response of a market economy to a host of seemingly intractable public policy and security problems. 
 Consider only a partial list of factors that would make a force of latter-day Hessians seem attractive. Among them are these:
Growing public disenchantment with the war in Iraq;
 The prospect of an endless campaign against global terrorism; 
 An over-extended military backed by an exhausted, even depleted force of reservists and National Guardsmen;
 The unwillingness or inability of the United Nations or other multinational organizations to dispatch adequate forces to deal quickly with hideous, large-scale atrocities (see Darfur and Congo); 
 The expansion of American corporations into more remote, fractious and potentially hostile settings.
 Just as the all-volunteer military relieved the government of much of the political pressure that had accompanied the draft, so a rent-a-force, harnessing the privilege of every putative warrior to hire himself out for more than he could ever make in the direct service of Uncle Sam, might relieve us of an array of current political pressures. 
 In the areas of logistics and support, this proposition is already more than theoretical. In addition to the roughly 130,000 American troops now serving in Iraq, private contractors have their own army of approximately 50,000 employees performing functions that used to be the province of the military. The army used to cook its own meals, do its own laundry, drive its own trucks. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Pentagon reduced American armed forces by some 36 percent, anticipating a peace dividend that was never fully realized.
 So, if there are personnel shortages in the military (and with units in their second and third rotations into Iraq and Afghanistan, there are), then what's wrong with having civilian contractors? Expense is a possible issue; but a resumption of the draft would be significantly more controversial.
 Moreover, contractors provide the bodyguards (most of them veterans of the American, British, Australian, Nepalese or South African military) and, in some cases, the armored vehicles and even helicopters that have become so necessary for the conduct of business by foreign civilians in Iraq. Such protective services are employed by practically every American news agency and, indeed, are responsible for the security of the American ambassador himself. 
 So, what about the inevitable next step -- a defensive military force paid for directly by the corporations that would most benefit from its protection? If, for example, an insurrection in Nigeria threatens that nation's ability to export oil (and it does), why not have Chevron or Exxon Mobil underwrite the dispatch of a battalion or two of mercenaries? 
 Chris Taylor, the vice president for strategic initiatives and corporate strategy for Blackwater USA, wanted to be sure I understood that such a thing could only happen with the approval of the Nigerian government and at least the tacit understanding of Washington. But could Blackwater provide a couple of battalions under those circumstances? ''600 people in a battalion,'' he answered. ''I could source 1,200 people, yes. There are people all over the world who have honorably served in their military or police organizations. I can go find honorable, vetted people, recruit them, train them to the standard we require.''
 It could have the merit of stabilizing oil prices, thereby serving the American national interest, without even tapping into the federal budget. Meanwhile, oil companies could protect some of their more vulnerable overseas interests without the need to embroil Congress in the tiresome question of whether Americans should be militarily engaged in a sovereign third world nation.
 There are limits, of course. None of these security companies is likely to undertake the full-scale military burden presented by an Iran or a North Korea. But their horizons are expanding. Cofer Black, formerly a high-ranking C.I.A. officer and now a senior executive with Blackwater USA, has publicly said that his company would be prepared to take on the Darfur account. 
 At whose expense and to what ultimate end is not altogether clear. But Blackwater and other leading security companies are seriously proposing to officials at very high levels of the government that their private forces could relieve a number of the burdens now being shouldered (or not) by American troops. The underlying theory seems to be that where a host government is unable to protect American business interests overseas and where the American government may be reluctant or unable to intervene, there is another option conveniently available.
 The Pentagon, which is anything but enamored of the prospect of private armies operating outside its chain of command, is nonetheless struggling to come to terms with what it now calls ''the long war.'' There is every expectation that the fight against global terrorism and the most extreme forms of Islamic fundamentalism will last for many years. This is a war that will not necessarily require aircraft carriers, strategic bombers, fighter jets or heavily armored tanks. It will certainly not enable the United States to exploit its advantages in nuclear weapons.
 It is a war, indeed, that favors the highly mobile and adaptive fighting skills of the former Special Forces soldiers and other ex-commandos who have already taken early retirement from the military in order to serve their country less directly, if more profitably.
 The United States may not be about to subcontract out the actual fighting in the war on terrorism, but the growing role of security companies on behalf of a wide range of corporate interests is a harbinger of things to come. Is what's good for companies like Exxon Mobil, Freeport-McMoRan (the mining company that has paid the Indonesian military to maintain security) or even General Motors necessarily good for the United States? 
 The other morning on NBC's ''Today'' program, Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive of Exxon, was asked by Matt Lauer if his company would consider lowering profits to help consumers this summer. Mr. Tillerson had the good manners not to laugh. ''We work for the shareholder,'' he said, adding, ''Our job is to go out and make the most money for those people.''
 What then if the commercial interests of a company or foreign government hiring one of these security contractors comes into conflict with the interests of the United States government? Mr. Taylor of Blackwater doesn't even concede the possibility. ''At the end of the day,'' he said, ''we consider ourselves responsible to be strategic partners of the U.S. government.'' To which he then added, perhaps a little more convincingly: ''If we went against U.S. government interests we would never get another contract.''
 It is, however, an evolving relationship that requires far greater scrutiny. There is, in the final analysis, no direct chain of command from the government to units of Blackwater or other security companies that have been hired by private corporations or foreign governments. Chris Taylor insists: ''We are accountable. We are transparent.'' That's debatable. But, he adds: ''Given the global war on terror, this is a way that a lot of these retirees (from the military) can contribute. We want to have a discussion into how we fit into the total solution set.''
 By all means. Let the discussion begin.

HEADLINE: No Restful Sabbatical For Journalism Fellows 

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
A yearlong journalism fellowship at Stanford University is supposed to provide a break from the news business, a relaxing time to think big thoughts, recharge your batteries and enjoy diversions like horseback riding on the sunny Palo Alto, Calif., campus. 
 But this year, not even the blissed-out Stanford fellows could escape the exigencies of the newspaper business. Of the seven fellows who came from American dailies, five worked at papers where buyouts were offered, and one took the offer. The papers of two were sold out from under them.
 ''It was pretty disconcerting,'' said James R. Bettinger, director of the John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional Journalists at Stanford. ''It's an indicator of the economic turmoil that's going on in the news business.''
 Only one of the fellows, Ivan Penn, who was a reporter at The Baltimore Sun, took a buyout. But the others were forced to confront their futures at a time when they had expected to be decompressing. 
 Mr. Bettinger said that the industry's woes had heightened everyone's concerns and prompted him to conclude that ''taking a complete break from journalism isn't going to happen anymore.''
 Karen de Sa, 39, a reporter for The San Jose Mercury News, said she had been treated well by the paper and did not consider taking a buyout, but then Knight Ridder sold The Mercury News to MediaNews. That made her think about gearing up for job interviews.
 Ms. de Sa also said that she had gained some perspective by learning about the experiences of some of the Knight fellows from abroad, who face death threats and imprisonment for their journalism if they go home. ''It makes you realize how fortunate we are, even as we deal with all this industry mayhem,'' she said. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

HEADLINE: Question: Who Is MediaNews's Dean Singleton?

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: SUNDANCE, Utah 

 BODY:
William Dean Singleton, the maverick chief executive of the MediaNews Group, had a special announcement for the editors of his 55 daily newspapers when they met in this rustic mountain resort early in May.
 ''We're buying Gannett,'' he deadpanned.
 In the seconds before he acknowledged the joke, the editors fell silent. Mr. Singleton is just brash enough, and has been on just enough of a newspaper-buying spree, that making a move on the biggest newspaper company in the country was not entirely implausible. After all, he had been in the hunt for Knight Ridder's 32 dailies and wound up plunking down $1 billion for four of them. And he has bid for two more big ones, The Inquirer and The Daily News in Philadelphia.
 ''It wasn't that far-fetched,'' said Becky Bennett, editor of Public Opinion in Chambersburg, Pa. ''He's pulled rabbits out of hats before.'' 
 Mr. Singleton, 54, a bantam figure with flinty blue eyes, is indeed thought of as something of a magician in the newspaper world -- having transformed himself from the son of a ranch hand in a tiny town in Texas to a media baron who now controls a newspaper empire that sprawls from coast to coast. He has, in a manner of speaking, sawed many of his competitors in half, only to have them hop off the table and become his partners.
 His company, the privately held MediaNews based in Denver, owns 55 dailies including The Denver Post, The Detroit News, The Daily News of Los Angeles and The Berkshire Eagle, plus more than 100 nondailies. With the addition of the Knight Ridder papers -- The San Jose Mercury News, The Contra Costa Times and The Monterey County Herald, all in California, and The St. Paul Pioneer Press -- MediaNews has become the nation's fourth-biggest newspaper company, up from seventh.
 For his next trick, Mr. Singleton hopes to lead the industry into a prosperous future as it seeks its footing in an increasingly Web-based world. This may be his most daring act yet. The newspaper business is in the midst of transformation, and no one, including Mr. Singleton, really knows what it is transforming into or how long it may take.
 The big challenge, he says, is figuring out how to make money from the Web, where most news is free and ads are cheap. ''If we don't start getting paid for news, we can't continue to afford to produce it,'' he said.
 Mr. Singleton wants to help steer the industry collectively toward a solution; no one paper, he says, can do it alone. 
 He may seem an unlikely captain for this effort. He earned a reputation as a merciless cost-cutter early in his career and is still known for ''clustering'' properties -- buying contiguous papers so he can combine back-office and even editorial operations.
 The performance of his papers is uneven -- some are profitable, others less so; some are adding pages, others are shrinking news space; some, like The Detroit News, have become bright and Web-like (he calls Detroit ''the paper of the future'') while others are burdened by old presses and poor color reproduction.
 John McManus, the director of GradetheNews.org, at the journalism school of San Jose State University in California, said many of Mr. Singleton's papers were low-wage and mediocre, and allowed advertisements to bleed all too easily into news content. But he does not underestimate Mr. Singleton's ambition.
 ''He aspires to be a mogul in the ranks of Pulitzer and the Hearst of old, and I think he's going to achieve it,'' Mr. McManus said. 
 Partly as a result of added expenses, MediaNews posted a loss of $3.6 million for the first three months of the year, in contrast to net income of $2.3 million in the quarter last year. The losses came on revenue of $208.4 million, compared with $184.7 million a year earlier.
 Mr. Singleton began buying newspapers in the 1970's, and his first major effort, reviving The Fort Worth Press, backfired. He closed it three months later. As he bought more papers, he stripped them down, laid people off and used the cash to buy more papers, almost all of them failing dailies that no one else wanted. Sometimes he saved them and sometimes, notably in Houston and Dallas, he let them die.
 He and Richard Scudder, now 93, a newsprint manufacturer in New Jersey, founded MediaNews in 1983; each of their families owns 45 percent of the company, with the remaining 10 percent owned by outside investors. He said he would never dream of taking the company public because having Wall Street dictate to him ''would drive me nuts.''
 These days, Mr. Singleton no longer looks at distressed properties. Instead, he is pouring $500 million into new printing presses around the country and building airy newsrooms for his employees. 
 Indeed, Mr. Singleton intends to make a showcase of The San Jose Mercury News, in the heart of Silicon Valley, as a kind of laboratory for how to meld print with the Web. He is so excited about the prospects that he plans to buy a home in the Bay Area, while keeping his primary residence in Denver.
 ''All the issues we're dealing with as an industry happened first in San Jose and are more dramatic in San Jose,'' he said in an interview. ''And if you begin to find solutions to the dramatic changes that are going on there, you've found them for all newspapers.''
 Mr. Singleton has also started free youth-oriented supplements and Spanish-language editions in a number of markets, acting with an energy, admirers say, seldom seen on the print landscape.
 ''The industry needs Dean Singleton,'' said Peter Appert, a media analyst with Goldman Sachs. ''It needs someone who is still passionate about the business.''
 Mr. Singleton's freedom from Wall Street has given him the flexibility to convert competitors into partners, usually through complex financial deals. He achieved this in Denver and Salt Lake City by driving the competition -- The Rocky Mountain News and The Deseret News, respectively -- into joint operating agreements with his Denver Post and Salt Lake Tribune. He is also partners with Gannett and the Stephens Media Group, and they share ownership of several newspapers. 
 ''You'll see us more and more working with other companies, both print companies and online companies,'' Mr. Singleton said, including Google and Yahoo, in a strategy he calls ''sleeping with the enemy.''
 Most recently, and strikingly, he enlisted the Hearst Corporation, which owns The San Francisco Chronicle, his chief rival, to help him buy Knight Ridder papers, completing a ring of 30 papers around San Francisco.
 ''He is an astonishing story,'' said Donald E. Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company, who has watched Mr. Singleton assemble his empire from scratch. ''There have been lots of people who have invested in newspapers and some who have started a group, but Dean is the only person in our lifetime who has done that.''
 Once a year, Mr. Singleton has been taking his editors on retreats, usually at one of his ranches in Colorado (he owns four). They include mountain hikes at dawn and raucous skits satirizing the newspaper business. This year's skit featured Mr. Singleton in a turban and swami outfit as his editors sang their own lyrics to ''Do You Know the Way to San Jose?'' (''Writers here/are thinking fast/of parking cars/and pumping gas.'')
 For some, that may have been painfully close to the truth. The Mercury News has been through considerable turmoil since the dot-com bust. Mr. Singleton said he had no plans to reduce the staff, change the guard or consolidate operations in the Bay Area under one roof. But Luther Jackson, executive officer of the San Jose Newspaper Guild, which represents news employees at The Mercury News, said they remained wary of Mr. Singleton and his practice of clustering.
 Skeptics like Mr. McManus at San Jose State said that while local editors had autonomy, they had to work within budgets handed down by Mr. Singleton. And he said he expected Mr. Singleton to lie low until any threat of an antitrust challenge to his Bay Area holdings passed and then begin to achieve economies of scale.
 While Mr. Singleton said he had no worries about antitrust violations, the Justice Department and the California attorney general's office are reviewing his arrangements.
 Mr. Singleton received a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in 1986. He travels constantly, but his walk has slowed and he says that sometimes his legs give out, leaving him to shuffle or just sit still. This has led some to suggest that his investments in the business stem from a desire for a positive legacy.
 ''He's paving his way to heaven,'' said David M. Cole, editor of NewsInc., a newsletter about the industry. ''He's trying to salve the wounds of Dallas and Houston, and the cuts he made in newspapers that upon reflection maybe he shouldn't have made.''
 Mr. Singleton dismissed such speculation, and so do his editors. Greg Moore, former managing editor of The Boston Globe whom Mr. Singleton tapped to become editor of The Denver Post, said Mr. Singleton was driven not by wanting to change his legacy but by sheer competitiveness. 
 ''He's had to scrape and scratch for everything he's ever gotten,'' Mr. Moore said. ''He loves a good fight. That's what drives him. It's about competition and winning.'' 


CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about Dean Singleton, the chief executive of the MediaNews Group, referred incorrectly to his management of The Dallas Times Herald. Mr. Singleton sold the newspaper before it was closed; he did not let it ''die.'' The article also referred incorrectly to a joint operating agreement between his paper, The Salt Lake Tribune, and its competitor, The Deseret News. The agreement existed before Mr. Singleton bought The Tribune; he did not force the The News into it.

HEADLINE: Investors to Acquire Parent of Nielsen

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, May 21 

 BODY:
A group of private investors said Sunday that their 7.7 billion euro ($9.7 billion) bid for the Dutch publishing company VNU, owner of Nielsen Media Research, which compiles television ratings, has succeeded. 
 The investors, who operate under the name Valcon Acquisition, said that 78.7 percent of VNU's shareholders had tendered their shares at the offer price of 29.50 euros ($37.15) a share.
The group had aimed at 80 percent of shares, but said Sunday it would waive that condition.
 VNU's fate has been uncertain since November, when Knight Vinke Asset Management and other mostly American institutional shareholders blocked VNU's $6.8 billion bid to buy IMS Health Inc. -- a show of strength unheard of in the Netherlands, where shareholders have no history of activism.
 VNU's chief executive, Rob van den Bergh, promised to resign after the IMS Health deal collapsed, but he continued to serve while the company sought a successor, and eventually entered talks with the buyout consortium.
 VNU, which has most of its business in the United States, does marketing research under the Nielsen brand name and publishes Billboard and Hollywood Reporter magazines.

HEADLINE: PRESSED BY U.S., EUROPEAN BANKS LIMIT IRAN DEALS

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
Prodded by the United States with threats of fines and lost business, four of the biggest European banks have started curbing their activities in Iran, even in the absence of a Security Council resolution imposing economic sanctions on Iran for its suspected nuclear weapons program.
 Top Treasury and State Department officials have intensified their efforts to limit Iran-related activities of major banks in Europe, the United States and the Middle East in the past six months, invoking antiterrorism and banking laws. They have also traveled to Europe and the Middle East to drive home the risky nature of dealing with a country that has repeatedly rebuffed Western demands over suspending uranium enrichment, and to urge European countries to take similar steps.
Stuart A. Levey, the under secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said: ''We are seeing banks and other institutions reassessing their ties to Iran. They are asking themselves if they really want to be handling business for entities owned by a government engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and support for terrorism.'' 
 The four European banks -- the UBS and Credit Suisse banks of Switzerland, ABN Amro of the Netherlands, and HSBC, based in London -- have made varying levels of disclosure about the limits on their activities in Iran in the past six months. Almost all large European banks have branches or bureaus in the United States, units that are subject to American laws. 
 American officials said the United States had informed its European allies about the new pressure exerted on the banks, and indeed had asked these countries to join the effort. At the same time, the Americans have not publicized the new pressure, partly out of concern it could complicate efforts by European negotiators, who were still talking with Iran about a package of incentives to suspend uranium enrichment.
 It is not clear how curbed business with four of Europe's biggest banks could adversely affect Iran. But some outside political and economic experts say it is unlikely to do much damage considering Iran is one of OPEC's leading producers and is earning hundreds of millions of dollars worth of windfall profits daily from $70-a-barrel petroleum.
 The American prodding has not yet resulted in any fines or other punishment. But UBS and ABN Amro are no strangers to the sting of American financial penalties for dealing with countries that the United States has wanted to isolate. UBS was fined $100 million by the Federal Reserve two years ago for the unauthorized movement of dollars to Iran and other countries like Libya and Yugoslavia, which were subject to American trade sanctions at the time. Last December, ABN Amro was fined $80 million for failure to comply with regulations against money laundering and with economic sanctions against Libya and Iran from 1997 to 2004. 
 UBS now says it will no longer do direct business with any individuals, businesses or banks in Iran. UBS also says it will not finance exports or imports for any corporate clients in Iran. But the bank has said that it would not stop doing business with clients who use other means to transact business there. ABN Amro also says it has minimized its activities in Iran.
 ''We have no representation in Iran,'' said Sierk Nawijn, a spokesman for ABN Amro in Amsterdam. He added that although the bank does no dollar-based business with Iran, it was participating in ''a fairly limited number of transactions'' with it.'' 
 Georg Sontgerath, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Zurich, said, ''As of January, we have said that we will not enter into any new business relations with corporate clients in Iran.'' He said the decision, which applied to Syria and some other countries, resulted from an assessment of an ''increased economic risk for our bank and our clients.''
 He said, however, that the bank would fulfill existing contracts with businesses in Iran.
 A United Nations Security Council resolution might restrict some of those kinds of dealings.
 The Americans have taken other steps to pressure Iran. With American encouragement, Iran's rating as a business risk was raised last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 30 leading countries with market economies.
 At the same time, the defiance of the West by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has unsettled markets, and American officials have said the climate of anxiety over the prospect of globally enforced sanctions -- or even military action -- was having its own effect.
 ''I think there is a real and growing sense that there's a risk associated with doing business with Iran, with lending Iran more money or providing it with a line of credit,'' said Robert G. Joseph, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security. ''But I would argue that their motive is market forces, more than any American pressure.''
 Some European diplomats from countries with missions in Tehran say that there are signs of an impact, despite the rise in oil prices.
 Whatever the cause, Iran's economic growth has slowed to less than 5 percent, its stock market has dropped more than 20 percent in the past year, new investments and construction have declined, and Iranians have been sending their money abroad, or buying gold. 
 Iran has recently tried to counter diplomatic pressures over its nuclear program with reminders to Europe that it was a good market, with a good work force. In a regular weekly news conference on Sunday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamidreza Assefi, urged Europe not to take any steps that would jeopardize economic links with Iran. 
 ''We have good ties with Europe, and a bad decision by Europeans over Iran's nuclear program can undermine relations and will eventually harm the Europeans,'' he said. 
 Many experts said it would be difficult to bar banks from conducting the lucrative business of financing trade deals with Iran. Iran's largest trading partners are Japan, China, Italy, Germany and France. All of those nations have companies that use banks to finance letters of credit to export machinery, commodities and other goods to Iran.
 The laws being applied against banks are varied, and many of them also apply to North Korea, Syria, Cuba and Sudan. A 1984 law requires a ban on activities with any country declared a sponsor of terrorism. Officials are also invoking the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 and a directive signed by President Bush last year banning transactions with those suspected of helping the spread of unconventional weapons.
 Under that directive, the United States has identified six Iranian entities, including its Aerospace Industries Organization, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and several private industrial groups, as off limits to banks that operate under American protections and laws.
 Mr. Joseph said the use of American banking regulations and antiterrorism laws against European banks had been effective against Iran and would have a greater effect ''if we can get other countries to take similar actions.'' 
 Some experts say they doubt that anything short of a sweeping oil embargo, or a blockade of gasoline imports -- Iran imports about 40 percent of its gasoline -- could get Iran to change its behavior, and the West is not contemplating such steps.
 ''I don't see that the pullout of a few European banks doing a tremendous amount of damage,'' said Karim Sadjadpour, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, an advocacy organization. ''They're making $300 million a day from oil revenues, and they can weather the storm.''

PERSON: Clarence Ray Nagin

HEADLINE: New Start for Familiar Face -- Clarence Ray Nagin

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 21 

 BODY:
As he delivered his victory speech on Saturday night, Mayor C. Ray Nagin was interrupted by an overexuberant supporter.
 ''Ladies and gentleman, somebody put a muzzle on this brother to my right,'' Mr. Nagin said coolly, breaking into his own speech. He went right on into a quick litany of thank-yous, wisecracks, self-mocking reproaches and appeals for peace.
 Mr. Nagin was as unruffled in his victory as he had been facing defeat, better-financed opponents, a cataclysmic flood, the defection of onetime supporters, the partial destruction of his city and skeptical reporters. 
 ''I'm on my boogie board,'' he said on Sunday after Mass at the historic St. Peter Claver Church in the Treme neighborhood. ''I'm just going to keep on riding.'' 
 Mr. Nagin is a mayor who has elevated being cool to a policy as well as a style. He improvises on the stump and -- some former staff members say -- in his second-floor suite at City Hall as well. Critics say this has served him and his city only intermittently well during his first four years, as some promises failed to materialize, crucial staff members frequently left or were forced out and the road through Hurricane Katrina and after proved rough.
 On Sunday, Mr. Nagin promised a new beginning, a different staff and an economic boom once federal reconstruction money started flowing, perhaps by late summer. 
 ''We now have the economic stimulus that will happen at unprecedented levels in the city, for us to expand the economic pie and for everyone to get a piece of that pie,'' Mr. Nagin said at a news conference. ''This is our shot. This is our time.''
 Though he did not address during the campaign the central issue of whether some ruined neighborhoods should be abandoned, he hinted on Sunday for the first time that this might happen by default. The difficulties of reconstruction in some areas could make rebuilding an enormous task, he suggested.
 ''Reality is setting in, in a lot of neighborhoods,'' Mr. Nagin said. ''People are going back and saying: 'Wow, that's pretty awesome. I'm not sure whether I can rebuild in this area.' ''
 For all the post-election exuberance, however, Mr. Nagin's own complicated trajectory -- before, during and since the hurricane -- offers only ambiguous confirmation of his brighter vision for the city and his administration of it.
 On Aug. 28, 2005 -- the day before Hurricane Katrina hit -- Mr. Nagin's most notable accomplishments to date were to have run an administration largely free of scandal and to have removed politics from municipal contracting.
 In a city with a small economy, where the budget had for years represented an irresistible temptation to City Hall's friends, relatives and hangers-on, this was considered no small thing, and Mr. Nagin seemed a safe bet for re-election the next year.
 Less passive accomplishments were harder to identify, however. He came into office in 2002 a political unknown, the highly paid head of Cox Cable in New Orleans whose long ascent from humble beginnings in the Sixth Ward had not carried him into the intersecting inner circles of cash and politics in the city.
 He was divorced from the alphabet soup of black political organizations that dominated politics for years in this city. And he set himself up as a dragon slayer, going after what was widely perceived -- and partly confirmed by subsequent investigations -- as a municipality for sale.
 Political professionals at first considered him a long shot, just as they did this year when his post-hurricane gaffes had apparently sunk him low. But Mr. Nagin astonished the professionals and everyone else in 2002 when he came in first. And now he has astonished them again.
 Clarence Ray Nagin was born on June 11, 1956, at Charity Hospital, to a father who cut fabric in a clothing factory and a mother who ran a lunch counter. Mr. Nagin attended an integrated high school but went to college at Tuskegee University in Alabama, one of the most venerable of the nation's historically black institutions and one with a distinctive ethic of personal success. 
 Still today, Mr. Nagin's rhetoric is infused with a worshipful regard for business acumen and the private sector, an attitude that initially endeared him to the white executives who mostly deserted him after Hurricane Katrina.
 But some of Mr. Nagin's grand, market-oriented ideas, like selling the airport or developing the riverfront, stalled. A drive to crack down on municipal corruption that was Mr. Nagin's calling card in 2002 resulted in little more than the arrest of some cab drivers and city employees accused of abusing the permit system for taxis.
 His staff choices have generally been reckoned unsuccessful, ranging from a chief administrative officer fired early in his administration, Kimberly Williamson Butler, who wound up in jail this spring after defying state judges, to the police chief, Edwin P. Compass III, who gained international notoriety during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina for exaggerating the extent of the city's anarchy. He, too, was let go.
 Many of these difficulties, insiders and observers say, stem from a businessman's habit of going it alone and not consulting others. Mr. Nagin seemed to half acknowledge this difficulty at the Sunday news conference, though he minimized it. ''It's just my style that gets people to calling me a lone wolf,'' he said.
 Those close to Mr. Nagin, while acknowledging some of his political faults, say that now, with unprecedented offers of help pouring into New Orleans, the mayor has a renewed chance at helping his city.
 ''Pre-Katrina it was hard to get good people in government service,'' said John Georges, a longtime friend who runs a food distribution business. ''He never really attracted a good team. I think he's got a huge opportunity to bring in the right team. More people than ever are willing to serve.''
 Still, for all his conciliatory talk on Sunday, Mr. Nagin proved again that he had not lost his ability to throw verbal bombs.
 Responding to a provocative suggestion that businessmen might now leave New Orleans because of his re-election, Mr. Nagin showed a rare flash of anger.
 ''In breaking down the corrupt, bankrupt political system in New Orleans, I had to do it in a systematic way,'' he said. ''The first piece was the political community. The next piece was kind of the religious community. The next piece was the business community. And the business community now has to make a decision, if they want to participate in a new paradigm, a paradigm that says, 'We're not going to be like the New Orleans of old. We're going forward.' ''
 Mr. Nagin added: ''If they opt out of that, where are they going to go? Where are they going to find a New Orleans of 1840?''

European Banks Curb Activities in Iran
Under prodding from the United States, some European banks have started curbing their activities in Iran, even in the absence of a Security Council resolution imposing economic sanctions on Iran for its suspected nuclear arms program. A1

Iran has become an increasing focus of interest in a three-year-old effort known as the Proliferation Security Initiative, under which the United States and cooperating countries carry out military and naval exercises aimed at stopping nuclear materials and contraband. A8

Rogues Hurt Iraq Police 

An American effort to rebuild the Iraqi police, undermanned and slow to get started, has become overwhelmed by corruption, political vengeance and lawlessness as rogue police units and other government security forces are accused of carrying out massacres and violence on behalf of political or tribal groups. A1

Iraq's new prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, used his first full day on the job to promise ''maximum levels of force in confronting terrorists and killers,'' but the deaths of at least 20 people in Baghdad were a measure of the uphill struggle in pulling Iraq back from the brink of civil war. A10

The Lazim family lost all four of its men when a man walked up to them as they got out of their pickup truck and sprayed them with gunfire. In the patterns of violence in Baghdad, sectarian killings like this one -- the Lazims are Shiites and blame Sunni insurgents for the murders -- have become routine. A10

U.S. Site to Stop Iran Missiles
The Bush administration is moving to establish a new antimissile site in Europe that is designed to stop attacks by Iran against the United States and its European allies. A1

Palestinian and Israeli Meet
The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel met in Egypt in the highest-level contacts between the sides since Hamas, the radical Islamic faction, won the Palestinian elections in January. A4

Kuwait's Parliament Dissolved
Kuwait's emir, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, dissolved the country's 50-member Parliament, ending a weeklong battle over a proposed redistricting law that paralyzed the government and threatened to cause a constitutional crisis. A6

Montenegro Splits From Serbia
According to projections, voters in the small Balkan state of Montenegro decided in a referendum to end their union with Serbia, breaking up all that remained of the Communist-era Yugoslavia. A3

W.H.O. Leader Hospitalized
The director general of the World Health Organization underwent emergency brain surgery in Geneva and will be unable to participate in the agency's annual meeting, which will focus on preventing and preparing for any pandemic of influenza. A3

NATIONAL A14-19

New Orleans Mayor Vote Shows Power of Incumbent
The extraordinary circumstances stacked against Mayor C. Ray Nagin by Hurricane Katrina could not finally trump a cardinal force of New Orleans politics, the power of incumbency. By a margin of four percentage points, voters re-elected Mr Nagin to guide the city through the next four years of rebuilding. A1

Mr. Nagin was as unruffled in his victory as he has been facing defeat, better-funded opponents, a cataclysmic flood, and the defection of one-time supporters. A18

Levees Flawed, Report Says
A new report says that major breaches in the New Orleans levee system during Hurricane Katrina were caused by flaws in design, construction and maintenance and that parts of the system can still be dangerous even after the current round of repairs. A19

F.B.I. Accuses Lawmaker
The Federal Bureau of Investigation charged that Representative William J. Jefferson, a Louisiana Democrat, was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes by a Kentucky businessman and stashed $90,000 in his home freezer in Washington. A1

Corruption Trial to Begin
A former White House budget official is scheduled to go on trial this week, the first defendant to face a jury in the corruption scandal centered on the lobbyist Jack Abramoff. A17

Gonzales on Journalists
The government has the legal authority to prosecute journalists for publishing classified information, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said. A14

5 Dead After Church Shooting
A man opened fire inside the Ministry of Jesus Christ Church in Baton Rouge, killing four people and wounding another, before kidnapping and later killing his wife, law enforcement officials said. A19

Effort to Save Racehorse
Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro's racing career is over, but a valiant and costly effort was made Sunday to repair the right hind leg of the horse that sustained a catastrophic ankle break before an audience of millions early in the Preakness Stakes on Saturday. A1

The pall that was cast over Pimlico Race Course the moment Barbaro took his first awkward steps in the Preakness had not lifted. The usually busting backstretch was eerily quiet, the visitors still seemed oblivious to the terrific race Bernardini had run in victory. D7

More Young Principals As System Is Revamped
More than half the principals in the New York City public school system have left the job over the past five years, opening the way for an influx of newcomers, some in their 20's and 30's with impressive credentials but little teaching experience. The transformation is occurring at the very moment Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein is seeking to give principals more authority. A1

NYC TV Is a Big Success
NYC TV, the city's official television outlet whose bread and butter used to be City Hall hearings, has soared in the ratings to 100,000 viewers for its most popular shows. The station's programming is so successful that its shows are starting to get picked up by stations from East Hampton to Los Angeles. B1

Plight of 9/11 Workers

HEADLINE: Israeli Foreign Minister and Abbas Meet at Economic Forum

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 21 

 BODY:
The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni of Israel met Sunday in Egypt in the highest-level contact between the sides since Hamas, the radical Islamic faction, won the Palestinian elections in January. 
 The two met on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Sharm el Sheik, the Egyptian resort on the Red Sea, and Ms. Livni said she envisioned talks between Mr. Abbas and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert.
''After some preparations, a meeting of the president with Prime Minister Olmert will be the next step,'' Ms. Livni said, according to Reuters.
 Israel has said it views the Palestinian Authority as a single entity and will not negotiate formally with the Palestinian leadership unless the Hamas-led government meets several conditions, including recognizing Israel and renouncing violence.
 Still, the meeting shows that Israel is willing to maintain lines of communication with Mr. Abbas, who is from the Fatah movement. He is viewed as a moderate and favors a resumption of negotiations with Israel.
 Mr. Abbas renewed his call for peace talks and urged Israel not to act on its own. ''Unilateralism cannot bring security to the two peoples,'' he said.
 In a related development, Mr. Olmert flew to the United States on Sunday for a meeting on Tuesday with President Bush. Mr. Olmert is expected to discuss his plans to define Israel's borders in the coming years. He says he prefers negotiations with the Palestinians, but is prepared to act unilaterally.
 Before Mr. Olmert left, the Israeli cabinet approved buying $11 million worth of medicine and medical equipment for the Palestinians, who say medical supplies have been running critically low since money to the government was cut off after Hamas won the Palestinian elections. 
 Israel says it will buy the medical supplies with the more than $50 million in taxes and customs revenues that it collects each month on behalf of the Palestinians but has been withholding.
 ''We have no intention of helping the Palestinian government,'' Mr. Olmert was quoted as telling the cabinet, a statement released by his office said. ''But I say we will render such assistance as may be necessary for humanitarian needs.''
 In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian security forces said Sunday that they had thwarted an attempt to kill a senior security commander allied with Mr. Abbas.
 A large bomb was found Sunday near the Gaza home of Rashid Abu Shbak, a Fatah member, the Palestinian security officials said. This year, Mr. Abbas appointed Mr. Shbak to oversee several security agencies, upsetting the Hamas government, which says it should run the agencies.
 A day earlier, a bomb badly wounded a senior intelligence official, Maj. Gen. Tareq Abu Rajab, and killed one of his bodyguards in an elevator at his headquarters in Gaza City.
 The two incidents were seen as part of Palestinian infighting, though it was not clear who was responsible. A previously unknown group, calling itself the Qaeda Organization of the State of Palestine, claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing in a Web statement, but its authenticity could not be verified.

HEADLINE: Promises? What Promises?

 BODY:
Bono, the U2 star, has always been good at turning a quick phrase, and last week was no exception. During a stop in Rwanda, which was part of a six-nation tour of Africa, the Irish singer turned philanthropist described a recent meeting he had held with members of the House Appropriations Committee, including Representative Jerry Lewis, the Republican chairman from California. 
 ''We spoke to the good men and women,'' Bono said at a news conference after touring a hospital in Kigali. ''They welcomed us with opened arms, patted us on the back and shook our hands, and their eyes misted up at the right place.''
And when he left town, Bono said, those same committee members turned around and slashed President Bush's request for $3 billion more for foreign aid down to $600 million. 
 The House action, unfortunately, is business as usual when it comes to aid. The politicians in Washington talk a beautiful game about trying to combat global poverty. They make grand speeches about the crying need of AIDS orphans in Uganda. They paint touching pictures of American plans to help. 
 Last year was long on promises. The British prime minister, Tony Blair, called Africa's poverty ''the fundamental moral challenge of our generation.'' The United Nations' secretary general, Kofi Annan, characterized our generation as one that could make poverty history. President Bush twice stood on the world stage and promised to sharply increase development assistance to poor nations. He did it first at the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland in July, when he pledged to double aid to Africa by 2010. He did it again two months later, at a United Nations meeting in New York, where he urged that the Monterrey Consensus, which calls on rich countries to increase their spending on development aid to 0.7 percent of gross national product, be put into effect.
 So far, this year has been disgracefully short on anything resembling action. Talks at the World Trade Organization to reduce global farm subsidies, a move that would help poor countries, have stalled. And the House decision to slash President Bush's request is another reminder of the hypocrisy of all those speeches about making poverty history.
 Mr. Bush should be commended for trying to significantly increase aid to Africa from the cellar depths in which it resided during the Clinton administration. But he has not tried hard enough. He should go to Capitol Hill and demand that lawmakers fully finance his Millennium Challenge Account, which is supposed to increase United States help to poor countries that are committed to policies promoting development. He should press Congress to finance the practical, ground-level aid efforts that have been shown to work. That means channeling real money into village-based water programs, malaria vaccines, AIDS drugs, mosquito bed nets and school feeding programs. 
 The Senate takes up the budget bill next. We dearly hope that President Bush has the backbone to stand behind the promises he made, and to press lawmakers in Washington to do the right thing.

 Re ''Inflation Rising, Markets Tumble'' (front page, May 18):
Perhaps investors would be even more concerned about the inflation figures if they really measured all of the cost-of-living pressures felt in Middle America.
 For these families, the costs of medical care and insurance, mortgage payments, energy, tuition and services represent a big chunk of the total budget.

HEADLINE: It Worked in Libya, But Iran Is Different 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 ''An American Embassy in Tripoli'' (editorial, May 17), about the Bush administration's decision to renew diplomatic relations with Libya, ends by raising this question: ''Hasn't the breakthrough come about because the United States has held direct talks with Libyan officials? That certainly isn't the case with Iran. Perhaps it should be.'' 
In fact, negotiations with Libya were productive not because of direct talks, but because the groundwork for them had been laid through its abandonment of its weapons of mass destruction program, renunciation of terrorism and cooperation with the will of the United Nations Security Council. 
 By contrast, Iran has made clear that it has no intention of complying with any Security Council directive curbing its nuclear weapons program. Nor has Iran ever renounced its support of terrorism, let alone assumed, as Libya has, responsibility for its past deeds, coupled with payment of just compensation.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy Standards

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Simply raising the fuel economy standards for cars would not fix a flawed decades-old program (editorial, May 15). As the National Academy of Sciences has reported, raising fuel economy standards without improving the program would do more to endanger motorists and threaten American jobs than it would to help end our addiction to oil. 
President Bush is committed to increasing fuel economy standards for passenger cars, just as this administration has twice increased the fuel economy standards for light trucks to record levels. But the president will never be comfortable with the idea of putting more travelers at risk by encouraging automakers to sell more, less crashworthy, small cars. 
 That is why he has called on Congress to reform the program in a way that will require all cars to get better gas mileage. If Congress acts, the administration will immediately set higher passenger car standards in a way that ensures that all types of cars get better mileage, motorists are safeguarded and the economy is protected.

HEADLINE: City Workers' 9/11 Claims Meet Obstacles 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decision to intervene in the case of a former deputy mayor who believes that he became severely ill from working around ground zero after the Sept. 11 attack has cast unwanted attention on the city's handling of 9/11 workers' compensation cases. Scores of such cases -- the city could not say precisely how many -- continue to drag on nearly five years after the attack.
 Advocates for public employees who worked in Lower Manhattan on Sept. 11, 2001, said that before the mayor stepped in, the case of the former deputy mayor, Rudy Washington -- who had his initial claim challenged by the city, and then won a judge's order granting him health care benefits only to see that order, too, appealed by the city -- was typical.
''Workers going through this process are being fought tooth and nail, while justice and humanity call for providing them with the medical treatment that they need,'' said Joel A. Shufro, executive director of the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a union-backed nonprofit educational organization that has often criticized the city's handling of compensation claims. 
 Dr. Robin Herbert, an occupational-medicine specialist and incoming director of the World Trade Center Health Effects Treatment Program at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said the workers' compensation program was one of the most common sources of complaint among her patients. 
 ''There's no question that our patients who have physical and mental health consequences of the World Trade Center disaster have had their psychological distress worsened by the difficult interactions with the workers' compensation system,'' she said. 
 William D. Dahl, a paramedic who worked for the Fire Department for 21 years until a city panel allowed him to retire on disability last month, has been fighting for long-term health care coverage.
 Mr. Dahl, 42, who was an emergency responder near ground zero on 9/11, filed a pre-emptive compensation claim immediately after the attack, but he did not develop symptoms requiring treatment until a year later. Since then sinusitis, tracheitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and synovial sarcoma, a rare cancer, have been diagnosed, he said. He coughs continually.
 On April 17, the New York City Employees' Retirement System granted Mr. Dahl a three-quarters disability pension. However, a month later, the city's Law Department told Mr. Dahl that it would challenge his claim for health care benefits under the workers' compensation system. Each side has presented doctors who disagree on the severity of Mr. Dahl's illnesses.
 Mr. Dahl, who lives in Seaford, N.Y., said he could not understand how one arm of the city -- the pension system -- could certify his World Trade Center-related disabilities while another arm -- the Law Department -- has questioned how sick he is. ''They have fought me every step of the way,'' he said of the city's lawyers.
 The state-run system is intended to provide workers who are injured or disabled on the job with medical assistance and fixed weekly payments -- two-thirds of wages, up to $400 a week -- to replace lost pay, loss of the use of a body part or facial disfigurement.
 Although the system was set up to eliminate the need for litigation, compensation cases can be as protracted and adversarial as lawsuits. Of the 313,102 claims resolved in New York State in 2004, 55 percent involved a hearing at which evidence was provided, and the rest were resolved informally. 
 Most private employers rely on insurance companies to identify and challenge claims that might be fraudulent, but some of the largest employers, like the City of New York, are self-insured and decide on their own when to challenge claims. Industry experts have estimated that 10 to 20 percent of workers' compensation claims may be baseless.
 One reason for the contentiousness is that the nature of workplace injuries has changed. Over the years, cuts, smashed feet and falls have become less common, replaced by injuries like back strain in which the severity and cause are more difficult to determine, said Robert S. Smith, a professor of labor economics at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. 
 ''I don't think the system is well designed for diseases that have long latency periods,'' he said. 
 As of last week, compensation claims had been filed by or on behalf of 1,436 employees of the City of New York and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority citing deaths, injuries or illnesses caused by 9/11, according to the State Workers' Compensation Board. That figure does not include claims by police officers, firefighters and sanitation workers, who are covered under separate workplace-injury programs. 
 In general, more than 90 percent of the 9/11 cases that have been brought to the board are considered ''resolved,'' according to a spokesman for the board, Jon A. Sullivan, but neither the state nor the city could say what proportion had been accepted or rejected. All workers' compensation cases are sealed. 
 The Law Department, which represents the city in workers' compensation cases, said it could not discuss the cases of Mr. Dahl or Mr. Washington and also declined to discuss how it handles compensation cases generally.
 Mr. Washington, 51, was a top official during the eight years of Rudolph W. Giuliani's tenure as mayor. He is believed to be the highest-ranking city employee to file an injury claim stemming from the attack. He filed his claim in December 2004, more than a year after the usual two-year deadline for filing compensation claims.
 The city challenged not only the timeliness of the claim, but also the link between 9/11 and the ailments Mr. Washington reported. He testified and presented medical reports at four hearings. 
 In March of this year, an administrative law judge sided with Mr. Washington after finding that he met a narrow exception to the deadline. In April, the city appealed the judge's ruling.
 On Thursday, Mr. Bloomberg said that he had only recently learned about the appeal and that he believed it was based ''on a technicality.'' He added, ''I thought that it was wrong.'' City lawyers are scheduled to meet on Tuesday with Mr. Washington's lawyer, Robert E. Grey. 
 A recent report on the workers' compensation program, prepared by the Law Department, lists 47 new 9/11 claims that were received in 2005, suggesting that many employees are continuing to pursue claims well after the usual two-year deadline.
 Neither the mayor nor Gov. George E. Pataki addressed last week the broader complaints by 9/11 claimants about the workers' compensation system. Mr. Pataki said only that the system's judges rely on ''professional judgment'' in rendering decisions.
 ''I'm sure they understand the implications of the tremendous sacrifice that thousands of New Yorkers made, risking their lives on the pile after those towers came down,'' Mr. Pataki said on Thursday. ''So they had to obviously follow the medical conclusions that are reached by the professionals, and I'm confident they're doing it.'' 
 However, those statements have not quelled growing criticism of the system, from both ends of the political spectrum.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg made the right decision in the end, but it shouldn't take front-page media coverage and high-powered friends to convince our leadership to do the right thing for those who are suffering,'' said Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democratic congressman who has called on the state to waive the two-year deadline to file most compensation claims.
 Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican business executive who was a top deputy in the Giuliani administration, said he believed the Law Department was making it much harder for civilian workers to obtain benefits than uniformed police officers and firefighters. ''Why are we treating a civilian city worker different than a uniformed city worker?'' he asked. ''I think the administration is taking advantage of the fact that it can.'' 
 Friends of Mr. Washington -- and Mr. Bloomberg himself -- have rejected the notion that he received any special treatment. 
 Mr. Shufro, the occupational health advocate, said he hoped that Mr. Washington's case would lead to more awareness of city employees in similar situations.
 ''We have people who, unlike Rudy Washington, don't have friends in high places and are losing their houses and having their kids withdraw from college because they can't get medical care and wage-replacement benefits, paltry as they are, to sustain themselves,'' Mr. Shufro said.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Legitimate, Study Says

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
Despite suspicions among consumers about rapidly rising gasoline prices and record oil industry profits, a federal investigation concluded Monday that the jump at the pump over the last year had not been the result of unlawful price manipulation.
 The Federal Trade Commission said the sharp increase in fuel costs was attributable to market forces -- namely big drops in supply and production and runs on inventories after major damage to refineries, ports and pipelines. In a report that Congress ordered last year after hurricanes struck the nation's refining hub on the Gulf Coast, the commission found no evidence of price collusion or improper reductions of inventory or supplies to increase company profits.
''The evidence collected in this investigation indicated that firms behaved competitively,'' the commission said. 
 Since the report did not find an industry villain, it was not likely to quell voter anger over the high gas prices. That is likely to add political pressure on Congress to take steps to lower prices or reduce the earnings of some oil companies. It could also provide some impetus for legislation, already adopted by the House, to outlaw price gouging and impose high penalties for violations.
 The commission said it found 15 examples of pricing by refineries, wholesale companies and retailers that technically fit the definition of ''price gouging.'' (It defined gouging as a price increase in the month after the hurricanes that was not attributable to the additional costs caused by weather-related damage.) But it said that in nearly all of those instances, there was probably not gouging because of regional or local trends that justified the higher prices.
 ''Some price gouging by individual retailers did occur to a limited extent,'' the report said. ''Local or regional market trends, however, seemed to explain the price increases in all but one case. Exceptionally high prices on the part of individual retailers generally were very short-lived.'' The report did not identify the retailer involved in the one case.
 While the agency had been expected to reach the conclusions that it formally announced on Monday, senior commission officials said they expected the agency would come under criticism when the five commissioners appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Tuesday. 
 Industry executives applauded the commission's findings.
 ''This investigation, like so many others conducted at the federal and state level, appears to vindicate the refining industry's actions post-Katrina, as well in the other areas that were the subject of the study,'' said Bob Slaughter, president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. ''We hope that Congress and the public will take full notice of its findings.''
 But Democrats in Congress, who have been the biggest critics of the commission for the way it monitors the industry, challenged the report's conclusions. 
 ''The F.T.C. white paper on gas price gouging is a whitewash,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''They find substantial numbers of refiners engaged in anticompetitive practices. They don't like the remedy Congress is proposing, namely a law on price gouging. But they just walk away from responsibility and don't propose a remedy themselves.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, also criticized the commission.
 ''It just defies belief that they didn't find price gouging because there is simply no price competition,'' he said. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate ''could do a lot if it had the backbone.''
 ''We could issue subpoenas, we could call in the executives, we could get to the bottom of this,'' he said. ''The problem is that the Senate leadership believes, as the president does, that what's good for big oil is good for America.''
 The report, which in recent weeks has been cited by President Bush in response to questions about high gas prices, had been widely expected to exonerate oil producers, in part because it is difficult to define market manipulation and price gouging. One commissioner, Jon Leibowitz, observed in a concurring opinion that price gouging ''is the obscenity of antitrust law: difficult to define in theory but easily recognized at the pump.''
 Moreover, the industry suffered substantial damage last summer that proved to be highly disruptive, and previous reports by the agency over the years about the pricing habits of the oil industry had reached similar conclusions. 
 The hurricanes knocked out about a third of the nation's crude oil production, and in the days after Katrina alone, gas prices jumped an average of about 50 cents a gallon in some cities. Just as the prices began to drop, a second hurricane, Rita, caused further significant damage to the region, and in its aftermath, prices increased by another 35 cents a gallon.
 ''In light of the amount of crude oil production and refining capacity knocked out by Katrina and Rita, the sizes of the posthurricane price increases were approximately what would be predicted by the standard supply and demand paradigm that presumes a market is performing competitively,'' the report said. ''Evidence gathered during our investigation indicated that the conduct of firms in response to the supply shocks caused by the hurricanes was consistent with competition.''
 Still, as lawmakers come under increasing pressure from voters, senior officials at the commission said in recent days that they were bracing for criticism. Congress has been considering legislation to ease the burden on consumers or lower the profits of the oil industry. 
 Last week, the House of Representatives approved a measure to renegotiate more than 1,000 leases for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in an attempt to revoke billions of dollars in government incentives to oil and gas producers. Lawmakers say they will consider energy legislation after they return from the Memorial Day recess in June.
 Gas prices have declined slightly in the last week, by 2 cents, to an average of $2.93, and could continue to drop in coming weeks, said Trilby Lundberg, an analyst who conducts surveys of gas stations around the nation.

HEADLINE: Bulls Retreat Worldwide As May Rally Turns to Rout

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Marjorie Connelly and Carter Dougherty contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A three-year bull run in stocks has been losing strength in the last few weeks as concerns mount about higher inflation and slower growth.
 Stocks fell again yesterday, with sharp declines in Asia and Europe, especially in emerging markets. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been flirting with a record high on May 10, is down 4 percent since then. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 5 percent from its May 5 high, while the Nasdaq composite index is down 8 percent since its most recent high in April.
Yet to many investors, this slump only confirms that the earlier rally in stocks may have been hollow to begin with.
 ''I am shocked that the market is where it is at,'' said Ron N. DeCook, 65, a retired newspaper ad salesman who lives north of San Francisco. ''I think business has improved, but I don't think it's through the rough. I wonder about the wars, the deficit -- I wonder if we are in a false economy.'' 
 ''The way I look at it the economy is based on consumer confidence, and if consumer confidence goes down, the market will follow.''
 Even as the American economy picked up speed, to an annual growth rate of 4.8 percent, and stocks were climbing, there was little sign of investor confidence in the market. 
 Half the people questioned in April by the Gallup organization said that if they had an extra thousand dollars to spend, they would consider it a bad idea to invest it in the stock market; 43 percent said it would be a good idea. By contrast, 67 percent of those polled in early 2000, when the market was in its last frenzied run, said it would be a good idea and only 28 percent said it would be a bad idea.
 ''People are surprised that our economy is doing as well as it has been doing,'' said Richard Sylla, a market historian and a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 The retreat in stocks gained momentum after the Federal Reserve left open the possibility of another increase in short-term interest rates and signs mounted that inflationary pressures were growing. Concerns that a campaign of higher rates might hurt growth has weighed on stocks around the world.
 Yesterday, stocks in Tokyo fell 1.8 percent, and Hong Kong stocks fell 3.1 percent. The selling continued in Europe: London closed down 2.2 percent; Frankfurt, down 2.2 percent; and Paris, down 2.7 percent. 
 Emerging markets, which have been popular with American investors recently, also fell sharply. Brazilian stocks were down 3.3 percent yesterday, while Mexico fell 4 percent.
 In Russia, stocks posted their largest one-day fall since October 2003, when the authorities arrested Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the chief executive of Yukos, who is now serving a sentence for tax evasion in a Siberian prison. The Russian RTS index denominated in dollars fell 9 percent.
 There was frenzied trading in India. A 10 percent plunge in the benchmark Sensex stock index led to a suspension of trading at midday, though share prices rebounded in the afternoon after the finance minister urged calm, and the government pledged to help cover margin calls. The index closed at 10,481.77 points, down 4.2 percent for the day and down nearly 17 percent from a peak of 12,612 reached May 11.
 In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 18.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,125.33. The S.& P. 500 fell 4.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,262.07, while the Nasdaq slumped 21.02, or 1 percent, to 2,172.86, its lowest level since November. Treasury prices rose yesterday. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 10021/32, driving its yield down to 5.04 percent from 5.06 percent on Friday.
 The downturn in stocks over the last eight sessions is a sharp turnaround given that the Dow was near a record high as recently as May 10. But some say the weakness in the market was already there.
 ''This hype wasn't justified by everything else that was going on in the market,'' said Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment officer at Charles Schwab & Company, who describes herself as neutral on American stocks. ''It was only a couple of generals that were leading the charge and the rest of the soldiers were falling behind.''
 The market has been led by a handful of energy and industrial companies and a cadre of smaller issues, while much of the domestic market, including most of the technology sector, is still some distance from making up its losses from 2001 and 2002, Ms. Sonders noted. 
 Take the Dow's 30 blue-chip stocks, for instance. On May 10, 21 of the companies in the index had not made it back to the prices they were trading at when the index peaked in early 2000. 
 Since January 2000, General Electric is down 33 percent, and two technology heavyweights that led the market during its last great bull run -- Microsoft and Intel -- are in the rearguard of the index. (The worst- performing stock is, perhaps not surprisingly, General Motors, which is down about 66 percent.)
 Who is on top? Five of the index's top six performers -- Caterpillar, United Technologies, Boeing, 3M and Exxon Mobil -- are benefiting from either a steep rise in commodity prices or strong demand for capital goods from the military and developing nations like China, or both. 
 Despite the recent downturn, not everyone is pessimistic about the market and the economy. Indeed, stocks recovered late in the day yesterday to show a gain before falling back in the final minutes of trading.
 Inflation may be inching upward and the housing market is losing momentum, but neither appears to pose a fundamental or grave threat to the economy, these experts say.
 ''It is not Jimmy Carter time,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York, referring to the late 1970's when the economy was hamstrung by high inflation and unemployment.
 Mr. Silverblatt adds that corporate profits, though slowing, are still setting records, and companies have so much cash they are stepping up stock repurchases, a phenomenon that could help lift the market. And stocks of smaller companies have performed better than the blue chips. The Russell 2000 index, for example, is up 6.24 percent so far this year, outpacing the major stock indexes, though it fell 1 percent yesterday.
 Still, it appears, many investors burned by the technology bust and accounting scandals at former market darlings like Enron and WorldCom have yet to regain their optimism and faith in the market.
 History suggests we should expect just that, Mr. Sylla said. After the market crashed in 1929, the Dow and the S.& P. indexes did not return to the peaks they established in September of that year until a quarter- century later, in 1954, long after the Depression and World War II ended.
 Michael S. Garfield, a technology consultant in Houston who is saving for retirement and for three pre-teenage sons who ''all want to go to college,'' sums up his primary investing goal: ''We are trying not to lose it.''
 Instead of making big bets on individual stocks as he often did in the 1990's, Mr. Garfield, who has a local radio show about technology, said he kept about three-fourths of his portfolio in college savings funds and other long-term investments. He keeps a smaller sum, $25,000 to $50,000, in online brokerage accounts and some of that has been invested, with success, in energy stocks.
 ''We are now more realistic,'' said Mr. Garfield, 41, who admitted that he and his wife used to joke during the technology boom that they might be able to retire in their 40's. 
 Today, he said, ''If we can get just single-digit growth, year over year, that's great.''

HEADLINE: Iraqi Charities Plant the Seed of a Civil Society

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Ali Adeeb and Hosham Hussein contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 22 

 BODY:
In the wave of lawlessness and frantic self-interest that has washed over this war-weary nation, small acts of pure altruism often go unnoticed. 
 Like the tiny track suits and dresses that Najat al-Saiedi takes to children of displaced families in the dusty, desperate Shiite slum of Shoala. Or the shelter that Suad al-Khafaji gives to, among others, the five children she found living in a garage in northern Baghdad last year.
But the Iraqi government has been taking note of such good works, and now, more than three years after the American invasion, the outlines of a nascent civil society are taking shape. 
 Since 2003 the government has registered 5,000 private organizations, including charities, human rights groups, medical assistance agencies and literacy projects. Officials estimate that an additional 7,000 groups are working unofficially. The efforts show that even as violence and sectarian hatred tear Iraq's mixed cities apart, a growing number of Iraqis are trying to bring them together. ''Iraqis were thirsty for such experiences,'' said Khadija Tuma, director of the office in the Ministry of Civil Society Affairs that now works with the private aid groups. ''It was as if they already had it inside themselves.'' 
 The new charity groups offer bits of relief in the sea of poverty that swept Iraq during the economic embargo of the 1990's and has worsened with the pervasive lawlessness that followed the American invasion. 
 The burst of public-spiritedness comes after long decades of muzzled community life under Saddam Hussein, when drab Soviet-style committees for youth, women and industrialists were the only community groups permitted. 
 Mr. Hussein stamped out what had been a vibrant public life. Since the founding of Islam in the seventh century, charity has had a special place in its societies. As far back as the 19th century, religious leaders, descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, formed a network called Al Ashraf that was a link between people and the Ottoman-appointed governor of Baghdad. 
 The Iraqi Chamber of Commerce dates from the 1930's, and its volunteers plunged into Baghdad's poor areas to conduct literacy campaigns in the 1950's, around the time of the overthrow of the monarchy. 
 Today's groups have picked up that historic thread and offer hope in an increasingly poisonous sectarian landscape that Iraqis may still be able to hold their country together. 
 Ms. Saiedi is a pragmatic 35-year-old who has neither a husband nor a job. After the American invasion she tried to find work at a cellphone company, one of the few types of private businesses that pay well, but was told that it was not hiring women because the job required travel. Boredom was part of her motivation: the risk of kidnapping has confined many women to their homes, and she had long hours at home with nothing to do. 
 So, together with a group of her close friends and two of her sisters, Ms. Saiedi formed a charity group, Bilad al Rafidain (Mesopotamian) Orphan Relief. 
 Once a month she picks her way around mounds of trash in Shoala in dainty sandals, taking blankets, slippers and towels to children there. The members take donations from friends and co-workers, and even people who visit the government offices where several of them work, and regularly give assistance to 520 children. 
 In lovingly rendered notebooks of various colors, Ms. Saiedi hand-writes the names of family members and the days that donations were made. 
 ''There are families of children where fathers were killed in explosions,'' said Ms. Saiedi, wearing a colorful green hijab on a recent day. ''Now the state is busy. If I don't care about them, who will?''
 Wassan al-Sharifi, 28, an office assistant for a government official, said she had joined the group because ''I like the spirit of its members.''
 ''In spite of this bad situation, they're willing to help people,'' she said.
 One delivery early this month took Ms. Saiedi to Shoala, to the home of Dumoh Mizher, a 31-year old Shiite widow, one of the women who runs a family of 15 children left fatherless after Ms. Mizher's husband and two of his brothers were killed in the town of Abu Ghraib in 2005, when Sunni Arab insurgents broke into their small shop and shot all three point-blank. 
 Children spilled through the doorway of the spare cinder-block house whose empty windows looked out onto a small pen with a goat. Framed photographs of the three dead men were set high on the wall, not far from portraits of Shiite saints. 
 ''Who is who?'' Ms. Saiedi asked, trying to calm the children down as they buzzed around her. 
 ''Zaineb, where is Zaineb?'' she asked, holding up a small pink dress wrapped in plastic.
 Not all groups are a force for good. Ms. Tuma estimated that nearly 10 percent of the registered groups were involved in guerrilla activities and other crime. 
 One was funneling aid to fighters in the volatile town of Falluja, she said, and the government shut it down. Another was running a ring that sold Iraqi children into slavery abroad. She reported that group to the prime minister. 
 Iraq's religion-based political parties also have a hand in supporting the charity groups. Ms. Khafaji, who founded Al Rahma (Mercy) Organization, her shelter for homeless women and children, in 2005, gets some of financing from an office of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. 
 The need here is growing. The number of acutely malnourished children has more than doubled, to 9 percent in 2005 from 4 percent in 2002, according to a report based on figures from the Planning Ministry that was released this month. 
 Homelessness has spread since 2003 and accelerated with the rise of sectarian violence, with Iraqis even squatting in an old movie theater in central Baghdad, Ms. Khafaji said. The Ministry of Migration estimates that 1.1 million Iraqis have been displaced since 2003. 
 Ms. Khafaji, 49, a former shopping center manager, said she felt a personal connection to homeless Iraqis. In 1969, Mr. Hussein's government executed her father, and her family was forced from its property. She and her siblings were separated for their safety, and their belongings were sold off. 
 ''This made me feel homeless,'' she said, sitting in a large room in a worn building in central Baghdad that houses about 20 women and children.
 Ms. Khafaji even looks for jobs and husbands for the women. A shy 30-year-old who fled an unhappy home life in Kut recently found work through the shelter, bringing tea to guests in a government ministry. Several others have married men in Sadr City, a Shiite district of Baghdad.
 A visit to the shelter offers a tour of some of the miseries of poverty here.
 The five children from the garage, ages 3 to 10, who were racing through the large concrete rooms of the building one day this month, squealing happily, are an example. 
 Their mother was killed by their father's friend in a domestic fight after she refused to give him ice, according to an account the eldest daughter gave a shelter worker. Their father, a drug addict, later sold one of his kidneys to raise the money he needed so he could marry again, the worker said. Their father came to visit the children once, but has not returned, workers said.
 In another case, a man came to the gate a month ago and tried to leave two children, a 1-year-old and an infant less than a month old. The shelter could not take them. 
 ''So many victims,'' Ms. Khafaji said, raising her hands and opening her palms in a gesture of fatigue.

HEADLINE: Save Your Whale and Eat It, Too

BYLINE: By Philip Armour. 
Philip Armour is the former editor of the Swedish edition of Outside magazine.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
WHEN the International Whaling Commission convenes tomorrow, its worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling will be under attack. It should be. The time has come for regulations that recognize that whaling, handled right and in moderation, can be sustainable.
 The moratorium, in place since 1985, has accomplished a great deal. Most countries, including the United States, have given up whaling, and as a result, many species that were dwindling are now on the rebound.
But there are also loopholes that a handful of persistent whaling nations have managed to slip through. Norway has never recognized the moratorium; Japan and Iceland claim that they kill whales for research, though they sell surplus meat for food. Now these countries are clamoring to hunt larger species and to do so in international waters. 
 In April 2004, I spent two weeks on the 53-foot Norwegian whaling ship Sofie, living with its five-man crew. I saw the Norwegians shoot six minke whales with grenade-tipped harpoons, drag them to the boat and kill them with blasts to the skull from a .458-caliber rifle. Once onboard, the whales dwarfed us all. But at an average of 25 feet and seven tons, the minke is small -- for a whale. 
 There are 120,000 to 182,000 minkes in the North Atlantic. Norwegian whalers hunt them every spring and summer along the fjord-carved coast of Arctic Norway, shooting 639 in 2005 and selling their red, beef-like meat for about $10 a pound. Given the animal's healthy numbers, killing and eating limited numbers of minke whales is sustainable, despite the Norwegian quota increase to 1,052 whales for 2006. 
 Whalers cite success with the minke programs to make their case for going after larger, more profitable species. But minkes have never been heavily hunted; as a result, their numbers far exceed those of larger whales like humpback or fin, two species Japan plans to hunt in 2006. 
 For its part, the International Whaling Commission, which is essentially a trade organization founded to preserve whale numbers for future hunting -- not for conservation -- is predisposed to serve whalers, not the public good. That's why it has failed to come up with a nuanced framework that can accommodate both environmental and economic needs. 
 The commission focuses on specific whale numbers rather than on general ocean health. But the old saw that all whales are in danger of extinction simply isn't true. Seven of the mammal's 37 species are still endangered, but only two are in serious trouble. Environmentalists need not bother with saving every whale. They'd be better off coming up with a plan to save the oceans. 
 Whales can become endangered by the loss of other ocean life that sustains them; and when whales are hunted, rather than allowed to die from natural causes and feed back into the ecosystem, that endangers the habitat, which in turn endangers whales. The debate over how to save the whales, therefore, needs to focus on both whaling and ocean health. 
 With proper management, whaling need not cause extinctions or deplete ecosystems, but as it stands, the fox is guarding the chicken coop. Whales need at least 50 more years to repopulate before hunting of larger species should resume. The commission, however, has proven incapable of allowing stocks to replenish fully, as we've seen with the moratorium's sloppy loopholes. Moreover, whaling nations have allegedly influenced the votes of commission members in exchange for development aid.
 A more disinterested body needs to govern whale hunting, and I suggest the United Nations. Fifty years would give the United Nations time to configure a global fishing commission -- and the International Whaling Commission time to dismantle. Limited whaling of certain species would continue, while the others would be given a rest. Conservation is the best option not just for the environment, but for the fishing industry as well. Whaling, however distasteful, needs to be reinvented with global resources -- not just whales -- in mind.

HEADLINE: Quotas to Aid India's Poor vs. Push for Meritocracy 

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; Hari Kumar contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 22 

 BODY:
The problem of caste prejudice here is as ancient as the Hindu texts. The efforts to redress it date from the formation of modern India nearly 59 years ago. Today -- as India enjoys awesome rates of economic progress and confronts the challenge of spreading the benefits to its needy majority -- the nation faces a polarizing totem of public policy: a government plan to extend college admission quotas to certain ''backward'' castes. 
 Affirmative action is in some ways an even more emotional issue in India than in the United States. In recent weeks, a proposal to extend quotas for admission to some of the country's flagship, federally financed universities has caused fresh turmoil.
 Protests -- particularly by medical students who say merit should be the only basis for admission to India's intensely competitive medical schools -- have spread across the country and, here in the capital, hobbled public health services. Advocates and opponents of the measure have exchanged often ugly rants. 
 For the government, redressing age-old caste discrimination has become mired in divisive politics. The government has said it will not back down from its proposal. 
 Caste-based quotas are not new. As authorized by its Constitution, India has long set aside 22.5 percent of public university seats, including those at the most elite institutions, for the lowest castes on the Hindu social ladder and indigenous tribes. Quotas also apply to government jobs and elective office. 
 The latest proposal extends that principle by setting aside an additional 27 percent of seats for a group known in the bizarre parlance of Indian bureaucracy as ''other backward classes,'' or O.B.C.'s. 
 The new quotas would apply to the country's most competitive federally financed universities, including the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and some elite medical colleges. 
 Medical students have been particularly outraged because the plan would further restrict the limited number of seats. Medical education in India begins with a five-year undergraduate program, and the proposal could affect students' chances of completing their training.
 The central lawn of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the pre-eminent public hospital, was occupied Friday by medical students on the fifth day of a strike that began last week and continued on Monday. ''My merit is my caste. What is yours?'' read one T-shirt.
 The quota advocates have also mobilized. On Friday in Patna, a group of them clashed with the police. Earlier in the week they faced off against antiquota medical students at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, arguing that it was against the law for doctors to strike. 
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has shied away from commenting explicitly on the proposal, but has instead appointed a three-member advisory committee to study the measure and its repercussions.
 Asked for a comment, his office cited only a speech to a Harvard alumni group on March 25, in which Mr. Singh suggested that he favored an expansion of scholarships for deserving students based on merit and means.
 ''Government can and must balance the elitism of meritocracy by facilitating those at the bottom of the social pyramid to rise to the apex of an academic pyramid,'' he said in that speech.
 The debate over college admission quotas is particularly salient. Most Indians are young, and how social policy addresses their aspirations is among the most pressing challenges for the government. 
 As a compromise, lawmakers have suggested that the flagship universities could expand the total number of seats. That, of course, would raise a new set of challenges, including hiring more professors.
 It has not gone unnoticed that at a time when the Indian economy is on the fast track to liberalization, the higher education system continues to be highly regulated. 
 In recent months there have also been suggestions -- but no explicit measures -- to introduce quotas in the private sector as well, prompting anxious opposition from business leaders.
 Affirmative action in India is different in important ways from affirmative action in the United States. In the intricate pecking order of Indian society, those who belong to the cow herder caste, which falls under the ''other backward'' category, are in fact several levels above the tailor caste. 
 Tailors, in turn, enjoy a higher status than waste collectors, who, despite a ban, continue to carry human waste on their heads in parts of the country. They are considered untouchable according to Hindu custom.
 While caste no longer necessarily determines a person's vocation, it does determine to a large extent whom one marries, dines with and, most important for this debate, votes for. The ''other backward castes'' are a powerful voting bloc in many parts of India, making the outcome of the current debate of particular importance to Indian politicians.
 Finally, unlike affirmative action in America, India's in effect begins and ends with quotas. Whether quotas are in fact the best and most effective means to promote access to marginalized young Indians is still a matter of debate.
 Supporters of the latest measure say that in an unequal society, only explicit set-asides can open doors. Where there are no mandatory quotas, in the private sector for instance, or in the news media, they argue, upper castes continue to dominate.
 ''Caste is qualification for few; caste is disqualification for many,'' said Bhalchandra Mungekar, an economist on the national government's Planning Commission. ''A small microscopic elite of Indian society is determined to perpetuate its monopoly over the privileges.''
 The opponents say set-asides would diminish the quality of India's best universities and divide students along caste lines. 
 ''Why after 55 years are we still thinking in terms of caste-based reservation?'' demanded Poojan Aggarwal, a third-year student at Safdarjung Medical College here. ''We should talk now of total meritocracy. We know on this issue none of the political parties will support us.''
 Some people worry that quotas -- or reservations, as they are sometimes called -- may not be the ideal way to expand access to the best universities. Caste is not the only inhibition, after all; income, poor public services and other factors also deny millions of Indians access to sound basic education.
 ''We recognize proactive measures, some form of affirmative action, needs to be taken to make them socially inclusive,'' said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a member of the Knowledge Commission who resigned on Monday because of differences with the prime minister's office over these quotas. ''We also recognize that the only instrument for affirmative action we've used so far, which is reservations, has actually not produced the kind of positive results we would have hoped.'' 
 Most members of the commission, which advises the prime minister on higher education and other issues, oppose the proposed measure. The commission has suggested that the government explore other means to expand access, like improving primary and secondary education, before resorting to more quotas.
 ''This is short-circuiting the debate about what needs to be done to have a much more effective affirmative action policy,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''Frankly, the other underlying thing for us is that reservations have become a way of displacing responsibility. We are not talking about all the other things that need to be done to improve access.''

Iraqi Charities Bringing A Divided Land Together
The Iraqi government has registered 5,000 private organizations, including charities and human rights groups. Officials estimate that another 7,000 groups exist unofficially. The efforts show that even as sectarian violence tears Iraq's cities apart, a growing number of Iraqis are trying to bring them together. A1

HEADLINE: BIG BOARD BIDS FOR EXCHANGES ACROSS EUROPE 

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSONand HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange took a big step yesterday toward the creation of a global marketplace by offering to acquire the operator of five European stock and futures exchanges for $10.2 billion in cash and shares.
 ''It is not enough to build the best marketplace in the U.S. or a champion of Europe,'' the chief executive of the New York exchange, John A. Thain, said in a conference call yesterday. ''The challenge is to build the best marketplace in the world.''
Finance and investment have been global phenomena for decades: Asian central banks are among the biggest buyers of United States Treasury obligations, big American commercial banks are joining their London counterparts in wooing Middle East investors, and hedge funds based in Connecticut buy and sell in markets from Iceland to Indonesia.
 But stock exchanges have remained largely national enterprises, even as their movements were shaped by global events. Indeed, the offer yesterday by the New York Stock Exchange's parent company, the NYSE Group, was made as share prices around the world were falling, seemingly in concert, beginning in Asia and continuing in Europe, before recovering somewhat in New York. [Market Place, Page C1.] 
 A deal between the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext -- which operates equities markets in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon and a futures exchange in London -- could draw new pools of investors to their listed companies, attracting more trading, more revenue for the exchanges and potentially lowering trading costs for big buyers and sellers like mutual funds and hedge funds. 
 But there are substantial obstacles remaining to the proposed deal, notably the need to gain shareholder approval amid competing inducements and the requirement for regulatory approval in some countries.
 Nonetheless, Michael Pagano, an associate professor of finance at Villanova University, remarked: ''It's the first true cross-Atlantic, international alliance or merger of securities exchanges. It has the opportunity to provide institutional and retail investors the ability to trade in a global framework -- to trade U.S. stocks, European stocks in one seamless environment.'' 
 A combination of the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext would create the world's largest equities market, with a total value for its listed companies of $26.9 trillion -- more than the next four markets. 
 It would have 22 hours of trading on seven markets in six countries. In addition to share trading in the United States and Europe, the New York Exchange would add an arm that traded derivatives in Europe -- the Liffe market in London -- to complement the options-trading business that it obtained as part of the recent acquisition of Archipelago, an all-electronic electronic market. 
 Trading derivatives, complex contracts whose value depends on an underlying security, has been a booming business and is more profitable to exchanges than the plain-vanilla business of dealing in shares. 
 Exchanges make money three ways: from the fees they charge companies to list their stocks, from the fees they charge for the trades and for the data they produce from all the trading, which can be packaged and sold to businesses like newspapers and brokerage firms. 
 Among the obstacles to the deal outlined yesterday is intra-European competition. Euronext management has said it welcomes the offer, but the company's shareholders will vote today on an alternative proposal from Deutsche Borse, the operator of the Frankfurt exchange. 
 Many Deutsche Borse shareholders have expressed strong interest in pairing with Euronext to create a ''European champion.'' The proposal is nonbinding, but Euronext's management would be under challenge by a vote in favor of the German exchange. 
 Any deal with New York or Frankfurt would have to be approved by regulators. A deal between Euronext and the New York Stock Exchange would have little impact on brokerage firms who already trade billions of dollars a day globally. 
 ''Technology already exists to access global exchanges,'' said Jamie Selway, president of White Cap Trading, an institutional brokerage firm. 
 It would probably not affect investors who buy shares in their national markets through brokers or electronic trading operations. But it could help small and midsize companies attract new global investors as foreign stocks become available in local currencies, enabling more trading in them, producing benefits for the companies. 
 ''When more institutions can trade more shares more quickly and efficiently,'' Mr. Pagano of Villanova said, ''the bottom line is these institutional investors can generate greater net returns for their investors, the retail investors.'' 
 There is fear, though, that the deal would allow companies to shop for the least strict regulatory environment to list a stock. A major attraction for United States markets that are shopping for European counterparts is the ability to attract companies who choose not to list in the United States because of the greater regulatory scrutiny and cost that have come as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The law, passed in the wake of corporate scandals, requires executives to certify the quality of their companies' financial controls. 
 Seth Merrin, founder of LiquidNet, which electronically and anonymously trades big blocks of stock, said, ''The only benefit I can see from N.Y.S.E. perspective is the benefit from regulatory arbitrage, all the listings moving to Europe from New York.''
 Many of the world's exchanges were once sleepy, not-for-profit utilities of a sort, operations that garnered little interest beyond their own hectic floors, where traders ran around in search of buyers and sellers. But in the last few years, many such exchanges have transformed themselves into largely electronic for-profit miniature monopolies. As their share prices soared, a race developed to use those rich prices to conclude deals. 
 ''Historically, exchanges were always a source of national pride,'' and deals between countries were off-limits, said Tom Kirchmaier, a corporate governance specialist at the London School of Economics. Euronext was one of the first successful transnational combinations of exchanges.
 The NYSE Group is still in the throes of its own reinvention. It used its merger with Archipelago to change from a not-for-profit operation to a publicly traded company, and is in the process of rolling out a new system, called hybrid, that incorporates elements of electronic trading in the traditional floor trading. 
 The board started looking at the other exchanges ''the day after the Archipelago deal closed,'' a person close to the negotiations said. Discussions were suspended while the NYSE Group completed a follow-on stock offering, and in recent weeks, negotiations heated up. 
 While the world of exchanges may seem relatively dull to some, negotiations to achieve a deal had been so secret that the two chief executives had to keep their dining top secret from New York to Paris. 
 When Jean-Francois Theodore, Euronext's chief executive, met Mr. Thain for dinner in New York, they picked the skybox at Daniel, a premier Manhattan restaurant. In Paris, they dined quietly at the Ritz. 
 As the two negotiated, the N.Y.S.E.'s traditional rival, Nasdaq, was building a stake in the London Stock Exchange, with an eye to owning it or seeking to prevent someone else from owning it through its stake. While many expected the NYSE Group to make a bid for London, those who listened to Mr. Thain knew that his interest was in building the business to include global stock, futures and derivatives trading. 
 His deal for Euronext will face its greatest obstacle today when Euronext shareholders are to vote at their annual meeting on whether or not the company should, in principle, merge with Deutsche Borse. 
 The vote was put on the agenda earlier this year by a group of hedge fund investors, said to be led by the Children's Investment Fund, who have been pushing for a deal. 
 On Friday, Deutsche Borse outlined its merger proposal for Euronext, but it was not greeted with enthusiasm because much of the management of the combined company would remain in Germany. 
 In contrast, under the New York offer, Jan Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Euronext's supervisory board, would be chairman of the new company, and Mr. Thain would be chief executive. Mr. Theodore, the Euronext chief, would be deputy chief executive and would run the European business. 
 Under the terms of the deal, the NYSE Group will pay $10.2 billion and will continue to have oversight of the United States stock business. The new company would be listed in both New York and Paris, with ownership split 50-50 between investors from each exchange. With the New York offer on the table, a shareholder vote to combine with Deutsche Borse is unlikely to pass, analysts said.
 Ultimately, financial markets may be moving to a point where there will be a limited number of global competitors, not unlike the situation in the car industry, Mr. Kirchmaier of the London School of Economics said. Both businesses are capital-intensive, and are consolidating. A result, at least so far in the auto industry, he said, had been more choice for customers.

HEADLINE: Now in Attack Mode, a Rightist Surges in Mexico

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY JR.

DATELINE: TUXTLA GUTIERREZ, Mexico, May 19 

 BODY:
Felipe Calderon loves to make allusions to Mexican folk songs. These days, the conservative candidate for president is particularly fond of recalling a song about a nag named Relampago who upsets a glistening champion, Moro, in a race.
 ''I was not the favorite,'' he boomed over loudspeakers to a crowd of farmers, fishermen and business owners in the town of Tonala on a swing in Chiapas on Thursday. ''I was not the one who was up in the polls, but do you know what I did, gentlemen? I went to work. I set about telling Mexicans what each candidate really stands for.''
 After six months in second place, Mr. Calderon has surged past the front-runner, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, with a stream of attack advertisements portraying him as a dangerous and violent leftist who will bankrupt the country. 
 Now, a month before the vote, the race is a contest between Mr. Calderon, a free-trade advocate backed by business leaders, and Mr. Lopez Obrador, a leftist who draws most of his support from poor people who feel that free-trade policies have failed to help them. 
 For his part, Mr. Lopez Obrador, 53, who was mayor of Mexico City until last year, dismisses the recent polls as ''propaganda'' and claims the numbers have been massaged to undercount working-class voters. Under his stewardship, Mexico City's finances remained solid. As for the charge that he is dangerous, he calls it simply ludicrous.
 Mr. Calderon, 43, a former congressman and energy minister, has engineered the turnaround with a nimble, slick campaign, relying heavily on radio and television advertisements, many of them negative, tested in focus groups and tailored to specific constituencies, his aides say. Mexicans vote July 2.
 Mr. Calderon, of President Vicente Fox's National Action Party, has outspent Mr. Lopez Obrador two to one on attack ads that, among other things, link the left-leaning candidate to Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's anti-American president. He has also deftly played on the perception that Mr. Lopez Obrador, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, has an authoritarian streak and a reputation as a rabble-rouser because of raucous protests against election fraud he led over a decade ago. Mr. Calderon's ads call his rival ''a danger to Mexico.'' 
 The personal attacks on Mr. Lopez Obrador were among several strategic shifts by Mr. Calderon's young campaign team in late March. Mr. Calderon now embraces President Fox, after first keeping him at arm's length, and staunchly defends the government's record on social programs and the economy.
 Mr. Calderon has also dropped his stuffy stump speech about the virtues of open markets and foreign investment, opting for a simpler message: he now vows to create jobs, jobs and more jobs. His ads call him the ''president of employment,'' and his slogan is ''My job will be to make sure you have a job.''
 One thing that unites the candidates is their opposition to President Bush's plan to build a wall along the border and deploy the National Guard. Both say the way to stop illegal immigration is to create more jobs and investment in Mexico. 
 Mr. Calderon has also stolen a page from Mr. Lopez Obrador, who promises a raft of government subsidies and handouts. Mr. Calderon, a fiscal and social conservative, now makes a point of saying he will extend and expand the welfare and health care programs Mr. Fox put in place. The promise to keep government largesse flowing draws the biggest applause at his rallies. 
 The upshot has been a remarkable political comeback. In January, five major surveys by respected pollsters showed Mr. Calderon trailing Mr. Lopez Obrador by 6 to 10 percentage points. In April and May, however, all five polls showed the race tightening with a slim lead for Mr. Calderon. 
 ''We've managed to change the subject of the election,'' said Juan Camilo Mourino, 34, Mr. Calderon's campaign manager, as he sat behind his desk in a dark blue suit at campaign headquarters, checking sports scores on a new laptop.
 Mr. Mourino said the inner circle of the campaign had a fierce debate before deciding to bombard Mr. Lopez Obrador with negative advertisements. An attempt to knock him off the ballot for ignoring a court order failed badly last year, only making him more popular. The conventional wisdom was, the more you attack Mr. Lopez Obrador, the stronger he gets by casting himself as the victim of a conspiracy. 
 But Mr. Calderon was trailing by 10 percentage points in late February. His free-trade message and ''Passion and Values for Mexico'' slogan was falling flat. ''We had to make adjustments,'' Mr. Mourino said. One of the architects of the new campaign was Antonio Sola, 34, a Spanish political consultant who was a top consultant to former Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. 
 Mr. Mourino said he also had several informal conversations about the campaign with Dick Morris, the American consultant who once worked for former President Bill Clinton, but the Calderon team decided not to hire him.
 Mr. Lopez Obrador's campaign has been slow to respond. Until recently, the candidate had resisted advice to respond to mudslinging with mudslinging of his own. Only this week did his party broadcast a radio spot calling Mr. Calderon ''a liar.''
 Besides taking his time to go on the offensive, Mr. Lopez Obrador has made other gaffes, his aides concede. In February, he ridiculed Mr. Fox, called him a chattering bird and told him to ''shut up'' and stay out of the campaign, handing Mr. Calderon fodder for his claim that Mr. Lopez Obrador is intolerant. 
 The leftist's decision in April to pass up the first debate, a classic front-runner's tactic, also backfired. Most analysts say it contributed to the notion that he can be arrogant, and contemptuous of other viewpoints. Mr. Lopez Obrador has also refused to let his aides use his modest lifestyle or his close relationship with his sons to soften his image, some inside the campaign say. 
 As for the polls, Mr. Lopez Obrador says they are the fabrications of media barons in a conspiracy to defeat him. (His aides maintain that their internal polls show he fell behind early this month, but has regained ground and now leads Mr. Calderon by six percentage points.) 
 Mr. Lopez Obrador has stubbornly insisted on running a grass-roots campaign that relies more on speeches in town squares, loudspeakers atop cars and word of mouth than on television and radio spots, his campaign aides say. That decision could turn out to be a stroke of genius or his biggest mistake. 
 ''The strategy will stay the same, because that's Andres Manuel's way of campaigning,'' said Ricardo Monreal, a senior aide. ''His way of campaigning is, as always before, street by street, town by town, at the level of the people. He believes he will beat the marketing campaign that way.''
 Mr. Monreal added: ''We all know that marketing has carried a lot of current presidents into office around the world. But Lopez Obrador isn't relying on this. He is relying on the strategy of the street.''
 Still, Mr. Lopez Obrador has made some adjustments, said Cesar Yanez, his spokesman and a close adviser. For months, the candidate avoided interviews, unless they were with local radio stations. He has always been obsessive about controlling his message. 
 In the last two weeks, however, he has submitted to three interviews on national television. He even let himself be lampooned on a morning show by a political satirist who wears a clown outfit.
 He has also begun to needle Mr. Calderon. Last week, he said the conservative candidate was a captive of his campaign advisers. 
 Mr. Calderon has kept up the invective. In Chiapas on Thursday, he leapt on Mr. Lopez Obrador's comment that President Fox was ''a puppet'' of the United States because of his restrained criticism of the United States Senate's support for more walls along the border. 
 President Chavez of Venezuela had used the same word to describe Mr. Fox last fall, and Mr. Calderon did not let the chance pass to tar Mr. Lopez Obrador again with the Chavez brush. ''He's an intolerant man, a very aggressive man, a hostile man and he has devoted himself to insulting the president,'' he said of his rival. Mr. Lopez Obrador, however, has kept his distance from Mr. Chavez. 
 The managers of both campaigns say the race is too close to call. The camps agree that the final debate on June 6, the only face-to-face confrontation between Mr. Calderon and Mr. Lopez Obrador, will be pivotal. 
 ''The debate will be important, and I say the dirty war has a limit in its impact on the election,'' Senator Ortega said. 
 ''We have to win the debate,'' Mr. Mourino said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Mexican presidential race incorrectly described the actions of Juan Camilo Mourino, the campaign manager for Felipe Calderon, during an interview. He was looking at his laptop to monitor bets being placed on each candidate on an Internet site; he was not checking sports scores.

HEADLINE: Gore Pulls His Punches

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
If Al Gore's new movie weren't titled ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' I wouldn't have quite so many problems with it.
 He should have gone with something closer to ''Revenge of the Nerd.'' That's the heartwarming angle to global warming. A college student is mesmerized by his professor's bold measurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Our hero carries this passion into Congress, where no one listens to him, and then works up a slide show that he inflicts on audiences around the world, to no discernible effect.
But then his slide show becomes a horror movie -- and it turns into a cult hit. The nerd becomes the toast of Hollywood, Sundance and Cannes. He is cheered at premieres across America. Audiences sit enraptured through a film starring graphs of CO2 concentrations and close-ups of ice cores. 
 The documentary doesn't open in theaters until tomorrow, but it's already a cinch for an Oscar, and deservedly so. Getting anyone to voluntarily endure 100 minutes of Al Gore and his slides is a historic cinematic achievement. 
 Gore isn't exactly likable in the film -- he still has that wooden preachiness and is especially hard to watch when he tries to be funny. Yet you end up admiring him for his nerdly persistence. He turned out to be right about something important: global warming is a problem worth worrying about.
 But the story he tells in the movie is hardly ''an inconvenient truth.'' It's not really true, and it's certainly not inconvenient for him or his audience. 
 In his morality tale, global warming has been an obvious crisis-in-the-making for decades, and there are obvious solutions that could have been adopted without damaging consequences. But supposedly America, almost alone among industrialized nations, has refused to do anything because the public has been bamboozled by evil oil companies and Republicans -- especially one villain who, we're reminded, got fewer popular votes than Gore did in 2000. 
 As therapeutic as this history may be for Gore, it has certain problems. Scientists recognized the greenhouse effect long ago, but the question was how much difference it would make. And until fairly recently, when evidence of global warming accumulated, many non-evil economists doubted that the risks justified the costs of the proposed remedies.
 Gore calls such cost-benefit analysis a ''false choice,'' as if the remedies really weren't expensive, and he castigates the U.S. for refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol. But most nations that did sign aren't meeting their goals because cutting emissions turned out to be so difficult. Global warming is a genuine long-term risk, but it's not easy persuading voters anywhere to make short-term sacrifices.
 Gore's cinematic strategy for rousing them is to present doomsday scenarios and ignore the evidence that civilization may just survive after all. You could argue that the ends justify the means -- that only by terrifying the public can you rouse politicians into doing the right thing.
 But even as propaganda, the film is ultimately unsatisfying. Gore doesn't mind frightening his audience with improbable future catastrophes, but he avoids any call to action that would cause immediate discomfort, either to filmgoers or to voters in the 2008 primaries.
 He doesn't propose the quickest and most efficient way to reduce greenhouse emissions: a carbon tax on gasoline and other fossil fuels. The movie gives him a forum for talking sensibly about a topic that's taboo on Capitol Hill, but he instead sticks to long-range proposals that sound more palatable, like redesigning cities to encourage mass transit or building more efficient cars and appliances. 
 Gore shows the obligatory pictures of windmills and other alternative sources of energy. But he ignores nuclear power plants, which don't spew carbon dioxide and currently produce far more electricity than all ecologically fashionable sources combined. 
 A few environmentalists, like Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace, have recognized that their movement is making a mistake in continuing to demonize nuclear power. Balanced against the risks of global warming, nukes suddenly look good -- or at least deserve to be considered rationally. Gore had a rare chance to reshape the debate, because a documentary about global warming attracts just the sort of person who marches in anti-nuke demonstrations.
 Gore could have dared, once he enticed the faithful into the theater, to challenge them with an inconvenient truth or two. But that would have been a different movie.

The Campbell Soup Company posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings yesterday on strong soup sales, and raised its forecast for the year. 
 The company increased prices on soups and other products earlier this year and those increases appeared to be working, analysts said. 
New products like premium soups in cartons and microwaveable versions of older varieties also helped soup sales, the company said. 
 Earnings rose to $166 million, or 40 cents a share, from $146 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit exceeded the 35 cents a share expected by analysts. Shares of Campbell's rose $1.10, to $33.75. 
 Sales in the period, which ended April 30 and was the third quarter of Campbell's fiscal year, rose 6 percent, to $1.84 billion, a figure that was also better than analysts had expected.
 The company said soup sales and profits were helped by its move away from promotions, which have the effect of cutting into prices, and into advertising. 
 The company raised its earnings forecast to a 9 percent to 10 percent increase over the $1.64 a share posted the previous year. 
 In February, Campbell said it was raising prices on some of its soup, sauce and beverage products by a weighted average of 2.3 percent as it tried to offset higher expenses, particularly for oil. 
 Tomato prices are also rising, and the company said it now expected inflation to add 4 percent or more to costs next year, compared with its previous outlook of 3 percent to 4 percent. Sales of soup rose 15 percent in the United States in the quarter, the company said. 
 The total United States soup, sauces and beverages segment had a 14 percent increase. Pepperidge Farm sales rose 11 percent, though overall baking and snack sales were nearly flat. 
 International soup and sauce sales fell 1 percent, hurt by currency factors.

HEADLINE: Home on the Range: A Corridor for Wildlife

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: LAKE LOUISE, Alberta 

 BODY:
One day in April, a zoologist named Paul Paquet found himself at the tiny railroad station here, in the middle of Banff National Park. Above him loomed the snow-covered crags of the Canadian Rockies, fringed with Douglas fir and lodgepole pine. A few dozen yards away, the Bow River glimmered in the sun.
 He surveyed his surroundings and grimaced. ''This park,'' he said. ''It's a national disgrace.''
 Sure it's beautiful, he said, and, yes, it is one of the last places where grizzly bears can roam and wolves can hunt the elk and bighorn sheep that are their prey. ''But there is a highway through the middle of the park, and development associated with it,'' he said. As a natural environment, ''it's a disaster.'' 
 Dr. Paquet, who works for the World Wildlife Fund and has faculty appointments at several Canadian universities, is part of a collaborative group of researchers, conservationists, government officials and others hoping to improve things -- not by removing roads or railways but by mitigating their effects. 
 They want to create a sustainable environment for wildlife from the Yukon to Yellowstone, even as people move ever deeper into the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. 
 Participants in the collaboration, called Y2Y, have designed and monitored overpasses and underpasses to help animals cross highways safely. They have negotiated limits on access to golf courses and ski slopes so animals can traverse them. They have encouraged the creation of wildlife corridors around or even across towns.
 Their goal is not just a wolf pack surviving here and there, or a few scattered grizzly bears or elk or bighorn sheep, but a landscape in which animals can thrive, roaming and reproducing widely and avoiding the genetic perils of small populations trapped in shrinking habitats. 
 When the researchers write up their findings for scientific journals, they call this goal ''functional connectivity,'' said Michael Proctor, a zoologist and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta. He calls it ''sex across the highway.''
 Around the world, conservationists are embarking on similar efforts. In India, wildlife experts are trying to establish corridors linking fragments of tiger habitat, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Similar projects are under way in Costa Rica and Australia. 
 Researchers at the University of Florida, working in an experimental landscape in South Carolina, reported last year that corridors established for wildlife can also help the survival of plants.
 But Y2Y is perhaps the largest effort. 
 Dr. Proctor, Dr. Paquet and other scientists were at the Lake Louise station because the Canadian Pacific rail line that carries grain to ports on the west coast is a major killing ground for elk, bears and other animals drawn to the tracks by grain that spills from the hoppers 
 There are arguments over who is responsible for the problem, said Mike Gibeau, as he bent to gather lentils, barley and other grain lying in small piles between the tracks. Dr. Gibeau, who works for Parks Canada, the agency that runs the national parks, is working with other researchers for ways to reduce the carnage.
 Here in Lake Louise, the tracks have been fenced off with metal mesh. Where the fence opens at the station, the rail bed has been fitted with a mat of six-inch metal spikes. Trains can pass over the spikes but, in theory, animals cannot.
 ''We're going to see if it works,'' Dr. Gibeau said, and if it does it will be adopted elsewhere. 
 Mesh fencing has also been installed along stretches of the Trans-Canada Highway as it slices across the park, and as the road is widened additional fencing will be added. The effort is motivated not so much by concern for animals, the researchers note, but to avoid injury to the drivers of cars and trucks that would otherwise hit them. In fenced areas, hardly any animals die on the road, but they are trapped on one side or the other. 
 A project a few miles south of Banff aims to correct that. There, an overpass about 50 yards wide over four lanes of traffic was built a few years ago. Researchers supported by Y2Y are studying what animals are using it and when, in hopes of installing similar crossovers elsewhere. 
 Approached from the woods, the crossover resembles any other sloping hill, covered with brushy grass, shrubs, saplings and even a clump or two of pussy willow. 
 Earthen berms on either side hide the road and mute the noise of the tens of thousands of cars that pass by daily, winter and summer.
 Animals have worn a trail along one edge and, at the top, leave prints on a cleared stretch of dirt, a so-called track pad, monitored by motion-sensitive cameras with night-vision lenses. 
 Wayne Hallstrom, a research associate with Parks Canada, said he and his colleagues checked the pad twice a week for signs of animal crossings. In the last few years, he said, they have counted tens of thousands of crossings by wolves, bears, cougars, elk, deer and other animals. Each year the numbers rise, presumably because more animals are learning where the crossings are. 
 He said researchers planned next to install a bit of barbed wire in hopes of snagging bits of fur with hair follicles that will yield DNA for testing. They want to know not just how many times bears cross the road, say, but whether there are many bears or just a few bears making multiple trips. 
 ''I think it's changed the movement of the elk,'' Mr. Hallstrom offered, ''but it's unstudied so far.''
 The overpass project is run by Anthony P. Clevenger, a scientist supported by Y2Y who works with the Western Transportation Institute at Montana State University at Bozeman. Dr. Clevenger is working on installing dozens of wildlife crossings on Route 93 in Montana, south of Flathead Lake. 
 ''We know that some species -- grizzly bears, wolves, elk and deer, also moose, prefer large structures,'' Dr. Clevenger said. ''Cougars and black bears prefer the opposite -- very constricted structures with lots of cover.'' Sometimes a pack of wolves will approach a crossing, but if only some are willing to chance it the pack as a whole may not cross. The scientists are trying to figure out a crossing design that will encourage packs to move en masse.
 Dr. Proctor said there was also talk of modifying avalanche sheds that carry cascading snow across mountain highways so animals can use them as crossovers. Y2Y began in the mid-1990's when some Canadian parks officials and conservationists approached the Kendall Foundation, an environmental grant-maker based in Boston. ''They said they had this idea of protecting the wild heart of North America from Yellowstone to Yukon,'' said Gary Tabor, who was at the foundation at the time and later became the first director of Y2Y. 
 The protection offered by national, state and provincial parks was not enough to protect their bears and elk and wolves, Dr. Tabor said they told him. ''They said, 'You have to protect larger landscapes to protect such species.' ''
 Eventually, Dr. Tabor said, the foundation convened meetings with academic researchers, conservation groups, government agencies and ''key stakeholders,'' like business leaders and American Indian representatives. They discussed what the Y2Y boundaries should be, settling on a region of about 465,000 square miles, most at elevations of 3,500 feet or higher, encircled at lower elevations by prairie grasslands. 
 They also talked about what kind of scientific work the organization should finance. Today, Y2Y receives grants from foundations and itself supports the work of established scientists, graduate students and others with an annual budget of about $2 million. (An exhibition on the initiative will open July 15 at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, where it will run until January.) 
 Initially, Dr. Tabor said, property rights organizations and other groups accused Y2Y participants of seeking to drive people out of the Rockies. ''That was never the intention,'' said Dr. Tabor, who left Y2Y in April to head the North America program for the Wildlife Conservation Society. ''The intention was, We have to have a regime where people and wildlife can live compatibly.'' Although parks and other protected areas form the core of Y2Y, ''we work community by community,'' he said. 
 ''It's not just public lands; it's about private lands in between,'' he added.
 When people objected that restrictions would harm the region's economy, Y2Y pointed to a study showing that a pristine environment could draw people who come to the area because of its ecological integrity, the so-called amenity migrants, said Rob Buffler, who replaced Dr. Tabor as Y2Y's chief. 
 One of the towns drawing them is Canmore, not only because of its beautiful location in the Bow River Valley, but also because it is within commuting distance of Calgary, thriving in Alberta's oil and gas boom, and Banff. 
 The growing town, which the researchers call ''the Canmore plug,'' has forced animals that once traveled along the river up the mountain slopes, Dr. Gibeau said. 
 To accommodate them, he said, some ski resorts and golf courses are limiting access to people. 
 ''Grizzly bears come down here to walk down the road in the middle of the night,'' he said. In April, Parks Canada appealed to drivers to use one major road, the Bow Valley Parkway, only from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. until June 25, to create traffic-free periods for wildlife on the move in spring. 
 But the human species does not always embrace all of Y2Y's goals. Hikers camp in wildlife underpasses. Mountain bikers drive animals away from an overpass built over a hydroelectric plant canal, Dr. Gibeau said, and they ruin hillside vegetation by riding their brakes too hard on the way down.
 Such problems sometimes leave the researchers wondering whether their efforts do any good. Dr. Paquet said it was troubling to think that he might simply be ''monitoring the slow demise'' of the ecosystem. 
 Dr. Gibeau carries in his wallet a much-folded piece of paper with words the naturalist Aldo Leopold wrote more than 30 years ago: ''One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds,'' Leopold wrote. ''Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well -- and does not want to be told otherwise.''
 Dr. Gibeau has this ''ecological education,'' and he knows Leopold was right. 
 ''People who come here are just so awestruck by the scenery that they cannot understand its ecological problems'' he said. ''They say, 'How can there be trouble here?' But once you peel back the veneer, this place is like most other places, a human-dominated system.''

Wandering Wolf Inspires Project

KANANASKIS STATION, Alberta -- A wolf gave scientists the idea for Y2Y, the conservation collaborative covering the Rockies from the Yukon to Yellowstone.
 Researchers captured the wolf, a female, near here on a rainy June day in 1991. They fitted her with a collar and satellite transmitter and, over the next two years, picked up signals as she moved north to Banff National Park, and then west into British Columbia, south across the United States border and through Glacier National Park to Browning, Mont., to Idaho and then to Washington and finally north again to British Columbia, where she stayed a few weeks before taking off on another looping trip south.
 The wolf, named Pluie (ploo-WEE, rain in French) wandered an area of about 40,000 square miles, spending time with five packs. ''We thought she was on a pickup truck for a while,'' said Paul Paquet, a zoologist with the World Wildlife Fund, who led the tracking effort. ''She was moving so fast.'' 
 In December 1993, near Fernie, British Columbia, Pluie's collar issued its last signal. Soon after, someone sent its battery to Dr. Paquet. It had a bullet hole through it.
 But Pluie was not dead, not yet. Two years later she turned up, with her batteryless collar, outside Invermere, British Columbia, near Kootenay National Park. She was with an adult male and three pups. A hunter had shot them all dead. 
 Pluie had shown that despite everything -- roads, rails, people and buildings -- large carnivores and their prey still roamed the Rocky Mountains. But she also showed that effective conservation must transcend state, provincial and national borders and provide a way to protect animals on the move from civilization's threats. 
 The grizzly bear is the official symbol of Y2Y. But Dr. Paquet said it was important for people to know about Pluie. ''This was the founding story of Y2Y,'' he said. ''Really, the whole idea evolved out of it.'' CORNELIA DEAN

HEADLINE: 9/11 Compensation Claims Continue to Trickle In Late

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
About 290 New York City employees have filed workers' compensation claims stemming from the World Trade Center attack since the two-year deadline for filing such claims passed, city officials said yesterday.
 City employees filed about 900 claims within the two years after the 9/11 attack, and nearly all, 96.5 percent, were found to be valid and eligible for compensation, the officials said. In two-thirds of those cases, however, no compensation was ever paid, because the workers did not ultimately lose wages or incur major medical costs, they said.
The 9/11 compensation claims have been in the spotlight recently with the disclosure that the city had appealed the awarding of health care benefits to a former deputy mayor, Rudy Washington. 
 Last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he did not agree with the appeal and directed the city's Law Department to resolve the matter. City lawyers are scheduled to meet with Mr. Washington's lawyer today.
 The fact that so many new claims have been filed since the deadline is prompting calls for Albany to extend the deadline for late-filing workers, many of whom say that the attack resulted in respiratory, digestive or psychiatric ailments that did not become apparent until years later, after the September 2003 deadline for filing the claims had passed.
 ''Latent respiratory illnesses can occur after two years, and that needs to be addressed,'' Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens of Manhattan told the corporation counsel, Michael A. Cardozo, during a budget hearing yesterday. Workers have difficulty proving that their respiratory illnesses are 9/11-related, she said, adding, ''I have a serious problem with that.'' 
 Last year, the Legislature approved a bill that paved the way for government workers who worked near ground zero after the attack and later developed certain illnesses to obtain disability pensions equivalent to three-quarters of their pay. The bill created a ''presumption'' that the illness resulted from 9/11, waiving the burden of having to prove that assertion.
 The Bloomberg administration unsuccessfully opposed the measure, saying it could cost the city pension system $50 million a year. 
 This year, Assemblyman Jonathan L. Bing, a Manhattan Democrat, and Senator John J. Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, have introduced a similar bill in Albany. It would create a similar presumption that applies to workers' compensation, waive the two-year deadline and give workers up to six months from the time they notice their symptoms to file their claims.
 It would also allow for workers whose claims had been rejected to get a new hearing.
 Such a bill would have helped people like Mr. Washington, who was briefly hospitalized shortly after the attack but did not file a workers' compensation claim until December 2004. (He has not tried to claim a disability pension.)
 Mr. Cardozo did not express an opinion on the new bill. He said that the city received about 15,000 workers' compensation claims each year and that World Trade Center-related claims are treated ''like any other.''
 ''If you have not filed the claim within two years, the state law requires that we assert the appropriate defense -- what lawyers call the statute-of-limitations defense,'' Mr. Cardozo told Councilman David I. Weprin of Queens.
 Mr. Cardozo later added: ''You have to prove that whatever illness you have is caused by 9/11, if that's what you're claiming. It is our job, since we're defending the city in those instances, to say, 'You have to demonstrate that you have become ill as a result of 9/11.' ''
 He rejected the notion that 9/11 claimants faced insurmountable burdens.
 ''Virtually all of the claims that were filed within the two-year limitation period, with the exception of about 3.5 percent -- all of those claims we found appropriate,'' Mr. Cardozo said, adding that the overall rejection rate was about 5 percent. 
 John F. Burton Jr., an economist and lawyer at Rutgers University who has written extensively about workers' compensation, said that New York's two-year deadline was too restrictive.
 ''New York is unusual in having a statute of limitations that is often very difficult for workers to meet if they have a delay between the date of exposure to a toxic substance and the time they are disabled,'' he said. He urged the state to change the deadline from two years after the accident to three years after the worker is disabled.

HEADLINE: $44 Million Ferry Terminal Is to Open in Weehawken Today

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
New Jersey residents who commute to Manhattan by ferry will have a gleaming new terminal to use in Weehawken, N.J., starting today -- just in time to ease the pain of an increase in fares. 
 The terminal, which cost $44 million in public money to build, will be the home base of New York Waterway, a private company that runs ferries between several docks in New Jersey, Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Next week, Waterway plans to raise its fares to and from the new terminal to as much as $9 each way.
 New Jersey Transit, which operates trains and buses throughout the state, owns the terminal but will not run it or set fares, said Kris Kolluri, the state's commissioner of transportation and the chairman of the transit agency.
 ''I see this as a public-private partnership where a private company is willing to provide the type of transportation services that the public is looking for,'' Mr. Kolluri said.
 A company affiliated with Waterway, which is controlled by the family of Arthur Imperatore, has a 32-year lease to operate the new terminal. Last fall, New York City's Economic Development Corporation opened a $56 million terminal on the West Side of Midtown, which is also operated by Waterway. The combined $100 million in spending on ferry docks was a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when tens of thousands of panicked people evacuated Manhattan by boat.
 Waterway rode to the rescue of many of them and prospered in the months that followed, expanding its operation as a substitute for the PATH train service to Lower Manhattan, while it was shut down. Since then, government officials like Mr. Kolluri have said that regular ferry service is a critical link in the region's transportation network.
 But ferries, unlike other forms of mass transit in the area, receive no operating subsidies. Instead, public agencies have chosen to build the infrastructure and hope that the private operators will come.
 So far, few have appeared. Waterway ran into such dire financial straits in late 2004 that it had to sell about half of its fleet and routes to a startup company, BillyBey Ferry, which is controlled by a Manhattan lawyer, William B. Wachtel. 
 On June 1, the Imperatore family's half of the Waterway ferry service will raise prices by 4 percent to more than 16 percent because of the high cost of fuel, said Pat Smith, a Waterway spokesman. 
 A one-way ticket to ride between the new terminals in Weehawken and Midtown will cost $6, up from $5.75. The one-way fare between Weehawken and the dock at the World Financial Center or at Pier 11 near Wall Street will rise to $9 from $7.75.

HEADLINE: Closing Arguments in Trial Of Subway Bombing Case

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM

 BODY:
A prosecutor at the trial of a Pakistani immigrant charged with plotting to blow up the Herald Square subway station used his closing argument yesterday to urge the jurors to ask themselves a question: 
 How would they react if someone who shared their anger and passion about a closely held political opinion suggested that they bomb a busy subway station to get their point across?
The prosecutor, Todd Harrison, an assistant United States attorney, told the jurors he believed that each of them, whether the opinion was about the war in Iraq, the Abu Ghraib prison scandal or the new Medicare plan, would say, ''Are you crazy?'' 
 ''I've got political opinions, but I don't think putting a bomb in crowded subway system in New York City is the way to go,'' Mr. Harrison said, adding what he thought the jurors would answer: ''Thanks, but no thanks.''
 Mr. Harrison said the four-week trial in Brooklyn federal court boiled down to that simple question and suggested that the jurors use their common sense today, when they begin to weigh the fate of the man charged in the plot, Shahawar Matin Siraj, 23.
 One of Mr. Siraj's lawyers, Martin R. Stolar, sought to present a more complex picture in his closing argument. He contended that the plot was driven by a paid police informer, a 50-year-old Egyptian-born man he had sought to portray throughout the trial as a canny and greedy manipulator and the real mastermind.
 It was the informer, he said, who treated the younger man like a son and entrapped him by inflaming his political passions with pictures from Abu Ghraib and talk of abuses of Muslims in America and in the Middle East. 
 He said that his client was not ''the brightest bulb in the chandelier'' and that it was the informer, Osama Eldawoody, who had convinced him that it was his duty as a Muslim to wage jihad against the American economy, though he urged him to avoid killing.
 ''The problem here is the firebrand who stirred the pot is a government agent, not some stranger or imam,'' Mr. Stolar told the jury during his two-hour summation. ''And the law does not allow the government to create a crime; it just is not permitted. That is why the defense of entrapment exists.''
 Throughout the arguments, Mr. Siraj appeared downcast, seated between two of his three lawyers. His fingers were laced together on the defense table, and he was wearing a blue pinstripe suit and a light gray open-collared shirt. 
 His mother, who prayed in the courtroom hallway during much of the trial, fingering light-green prayer beads and sometimes chanting, sat in the back row of the courtroom, rocking slightly back and forth. 
 In his opening statement at the trial, Mr. Stolar had acknowledged that his client had taken part in the plot along with another man and Mr. Eldawoody, a nuclear engineer who secretly recorded more than 30 hours of conversations, mostly with Mr. Siraj. The other man, James Elshafay, 21, pleaded guilty and testified against Mr. Siraj. 
 Mr. Stolar has argued that the government manufactured the crime, noting that Mr. Eldawoody had told the two men that he was part of a nonexistent terrorist group and would supply the explosives. Mr. Stolar stressed to the jury that if they found that his client was not predisposed to commit an act of violence, they should find him not guilty.
 Mr. Stolar conceded that many of the statements his client made on the recordings were ''despicable stuff'' -- the young man praised Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, said he approved of suicide bombings in Israel and Palestine and repeatedly talked about killing Jews. 
 ''But the verdict you make is not because you dislike the man, it's because you follow the law,'' he said. ''If your verdict sheet could say 'reluctantly not guilty,' that's the box I want you to check.''
 Earlier in the day, another prosecutor, Marshall Miller, hammered away at Mr. Siraj's entrapment defense. He detailed statements by Mr. Siraj that he said undercut the argument that he was not predisposed to violence before he met Mr. Eldawoody.
 Mr. Miller cited the testimony of an undercover detective who had frequented the Islamic bookstore where Mr. Siraj worked nearly a year before the young man first met Mr. Eldawoody in September 2003.
 The detective, who wrote dozens of reports about his conversations with Mr. Siraj, was called to rebut the testimony of Mr. Siraj, who testified that he had never talked about violent jihad or support for terrorism until he met Mr. Eldawoody.
 The detective, testifying under a pseudonym, recounted statement after statement that Mr. Siraj had made long before he met the informer, including saying that he hoped Al Qaeda operatives would attack America again and that he would carry out a suicide bombing for revenge if someone killed his family. The detective quoted Mr. Siraj in one of his reports as saying that bin Laden ''was a talented brother and a great planner'' and said he hoped he ''planned something big for America.''
 Mr. Miller told the jurors they had heard ''conversation after conversation of the defendant spouting violent jihad and describing his own violent activities'' long before he met Mr. Eldawoody.
 Addressing the entrapment defense directly, he argued that the prosecution of Mr. Siraj was justified because he was disposed to carrying out an attack. ''If there are people out there who are ready and willing to bomb the subway system, then law enforcement should be out there trying to arrest them before attacks happen,'' he said.
 Mr. Stolar dismissed the government's arguments about his client's statements, saying that just because Mr. Siraj said he could understand suicide bombings in Israel, that does not mean ''he is predisposed to blowing up a subway station in New York.''
 ''It's his First Amendment right to have and express that opinion,'' Mr. Stolar said. ''It does not mean that it makes him disposed toward killing or a violent crime.''

HEADLINE: Over Budget, Fulton Street Transit Hub Faces a Redesign 

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The cost of the Fulton Street Transit Center, designed to link a dozen subway lines in Lower Manhattan, has jumped by as much as $50 million and the project needs to be scaled back, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said yesterday. 
 Mysore Nagaraja, who oversees capital construction for the authority, said the project, which will also connect subway riders with a new World Trade Center transportation center, was running $40 million to $50 million over its original budget of $799 million.
The opening of the Fulton Street center has already been delayed from December 2008 to June 2009, transit officials said. It is intended to provide easier transfers for riders on the A, C, E, J, M, R, W, Z, 2, 3, 4 and 5 lines.
 Mr. Nagaraja blamed rising real estate values that have forced the authority to pay more for private property at the site. Construction costs have also increased because of more stringent standards for asbestos removal adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency, transit officials said.
 The project is being financed with part of $4.5 billion in grants from the Federal Transit Administration to various agencies for rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 The transit center's design, first unveiled in May 2004, has already been scaled back because of budget constraints. 
 What had been envisioned as a striking example of train station architecture, with a conical steel-and-glass dome admitting light to what some called a Grand Central Terminal for Lower Manhattan, was altered slightly to incorporate a less prominent dome.
 Mr. Nagaraja, who spoke yesterday before a committee of the authority, said no decisions had been made about specific changes to address the latest budget gap. 
 He said a priority would be put on fulfilling commitments that were part of an environmental impact statement on the project, which took two years to complete.
 Timothy O'Brien, a spokesman for the authority, said planners were doing ''everything they can to maintain the concept of a light and airy'' transit center.
 ''What the final rendering will look like, we can't say,'' he said. ''They are trying to do it in a way that is economically elegant.''

HEADLINE: On Global Warming, Passionate Warnings With Pictures

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

An Inconvenient Truth
The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It
By Al Gore
Illustrated. 325 pages. Rodale. $21.95.
 Lately, global warming seems to be tiptoeing toward a tipping point in the public consciousness. There has been broad agreement over the fundamentals of global warming in mainstream scientific circles for some time now. And despite efforts by the Bush administration to shrug it off as an incremental threat best dealt with through voluntary emissions controls and technological innovation, the issue has been making inroads in the collective imagination, spurred by new scientific reports pointing to rising temperatures around the world and melting ice fields in Greenland and Antarctica. A year ago, the National Academy of Sciences joined similar groups from other countries in calling for prompt action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A Time magazine cover story in April declared that ''the climate is crashing and global warming is to blame,'' noting that a new Time/ABC News/Stanford University poll showed that 87 percent of respondents believe the government should encourage or require a lowering of power-plant emissions. That same month, a U.S. News & World Report article noted that dozens of evangelical leaders had called for federal legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and that ''a growing number of investors are pushing for change from the business community'' as well. And even Hollywood movies like the kiddie cartoon ''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' and the much sillier disaster epic ''The Day After Tomorrow'' take climate change as a narrative premise. 
 Enter -- or rather, re-enter -- Al Gore, former vice president, former Democratic candidate for president and longtime champion of the environment, who helped to organize the first Congressional hearings on global warming several decades ago.
 Fourteen years ago, during the 1992 campaign, the current president's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, dismissed Mr. Gore as ''Ozone Man'' -- if the Clinton-Gore ticket were elected, he suggested, ''we'll be up to our neck in owls and out of work for every American'' -- but with the emerging consensus on global warming today, Mr. Gore's passionate warnings about climate change seem increasingly prescient. He has revived the slide presentation about global warming that he first began giving in 1990 and taken that slide show on the road, and he has now turned that presentation into a book and a documentary film, both called ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' The movie (which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Wednesday) shows a focused and accessible Gore -- ''a funnier, more relaxed and sympathetic character'' than he was as a candidate, said The Observer, the British newspaper -- and has revived talk in some circles of another possible Gore run for the White House.
 As for the book, its roots as a slide show are very much in evidence. It does not pretend to grapple with climate change with the sort of minute detail and analysis displayed by three books on the subject that came out earlier this spring (''The Winds of Change'' by Eugene Linden, ''The Weather Makers'' by Tim Flannery and ''Field Notes From a Catastrophe'' by Elizabeth Kolbert), and yet as a user-friendly introduction to global warming and a succinct summary of many of the central arguments laid out in those other volumes, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' is lucid, harrowing and bluntly effective. 
 Like Mr. Gore's 1992 book ''Earth in the Balance,'' this volume displays an earnest, teacherly tone, but it's largely free of the New Age psychobabble and A-student grandiosity that rumbled through that earlier book. The author's wonky fascination with policy minutiae has been tamed in these pages, and his love of charts and graphs has been put to good use. Whereas the charts in ''Earth in the Balance'' tended to make the reader's eyes glaze over, the ones here clearly illustrate the human-caused rise in carbon dioxide levels in recent years, the simultaneous rise in Northern Hemisphere temperatures and the correlation between the two. Mr. Gore points out that 20 of the 21 hottest years measured ''have occurred within the last 25 years,'' adding that the hottest year yet was 2005 -- a year in which ''more than 200 cities and towns'' in the Western United States set all-time heat records. 
 As for the volume's copious photos, they too serve to underscore important points. We see Mount Kilimanjaro in the process of losing its famous snows over three and a half decades, and Glacier National Park its glaciers in a similar period of time. There are satellite images of an ice shelf in Antarctica (previously thought to be stable for another 100 years) breaking up within the astonishing period of 35 days, and photos that show a healthy, Kodachrome-bright coral reef, juxtaposed with photos of a dying coral reef that has been bleached by hotter ocean waters. 
 Pausing now and then to offer personal asides, Mr. Gore methodically lays out the probable consequences of rising temperatures: powerful and more destructive hurricanes fueled by warmer ocean waters (2005, the year of Katrina, was not just a record year for hurricanes but also saw unusual flooding in places like Europe and China); increased soil moisture evaporation, which means drier land, less productive agriculture and more fires; and melting ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland, which would lead to rising ocean levels, which in turn would endanger low-lying regions of the world from southern Florida to large portions of the Netherlands. 
 Mr. Gore does a cogent job of explaining how global warming can disrupt delicate ecological balances, resulting in the spread of pests (like the pine beetle, whose migration used to be slowed by colder winters), increases in the range of disease vectors (including mosquitoes, ticks and fleas), and the extinction of a growing number of species. 
 Already, he claims, a study shows that ''polar bears have been drowning in significant numbers'' as melting Arctic ice forces them to swim longer and longer distances, while other studies indicate that the population of Emperor penguins ''has declined by an estimated 70 percent over the past 50 years.'' 
 The book contains some oversimplifications. While Mr. Gore observes that the United States is currently responsible for more greenhouse gas pollution than South America, Africa, the Middle East, Australia, Japan and Asia combined, he underplays the daunting increase in emissions that a rapidly growing China will produce in the next several decades. And in an effort to communicate the message that something can still be done about global warming, he resorts, in the book's closing pages, to some corny invocations of America's can-do, put-a-man-on-the-moon spirit.
 For the most part, however, Mr. Gore's stripped-down narrative emphasizes facts over emotion, common sense over portentous predictions -- an approach that proves considerably more persuasive than the more alarmist one assumed, say, by Tim Flannery in ''The Weather Makers.'' Mr. Gore shows why environmental health and a healthy economy do not constitute mutually exclusive choices, and he enumerates practical steps that can be taken to reduce carbon emissions to a point below 1970's levels. 
 Mr. Gore, who once wrote an introduction to an edition of Rachel Carson's classic ''Silent Spring'' (the 1962 book that not only alerted readers to the dangers of pesticides, but is also credited with spurring the modern environmental movement), isn't a scientist like Carson and doesn't possess her literary gifts; he writes, rather, as a popularizer of other people's research and ideas. But in this multimedia day of shorter attention spans and high-profile authors, ''An Inconvenient Truth'' (the book and the movie) could play a similar role in galvanizing public opinion about a real and present danger. It could goad the public into reading more scholarly books on the subject, and it might even push awareness of global warming to a real tipping point -- and beyond.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Yields on PC's From China

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Long story short, an influential member of Congress played the China card, and the State Department folded.
 It was a drama that reached a conclusion late last week, when the State Department, responding to fears that its security might be breached by a secretly placed device or hidden software, agreed to keep personal computers made by Lenovo of China off its networks that handle classified government messages and documents.
 The damage to Lenovo is more to its reputation than to its pocketbook. The State Department will use the 16,000 desktop computers it purchased from Lenovo, just not on the computer networks that carry sensitive government intelligence. 
 Yet the episode does point to how much relations between the United States and China have become a tangled web of political, trade and security issues. Mutual economic dependence and mutual distrust, it seems, go hand in hand. 
 To the Lenovo side, the outcome was a matter of anti-China politics overriding economic logic.
 Last year, the Chinese company completed the purchase of the personal computer business of I.B.M., after the Bush administration concluded a national security review. Given the nod, Lenovo figured it was free to do business in America just like any other personal computer company.
 But the State Department decision suggests that it is not that simple. ''Unfortunately, we're in a situation where certain people in Congress and elsewhere want to make a political issue of this,'' said Jeffrey Carlisle, vice president of government relations for Lenovo. ''They are trying to create as uncomfortable an atmosphere as possible for us in doing business with the federal government.''
 Mr. Carlisle characterizes the worry that the Chinese government might secretly slip spying hardware or software on Lenovo computers shipped to the State Department as ''a fantasy.'' The desktop machines, he said, will be made in Monterrey, Mexico, and Raleigh, N.C., at plants purchased from I.B.M.
 ''It's the same places, using the same processes as I.B.M. had,'' Mr. Carlisle said. ''Nothing's changed.''
 Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, said the change of ownership changes a lot. In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice earlier this month, he wrote that because of the Chinese government's ''coordinated espionage program'' intended to steal American secrets, the Lenovo computers ''should not be used in the classified network.''
 Mr. Wolf is the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the budget appropriations for the State Department, Commerce Department and Justice Department.
 In an interview yesterday, Mr. Wolf said the security concerns about the State Department's use of Lenovo computers had been brought to his attention by two members of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan group appointed by Congress. ''They deserve the credit for this,'' Mr. Wolf said.
 Larry M. Wortzel, a member of the review commission and former military attache to the American embassy in Beijing, said he and another commission member, Michael R. Wessel, began looking into the sale in March. What most concerned them, he said, was that 900 of the Lenovo computers were intended for use on the State Department's classified networks.
 Lenovo is partly owned by the Chinese government, which holds 27 percent. ''This is a company owned and beholden to agencies of the People's Republic of China,'' Mr. Wortzel said. ''Our assumption is that if the Chinese intelligence agencies could take action, they would take action.''
 After meetings with American government and securities agencies, including classified briefings, Mr. Wortzel and Mr. Wessel concluded that it would be possible for the Chinese government to put clandestine hardware or software on personal computers that might be able to tap into American intelligence. 
 ''This is not off the wall as to whether there are potential security concerns here,'' Mr. Wessel said.
 Both Mr. Wortzel and Mr. Wessel insisted that theirs is not an anti-China stance or even anti-Lenovo.
 ''I'm sure they are good computers,'' Mr. Wortzel said. ''I would use them in my home. But I would not use one on a classified network at the State Department.''
 The State Department said last Thursday that it would not use the Lenovo computers on its classified networks. In a letter to Mr. Wolf, Richard J. Griffin, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, said that the department had ''consulted with U.S. government security experts and is recommending that the computers purchased last fall be utilized on unclassified systems only.'' 
 The letter added that the State Department was ''initiating changes in its procurement processes in light of the changing ownership'' of computer equipment suppliers. A spokesman said that ''to allay any possible fears and any possible concerns, this is where we came out.''
 Certainly, there are fears aplenty these days in any matter related to China. Mr. Carlisle of Lenovo insists any security fears about its computers are unfounded. 
 The company's computers and the software loaded on it are routinely tested inside the company and, on the State Department sale, by third-party American contractors, like CDW.
 ''If anything were detected, it would be a death warrant for the company,'' Mr. Carlisle said. ''No one would ever buy another Lenovo PC. It would make no sense to do it.''
 Lenovo, industry analysts say, may well have the stronger argument, but it may still suffer. 
 ''Basically, this is much ado about nothing,'' said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates. ''Unfortunately, perceptions count. And the damage has already been done.''

HEADLINE: Lowe's Profit Up 44%, but Outlook Is Lowered 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Lowe's Companies, the home-improvement retailer, said yesterday that first-quarter profit rose 44 percent on higher sales of appliances and lawn mowers, but the company cut its annual revenue forecast, setting off a 4 percent decline in its share price. 
 Net income climbed to $841 million, or $1.06 a share, from $586 million, or 73 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 94 cents a share.
Sales increased 20 percent, to $11.92 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5.7 percent, less than some analysts projected. 
 The chief executive, Robert A. Niblock, said Lowe's cut its forecast for full-year sales gains because of higher fuel prices and trends in consumer spending. Investors are concerned that revenue growth will slow at Lowe's as interest rates climb.
 ''If you look at the past few times we've had a rising interest rate cycle, they've had a slowdown'' in comparable sales, said Bryan Keane, an analyst with the U.S. Trust Company in New York, referring to sales at stores open at least a year. 
 Shares of Lowe's fell $2.82, or 4.5 percent, to $59.82. 
 Lowe's, based in Mooresville, N.C., lowered its full-year sales forecast to an increase of 13 percent from as much as 14 percent and its same-store sales growth forecast to 4 percent to 5 percent, from 5 percent to 6 percent. It raised its projection for profit in the year ending in January to $4.14 to $4.22 a share.
 Lowe's first-quarter sales were strong across most of the United States except the West Coast, where rain affected sales, and one north-central market, where layoffs and plant closings hurt revenue, Mr. Niblock said in a call with analysts.
 ''The run-up in gas prices probably has hit disposable income for consumers a little, but the American consumer's pretty resilient,'' Mr. Niblock said in an interview. ''They'll adjust to that.''

HEADLINE: Standard & Poor's Upgrades City's Credit Rating to Best Ever

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
In a vote of confidence from Wall Street, one of the three major bond-rating agencies upgraded its rating of New York City's debt yesterday, citing surging tax revenues, a commitment from Albany to finance school construction projects and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's decision to create a $2 billion trust fund to pay for the health care expenses of retired city workers. 
 The upgrade, to AA- from A+, gives the city's general obligation debt, which is about $34.2 billion, its highest credit rating ever by the agency, Standard & Poor's.
Of the two other major credit-rating agencies, Fitch Ratings gives the city an A+ and Moody's Investors Service gives it an A1, the equivalent of A+. 
 Dall W. Forsythe, an expert on public finance at Baruch College, said the upgrade was an important step in the city's decades-long journey from the fiscal abyss of the mid-1970's. ''It means the city can borrow a little more cheaply and does not have to pay quite as high interest rates,'' he said. ''It means that a slightly larger group of investors will be willing to buy the city's bonds.'' 
 Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg emphasized fiscal restraint when he addressed the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy organization, for the first time since December 2002. The group has expressed alarm about the rising costs of debt service, Medicaid and the pensions and health care benefits of city workers. 
 Mr. Bloomberg said so-called discretionary spending should be held to the rate of inflation or lower, but acknowledged that fixed costs, like pension fund payments, were growing rapidly.
 ''To achieve structural balance, we need not only continued fiscal restraint at City Hall, we must also work with our municipal unions to achieve pension reform in Albany,'' he said. ''That will be one of the great battles to come.'' 
 However, the mayor's own budget director, Mark Page, recently noted the immense challenges involved in potentially altering pension plans. Any changes made now would take decades to produce substantial savings, while the opposition from unions would be intense and immediate, he said. 
 ''The math of pension reform, for somebody you haven't hired yet, in terms of what resources it makes available to your taxpayers or other services or what have you, is extraordinarily long term,'' Mr. Page said at a Citizens Budget Commission conference on April 8. ''And political equations tend not to be.'' 
 Randi Weingarten, the chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, a coalition of unions, said pensions were being made a scapegoat. ''The average pension of a municipal worker is $20,000 a year,'' she said. ''That's not what I call breaking the bank.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Questions China on Arms Buildup

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
China's leadership has not satisfactorily explained its military expansion and goals, even as it modernizes its forces to be able to challenge foreign armed forces operating in the region, the Defense Department said in a report released Tuesday.
 ''China's leaders have yet to adequately explain the purposes or desired end-states of their military expansion,'' according to the 2006 report, ''Military Power of the People's Republic of China.'' ''Estimates place Chinese defense expenditure at two to three times officially disclosed figures.'' 
The 50-page report, delivered annually to Congress, is at www.defenselink.mil/pubs. The report includes a list of new Chinese weaponry and describes among other things the modernization of China's ballistic missile force. But it balances its cautionary language about military competition with China with carefully chosen words expressing optimism for harmonious relations with Beijing.
 In past years, the report has taken on a diplomatic life of its own, sparking an annual round of analysis and criticism from the United States that, in turn, has prompted an annual response of criticism and analysis from China. 
 The report comes as the Bush administration works to entice China into a partnership to halt the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea.
 Peter W. Rodman, the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said Tuesday that the report had been circulated and approved across the United States government and that it represented ''a community view about the facts.''
 ''The United States welcomes the rise of a peaceful and prosperous China,'' the report said. ''U.S. policy encourages China to participate as a responsible international stakeholder by taking on a greater share of responsibility for the health and success of the global system from which China has derived great benefit.''
 The Chinese military, according to the report, has embarked on a long-term effort to change from a large army designed for wars of attrition on its home territory into ''a more modern force capable of fighting short-duration, high-intensity conflicts against high-tech adversaries.''
 While acknowledging that China has only a limited ability to sustain military operations at great distances, the report also states that Chinese armed forces have the potential to compete with the United States by fielding ''disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional U.S. military advantages.''
 What that means in the near term, the report added, is that China will continue its efforts to build up its forces across the strait from Taiwan, which Beijing considers a runaway province, even as it is ''generating capabilities that could apply to other regional contingencies, such as conflicts over resources or territory.''
 China had by last year deployed 710 to 790 short-range ballistic missiles across from Taiwan, an increase from the estimated 650 to 730 missiles deployed a year before.
 The report details trends in China's ability to deny other armed forces access across the region by a combination of strike aircraft, submarines and precision missiles. The report argues that those weapons ''have the potential to pose credible threats to modern militaries operating in the region.''
 The expanding Chinese economy has resulted in that nation's becoming, in 2004, the world's second largest consumer and third largest importer of oil. 
 China has carefully sought and nurtured relationships with energy-producing nations in regions where the United States previously operated without competition from China.
 ''Several aspects of China's military development have surprised U.S. analysts,'' the report said, ''including the pace and scope of its strategic forces modernization.'' 
 The term ''strategic forces'' applies to long-range nuclear weapons. China is modernizing its longer-range ballistic missiles by upgrading some systems and replacing others with mobile, quick-launch models, the report said.
 The report is based on evidence that the Chinese are ''at the beginning of some serious modernization of their overall strategic forces,'' said Mr. Rodman, the assistant secretary of defense.
 Chinese officials have dismissed warnings about its military modernization, saying that China is pursuing national security interests and protecting its territory as any large nation would, and that its military constitutes no threat to American soil.

HEADLINE: Don't Be Friends With Christians or Jews, Saudi Texts Say 

BYLINE: By HASSAN FATTAH; Abdulnabi Shaheen contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for this article.

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, May 23 

 BODY:
Despite years of work aimed at changing Saudi Arabia's public school curriculum, the country's latest textbooks continue to promote intolerance of other religions, a new study said Tuesday.
 A first-grade student is taught that ''Every religion other than Islam is false''; the teacher instructed to ''Give examples of false religions, like Judaism, Christianity, paganism, etc.'' Fifth graders learn ''It is forbidden for a Muslim to be a loyal friend to someone who does not believe in God and his prophet, or someone who fights the religion of Islam.''
Those lessons are among numerous examples cited in a controversial new study of Saudi Arabia's religious curriculum released Tuesday by the Center for Religious Freedom, part of Freedom House, a nonprofit group in Washington that seeks to encourage democracy. Despite official pronouncements that curriculum change is marching ahead, intolerance continues to pervade religious education in Saudi public schools, the report says. 
 ''It is not hate speech here and there, it is an ideology that runs throughout,'' Nina Shea, the center's director and principal author of the report, said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''It adds up to an argument, an ideology of us versus them.'' 
 The report's authors, who worked with the Institute for Gulf Affairs, a research group based in Washington that focuses on the Middle East, obtained 12 history and religion textbooks from parents of Saudi schoolchildren, and translated the texts. The textbooks were used last year in Saudi schools and Saudi-run schools in Washington, London, Paris and several other cities, the report said. 
 The results, they say, outline a systematic theme of ''hatred toward 'unbelievers,' '' mainly Christians, Jews, Hindus and atheists, but also Shiites and other Muslims who do not ascribe to the country's orthodox Wahhabi teaching of Islam. 
 Saudi Arabia's education system was heavily scrutinized after the Sept. 11 attacks, and criticized internationally for its extremism. Since then, the government has faced significant pressure from both inside and outside the country to change its schools. King Abdullah, the Saudi monarch, has made the reform a priority.
 Religion is at the core of Saudi public education and can amount to one quarter to a third of class time. By the time Saudi students reach high school, that amount drops slightly to at least one period in six devoted to religious topics, including interpretation of holy texts, theology and morality. (The report looked solely at religion and history texts, and excluded books on other subjects like math and science.)
 The findings contradict Saudi statements that educational materials have been revised, the report said.
 Saudi officials acknowledged that acerbic language remains in Saudi textbooks, but said their revision was far from complete.
 Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Prince Turki Al-Faisal, responding to an article by Ms. Shea in The Washington Post over the weekend, said in a statement Monday, ''There are hundreds of books that are being revised to comply with the new requirements, and the process remains ongoing.''
 He added, ''The objective of the educational system is to fight intolerance and to prepare Saudi youth with the skills and knowledge to compete in the global economy.''
 Saudi reformers note that if the latest textbooks are wanting, they are still a far cry from what they were five years ago. The Saudi public, said Muhammad al-Zulfa, a member of the consultative Shura council, say they are generally in favor of reforming textbooks and curriculum, but religious conservatives have stymied the effort. 
 ''It is an uphill battle to revise the curriculum because the resistance by well-established conservative pockets is so fierce,'' Mr. Zulfa said.
 One Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity, also cited religious conservatives. ''We know what needs to be taken out,'' he said. ''But it's not that easy to do it.''
 Hamza al-Mozainy, a professor of linguistics and a columnist who has campaigned for education reform, said the seeming clash between Islam and the West creates a tough environment for change. 
 ''What makes changing the curriculum so difficult is that the people are living in the middle of a conflict,'' he said. One of the easiest ways conservatives have of attacking him is to say he is serving America by demanding the change, he says.
 ''As we discuss change, they say, 'Look what America is doing to us, look what Israel is doing,' '' he said. 
 But even if the textbooks were changed, the effort might not amount to much unless the country's teachers were retrained, a far more difficult matter. 
 ''The problem was not the textbooks, it was the mentality of a minority,'' said Hassan al-Ahdal, director general of the Muslim World League, a Saudi-based Islamic organization. ''Some teachers or supervisors are projecting their own beliefs on the textbooks and are trying to convince their students, as if theirs is the real interpretation of the textbooks.''

HEADLINE: Beat the Clock 

 BODY:
Like many Americans, lawmakers in Congress plan to knock off early on Friday to get a jump on the holiday weekend. Then they'll take the rest of the week off, and while they're gone, federal disaster unemployment benefits will start to expire for some 80,000 people still out of work because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Both houses have only a few days left to extend this much-needed aid. 
 Most of the unemployed are Katrina victims who are still living outside Louisiana. The argument that their jobless benefits are a disincentive to work is absurd, as well as heartless. The average benefit is $104 a week -- and that is for people who lost everything and, in many cases, loved ones only nine months ago.
It's distressing that lawmakers even need to be prodded to provide additional relief. Since their last recess, their biggest ''achievement'' has been a two-year extension of investor tax cuts, worth nearly $51 billion, for America's wealthiest families. Congress hustled to lock in the tax cuts this month, even though they weren't scheduled to expire until the end of 2008. Yet those same lawmakers are now running out the clock on unemployment benefits for some of America's neediest families. The estimated cost for a 13-week extension is $125 million. 
 Two Louisiana Republicans, Richard Baker and Charles Boustany Jr., introduced a bill in the House last week calling for a straightforward extension through the summer. Financing for the additional benefits is already built into the overall disaster budget, so it requires no special appropriation. All that is needed is for lawmakers to pass the measure -- before their next paid vacation.

HEADLINE: This Glass Is Half Full, Probably More

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
HERE is a political Rorschach test for this midterm election year. What's your reaction to the following:
 These are the best of times in many ways. Americans are wealthier than previous generations, they are healthier and they enjoy a higher standard of living. The good old days simply weren't as good as the present day.
 If that makes you a little squeamish, the odds are good that you generally vote Democratic. You see a lot of real problems -- widening inequality, a big federal budget deficit, melting icecaps -- and you have a hard time believing that the country has never been richer. 
 But the fact that by most broad measures -- wages, average life span, crime, education levels, home ownership and racial and gender equality, to name a few -- life in this country has clearly improved over the last generation. 
 And most Americans think about their lives in these terms. In polls, even low-income people generally say they are better off than their parents were, probably because most are.
 Yet many Democratic politicians just don't seem comfortable talking about the ways that overall living standards have risen, focusing instead on the recent stagnation in wages for rank-and-file workers. ''We do talk negative about the economy,'' Rep. Rahm Emanuel, an Illinois Democrat, told me yesterday, adding that it comes in part with being the opposition party. There is a fear that any good news will somehow help President Bush, and there is also the admirable liberal tradition of agitating for the little guy, a tradition that helped end the Depression, crush Jim Crow and open up the economy to women.
 But the Democrats' approach has a downside. With Mr. Bush less popular than he has ever been, they have become even more downbeat about the economy at a time when more than half of Americans rate it as good, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll.
 In his 2004 convention speech, John Kerry argued that ''our great middle class is shrinking.'' A couple of weeks ago, the spokesman for one House candidate went one better, saying: ''This economy is terrible. Republicans are using lies, damn lies and statistics to say otherwise.'' 
 In a country founded on optimism, this is a tough sell. 
 ONE of the most influential political books of the last few years has been ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' by Thomas Frank. Published during the 2004 campaign, it neatly captured the Republicans' success in using social issues to attract blue-collar Kansans who don't really benefit from Republican economic policies. 
 ''All they have to show for their Republican loyalty,'' Mr. Frank writes, ''are lower wages, more dangerous jobs, dirtier air, a new overlord class that comports itself like King Farouk,'' and a culture in ''moral free fall.''
 The book was a New York Times best seller for 35 weeks.
 But close inspection uncovers a big problem with Mr. Frank's economic analysis. Wages haven't been falling in Kansas. Up and down the economic spectrum, they have been higher in the last few years than they were at any point in the 1980's or 90's, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from the Economic Policy Institute. The median Kansas worker made $13.43 an hour in 2004, 11 percent more than in 1979, which might help explain why many people don't vote on bread-and-butter issues anymore. 
 Now, an 11 percent raise over the course of a generation -- which is similar to the national increase -- is not especially impressive. It's certainly smaller than the increase workers received in the 25 years leading up to 1979, and for the last few years, wages have not risen at all. But they did rise during the 1990's boom, and pretending otherwise does not jibe with most people's experiences. 
 More to the point, some other improvements have accelerated recently. In just the last 15 years, the murder rate has been cut almost in half. Many big cities are far more vibrant places than they used to be. About 33 percent of young adults get a bachelor's degree these days, up from 25 percent in the early 1990's. The gap between men's and women's pay reached its lowest ever last year. The divorce rate has stopped rising. 
 Many luxuries of earlier generations -- owning a three-bedroom house, flying across the country, calling relatives who live overseas -- are staples of middle-class life. If all this doesn't add up to a rise in living standards, I'm not sure what the phrase means.
 Senator Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat, has become something of a rock star in the last two years, and I think a big reason is that he speaks eloquently about all the economic progress the country has made and all the problems it faces. When you listen to him, you have no doubt that too many people are still struggling, and you even start to wonder whether the next quarter-century will be as good as the last one. 
 But Mr. Obama doesn't confuse the new insecurity with a general decline in the quality of life, and he insists, in almost Reaganesque language, that doing nothing about disappearing pensions and blue-collar jobs is simply not an option. ''It's not how our story ends -- not in this country. America is a land of big dreamers and big hopes,'' he said at a college graduation last year. ''And it is because our dreamers dreamed that we have emerged from each challenge more united, more prosperous and more admired than before.''
 By taking the opposite tack, you can sell a lot of books or attract a lot of visitors to your blog. But you'll be elevating nostalgia over reality, and most Americans will know it.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plan to Lure Nurses May Hurt Poor Nations

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER; Carlos H. Conde contributed reporting from Manila for this article.

 BODY:
As the United States runs short of nurses, senators are looking abroad. A little-noticed provision in their immigration bill would throw open the gate to nurses and, some fear, drain them from the world's developing countries.
 The legislation is expected to pass this week, and the Senate provision, which removes the limit on the number of nurses who can immigrate, has been largely overlooked in the emotional debate over illegal immigration.
Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, who sponsored the proposal, said it was needed to help the United States cope with a growing nursing shortage. 
 He said he doubted the measure would greatly increase the small number of African nurses coming to the United States, but acknowledged that it could have an impact on the Philippines and India, which are already sending thousands of nurses to the United States a year. 
 The exodus of nurses from poor to rich countries has strained health systems in the developing world, which are already facing severe shortages of their own. Many African countries have begun to demand compensation for the training and loss of nurses and doctors who move away. 
 The Senate provision, which would remain in force until 2014, contains no such compensation, and has not stirred serious opposition in Congress. Because it is not part of the House immigration bill, a committee from both houses would have to decide whether to include the provision on nurses if the full Congress approves the legislation.
 Public health experts in poor countries, told about the proposal in recent days, reacted with dismay and outrage, coupled with doubts that their nurses would resist the magnetic pull of the United States, which sits at the pinnacle of the global labor market for nurses. 
 Removing the immigration cap, they said, would particularly hit the Philippines, which sends more nurses to the United States than any other country, at least several thousand a year. Health care has deteriorated there in recent years as tens of thousands of nurses have moved abroad. Thousands of ill-paid doctors have even abandoned their profession to become migrant-ready nurses themselves, Filipino researchers say. 
 ''The Filipino people will suffer because the U.S. will get all our trained nurses,'' said George Cordero, president of the Philippine Nurse Association. ''But what can we do?'' 
 The nurse proposal has strong backing from the American Hospital Association, which reported in April that American hospitals had 118,000 vacancies for registered nurses. The federal government predicted in 2002 that the accelerating shortfall of nurses in the United States would swell to more than 800,000 by 2020.
 ''There is no reason to cap the number of nurses coming in when there's a nationwide shortage, because you need people immediately,'' said Bruce Morrison, a lobbyist for the hospital association and a former Democratic congressman.
 The American Nurses Association, a professional trade association that represents 155,000 registered nurses, opposes the measure. The group said it was concerned the provision would lead to a flood of nurse immigrants and would damage both the domestic work force and the home countries of the immigrants.
 ''We're disappointed that Congress, instead of providing appropriations for domestic nursing programs, is outsourcing the education of nurses,'' said Erin McKeon, the group's associate director of government affairs.
 Holly Burkhalter, with Physicians for Human Rights, an advocacy group, said the nurse proposal could undermine the United States' multibillion-dollar effort to combat AIDS and malaria by potentially worsening the shortage of health workers in poor countries. ''We're pouring water in a bucket with a hole in it, and we drilled the hole,'' she said.
 There are now many more Americans seeking to be nurses than places to educate them. In 2005, American nursing schools rejected almost 150,000 applications from qualified people, according to the National League for Nursing, a nonprofit group that counts more than 1,100 nursing schools among its members. 
 One of the most important factors limiting the number of students was a lack of faculty to teach them, nursing organizations say. Professors of nursing earn less than practicing nurses, damping demand for teaching positions.
 Under the current immigration system, experts estimate that 12,000 to 14,000 nurses have immigrated to the United States annually on employment visas that entitle them to bring their immediate family members and obtain green cards. They must pass English and U.S. nursing exams to qualify for visas.
 In recent years, there had been enough visas for foreign nurses from most countries, but a bottleneck developed in 2005, after immigration authorities made a big push to clear a backlog of employment visa applications. That year, Congress set aside 50,000 additional visas for nurses and their families. But those visas will likely have all been used up by early next year, State Department officials said.
 It is difficult to forecast exactly how removing the limit on nurse immigration would affect the number of nurses who moved to the United States. 
 Based on past trends, Mr. Morrison, the lobbyist who represents the hospital association, said he thought the numbers would grow 5 to 10 percent a year over recent levels. Recruiters would focus on countries with large numbers of well-trained nurses, mainly the Philippines, India and China.
 ''But it's certainly true that the longer the United States puts off investing in training nurses, the more pressure there will be to find nurses abroad,'' he said.
 Senator Brownback, who has been an advocate for programs to combat AIDS and malaria in Africa, said he did not think lifting the cap on nurse migration would have much effect on Africa because the infrastructure of companies that did recruiting for the United States market was not set up there, nor did African nurses have a big community there to plug into.
 And while the Philippines could see an increase in nurse immigration, such flows could also bring benefits, he said, not just in the money they sent home, but in the nurses' voluntary efforts to improve health care in their home countries.
 But Eric Buch, the top health adviser to the New Partnership for Africa's Development, an Africa-wide undertaking initiated by the continent's heads of state, said he expected that recruiting agencies would set up in African countries where nurses were trained in English and that they would advertise the change in the American law. 
 ''You'll see that emerge, that's my guess,'' Professor Buch, who teaches health policy at the University of Pretoria, in South Africa, said in a telephone interview. ''The United States could become a place where we bleed our health care workers.'' 
 The flight of nurses from the Philippines, a former American colony, has provided a huge boost to a weak economy, through remittances. Some government agencies there have encouraged the export of nurses, who send home billions of dollars each year to their families. 
 A nurse in the Philippines would earn a starting salary of less than $2,000 a year compared with at least $36,000 a year in the United States, said Dr. Jaime Galvez Tan, a medical professor at the University of the Philippines who led the country's National Institutes of Health. 
 He said the flight of nurses had had a corrosive effect on health care. Most Filipinos died without medical attention in 2003, just as they had three decades earlier. And the percentage of women who gave birth with a doctor, nurse or midwife attending has declined in recent years.
 Based on surveys, Dr. Galvez Tan estimates that 80 percent of the country's government doctors have become nurses or are enrolled in nursing programs, hoping for an American green card. ''I plead for justice,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''There has to be give and take, not just take, take, take by the United States.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Wednesday about a proposal in the Senate to remove the limit on the number of nurses who can immigrate to the United States misstated the availability in recent years of medical care during childbirth in the Philippines, a major source of nurses for the United States. The percentage of women giving birth there with a doctor, nurse or midwife present has held steady; it has not declined.

HEADLINE: A Million Manhattan Projects

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
So we're toast, right?
 I mean, that's pretty much the pervasive global assumption these days: The 19th century belonged to England, the 20th century belonged to America, and the 21st century will belong to China. Tell your kids to study Mandarin.
I'm second to none in worrying about U.S. education and industry meeting the challenge of a rising China and India. But after a year traveling all over America talking to educators and innovators, I am not yet ready to cede the 21st century to China. No, not yet. 
 You see, my grandma back in Minnesota had a saying that went like this: ''Never cede a century to a country that censors Google.'' 
 It was just a little thing my grandma had -- she never believed that the future would belong to a country that limited its people's ability to discover knowledge. Censoring Google is a proxy for a lot of bad government heavy-handedness and censorship that hinders innovation.
 Now it's true that America's two major political parties are lost, and Washington is brain-dead. But precisely because we have this incredibly flexible, open, unrestricted, competitive economy -- where we don't censor anything -- what you find when visiting U.S. innovation hubs is that no one is waiting for Washington to declare the next big Manhattan Project, for, say, energy independence. American innovators are growing their own.
 Not a day goes by now that I don't get a letter from some start-up that wants me to write about how it is turning trash, corn, sugar, coal, manure, hydrogen, waves, wood chips, wind, sunlight or switch grass into power. I recently visited SRI International, near Stanford, where scientists are working on the critical problem of how to get more electric power out of batteries. Last week, I was in Pasadena to visit Idealab, whose founder, Bill Gross, couldn't wait to take me up to his roof to show off his Sunflower solar system, which tracks the sun with small mirrors and concentrates its rays onto a single silicon pod. It now helps to power his whole office.
 A few days later I interviewed the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Gary Morgenthaler, whose firm has invested in quantum-dot-based thin films for solar panels and has looked at one start-up that is bioengineering algae to produce oil. I ended the week at the Greentech Innovation Network in San Francisco, which brought together dozens of clean-power innovators to swap ideas. The meeting was organized by Kleiner Perkins, the venture firm that helped start Google and now backs an array of energy start-ups. 
 Bill Gross, of Idealab, said: ''The price of fossil fuel goes up enough, and look what happens. With no government regulation, investment and innovation in the energy space takes off with more talent and focus than any government program. It's a 'distributed' Manhattan Project that attracts the smartest, most ideal people for the task, and the capital is efficiently allocated to those teams.'' 
 But have no illusions, said K. R. Sridhar, whose company, IonAmerica, is developing solid oxide fuel cells: if we want to see these alternatives move from little start-ups to large-scale commercial ventures, ''we need to really get the price mechanism right.''
 When you're talking oil, you can't just say, ''Let the free market work,'' because there is no free market in oil: the producers have a cartel, and governments -- like ours -- subsidize oil, so we don't pay the full cost. 
 If the government would just do a couple of things, the energy start-ups we're seeing today would turn into real products, Mr. Sridhar said. One, the government should institute a carbon tax or gasoline tax that would ensure that the price of gasoline never fell below $3.50 to $4 a gallon, which would make a host of new technologies competitive. Second, the government should set high goals for mileage and CO2 emissions for its own vehicle fleet, as well as high goals for eco-friendly, low-energy electricity generation for every government building -- and then promise to be the first customer for whatever company reaches those high goals.
 ''The federal government is the single largest consumer of energy in the country,'' Mr. Sridhar said. ''It's time for the government to lead by example and flex a little consumer muscle. It's time for government to use its buying power when buying power.''
 The major industrial country that gets the greenest the fastest, with the smartest technologies -- that's the country that will lead the 21st century. We've got the innovators; we've got the venture capitalists. If only we had the government that would create the right market conditions and then get out of the way.

HEADLINE: West Bank Pullout Gets a Nod From Bush

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
President Bush offered conditional support on Tuesday for Israeli ideas for a substantial withdrawal of settlers from the West Bank, but insisted that the new prime minister, Ehud Olmert, first exhaust all possibilities for a negotiated solution.
 With concern rising over Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Bush reconfirmed the United States commitment to defend Israel against attack, and said that he, too, wanted to exhaust all diplomatic options before discussing any military attack.
''Our primary objective is to solve this problem diplomatically,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Olmert spoke at a joint news conference at the White House after a meeting here, their first since Mr. Olmert became prime minister. The two men said they also planned to meet later in the White House residence, without their advisers. 
 Mr. Bush praised Mr. Olmert's ''bold ideas'' for another unilateral Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory. But he said a negotiated agreement ''best serves Israelis and Palestinians and the cause of peace.''
 Mr. Olmert said that ''we will make a genuine effort to negotiate with the Palestinian side,'' and that ''we accept the sincerity of Mahmoud Abbas,'' the Palestinian president, whom he plans to meet soon. 
 But with the Palestinian Authority led by Hamas, which is considered a terrorist group, Mr. Olmert said, ''We hope he will have the power to be able to meet the requirements necessary for negotiations between us and the Palestinians.''
 Mr. Bush said, ''What worries me is that Hamas says it wants to destroy Israel.'' 
 ''I assured the prime minister that our position is steady and strong -- that Hamas must change,'' he said. ''No country can be expected to make peace with those who deny its right to exist, and who use terror to attack its population.''
 But if negotiations are not possible or successful, Mr. Olmert said, Israel will move ahead on its own. ''We will not wait indefinitely,'' he said. 
 Mr. Olmert ran for election on a promise to try to set the permanent borders of Israel by finishing the separation barrier between Israel and the Palestinians and by pulling out Israeli settlers -- as many as 70,000 -- who live in the West Bank beyond the barrier. 
 Another 175,000 Israelis, plus another 200,000 in East Jerusalem, live beyond the 1967 boundaries. But Mr. Olmert says Israel intends to keep those large settlement blocs.
 The United States has said a final agreement should recognize new realities on the ground. But Mr. Bush has also emphasized that final borders cannot be imposed but must be negotiated, and that neither side should do anything to prejudice those negotiations.
 ''While any final status agreement will be only achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes,'' Mr. Bush said, ''the prime minister's ideas could be an important step toward the peace we both support.''
 Officials of both countries emphasized that they did not have high expectations that Mr. Abbas would be able to generate the conditions for a resumption of talks on the peace plan called the road map. 
 The Palestinians have agreed to abandon terrorism and dismantle militant groups that operate outside the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, and defends the right of Palestinian groups like Islamic Jihad to fight the Israeli occupation. Hamas leaders recently praised an Islamic Jihad suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, while Mr. Abbas called it despicable.
 ''When we say, 'Abandon terror,' we mean that it's not enough to renounce terror, that's just words, but there have to be actions on the ground to show that they've given up terrorism as a legitimate tool,'' a senior American official said.
 But Mr. Olmert and the Israelis have barely begun planning a pullout, which he has now chosen to call realignment. Israeli officials say they will need six months to a year to prepare their plans, which they will do in discussions with the Americans, talks that will provide a window to test the possibility of negotiations with Mr. Abbas.
 ''It's our view that this window is one reason the Israelis can say honestly that there is time to evolve on the Palestinian side, since they're not ready to move,'' the senior American official said. ''It's a lucky circumstance.''
 The official supported the Israeli contention that the Palestinians were not yet ready for the negotiations that Mr. Bush called for. 
 ''The question is whether there's an evolution, either of Hamas or the power relationships with the Palestinian Authority, such that such a negotiation would be advisable,'' the American official said. ''Olmert made it clear that it's not advisable today, and the president said clearly that Israel is not able to negotiate with Hamas.''
 Mr. Olmert's visit to the White House was his first as prime minister, and his aides were pleased with the warmth of the reception. 
 He and Mr. Bush were scheduled to spend about 45 minutes in private discussions on Tuesday night -- a chance to bond, but also to have a serious discussion about Iran and about how both countries might respond if diplomacy there fails.
 Mr. Bush recognizes that a visit from the Israeli prime minister provides a chance to remind his Republican supporters and American Jews, many of whom vote Democratic, about his staunch support of Israel during a crucial election year.
 Negotiations took place over the last week or so on how Mr. Bush would characterize Mr. Olmert's proposal for withdrawal, with the Americans eager not to be seen to support what the Palestinians would call an Israeli land grab of occupied territory.
 Having first suggested that Mr. Olmert's ideas were ''interesting,'' the negotiators moved to ''constructive'' and finally to ''bold,'' which pleased the Israelis. 
 The Americans have many questions, however: how many settlers will go; where the barrier will run; what will happen to the Israeli development plans for an area called E1, which would cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank; how the Israeli Army would be deployed in the areas Israel abandons, or whether it would be withdrawn entirely.
 Still, there was some disappointment among Israeli officials that Mr. Olmert's plan, which to them is more risky and ambitious than Ariel Sharon's pullout of 9,000 settlers and troops from Gaza, was greeted cautiously in Washington.
 There was little new on Iran. Both men agreed that Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear power. ''We determined that the Iranian regime must not obtain nuclear weapons,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Israel says it believes that Iran is only months away from developing the know-how to enrich uranium. Mr. Olmert said: ''This is a moment of truth. It is still not too late to prevent it from happening.''
 Mr. Bush concentrated on his diplomatic efforts to get Russia and China to agree to possible sanctions against Iran in the United Nations Security Council. ''We're spending a lot of time working with our Russian friends in particular, to make it clear to them that Iran is showing no good faith'' in negotiations, Mr. Bush said.
 He faced a new complication on Tuesday, when the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling for withholding support from Hamas until it acknowledges Israel's right to exist and expels any members with ties to terrorism.
 The House was calling for the United States to withhold funds for United Nations agencies that assist the Palestinian Authority at a time when even the Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, has voiced concern that its economic isolation -- intended to weaken it -- is having a rallying effect in the territories.
 The White House opposes the resolution as too constraining. The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said the administration expected it to take a different form after consultation with the Senate.

HEADLINE: Political Overtones Cited in Detention of District Governor

BYLINE: COMPILED BY RACHEL THORNER

 BODY:

A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.

TODAY'S TOP STORIES
The authorities detained the governor of the Nenets Autonomous District in the Russian Far North, Aleksei Barinov, making him the first governor in the Russian Federation's history to be deprived of political amnesty, according to several newspapers that featured the case prominently. Mr. Barinov is under investigation for what officials said was fraud and the misappropriation of land. Most newspapers were more skeptical, saying Mr. Barinov's detention had more to do with his politics than the law.
 Kommersant said that the governor's refusal to acquiesce to Moscow's demands to dismiss the region's representative in the upper house of parliament, Aleksandr Sabadash, might have caused authorities to move against him. The newspaper said that the timing of his refusal and subsequent arrest was "hardly accidental." Mr. Sabadash tendered his resignation on Tuesday anyway, saying that he "did not want innocent people to suffer," Kommersant reported. Trud, normally a pro-Kremlin paper, echoed criticism that authorities could be punishing Mr. Barinov for refusing to comply with the demands to remove Mr. Sabadash. 
 Another explanation, the papers reported, was that the Kremlin might have been retaliating against Mr. Barinov for his criticism of domestic energy policies, which he said recently were draining the resource-rich region of its gas and oil revenues. The governor, on the eve of his detention, accused the prosecutor general of acting in accordance with "commercial structures that have oil interests," according to Gazeta. The governor has also filed suit against energy companies, including the state oil giant Rosneft, which has very close ties to the Kremlin. The region's deputy governor, Vladislav Peskov, told Kommersant that Mr. Barinov was really being persecuted for trying to ensure that "gas dollars stay in his region" and out of the Kremlin's hands. He said that the case against Mr. Barinov was intended to be a message to defiant politicians across the country, in an effort to silence them. The vice governor of Volgograd, Aleksandr Shilin, however, expressed faith in the country's judicial system. "A thief should sit in jail," he told Kommersant.

OTHER NEWS

KOMMERSANT
LUKASHENKO STATE OF NATION ADDRESS: President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus gave his state of the nation address on Tuesday. He discussed the possible economic hardships caused by the spike in prices of oil and gas, which Russia's energy monopoly, Gazprom, has decided to increase more than fourfold. He then said that the country would work to create closer ties with China.

NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA
RICE SOFTENS CHENEY'S CRITICISM: In an interview with the Boston College newspaper, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice softened Vice President Dick Cheney's recent criticism of Russia, underscoring positive developments in the countries' relations. The newspaper said that "the situation surrounding Iran could have helped to moderate America's position."

RUSSIAN ARTISTS STUCK ON LENIN: The Art Moscow exhibit of contemporary art, which featured work from New York, London, Paris and Russia, underscored the enduring influence of Lenin. Lenin "continues to direct art, even as a vehicle for insult" among Russian artists, a review in the newspaper said. Nearly all of the work by Russian artists responded to aspects of Soviet life, ideology or politics, underscoring how deeply the Soviet legacy affects Russian culture today.

GAZETA
AEROFLOT TO FLOAT SHARES: Aeroflot, Russia's major airline, announced that it wants to float $500 million worth of its shares and recommended that its board of directors revise the company's rules accordingly.

TRUD
PUTIN'S WIFE PRAISED: President Vladimir V. Putin's wife, Ludmila, led a round table discussion on how to preserve the mental and physical health of schoolchildren. In an unexpected tangent, the newspaper noted that Ludmila, "having lost weight and wearing an elegant hairstyle," looked especially nice for the event.

MOSKOVSKY KOMSOMOLETS
ADOPTION REGULATIONS TIGHTENED: Authorities have tightened regulations for foreigners hoping to adopt Russian children; new requirements include a work permit issued by the prospective parents' country, and proof of five years of experience in one's profession.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Swears Off Improvising

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, is likely to be a lot less interesting at dinner parties from now on.
 On Tuesday, not quite four months after taking over at the Fed, Mr. Bernanke publicly admitted to a ''lapse of judgment'' in earlier telling a television reporter at a banquet here that investors had ''misunderstood'' him.
 Mr. Bernanke's remarks to Maria Bartiromo of the financial news channel CNBC, made at the White House Correspondents Dinner on Saturday, April 29, touched off a brief furor among stock market traders when Ms. Bartiromo reported the conversation as an important disclosure the following Monday. 
 Most analysts quickly concluded that Mr. Bernanke had said little, if anything, that was new and had simply repeated his determination to keep the Fed's options open.
 But Ms. Bartiromo, who reported that Mr. Bernanke ''had surprising comments'' about the way that media and markets had interpreted his testimony to Congress a few days earlier, helped set off a round of second-guessing in the financial markets. 
 ''Ben Bernanke told me over the weekend the media and the markets got it wrong last week in speculating the Fed is done raising interest rates,'' Ms. Bartiromo reported at the time. 
 Until Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke had refused to either confirm or deny that the conversation even took place. But asked about it at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, the Fed chairman acknowledged that he had learned the hard way that there is no such thing as idle chitchat.
 ''Senator, that episode you refer to was a lapse of judgment on my part,'' Mr. Bernanke told Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky. ''In the future, my communications with the public and the markets will be entirely through regular and formal channels." 
 Mr. Bernanke might take lessons from his cryptic predecessor, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan was a fixture at Washington dinner parties, but he was so quiet that he often seemed boring.
 In the annals of public gaffes by top economic policy officials, analysts say, Mr. Bernanke's slip was a small one. Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, committed a bigger faux pas last June when he said in a television interview that the Fed had already reached the ''eighth inning'' of raising interest rates.
 His comment provoked a trading frenzy similar to that set off by Mr. Bernanke's reported conversation. But Mr. Fisher's comment was at odds with most other signals from Fed policy makers, and it turned out to be wildly wrong: the Fed has raised rates eight times since he spoke and is widely expected to raise them a ninth time at its meeting on June 28 and 29.
 Mr. Fisher has complained that CNBC dropped the last part of his comment, which was that the ''game'' might well go into extra innings. He has been more cautious in his public comments ever since.
 Paul H. O'Neill, who was secretary of the Treasury in 2001 and 2002, on several occasions rocked the currency markets with off-the-cuff remarks. During his first month in office, he set off a drop in the dollar after telling a German newspaper that ''we are not pursuing, as is often said, a policy of a strong dollar.''
 Mr. O'Neill backpedaled furiously after the dollar started to plunge, insisting that he had not meant to signal any change in United States policy. ''I guess I made a mistake by assuming that it was O.K. to talk beyond a simplistic level,'' he said ruefully. 
 Mr. Bernanke, in contrast to Mr. O'Neill, did not hint at a new turn in policy. As Ms. Bartiromo reported, the Fed chairman insisted that decisions would be based on new economic data -- a stance he has repeatedly emphasized and that has been accurately reported in most newspapers.
 ''It's really an innocuous mistake,'' said Tom Schlesinger, executive director of the Financial Markets Center, a policy research group in Howardsville, Va. ''If that's the worst mistake he ever makes, he'll be remembered as very successful.''

HEADLINE: Life in the Fast-Food Lane

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni

 BODY:
FOR a moment I doubted my eyes. Was I wishing it into existence? Dreaming it?
 Then, drawing closer, I grew certain that the stripes on the horizon -- the ones rising above a fast-food tree line of McDonald's and Taco Bell logos -- were indeed orange and white. That they did form a telltale consonant near the end of the alphabet.
That after 4 days, 10 states and 20 drive-through meals, I had the shimmering W of a Whataburger in my sights.
 ''There!'' I pointed. ''Look!'' 
 ''I don't see ,'' groused my companion, groggy from the fried chicken at Popeyes, the fried fish at Captain D's Seafood and the other fried things at the other fry-happy establishments we had visited that day.
 Her protest trailed off, because then she saw. How, she asked, had I spotted the sign from so far away?
 Got me. But by that night in Shreveport, La., I had developed a crazy knack for detecting beef patties and sesame seed buns where they weren't readily apparent. I had become a human divining rod for fast-food restaurants, especially untried ones.
 And Whataburger, absent over the long stretches of highway east of the Mississippi, was up ahead.
 ''Dinner,'' I said, and I pressed the accelerator.
 A few weeks ago I embarked on a gluttonous odyssey, with a changing cast of co-conspirators, across this fast-food nation, from New York to California, sea to greasy sea. It was a roving binge as warped road movie: ''Transfatamerica.'' Or maybe, given our cholesterol-oblivious plunge over a nutritional cliff: ''Thelma and Disease.''
 But my goal wasn't to supersize myself. It was to size up and single out the best fast food from familiar national chains, relatively unfamiliar regional chains and tiny local chains I had never encountered. To take the culinary road less traveled, at least by me.
 I'm a pampered diner, my diet richer in squab and poorer in chili dogs than most Americans'. As a restaurant critic, I usually eat three-hour meals at beautifully set tables. On this journey, I ate three-minute meals in the driver's or passenger's seat, the dashboard doubling as a buffet, an automotive altar across which Quarter Pounders and bean and cheese burritos, as worthy of assessment as veal sweetbreads and duck liver pate, were arrayed.
 Until I hit an In-N-Out Burger in Torrance, Calif., on the eighth day of my trek, all of my fast food was consumed, as fast food often is, in the car, which smelled worse and worse as the trip went on and on. Like an obtuse houseguest or a Supreme Court justice, the scent of a White Castle slider lingers.
 My sample period ultimately spanned 9 days, 15 states, 3,650 miles and 42 visits to 35 different restaurants (I hit some more than once). It bequeathed crucial knowledge and invaluable lessons.
 I learned that Pennsylvania abounds in speed traps, West Virginia in roadkill and Texas in tacos, which can be found at Taco Cabana and Taco Bueno, Taco Villa and Taco Casa. A homogenous country? Not ours. The Mrs. Winner's chicken franchises of Georgia gave way to the Carl's Jr. franchises of Arizona, the scenery and sources of carbohydrates constantly changing.
 I learned about Culver's, a chain based in Wisconsin that serves floppy burgers on generously buttered buns, and Sawyer's, which makes ''Buffalo fingers,'' slathered with tangy tomato sauce and accompanied by blue cheese dip, at just two locations in Knoxville, Tenn. 
 I learned about the transcendent utility of Wet Naps -- for hands, mouth and steering wheel. I learned that the art of lap dining is best served by dark-colored clothing, and would be even better served by a hazmat suit, because the ketchup, mustard and barbecue sauces on the insides and outsides of sandwiches have a way of going astray.
 What occurred with packets of red paste from a Birmingham, Ala., Chick-fil-A qualified as the Exxon Valdez of condiment spills, and my rented Ford Taurus, like Prince William Sound, was slow to recover.
 This adventure required adjustments. 
 ''What do you recommend?'' I sometimes asked, out of habit, as I pulled up to yet another drive-through window, eager to sample the best of what a chain had to offer.
 The question usually yielded a one-syllable response: ''Huh?'' So I learned to ask instead about which sandwiches and sides were most popular.
 I made new friends, like Elizabeth Stephens, 69, whose paneled Buick station wagon was parked near my Taurus outside the Varsity in downtown Atlanta.
 The Varsity dates from 1928 and has six locations in Georgia, the downtown Atlanta one being the best known. Along with the Culver's I visited in Rockwall, Tex., it was my favorite stop, but it might not have been if Ms. Stephens hadn't recognized my friend Alessandra and me as neophytes and decided to intervene.
 She told us to get the chili slaw dog, an inspired creation that layers coleslaw atop the chili atop a meaty, smoky hot dog, producing a riot of textures and hot-cool sensations that I'm determined to experience at least once again in this life.
 She wisely pushed the onion rings, real slices of slippery onion under crunchy, oily shells. And she insisted on an appendix to our order when she realized that we were about to skip dessert.
 ''You didn't get the peach pie?'' she said.
 ''No,'' I answered. ''Should we?''
 ''Honey,'' she said, ''you're in Georgia. You have to get the peach pie.''
 We got the peach pie. It was similar in shape and construction to a McDonald's apple pie, and I could have done without it.
 I visited McDonald's three times, in three states, because I didn't want to shortchange the giants. But the fast-food universe is infinite, so I had to set some limits.
 No pizza. No submarines. No Long John Silver's, at least not after Captain D's, where the butterfly shrimp should be called gypsy moth shrimp and a mash of putative crab put me off seafood for a while.
 No Chipotle or Fuddruckers or restaurants without a drive-through window or at least the spirit of one, except for a Baja Fresh in Ontario, Calif., the inadmissibility of which I realized only after paying nearly $20 and waiting 15 minutes for lunch for two. The cheese and pork quesadilla was terrific, and would easily have made my list of 10 favorites, but it wasn't fast food.
 I made comparisons. The fries at Hardee's were better -- crisper, more substantial in feel and taste -- than the fries at McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King and Jack in the Box.
 But the tots at Sonic, a chain prevalent in the South, were the sultans of spuds. Since all of these potato variants are about exterior crackle, not interior vegetable, the tot configuration, with more crests and buttes and ridges, won the day.
 The runner-up, for much the same reason: McDonald's hash browns, sculptured by unseen Michelangelos of fast food into what is essentially one mammoth, oblong, scrumptious tot.
 It wasn't until Tucson, and the eighth day, that I had this glistening potato cake (a two-Wet-Nap item) along with a slightly soggy Egg McMuffin, which I enjoyed less than a ''ciabatta breakfast sandwich'' from a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth. 
 The major chains love to throw around foreign-sounding terms, like ciabatta and frescata, which is the name of a selection of tasteless deli-style sandwiches at Wendy's, where the best bet remains the economical, healthy chili.
 Or they just bluntly declare an item to be ethnic, ipso fatso. McDonald's puts slices of white meat, snow peas and mandarin orange sections on iceberg lettuce and calls it an Asian chicken salad, a few bites of which rightly prompted Alessandra, blond and blue-eyed, to say, ''It's about as Asian as I am.''
 I noted, for the sake of argument, that it had what tasted vaguely like Russian dressing and that the eastern expanse of Russia fell in the designated continent.
 ''O.K.,'' she said, ''it's a Eurasian chicken salad.''
 She got the middle stretch of the trip, a southern swing heavy on fried chicken and jalapeno poppers. My friend Kerry got the first stretch, which meant the lackluster roast beef sandwiches at a midsize Midwestern chain called Rax and, at Gold Star Chili, the single worst item of the journey.
 It was a gummy nest of thin noodles, which were covered by a watery chili, which was in turn covered by rubbery orange confetti that bore a passing resemblance to cheese. Several hours after this starchy insult, as we barreled south toward Knoxville, Kerry moaned, ''Ewwww.''
 It came out of nowhere. I shot him a puzzled look.
 ''Flashback,'' he explained. ''Gold Star.''
 My friend Barbara got the final stretch of the trip, a southwestern route of burritos and more burritos: with and without rice, with and without sour cream, planned burritos and serendipitous burritos.
 We pulled off the highway near Odessa, Tex., to hunt down a Taco Villa and, across the street, espied something called JumBurrito, an even smaller Texas chain. Taco Villa's grilled chicken burrito had a profusion of chicken that indeed tasted grilled, while JumBurrito's combination burrito redeemed dull beef with vibrant avocado.
 Neither approximated the majesty of the burrito I loved most, which I ate in Dallas, at a Taco Cabana. A great burrito is a balancing act, and the proportions of ground beef, beans, sour cream and diced tomatoes in Taco Cabana's plump, heavy Burrito Ultimo (three Wet Naps) were spot on.
 The Taco Villa and the JumBurrito I visited shared a stretch of road with Bush's Chicken, a purveyor of chicken fingers (as puffy with batter as a chinchilla is with fur) in the Odessa-Midland area. Throughout the country, I spotted and sampled more of these geographically contained fast-food players than I had expected to.
 Near Allentown, Pa., there was Yocco's, which proclaims itself the ''hot dog king,'' probably because no one who has had the misfortune of eating there would. In central Louisiana there was Raising Cane's, which dutifully and competently serves the chicken finger needs of residents of that state and of nearby ones. 
 And, in El Paso, where Barbara and I stopped after Odessa, there was Chico's Tacos. We visited the Chico's closest to the highway, just across the street from a ''do-it-yourself pest control'' store called Bug-a-Boo. Barbara hogged the stewed beef burrito. I retaliated by hogging the beef flautas, oddly shaped islands in a spicy soup of tomatoes and chili peppers. I was surprised by how much I liked them.
 I was often surprised, beginning with the first day, when I excitedly bit into that slider and realized how treacherous fast-food memories are. If I had ever enjoyed sliders -- and I recalled that I had -- it must have been when I was drunk. Or hung over.
 Three hours and about 125 miles later, I hesitantly bit into a piece of Original Recipe chicken at a KFC. I didn't hesitate before subsequent bites. The battered skin wasn't too peppery, the frequent sin of much fried chicken to come. The flesh was positively juicy. And the Colonel, in my book, deserved a promotion to commander in chief.
 I expected Chick-fil-A to be good. It didn't disappoint. Its standard chicken sandwich, a lightly coated breast fillet with little adornment, was meaty and tender, and the bun cradling it couldn't have been fluffier. We need more Chick-fil-A in New York City. (There's just one branch, at New York University.) We need it fast.
 We need Dairy Queen even faster. Among all the incarnations of candy-studded soft ice cream I tried, including the McFlurry, the Frosty and the Sonic Blast, the Blizzard reigned supreme. It had the most candy most thoroughly integrated into the most sumptuous frozen cradle.
 This was true of the Georgia Mud Fudge Blizzard. Of the Brownie Batter Blizzard. Check back with me in a year or two about the other Blizzards -- I hope to work my way through all of them. If my obituary reads, ''perished in a Blizzard,'' you will know that I died a happy man.
 I ate more burgers than anything else, and came to several conclusions.
 Flame, or at least a suggestion of grilling or broiling, matters. That's a principal reason a Whopper bested a Big Mac, cooked on a griddle. It's why the new roster of one-third-pound charbroiled Thickburgers at Hardee's tasted better than the steamed slivers at Krystal, a White Castle analogue in the South.
 Buns matter. The large, doughy one on the classic Whataburger created ample space for three slices of tomato and a sense of heft that felt good in the hands, good in the mouth. The generously buttered, crisply toasted ones on Culver's burgers, called butterburgers in honor of those buns, exalted whatever they encased, which included seared, loosely packed patties with more charred edges and, as a result, more flavor.
 Produce matters, and the ratio of produce to patty size matters, which brings us to In-N-Out. This California chain inspires worship, and I understand why. The burgers tasted fresher than most -- though, like seemingly all fast-food burgers, they were cooked to a temperature well above medium -- and the vegetables atop them tasted even fresher. The juicy tomato and cooked onions on an ''animal-style'' cheeseburger were revelations.
 But they obscured the thin patty they were meant to accessorize. A double cheeseburger remedied this shortcoming somewhat, but not entirely. In its case, too, the produce -- whole-leaf lettuce as well as tomato -- registered as strongly as the beef. I liked In-N-Out but I had my issues with it.
 Or maybe I was just too stuffed by that point. On my way there, driving alone through Santa Monica, Calif., I had suddenly found myself swerving to the right, parking yet again, ordering anew. The divining rod was at work, and it pointed me to Tommy's, another California chain.
 Tommy's pours a pasty, forgettable chili over just about everything. Nestled behind the steering wheel, I nibbled on a chili-strangled hot dog and a chili-mugged double cheeseburger and then collected the latest round of voluminous, odiferous trash. What were these mushy, orange squiggles? Gold Star, the indigestion that keeps on giving.
 I was almost done. I was mostly content. On the right road, with the right company, there may well be as much satisfaction at the low end of dining as there is at the high end. There's certainly as much bounty.
 On the next and last day of my adventure, I whizzed past a Fatburger on the way to a Wienerschnitzel. In pursuit of El Pollo Loco, I disregarded Del Taco. I'd have to save those restaurants for another time. An emptier stomach. A cleaner car.

HEADLINE: An Architect With Plans for a New Gulf Coast 

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
He's the man architecture critics love to hate: Andres Duany, charismatic prophet of the New Urbanism, with his nostalgic prescriptions for dense, walkable neighborhoods energized by stores, mass transit and traditional housing. 
 Opponents cast this architect as an imperious enemy of progressive design and a threat to the Gulf Coast, where he has been involved in plans to redesign communities that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
Reed Kroloff, dean of the architecture school at Tulane University in New Orleans, for example, has referred to Mr. Duany and other New Urbanists as ''Svengalis'' who ''have now seduced Louisiana's hapless governor and been given the keys to the state.'' 
 Mr. Duany, 56, said that a year or two ago he would have paid those critics little heed. Typically he lacks the time or the inclination to counter his detractors, he said during an interview in the office he shares here with his wife and partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, 55. 
 But these days, with the future of New Orleans; Biloxi, Miss.; and other cities hanging in the balance, Mr. Duany (pronounced DWAH-nee) said he was speaking out more aggressively. 
 ''The response is not about convincing him -- I'll never convince him,'' he said of Mr. Kroloff. ''It's more like defending your side, or heartening your allies.'' 
 Recently, the New Urbanist planners involved in rebuilding Biloxi, Elizabeth Moule and Stefanos Polyzoides, resigned from the project after clashing with federal officials and with Mayor A. J. Holloway of Biloxi over control of the reconstruction. 
 To Mr. Duany these issues are crucial because the Gulf Coast offers the rare opportunity to start over from scratch, potentially with quick results. ''For a city to become a city that's planned, it has to destroy itself; the city literally has to molt,'' he said. ''Usually this takes 20 years, but after a hurricane, it takes five years. The people can see the future in their own lifetime.''
 ''If architecture mattered to the world, '' Mr. Duany added, ''this would be the most important thing in the world.''
 Last fall, at the invitation of Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, Mr. Duany and the group he founded, the Congress for a New Urbanism, led a conference of 200 architects and planners in Biloxi in drafting architectural proposals for the coastal communities. He recently held a similar brainstorming session in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. 
 Critics of New Urbanism argue that Mr. Duany and his allies seek to create a picture-postcard image of the past and will squander the opportunity to start anew. They note that Mr. Duany's most famous project, the town of Seaside, Fla., was used as the location for ''The Truman Show,'' the 1998 Jim Carrey film that in part parodied idealized small-town America.
 Mr. Duany did not originally set out on a traditionalist path. A son and grandson of developers, he was born in New York City, then grew up in a suburb -- of Santiago de Cuba, the island's second largest city, after Havana -- and moved with his family to Barcelona, Spain, when he was 13. 
 His father was a conventionally modern developer in Cuba, he said, building single-family houses on large lots at a great distance from one another and far from commercial activity. It seemed at first that Mr. Duany would follow a similar path. After studying architecture at Yale in the 1970's, he and his wife helped to found Arquitectonica, a Miami firm that became known for its modern and hip sensibility. 
 Mr. Duany insists that New Urbanists are not averse to contemporary architecture. ''They think that I don't know modernism or I can't design it,'' Mr. Duany said of his critics. ''It's not true.''
 It was while living in Coral Gables, Fla., that he and Ms. Plater-Zyberk realized that the suburbs needed to be thoroughly rethought. ''We would walk out and be bored to death,'' he said. ''It was just this terrible lack.'' 
 ''We needed to have meaningful destinations within walking distance,'' he continued. ''You can't just walk past beautiful lawns, you want to walk past action.''
 Disenchanted with the high-rise business, he and Ms. Plater-Zyberk left Arquitectonica in 1980. By then they had decided that the best way to affect a landscape was not through designing discrete buildings, he said, but by writing new building codes governing zoning, parking, retailing, transportation and urban design. 
 In departing, they took along the firm's Seaside project, a traditionalist community in the Florida Panhandle, completed in 1981, that proved immensely popular. Lecturing across the country about Seaside, Mr. Duany soon met dozens of likeminded planners. 
 Groups began gathering to learn from one another, and ''then, it grew,'' he said. Ultimately those encounters led to the creation of the Congress for a New Urbanism in 1993, with a charter espousing principles like ''the reconfiguration of sprawling suburbs into communities of real neighborhoods'' and diverse, mixed-use districts. 
 The congress used to maintain a list of New Urbanist communities but stopped counting two years ago when the number reached about 600. ''There's not enough of us,'' Mr. Duany said. ''We're dying of overwork.'' Duany Plater-Zyberk & Company, founded in 1980, has alone completed designs for more than 250 new and existing communities, including neighborhoods in Providence, R.I.; Baton Rouge, La.; and West Palm Beach. 
 And Ms. Plater-Zyberk, who is also dean of the University of Miami School of Architecture, now leads Miami 21, a project to overhaul city zoning intended to discourage exposed parking garages, assure wider sidewalks and create homes where people can live above their businesses.
 By speaking the language of developers so effectively, Mr. Kroloff asserts, New Urbanism has come to monopolize urban planning. The congress, he said, is ''the only truly organized voice in planning in the United States and has become the most important force in architecture, with the exception of Frank Gehry, in the last 30 years.''
 ''The development community loves New Urbanism,'' Mr. Kroloff added. ''It speaks to the sentimentality that seems to underlie Americans' home-buying habits. And creating higher density per acre allows developers to make more money. There is no organized contradictory voice in planning.''
 Mr. Duany counters that critics like Mr. Kroloff are often acting on misinformation. ''We're not just about picket fences and porches, and it's frustrating to have that repeated,'' he said. ''Yes, we want you to walk, but we're not eliminating cars. We're not forcing transit; we're simply fitting communities so that, if they ever want transit, it will work.'' 
 ''Yes, we love Main Streets, but we don't expect that the shop owners are going to be mom-and-pop stores,'' he continued. 
 As for contemporary architects, Mr. Duany said they were welcome in New Urbanist communities, but only for public buildings like a town hall or library. ''The star architect is confined to the civic building,'' he said. ''The civic buildings are free of any constraint.'' 
 Clearly, New Urbanism is out of sync with the phenomenon of the star architect, Mr. Duany added pointedly. ''We're a group,'' he said, ''and these days, anybody who's an architect who isn't an 'individual' is very suspicious: 'What do you mean, you all have a system of beliefs? You believe in something other than artistic expression?' ''
 Ms. Plater-Zyberk echoed his sentiments. In New Orleans, she said, ''The avant-garde, the individual great building, is not the answer for what were the postwar ranch house suburbs.''
 Peter A. Calthorpe, a planner based in Berkeley, Calif., who is working on a regional plan in Louisiana, said that the debate over New Urbanism was a depressing distraction from the urgent issue of rebuilding towns ravaged by Katrina. ''It is tragic to reduce issues facing New Orleans to issues of architectural style,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kroloff himself stepped down from a rebuilding role in Mayor Ray Nagin's Bring Back New Orleans Commission this year, saying he felt that he had become too much a focus of attention.
 New Orleans policymakers were initially wary of the New Urbanists until they saw the local planning work that Mr. Duany did this year for the nearby St. Bernard Parish and invited him to do the same for Gentilly. ''He showed the possibilities for how the area could come back,'' said Cynthia Hedge Morell, a city councilwoman.
 Mr. Duany, who with his handsome looks and polished, articulate style, can easily hold a crowd, said, ''What happens is, we connect to the people.'' It is clear that he does not suffer fools gladly: during the interview he snapped repeatedly over the phone at a colleague with whom he was preparing an op-ed article.
 Mr. Kroloff said that Mr. Duany's popularity with the public was unsurprising. ''A disaffected generation of traditionalists suddenly found themselves with a champion and flocked to him with a passion,'' he said.
 Mr. Duany said that those who deride the New Urbanists are threatened by their influence. 
 ''Nobody gave a damn about us until we got powerful,'' he said. ''The world watches.''

HEADLINE: One Auteur's Bumpy Festival Trajectory 

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

DATELINE: CANNES, France, May 23 

 BODY:
Consider the strange case of Bruno Dumont. In 1997 Cannes showed that French filmmaker's feature debut, ''Life of Jesus,'' outside the main selection in the parallel program, Directors' Fortnight. The film, which follows a group of unemployed young people in a desolate town in Normandy, received a special mention and subsequently hit the festival rounds. Like critics, festival programmers tend to have a proprietary relationship with directors they feel they have had a hand in discovering, so when Mr. Dumont was invited back to Cannes two years later with his second film, ''Humanity,'' it was no surprise that this time he was welcomed into the main competition. 
 During its first press screening ''Humanity'' suffered a fair share of critical derision, telegraphed with choruses of giggles, but nonetheless picked up three major awards. Cannes understandably passed on Mr. Dumont's follow-up film, ''Twentynine Palms,'' a violent folly about two Europeans tooling around the California desert in a symbolically overloaded Hummer. Now Mr. Dumont is back in competition at Cannes with ''Flandres,'' about a young French farmer named Demester who goes off to fight in some unnamed war in an unspecified Arab country. Once again, the filmmaker's favorite themes and tropes are mostly present, notably the narcoleptic pacing, human faces as cragged as landscapes, ritualistic rutting and, regrettably, allusions to Robert Bresson, one of the art's holy men.
His Bressonian aspirations are evident in the film's uninflected performance style (by nonprofessionals), the unadorned yet carefully framed compositions and a lack of melodramatic incident. Unlike Mr. Bresson, however, Mr. Dumont seems uninterested in spiritual journeys or in representing how the ineffable equally touches the human face, a donkey's ear, a crown of flowers. The only mystery here is how Mr. Dumont has gone so quickly from promising young director to such an unsteady, unhappy talent. 
 One answer may lie in his characters. As uncommunicative as the animals he keeps, Demester is one of Mr. Dumont's false Everymen, a man whose thick brow and silences are meant to reveal an interior state that the filmmaker has no interest in beyond the decorative and entomological.
 If nothing else, Mr. Dumont's nearly 10-year Cannes trajectory from triumph to disappointment indicates that the burden of the auteur hangs over European directors as heavily as it does any digital savant hungry for Sundance. In an interview about 1970's cinema, Francis Ford Coppola once suggested that an auteur was a filmmaker who wrote the scripts he also directed, rather than a filmmaker with a personal vision. It's hard not to wonder how many generations of young filmmakers have been similarly mistaken, not understanding that in cinema the Mac that writes the script is less important than the camera that is wielded as freely as a pen. Mr. Dumont may have something to say off camera, but on camera all he can offer now are fine technical skills and recycled gestures.

HEADLINE: Cooke's America, Explored In Wartime

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

The American Home Front
1941-1942
By Alistair Cooke
Illustrated. 327 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $24.
 Soon after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Alistair Cooke, a reporter for the BBC, made a shrewd decision. As his fellow journalists converged on Washington, he bought a Lincoln Zephyr, recapped its bald tires and took to the road to see what was going on in the rest of the United States and what Americans outside the circles of government thought about the war.
The reporter was a little late meeting his deadline, as Sir Harold Evans points out in his introduction to ''The American Home Front, 1941-1942.'' Mr. Cooke's account of his two lengthy trips across the United States lay buried in a closet in his Manhattan apartment for six decades before being discovered by an assistant sorting through his papers just a few weeks before his death in March 2004. In 1945 Mr. Cooke's publishers had decided that, with Japan and Germany defeated, readers did not want to relive the war. Mr. Cooke's tour was old news. 
 Well, it feels very fresh now. Crisscrossing the American continent from east to west and north to south, stopping in diners and bus stations and newly humming industrial plants, Mr. Cooke brings to life an America stepping into the unknown, committing its muscle and blood to an enterprise that most citizens could barely articulate, in places most of them had never heard of. On Dec. 7, 1941, Mr. Cooke writes, ''a lot of people were left sitting in their homes not 'stunned' as the newspapers have it but fuzzily wondering where Pearl Harbor was.'' 
 ''The American Home Front'' will come as a revelation to American audiences who knew Mr. Cooke only as the urbane host of ''Masterpiece Theater'' or of the BBC series ''America'' or, for that matter, of his weekly ''Letter From America,'' a BBC radio broadcast that ran from 1946 to 2004. In addition to being a broadcaster, Mr. Cooke was a print reporter, and a superb one, with a sharp, skeptical eye and a stylish pen. Both are on brilliant display here.
 Despite the grim circumstances, ''The American Home Front'' can be read, with great pleasure, as nothing more than a colorful travelogue, given poignancy by the passage of time. Cruising down two-lane highways, along routes since shoved aside by the interstates, Mr. Cooke sees a vanished America of drug stores and soda fountains, of unspoiled Western forests and empty, pristine beaches.
 He encounters regional differences that the intervening decades have smoothed out, and character types that no longer exist. After puzzling over the mysteries of Texas, Mr. Cooke stubs his toe against the flinty resistance of Vermont farmers, who respond to his every inquiry with one or two monosyllables. He senses an entry point after reading that the maple syrup industry faces complete collapse, since wartime restrictions do not allow syrup to be shipped in steel drums.
 ''When I tried to fume with a little decent sympathy, I was regarded with slow, eye-blinking boredom,'' he writes. ''I was simply not one of the family, and the implication was that every family should be left to bury its own. Evidently Vermont, like Texas, is an ideology as well as a state.'' 
 Mr. Cooke was not simply putting random miles on the odometer. He was driven by burning curiosity and the need to learn about matters of life-and-death importance. Now that the United States had entered the war, what could Britain expect? In his restless wanderings, Mr. Cooke compiles a comprehensive report on an industrial and agricultural powerhouse coming to life after the dead years of the Depression. 
 His most valuable, vivid reporting shows, at ground level, the social upheavals and mass migration of the early 1940's, as armies of previously unemployed workers head off to well-paying jobs at shipyards and steel mills in San Francisco and Seattle, or to previously unheard-of towns like Charlestown, Ind., where the government decided to create a smokeless gunpowder plant and with it 5,000 jobs. 
 A poor fruit picker from Florida tells Mr. Cooke: ''N'ah says to my old lady, Sue, ah says, we're headin' fo' Charlestown. She says where's that? I says ah doan' know, but we're headin' theyre.'' America is on the move, and changing in ways that will outlast the war.
 Mr. Cooke sees the things only a foreigner would. He grasps the unique qualities of the drug store, which he calls ''the image of a complete American community -- a shining fountain, the taste of lush syrups, an orgy of casual friendships and smart advertising, a halfway house between brisk comings and goings, the wayside first-aid station of American cleanliness and quick health.'' He has a sensitive ear for the casual cruelties of racism, and in California makes a detour to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans, which he reports on, sorrowfully and humanely, at time when most Americans could not have cared less. 
 Much of the reporting is upbeat. Factories are going full blast, everyone has a job, and airplanes, tanks and Jeeps are rolling off the assembly lines. Even amber waves of grain, ''the American factory of winter wheat,'' seem to be part of the vast American war machine. The mood, in many ways, is bright.
 Direct questions about the war elicit somber responses. ''But walk right into his cornfield,'' Mr. Cooke writes of the average Kansas farmer, ''exchange the time of day, admire a stallion, and ask him how's business and he will grin, wipe his forehead, and say that the last two years have been fine, and if the war keeps on, the next two years will be better.'' 
 Whether he was at a film studio in Los Angeles or a cattle ranch in Wyoming, Mr. Cooke always managed to ask that second question. While the rest of the journalistic pack nibbled at news releases back in Washington, he followed his instincts and took a good look around the rest of the country. He filed late, but boy, did he get it right.

HEADLINE: Building a City Within the City of Atlanta

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
''Make no little plans'' was the sentiment espoused by the celebrated architect and city planner Daniel H. Burnham at the turn of the last century, and it seems to be making a comeback at the turn of this one. From Denver to Dallas to downtown Los Angeles, multibillion-dollar large-scale mixed-used developments are taking shape. But Atlantic Station here is Exhibit A.
 Atlantic Station is not only extraordinarily large, but it is also being built on a formerly contaminated site that was home to a hundred-year-old steel mill, which ceased operation in 1998. Now, the location has become a city within a city on 138 acres with retail, residential, commercial and public space in Midtown Atlanta, the commercial district. And the development seems to be exceeding the expectations of some people.
It will be several more years before the project, which is about half finished, is completed. If it all happens as planned, the $2 billion investment will create a total of 13 million new square feet -- about 50 percent larger than the huge Atlantic Yards project proposed in Brooklyn. 
 The Atlanta development will ultimately include 6 million square feet of ultramodern Class A office space; 5,000 residential units (from luxury condo lofts to more affordable town houses and apartments); 2 million square feet of retail and entertainment space, including restaurants and movie theaters; 1,000 hotel rooms; and 11 acres of public parks.
 ''There are other projects like this around the country, but not on this scale with as many complicating factors,'' said James F. Jacoby, president of Jacoby Development Inc., an Atlanta-based development firm.
 In 1996, he had the idea of redeveloping the steel mill property, despite the environmental concerns that had scared off many others. ''To have this much property in the hands of one owner in a location like this, it's very rare,'' he said. 
 Atlantic Station has three areas: the District is the town center of sorts with commercial, retail and urban-style lofts; the Commons is predominantly a high-rise residential area; and the Village is low-rise housing as well as an Ikea store.
 Much of the commercial property within the District -- where the second Class A office building is coming out of the ground -- is built atop a parking structure that will eventually have 15,000 spaces. (The structure was part of the environmental remediation to cap the area where the steel mill operated and it is built on top of the contained area.) 
 Since Mr. Jacoby first disclosed his plans for the project 10 years ago, it has been a target of critics and skeptics. Many doubted that the project would ever happen, only to wonder later if it could possibly live up to the hype.
 But even Kyle Jenks, principal at Parkside Partners, a rival commercial development company that is not affiliated with Atlantic Station, said the project had been a boon to commercial real estate in Midtown Atlanta. 
 ''Over all, the project has far exceeded expectations,'' Mr. Jenks said. ''The residential component has been very successful, and equally impressive is the amount of Class A office they've been able to do in a tough speculative market.
 ''Three years ago, people would have said it was a Class B location, and yet they've gotten some very high-profile clients. That has only helped Midtown.''
 The main problem with the site was that in addition to being associated in people's minds with a polluted steel mill, it was separated from downtown by two merging Interstate highways. When the steel mill was built, this was the outskirts of town. But the city grew up around it, creating an enticing redevelopment spot. It has now been connected to the rest of downtown by a highway overpass and pedestrian bridge. 
 So far, all of the residences at Atlantic Station have been built by third-party developers. Mr. Jacoby says they have doubled their expected return on investment, and Jacoby Development will take over all future residential development. It intends to create upscale high-rises.
 One current criticism of the project involves the retail segment, which opened last October and which has been faulted for relying heavily on national chains that are already in suburban shopping malls. 
 Yet, being able to walk from shops and restaurants to public parks and movie theaters -- a rare experience in Atlanta -- has attracted visitors from throughout the metropolitan area who drive in, park and spend the day. 
 ''We're actively recruiting local retailers,'' said Derrick McSwain, chief financial officer for Atlantic Station. ''But we had to have a critical mass first before local retailers could be persuaded to take a risk.'' 
 To avoid monotonous design, the developers also insisted that the third-party residential developers hire different architects and builders. Even so, everything is still so new that there is a somewhat sterile feeling, although that is expected to disappear over time as people continue to move in and occupy the space.
 ''There's a serious attempt to create some form of urbanity out of a relic of another world,'' said Douglas C. Allen, professor and associate dean of architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology. ''But the site in its entirety appears to be overprogrammed. You have apartmentville, retail town and office town. I don't know if that's because of planning, or in order to accommodate all the different investors who were taking out pieces of it, but it falls short in some measure, particularly the architecture. But it will get better over time, especially as it's fully built out.'' 
 Susan S. Fainstein, director of the urban planning program at Columbia University, is chairwoman of a panel, ''The New Mega Projects and Their Impact on Urban Life,'' that will be held in July at the World Congress of Sociology in Durban, South Africa. ''It's hard to create texture when everything is brand new,'' Professor Fainstein said. ''But given these kinds of sites, like old steel mills, you can't develop them incrementally. You need a whole new address. It isn't just a matter of momentum; you have to create a change in perception. And that requires a lot of capital and patient investors.''
 Indeed, the site could easily have become a failed large-scale urban redevelopment dream without a big investor -- in this case, the American International Group. Mr. Jacoby said that once he was able to show that a cleanup was possible and that he had a master plan in place as well as support from the city in the form of tax increment financing, he wooed A.I.G. as a partner in the project in 1999. 
 ''Many developers passed it up until Jim got it to the point where we could see some economic value,'' said Kevin P. Fitzpatrick, president of the AIG Global Real Estate Corporation. 
 The Environmental Protection Agency certified the property as safe for construction on Dec. 11, 2001, after years of environmental cleanup. It is said to be the nation's largest remediation of a brownfield, defined by the E.P.A. as contaminated property, usually where heavy industry once operated. It took another $250 million of infrastructure investment in roads, sewers and utility lines before construction of buildings could begin in 2002. 
 Brian Leary, vice president for design and development at Atlantic Station, said his company was working with A.I.G. on similar developments, including a large-scale waterfront project in Cincinnati. 
 ''Unless it was hovering above water, Atlantic Station couldn't be more complicated,'' he said. ''But there are other opportunities to export what we've learned to places with the same characteristics that Atlanta has: a growing economy, a high percentage of educated population, opportunity for public-private partnerships.
 ''It's not about replicating one building; it's about building a whole community.''

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Investors Buy Two Newspapers 

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Julie Bosman contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
A group of local investors bought The Philadelphia Inquirer and its sister paper, The Daily News, yesterday, promising not to interfere with news-gathering operations, although critics question whether editorial independence will be possible.
 The new owners paid the McClatchy Company $562 million for the papers, and said they would keep publishing The Daily News, a tabloid with a declining circulation whose future has periodically been in doubt. And they pledged not to interfere in the running of the newspapers, addressing concerns that the papers might cater to their business interests.
The new owners paid homage to the history of The Inquirer, one of the country's oldest newspapers, which won 17 Pulitzer Prizes during a period in the 1970's, 80's and early 90's. They said they had agreed to leave much of the current newsroom management in place and honor union contracts. 
 ''The next great era of Philadelphia journalism begins today with this announcement,'' Brian P. Tierney, an advertising executive who is a lead investor, said. 
 The group, which calls itself Philadelphia Media Holdings, consists of 10 local investors representing corporate and labor interests as well as entrepreneurs. The buyers, none of whom have owned newspapers before, have said they want the papers to concentrate on local news, particularly business news.
 Bruce E. Toll, a home builder who is the biggest investor with a contribution of $25 million, will be chairman of the new company. He owns automobile dealerships and recently sold shares in UbiquiTel, worth more than $30 million. As a businessman in the area and a co-founder of Toll Brothers, the home building company, he has been frequently mentioned in The Inquirer in the last two years.
 Other investors, who have also been covered in the papers over the years, include Leslie Brun, chairman of a diversified holding company, the Sarr Group; the Carpenters Pension and Annuity Fund of Philadelphia and Vicinity; Bill Graham, chief executive of a large insurance brokerage firm; and Michael Hagan, chairman and chief executive of NutriSystem 
 Mr. Tierney, who will be the chief executive, has been involved in Republican politics, served as a corporate spokesman for Sunoco and has represented the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
 At the news conference, Mr. Tierney said all the investors had signed a pledge that they would not attempt to influence or interfere with either the news coverage or the editorial pages of the papers. In an interview, he said the pledge would extend to the papers' endorsements of political candidates.
 ''I understand the concern, but we don't want to be involved in that,'' Mr. Tierney said. He said his expertise was in advertising and marketing and he would focus his energies on those. ''The best way to kill this as a business,'' he said, would be to tamper with the integrity of the papers, ''so I pledge to you that won't be the case.''
 At one time, newspapers were frequently owned by business interests but that has been less true since the middle of the last century, when media companies began consolidating. Walter Annenberg, a wealthy businessman whose family owned The Inquirer from the 1940's until the late 1960's, used The Inquirer to settle personal scores, promote his own political views and crush his business and political rivals.
 ''Annenberg treated The Inquirer as an arm of his own will,'' said John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, who said that having local businesspeople own a newspaper created potential conflicts of interest.
 ''That's the danger,'' he said. ''And that danger may be aggravated by the fact that these new owners don't come out of a newspaper culture and might not be sensitive to the damage to a newspaper's journalism and to its future by using it for some kind of personal agenda.''
 Joseph Natoli, the publisher of The Inquirer, said in an interview that he took Mr. Tierney at his word that he would not interfere with news and editorial functions.
 ''I and a lot of other folks will be quick to call them on it if we see a problem,'' Mr. Natoli said.
 Similarly, Zach Stalberg, the former editor of The Daily News and now president of the Committee of Seventy, a nonpartisan local civic watchdog group, said of Mr. Tierney, ''He's an honorable guy, and he knows the world will be watching.''
 Mr. Stalberg said he was surprised that the Tierney group won the bidding, because its members had no newspaper experience. But he said it was a good outcome for the papers and the city.
 ''He's a forceful advocate for the things he cares about,'' he said, ''and what these papers need is someone who will fight like hell for them.''
 Others are less sanguine. Ralph Cipriano, a former Inquirer reporter, got into a battle with Mr. Tierney when Mr. Tierney represented the archdiocese and Mr. Cipriano covered religion for the paper. Mr. Tierney objected to a pending article, which Mr. Cipriano said was then watered down before publication. (The episode led to Mr. Cipriano's dismissal in 1998 and his filing of a libel suit against The Inquirer. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.)
 Mr. Cipriano attended the news conference yesterday. ''For an advocate kicking down editors' doors, I don't think he showed much respect for the integrity of the newsroom,'' he said.
 The new owners said they wanted to market and sell ads for the newspapers aggressively and upgrade the joint Web site, www.philly.com.
 ''I want to try to grow these publications, not manage their decline,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''There's no plans to close The Daily News. I love The Daily News.''
 The sale ends one chapter of uncertainty and turmoil at both papers. But it could open another as the owners get to know the newspaper business, which is still profitable although troubled. Advertising is in a slump, classified ads are migrating to free online sites, readers are decamping for the Internet and newspapers have yet to figure out how to make money from their increasingly popular Web sites. Philadelphia is further hobbled by a lagging economy, and the papers are saddled with expensive union contracts.
 Mr. Tierney emphasized that the company would be private, freeing the investors from meeting the demands of Wall Street. As a measure of investor commitment, he said all had pledged not to sell any of their interest in the papers for at least five years.
 The group will give McClatchy $515 million in cash and will assume $47 million in pension liabilities. 
 Knight Ridder, which owned 32 daily newspapers, including The Inquirer and The Daily News, was sold under pressure from shareholders to McClatchy in March for $4.5 billion. McClatchy immediately announced it would sell 12 of those papers, including the two in Philadelphia, because their markets were not considered growth markets.
 Knight Ridder's profit margin in 2004 was 19.3 percent, about average for the industry. Morgan Stanley, which examined the company before its sale, said the profit margin in Philadelphia was 9 percent, while company executives said it was somewhat higher, even with severance payments last year as the papers trimmed their staffs. 
 Both papers have been losing circulation at rates that exceed the industry average.
 Circulation at The Inquirer, once the jewel of the Knight Ridder chain, fell to 350,457, a drop of 5 percent, for the six-month period ended March 31, compared with the period the year before. Circulation at The Daily News dropped 9.4 percent, to 116,590.
 The average circulation loss for the industry was 2.5 percent.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 3, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on May 24 about the sale of Philadelphia's newspapers, The Inquirer and The Daily News, to a group of local investors misstated the date that The Inquirer was purchased by the Annenberg family. (The error was repeated on Monday in an article about Brian Tierney, one of the new owners.) It was 1936, not the 1940's.

HEADLINE: Theater Named for Helen Hayes Is on the Brink of Closing

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

 BODY:
The playhouse named for the actress known as the first lady of the American theater, Helen Hayes, will shut down permanently in less than a month unless a new operator can be found to take it over. 
 The 587-seat hall opened nine years ago in an old movie theater on Main Street in the Hudson River village of Nyack, where Ms. Hayes lived from 1932 until her death in 1993. Jackie Mason and Rupert Holmes and others chiseled their pre-Broadway productions at the theater, which featured new works and revivals of classics. Last year, Olympia Dukakis starred in a new work there.
But the Helen Hayes Theater Company and other regional theater companies fell on hard times after the 9/11 attack. With its debt mounting, the company closed the theater in December and then sold the building in March for $3.76 million to a strip-mall developer, Milbrook Acquisition Corporation of Manhasset, N.Y., to pay off its debts. 
 Local residents have pressed the new owners to keep the theater open, and Milbrook has been cooperating with the Helen Hayes board to find another performing arts tenant. The company has agreed to lower the monthly rent by half, to $18,000, to encourage another nonprofit theater group to lease the property. For its part, the Helen Hayes board has offered to give its seats, sound boards, stage furnishings and lighting equipment free to such a group. 
 But no one has stepped forward to lease the theater. ''It's a sign of the times,'' Dan Rodriguez, a Helen Hayes trustee, said. ''The economics just doesn't make sense for these regional theaters.'' 
 Mr. Rodriguez said that the theater company, which put on 1,600 performances, never rebounded from a drop in ticket sales and contributions after the terrorist attacks. He also blamed video games, the Internet and iPods for a drop in theatergoing nationwide. ''There's a lot of competition for those entertainment dollars,'' he said.
 Other regional theater groups have faced similar pressures. 
 The John Harms Center for the Arts, in Englewood, N.J., closed in the face of huge debts in 2003 and has since been reborn as Harms Hall, under the auspices of the Bergen Performing Arts Center. The 72-year-old Paper Mill Playhouse, in Millburn, N.J., is fighting for survival by broadening its programs and diversifying its audience, according to Mark Hoebee, the associate artistic director. Despite some successes, he said, subscriptions are down and the budget has dropped by 20 percent in recent years. 
 Mr. Rodriguez said that the Helen Hayes board decided to shut down its theater before it became insolvent, rather than follow the example of the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Mount Kisco, which closed last October after 27 years following a string of financial crises. The multi-arts center, which housed a theater of its own, closed owing thousands of dollars in back pay to staff and faculty members and in tuition refunds to students.
 ''The irony here is that we have a debt-free theater,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''All our vendors are paid in full and we owe nothing.'' 
 He said the Helen Hayes board has given itself until June 13 to find a theater operator. ''If we can't,'' he said, ''we will dissolve the corporation, liquidate our assets and give the proceeds to other not-for-profit arts organizations within the community.''
 Thomas J. LiPuma, Milbrook's property manager, said that the company would ''love to have a theater'' in the Nyack building, which also has 14,000 square feet of occupied retail space on Main Street. ''We want to work quickly in getting the space up and running,'' he said.
 Mr. LiPuma, whose company owns 55 buildings in Rockland County, on Long Island and in New Jersey and Florida, said it was unclear what would happen if another theater group is not found. ''If we can't make it work, we'll go to plan B,'' he said, though he added that he was unsure what that would be. But he said he did not anticipate demolishing the theater, because of its retail space.
 Deborah Darbone, chairwoman of Friends of the Nyacks, said her group was working to find someone to run a multi-arts center in the building. ''We remain optimistic that that will happen,'' she said. 
 Two groups were considered likely candidates for the Helen Hayes, but backed away from the $18,000 monthly rent. One, the Lamb's Theater Company in Manhattan, faces eviction as plans proceed to turn its longtime home, a building on West 44th Street, east of Broadway, that has been declared a landmark, into a hotel. Carolyn Rossi Copeland, the Lamb's founding producer and director, said she told Milbrook on May 9 that she was no longer interested.
 ''It's not a good move for a nonprofit theater company to move out of the city and be saddled with the kind of rent they're looking for,'' she said. ''They're looking for Manhattan prices.'' 
 She said that liability insurance, utilities and other expenses would raise the monthly cost to at least $22,000.
 Another group, which Mr. Rodriguez declined to identify, also dropped out of discussions. 
 Nyack's mayor, John Shields, said a group of local residents was ''actively looking'' to locate a theater company in the area if efforts to save the Helen Hayes theater fail. 
 And Marty Hollander, a retired film distributor and Nyack business owner who advocates turning the closed theater into a profit-making first-run movie theater, is also waiting in the wings. ''I have a plan, and I am in the running,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Restrictions on City Lobbying Ignore Loophole, Critics Say

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JO CRAVEN McGINTY

 BODY:
The New York City Council is poised today to approve some of the most restrictive rules on lobbying in city history, including a curb on the ability of lobbyists to tap public matching funds when they make campaign contributions. Officials say the change will prevent taxpayer dollars from going to subsidize special interests.
 But the heavily promoted reforms contain a loophole that some civic groups say will allow lobbyists to continue drawing matching funds as they seek to influence officeholders. Lobbyists will still be able to seek, collect and deliver contributions, a process known as bundling, and then have those donations matched by taxpayer dollars -- $4 to $6 for every $1 given to a candidate, up to $250 for each donor who lives in the city.
It is through such bundling, according to watchdog groups and the city's Campaign Finance Board, that the influence of lobbyists on candidates is most strongly felt. 
 Registered lobbying firms and their employees collected around $400,000 as intermediaries on behalf of local political candidates last year, according to an analysis of public campaign finance and lobbying records by The New York Times. And that sum includes only money that the lobbyist bundles and ''delivers'' to the candidate; a lobbyist who merely urges others to donate money to a candidate does not have to be listed as an intermediary. 
 The measure the Council is expected to approve today has the backing of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and it contains far-ranging changes intended to reduce the influence of lobbyists. For instance, lobbyists would be prevented from giving any gifts -- even a cup of coffee -- to elected officials, and not only would their personal donations be ineligible for matching funds, but so would gifts from their spouses and children. 
 But advocates who want to reduce the influence of money on politics worry that the new rules will only prompt well-connected lobbyists to exploit the new loophole. 
 Gene Russianoff, a lawyer with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit watchdog organization, predicted that if the Council made only donations from lobbyists ineligible for matching funds, the lobbyists would just stop giving and channel their efforts as intermediaries instead. 
 ''Campaign money is like water -- it will go to the point of least resistance,'' he said. ''That's why this glaring loophole should be filled now.''
 The Campaign Finance Board has also expressed reservations about whether the current lobbying proposal goes far enough.
 ''Our preliminary research shows that while lobbyists as contributors are relatively insignificant, they have a far greater role as intermediaries,'' the board's executive director, Nicole A. Gordon, said at a Council hearing on April 4.
 At the hearing, Ms. Gordon noted that when lobbyists do not donate to a candidate directly, but act solely as intermediaries, they are not required to disclose their status as lobbyists. ''This seems to be a major loophole,'' she said.
 Candidates for city offices who received bundled contributions claimed more than $55,000 in public matching funds tied to these donations. If all of those claims were validated by the city Campaign Finance Board, the candidates, as a group, would have been eligible to receive at least $221,200 in matching public funds.
 Among the lobbyists who raised the most money for local candidates last year, according to the records, were Kenneth K. Fisher and the late Robert J. Dryfoos, two former councilmen; Brian O'Dwyer, a nephew of William O'Dwyer, who was mayor from 1946 to 1950; Donald M. Halperin, a former state senator; and Catherine Giuliani, who worked in the city's Economic Development Corporation when her cousin by marriage, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was mayor.
 Wachtel & Masyr, a law firm that focuses on land use, collected the most money through bundled donations, funneling more than $94,000 to candidates, according to the records. The chief beneficiaries were Fernando Ferrer, the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for mayor, who received at least $81,350 in donations bundled by the firm, and Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who took in at least $9,250.
 Suri Kasirer, a lobbyist who worked for Mario M. Cuomo when he was governor, collected at least $83,750 as an intermediary, channeling all but $2,000 to Gifford Miller, a former Council speaker who sought the Democratic nomination for mayor last year.
 In interviews, about a dozen lobbyists who bundled donations last year expressed varying views on the proposal before the Council. 
 Some said they even agreed with the advocates who want to end the practice of matching donations bundled by lobbyists. 
 ''If they think that will make for cleaner government, it's a good thing,'' said Jesse Masyr, a partner in Wachtel & Masyr. ''It's worth trying. If the law wants to say my contribution should be treated differently because I also have a practice that involves government interaction, it doesn't bother me.'' 
 Mr. Masyr, who bundled money for Scott M. Stringer, now the Manhattan borough president, noted that the vast majority of the money bundled by the firm's lawyers last year was solicited by his partner, William B. Wachtel, on behalf of his longtime friend Mr. Ferrer.
 Mr. Fisher, who was on the Council from 1991 to 2001, also said he could support restrictions on bundling. ''In terms of ensuring public confidence and the integrity of the political process, it might not help, but it probably wouldn't hurt,'' he said. 
 Mr. Fisher bundled money for Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s re-election effort but said he had lobbied Mr. Thompson only once, on a matter concerning procurement policies that is still pending. ''When I go out and try to help a candidate that I believe in, whether the donations are matched or not is not something I pay attention to,'' Mr. Fisher said.
 Other lobbyists said they believed they were being unfairly singled out. 
 ''As much as I admire Mayor Bloomberg, what they're doing again is setting up rules and regulations that will only allow rich and self-financed candidates to run,'' said Mr. O'Dwyer, who added that he had largely given up lobbying to focus on his law practice. ''Ultimately that is bad for the city.'' 
 Ms. Kasirer, who bundled money for Mr. Miller, said she could support restrictions on direct donations from lobbyists but not on bundled donations. ''The proposed law, as I understand it, strikes a good balance,'' she said. ''Further restrictions of the type being discussed would work to the benefit of rich and well-funded candidates at the expense of other worthy persons seeking public office who don't have deep pockets.''
 Kevin B. McGrath, a lobbyist for Cablevision, which fought the Bloomberg administration's effort to build a football stadium, bundled at least $3,500 for Mr. Miller, who opposed the stadium -- but said he never expected that fund-raising to sway Mr. Miller.
 ''I'm concerned about these so-called reforms,'' Mr. McGrath said. ''They imply that lobbyists, who might be lawyers and have to file because they speak to public officials, are dishonest.''
 Ms. Quinn, the Council speaker, called the lobbying proposal a major step forward. ''The idea of there being a loophole as it relates to restrictions on bundling -- I don't see it that way,'' she said in a telephone interview.
 The measure would also require political consultants to register with the city, as lobbyists are required to do. 
 Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg began working on lobbying reform in January, after the mayor raised the issue in his State of the City address and after Ms. Quinn's colleagues elected her speaker. ''I've worked in or around this building since 1989, when I was a housing organizer, and I've seen the number and influence of lobbyists grow every year,'' she said. Ms. Quinn said she remained open to addressing bundling. ''The original package that was put before the Council did not include an anti-bundling provision,'' she said. ''That suggestion got made later in the process, after the Council had begun internally discussing and debating the lobbying proposal. To add it in midway or late in the process would have been very difficult.''
 Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor who has been coordinating talks with the Council over the lobbying proposal, also said the administration was receptive to considering the bundling issue in the future. ''Nobody said this would be the be-all and end-all,'' he said. ''For the first time, people are not talking about whether to do lobbying reform, but which reforms to do, and that's a major step forward. We'll take a look at any proposals that either the Council or outside groups have going forward.'' 
 He added that he viewed the bills as ''a ground-breaking proposal.''
 Dick Dadey of Citizens Union, an advocacy group that promotes transparency in government, agreed. ''These bills are not perfect, but take us a long way down the road toward knowing more about what goes on and limiting the influence of money in the lobbying process,'' he said. ''In judging these bills, let not the perfect be the enemy of the good.''

HEADLINE: In Search of Standouts Who May Not Stand Out Enough

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Every Tuesday after classes this year, Mosi London has been riding the subway downtown from his high school on East Houston Street and then walking to Wall Street. There, in an office suite, he and 11 other New York high school students have spent two hours a week on academic exercises, ranging from team-building games to writing assignments to public speaking. They have been training for college.
 In the fall, Mr. London, who is 17 and grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, will attend Lafayette College in Pennsylvania on a full scholarship. He was identified by the nonprofit Posse Foundation, whose executives looked beyond standardized test scores to select him and 304 other students nationwide as likely to excel at a selective college -- but also as likely to be overlooked by admissions officials. Mr. London is not a star athlete or musician and does not have stellar SAT scores; he is simply a New York City student with good grades, pride and potential.
''We are expected to be leaders,'' Mr. London said one recent afternoon after a Posse training session. 
 Last fall, Mr. London was one of 6,300 students in five cities who competed for a Posse scholarship. The students who were picked received full scholarships to one of 23 colleges and universities working with the foundation; other participating institutions are Pomona College, Bryn Mawr College and Brandeis University. 
 For the participating colleges and universities, the Posse program offers a way to bring in students -- especially minority students -- to diversity their campuses. While Posse Foundation executives said the program did not search exclusively for minority students, it does recruit from urban schools, which tend to have far more nonwhite students.
 ''We're looking for standout kids, kids who exhibit leadership,'' said Deborah Bial, president and founder of the 17-year-old foundation, which is based in Manhattan and is financed through private donations.
 Elite schools ''all want the Dominican kid with 1600 on their SAT,'' added Ms. Bial, who is married to Bob Herbert, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times. She said a narrow focus on standardized test scores missed students who show in other ways that they, too, have potential. ''We're looking at them through a nontraditional lens,'' she said.
 To participate in the program, students must first be recommended by a guidance counselor or other school official. Then they go for a kind of group interview, in which the students, who may never have met before, must interact with each other and with Posse officials. They might also have to cooperate on a project, like building a robot out of Legos, for example. At this stage, Posse officials do not know anything about students' grades, test scores, extracurricular activities or other traditional measures of merit. 
 About two-thirds of the students make it to a more conventional, individual interview. About 600 undergo a final interview with Posse officials and admissions officials from one of the participating institutions.
 The selected students, having bypassed the typical admissions process, form a so-called posse of about 10 (or in Mr. London's case, 12), who will go off to the same college in the fall. Until then, they meet weekly as a group with Posse trainers to prepare. The idea is that having bonded before college, they will support each other once they get there. 
 The students do well. More than 90 percent of Posse students graduate within five years, compared with about 60 percent at private four-year institutions nationally. More than half earn a grade point average above 3.0, according to a 2003 independent study of the program. The success of the program, which costs the foundation about $5,000 a year per student (not including tuition, which is covered by the college), suggests that its true strength is finding young people who are capable of thriving at selective institutions, but who might not be identified by admissions offices.
 ''They have a lot to teach us,'' Daniel H. Weiss, the president of Lafayette, said, referring to the Posse Foundation. The conventional admissions process, he said, ''misses entirely too much.'' 
 Mr. London is the son of Guyanese immigrants who moved to the United States before he was born. His father runs a property management business; his mother died not long ago. Mr. London is an intense, thoughtful young man -- lately he has been reading Philip Roth's ''Plot Against America'' on the J train to and from Bard High School Early College. Years ago, he decided to focus on homework and not potential distractions in his neighborhood.
 ''It was always a choice I had to make,'' he said. ''The high school I went to was very demanding, and I decided that I had to do well to get where I wanted to go.''
 Steffi Romano, 18, is a first-year Posse student at Lafayette, whose pretty campus is perched on a hill overlooking Easton, Pa. Before going through the selection process, she had never heard of the college.
 Last year, Ms. Romano was valedictorian at Health Careers and Sciences High School in Upper Manhattan and was thinking about applying to Columbia and New York University. But her SAT scores were low for those schools, and lower than the average score of an entering Lafayette student, which was 1279 out of a possible 1600, according to the institution. Regardless, in her first semester at Lafayette, she made the dean's list.
 Ms. Romano, who moved to Harlem with her parents from the Dominican Republic when she was 3, said that before entering Lafayette, she was nervous about attending an overwhelmingly white college. Of Lafayette's roughly 2,300 students, more than 1,900 are white, and Posse students make up more than 10 percent of the non-foreign minority population. Ms. Romano described her high school as ''98 percent Hispanic.''
 ''I knew it was going to be predominantly white,'' she said about Lafayette, ''but you don't really get a feel for that until you're there.''
 Campus culture was a shock, but not just because of demographics or academic challenges. One of the biggest problems, Ms. Romano said, was the social scene, with its emphasis on drinking, a phenomenon that was new to her. 
 In their first and second years at the college, Posse students regularly meet as a group and individually with a faculty mentor. The idea is to talk about whatever challenges the students might face, said Ed Gamber, an economics professor at Lafayette who is mentor to Ms. Romano's group.
 Ms. Romano's group, the fourth to attend Lafayette, recently invited other professors to one of their meetings, with the idea of dispelling misconceptions about the program. Several Posse participants expressed frustration that on campus, the program is regarded as an all-minority program even though some Posse students are white. ''Some of us got into Columbia University,'' Ms. Romano said at the meeting. Negative attitudes toward the Posse scholars were much stronger for Posse 1, the first New York City students to arrive on campus four years ago. 
 ''People didn't know what Posse was,'' recalled Rasheim Donaldson, 21, a senior at Lafayette. ''Some students of color actually opposed Posse,'' he continued, because they thought that full scholarships ought to go to students who went through the institution's conventional admissions process.
 ''We were under a microscope,'' said Mr. Donaldson, who grew up in Washington Heights and graduated from Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem. 
 Mr. Donaldson recalled that in those early days, the members of his group were extremely close, creating what he described as a haven for each other. He recalled a debate over affirmative action in a class in which he was the only black student, during his freshman year.
 ''I was very fervent in my position,'' he said; he argued that policies to address racial inequality were necessary. He added that he had honed his arguments during Posse training sessions.
 Now Mr. Donaldson, who is tall, articulate and constantly in motion, heads the black student organization, is a resident adviser in a dormitory and coordinates a program that works with children in Easton.
 Mr. Donaldson and his classmates are thinking about what they will do after graduation in a few weeks. One plans a bicycle ride across the country to meet a variety of nonprofit groups; another will start work at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Donaldson is considering law school, although he would have to attend without his posse.

HEADLINE: Comptroller's Report Faults Albany for 'Flawed' Budget 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 23 

 BODY:
The state's budget may have passed on time this year, but the process ''has never been in worse shape,'' according to a bleak new report by State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi that faulted the Pataki administration for inflating its estimate of the Legislature's budget by $3 billion.
 The report gave credence to repeated complaints by Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno, the state's other top Republican, that Mr. Pataki's budget staff was purposely overstating the size of the Legislature's budget. 
The report by Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, also accuses the governor of not living up to his claims of fiscal conservatism. Not only did the governor propose in his own budget to increase spending above inflation, but also the report points out that he re-inserted spending initiatives into the budget after it was passed last month, circumventing the Legislature.
 And it takes Mr. Pataki to task for claiming that many of his vetoes of budget items could not be overridden by the Legislature on constitutional grounds, muddying the outcome of the budget; Mr. Pataki's powers, however, have been bolstered by recent court decisions. 
 Mr. Pataki is hardly the only target of the report, which also lambastes the Legislature's eagerness to spend. The end result is a ''severely flawed'' $112.3 billion final budget that increases spending at three times the pace of inflation and is only balanced by the substantial use of new debt and one-shot revenues like stock sales, which will end up leaving the state with a $9.8 billion shortfall over the next two years. About the only positive was that the process produced the second on-time budget in the last two decades; Mr. Hevesi suggests, however, that timeliness has been overrated. 
 ''A budget must not only be on-time, it must also be prudent,'' he said in a statement, adding that the budget instead followed a ''formula for severe problems in the future.''
 Mr. Pataki's staff was quick to fire back, saying the comptroller should have weighed in during negotiations. 
 ''Alan Hevesi is nothing more than a spending-binge enabler who stayed on the sidelines while the Legislature added billions of dollars in spending and debt to the governor's budget,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki. ''New Yorkers respect leaders who are willing to engage on the issues when it matters, not Tuesday morning quarterbacks,'' he added. 
 Mr. Hevesi's staff said that weighing in the midst of budget negotiations would not have been proper for the comptroller.
 The comptroller also said the governor's staff added items to the Legislature's budget that were not there, including $1.2 billion in spending for needy families that was left out of the budget in a dispute. The governor's staff said there was money available to support the program and it was justifiably counted. 
 The report echoed a recent study by the Manhattan Institute, which found that the budget's spending increases were the largest since the Rockefeller era. ''I don't think the problem is the process, but the excess,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, a budget analyst with the institute, a conservative policy research group.
 Mr. Bruno was critical of the findings. ''Rather than issuing a report attacking the budget and the budget process, the comptroller should make constructive recommendations on what taxes he would increase and what programs he would cut,'' he said in a statement. 
 Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, focused on Mr. Pataki, saying the governor ''refused to work with the Legislature and showed a make-it-up-as-you-go-along attitude toward the state Constitution throughout the budget process.''

PERSON: Lloyd Bentsen

HEADLINE: Lloyd Bentsen, Senator, Treasury Chief And Author of Notable Retort, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM. 
David E. Rosenbaum, the reporter for this article, died in January.

 BODY:
Lloyd Bentsen, former congressman and senator from Texas, onetime secretary of the Treasury and the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1988, died yesterday at his home in Houston. He was 85. The cause was complications of a stroke he suffered in 1998, his family said.

Rapid Rise to Influence
 In a long career in public office, Lloyd Bentsen was involved in some of the most important legislative battles of the second half of the 20th century. But he is probably best remembered for one devastating riposte he delivered an hour into a deadly dull debate between the vice-presidential nominees in Omaha in October 1988.
 Almost as an aside, his youthful Republican opponent, Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana, remarked, ''I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency.'' 
Mr. Bentsen pounced. ''Senator,'' he declared, contempt in his voice and admonition in his eyes, ''I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
 In the election a month later, Mr. Bentsen and Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, were trounced by George Bush and Mr. Quayle. But that one moment onstage in a generally lackluster election campaign propelled Mr. Bentsen's national image from that of an unexceptional Texas senator beholden to the oil and gas industry to that of a major national figure. 
 In their book ''The Quest for the Presidency 1988,'' Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews wrote that before the debate, Mr. Bentsen ''had been the forgotten man'' of the campaign.
 Afterward, Mr. Bentsen's ''own gray solidity,'' they wrote, was ''made luminescent by the pallor of the other three men.''
 Then and throughout his career, Mr. Bentsen was helped by the fact that he looked and comported himself like Hollywood's version of a successful politician. He was tall and thin with handsome features, a deep, soothing voice, elegant clothes and such legendary self-control that those who served with him in Congress and in the Clinton cabinet could not recall a single instance in which he let his emotions get the better of him.
 Indeed, in his younger days in Congress, his skills as a poker player were fearsome. Once, it is said, he won a house from another lawmaker in a late-night game. Asked about this years later, Mr. Bentsen, looking like a man with confidence in his hole card, replied, ''There are some who have alleged it.''

Big Lloyd and a Big Ranch
 Lloyd Millard Bentsen Jr. -- he stopped using his middle initial and the ''Jr.'' long ago -- was born into prosperity on Feb. 11, 1921, in Mission, Tex., in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the country's poorest regions.
 His father, Lloyd Bentsen Sr., known as Big Lloyd, had taken military training in San Antonio in World War I and moved to South Texas from South Dakota after the war. He made money buying and selling land, and quickly expanded from ranching to oil and then to banking.
 The Arrowhead Ranch, where Lloyd Jr. was reared, was one of the biggest in the valley and remained in the Bentsen family until it was sold in 1997 for more than $6 million.
 After earning a law degree from the University of Texas, Mr. Bentsen enlisted in the Army as a private in 1942 and quickly became a commissioned officer in the Army Air Forces. Before being shipped off to Europe in 1943, he married Beryl Ann Longino, known as B. A., a fashion model who had been a college classmate.
 Charming and enormously popular in Washington and Texas, Mrs. Bentsen often wanted to stay at social functions long after her husband was ready to leave. Even when they were well into middle age, he would playfully toss her over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and carry her out of parties. In addition to his wife, his survivors, all from Houston, include two sons, Lloyd III and Lan; a daughter, Tina Smith; two brothers, Don and Kenneth; a sister, Betty Bentsen Winn; and eight grandchildren.
 During the war, Mr. Bentsen, a B-24 pilot, was shot down twice and received the Distinguished Flying Cross, among other decorations. He left the Army as a colonel. Back home, helped by his war record and his family's money and prominence, he was elected Hidalgo County judge in 1946. Two years later he was elected to the House of Representatives, becoming the youngest member of Congress at age 27.
 Mr. Bentsen was a protege of a fellow Texan, Speaker Sam Rayburn, but when he was 33, after six years in the House, he decided to leave politics to earn money to support his young family. 
 He often told the story that when he announced he would not run for re-election, Rayburn, a bachelor, commented: ''Lloyd, it's a damn fool thing you've done. Why, in another 25 years, you could be speaker.''
 Mr. Bentsen replied: ''Mr. Speaker, I have a wife and three kids. They'' -- the government -- ''pay me $12,500 a year. I can't cut it on that. I have to go back to Texas and go to work.''
 And that is what he did for the next 15 years. In 1955, he went to Houston and founded the Consolidated American Life Insurance Company, called Calico. At the time, the $7 million his father put up was described as the largest initial capitalization ever for a Texas insurance company.
 Calico soon branched out into other businesses, and by 1967 Mr. Bentsen was president of a family financial holding company, Lincoln Consolidated Inc. The company, one of the first in Texas to use data processing technology, owned businesses ranging from a savings and loan to a funeral home. Mr. Bentsen also served on the boards of the Lockheed Corporation and various petroleum companies.
 In 1970, having earned his fortune, Mr. Bentsen re-entered politics, challenging Ralph W. Yarborough in the Democratic primary for Mr. Yarborough's Senate seat. Mr. Yarborough, a strong supporter of labor unions and an opponent of the Vietnam War, was a leading figure in the liberal-populist wing of the Texas Democratic Party. The battle was a bruising one in which Mr. Bentsen painted him as an ally of antiwar rioters, and it left wounds in the state party that did not heal for years. 
 Mr. Bentsen narrowly won the primary and defeated Mr. Bush, then a congressman from Houston, in the general election. The two candidates were on the same wavelength ideologically -- Mr. Bush less conservative than most Republicans, and Mr. Bentsen less liberal than most Democrats -- and Mr. Bentsen won largely on the strength of a heavy Democratic majority in voter registration in Texas.

A Pro-Business Democrat
 After only two years in the Senate, Mr. Bentsen was given a prized seat on the Finance Committee, which handles tax, trade and social welfare legislation. He got the post in large part because the chairman, Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, wanted to solidify his majority on the committee on the side of favorable treatment for the oil and gas industry.
 In 1976, as his first term in the Senate was drawing to a close, Mr. Bentsen made a quixotic run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He called himself a Harry Truman Democrat and tried to establish a base as a moderate Southerner. 
 But the campaign never got off the ground. Squeezed by the combined opposition of Jimmy Carter and George C. Wallace, Mr. Bentsen dropped out of the race in the spring with only six delegates, all in Texas. That November, he easily won re-election to the Senate.
 As he moved up in seniority on the Finance Committee, he became increasingly influential as an ally of business interests. He devoted considerable energy to maintaining tax breaks for small oil and gas producers and for the real estate industry, to which he had close ties. He was a leader on trade expansion and pension issues. And he was one of the foremost Democratic advocates of private investment and economic growth.
 Mr. Bentsen basically took a pass on the most important matter to come before the Finance Committee while he was a member, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which completely rewrote the nation's tax code. He eventually voted for the legislation, but he was never enthusiastic about its underlying principle of ending most deductions and tax incentives in return for lower tax rates. He tried, but failed, to block a section of the measure that abolished most real estate tax shelters.
 In 1987, with Senator Long's retirement, Mr. Bentsen became the committee's chairman. Soon after he took the seat, he was embarrassed by the disclosure that he had invited lobbyists to breakfasts in exchange for $10,000 campaign contributions. Rather than make excuses, he admitted to a ''doozy'' of a mistake and refunded the $92,500 he had collected. 
 In 1990, Mr. Bentsen was instrumental in brokering the budget deal in which President Bush agreed to a tax increase. 
 On politically delicate issues outside the Finance Committee, he often voted with Republicans. He supported prayer in public schools, aid to anti-Marxist rebels in Nicaragua, production of the MX missile and restrictions on involuntary busing for school desegregation. He voted against federal financing of abortions for poor women and against gun control.
 Compared with that of many other senators who stayed long enough to become chairmen of powerful committees, Mr. Bentsen's Senate career was not particularly distinguished. No landmark legislation bears his name. He was hampered in part by the fact that Republicans controlled the White House for all but 4 of his 22 years in the Senate.
 But he made many friends among senators of both parties. His contacts in Congress and the national acclaim he had gained from his 1988 campaign for vice president led President Bill Clinton to choose him as Treasury secretary. The appointment was applauded in Congress and on Wall Street.
 At the Treasury, Mr. Bentsen led the fight in 1993 for approval of the first Clinton budget, which included a tax increase and was approved without any Republican votes. Then he mustered enough Republican support to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement over significant Democratic opposition.
 After two years in the cabinet, Mr. Bentsen, by then 73, resigned. He told the president that he had long planned to retire from politics in 1994, at the end of what would have been his fourth term in the Senate.
 Out of office, Mr. Bentsen joined the Houston office of the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, which makes a point of hiring famous former politicians as lobbyists and rainmakers. Among others, Bob Dole and George J. Mitchell, both former Senate majority leaders, also joined the firm after they left office.
 In his political retirement, Mr. Bentsen traveled widely. He helped create a billion-dollar private investment firm to finance projects throughout Latin America and headed the advisory committee of the Beacon Group, a New York investment bank with interests around the world.
 As a private citizen, he stayed out of the limelight and almost never spoke out about public policy. But his office in Houston remained a testament to his life in politics.
 On the walls were portraits of the 10 presidents he had known, from Truman through Bill Clinton. On his portrait, Mr. Clinton had written, ''To my friend Lloyd Bentsen, who makes me study things until I get it right.''
 And in the center was the photograph that was in a prominent spot on the wall of every office Mr. Bentsen occupied for nearly 50 years -- a portrait of his beloved mentor, Sam Rayburn.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Board Differs On City Budget 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has overstated its projected deficits for the 2008 to 2010 fiscal years by $1 billion a year, according to an analysis released yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office. The analysis also found that the city will end the current fiscal year on June 30 with a surplus of $3.5 billion, slightly greater than Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has projected, and should expect a surplus of $400 million in the 2007 fiscal year, which starts July 1. The future deficits will not be as severe as Mr. Bloomberg has projected because some of the rise in property values has not yet been reflected in tax receipts, according to the report, which, however, also noted risks from rising interest rates, higher oil prices and a slowing housing market.

HEADLINE: New Signs of a Slowing Economy in 2 Federal Reports 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
New-home sales rose last month, but failed to keep up the robust growth pace of March. The home sales numbers, along with a second government report yesterday that showed a steep decline in orders for durable goods, were seen as pointing to a softening economy.
 But the numbers did little to reassure investors hoping that the economic data would encourage the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates when it meets next month. 
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes were up 4.9 percent in April, while orders for durable goods -- relatively costly items that are expected to last at least three years, including aircraft and home appliances -- fell 4.8 percent. 
 Since the Fed increased its benchmark short-term interest rate earlier this month to 5 percent, investors have been scrutinizing every economic indicator to determine what it might do at its next meeting in late June. With consumer prices on the rise and fears of inflation growing, many investors worry the Fed may raise rates for the 17th consecutive time in two years.
 Investors' attention will now turn to the Commerce Department's announcement today of the revised gross domestic product figure for the first quarter, which is expected to be above the already strong 4.8 percent reported in February. 
 Because growth was so torrid in the first quarter, most economists expect the economy to slow as the year goes on. But it is unclear whether that will be enough to encourage central bankers that they do not need to worry about inflation.
 ''We came ripping right out of the box in January,'' said Brian Jones, an economist with Citigroup. ''Going forward it would be very difficult to keep that pace of spending up.''
 Indeed, investors appeared unsure how to digest yesterday's economic news. After a day in which the major United States stock indexes swung in and out of the red, stocks ended on an up note. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.97 points, to close at 11,117.32. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 1.99 points, to 1,258.57. The Nasdaq rose 10.41 points, to 2,169.17. [Page C12.]
 Gold futures fell nearly 5.4 percent, or $36.20, to $637.50 an ounce. 
 Typically, new housing sales and durable goods are two highly volatile measures of economic growth. This year, they have been even more volatile than usual. New-home sales were down in the first two months of 2006 but up 12 percent in March.
 Durable goods orders plunged in January but were up for the next two months. 
 Despite all the ups and downs in recent months, Wall Street analysts were still surprised by the numbers released yesterday. 
 ''These are two of the most volatile series that we have,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. ''And they displayed volatility in the most recent data.''
 While much of the drop in the durable goods figure can be attributed to fewer orders for aircraft last month, the home sales numbers are more of a reason for concern. The new housing data appear to confirm what many economists have already said: as real estate speculators bow out of a peaking market and mortgage rates rise, the torrid pace of home sales is cooling. Compared with last April, sales of new homes fell 5.7 percent. 
 ''It does look like things seem to be steadying,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist with RBS Greenwich Capital. ''Now, we're more or less just back to the fundamental demand that was there all along of people who actually want to buy and live in a home -- the family with two kids and a dog.''
 Inventories are also rising, yet another sign of weakness in the latest housing data. At the end of April, the number of homes for sale reached a record 565,000.
 The median sale price of new homes nationwide rose to $238,500 in April, up from $232,000 in March, but little changed from a year earlier. 
 Sales of new homes in April were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.2 million compared with the annual rate for March of 1.1 million homes. The largest gains last month were in the Northeast and the South, which both had increases of about 8 percent.
 With mortgage rates climbing, many economists believe home sales will decline this month.
 ''We did get this quirky increase in April,'' said Mr. Jones of Citigroup. ''But what we will see probably is a nice, gradual, orderly decline in activity.''

HEADLINE: Laid Off And Left Out

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
You don't hear much from the American worker anymore. Like battered soldiers at the end of a lost war, ordinary workers seem resigned to their diminished status.
 The grim terms imposed on them include wage stagnation, the widespread confiscation of benefits (including pensions they once believed were guaranteed), and a permanent state of employment insecurity.
For an unnecessarily large number of Americans, the workplace has become a hub of anxiety and fear, an essential but capricious environment in which you might be shown the door at any moment. 
 In his new book, ''The Disposable American: Layoffs and Their Consequences,'' Louis Uchitelle tells us that since 1984, when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics started monitoring ''worker displacement,'' at least 30 million full-time workers have been ''permanently separated from their jobs and their paychecks against their wishes.''
 Mr. Uchitelle writes on economic issues for The Times. In his book, he traces the evolution of that increasingly endangered species, the secure job, and the effect that the current culture of corporate layoffs is having on ordinary men and women.
 He said he was surprised, as he did the reporting for the book, by the extensive emotional fallout that accompanies layoffs. ''There's a lot of mental health damage,'' he said. ''The act of being laid off is such a blow to the self-esteem. Layoffs are a national phenomenon, a societal problem -- but the laid-off workers blame themselves.''
 In addition to being financially strapped, laid-off workers and their families are often emotionally strapped as well. Common problems include depression, domestic strife and divorce. 
 Mr. Uchitelle's thesis is that corporate layoffs have been carried much too far, that they have gone beyond a legitimate and necessary response to a changing economy.
 ''What started as a necessary response to the intrusion of foreign manufacturers into the American marketplace got out of hand,'' he writes. ''By the late 1990's, getting rid of workers had become normal practice, ingrained behavior, just as job security had been 25 years earlier.''
 In many cases, a thousand workers were fired when 500 might have been sufficient, or 10,000 were let go when 5,000 would have been enough. We pay a price for these excesses. The losses that accrue to companies and communities when many years of improving skills and valuable experience are casually and unnecessarily tossed on a scrap heap are incalculable.
 ''The majority of the people who are laid off,'' said Mr. Uchitelle, ''end up in jobs that pay significantly less than they earned before, or they drop out altogether.''
 At the heart of the layoff phenomenon is the myth, endlessly repeated by corporate leaders and politicians of both parties, that workers who are thrown out of their jobs can save themselves, can latch onto spiffy new jobs by becoming better educated and acquiring new skills.
 ''Education and training create the jobs, according to this way of thinking,'' writes Mr. Uchitelle. ''Or, put another way, a job materializes for every trained or educated worker, a job commensurate with his or her skills, for which he or she is appropriately paid.''
 That is just not so, and the corporate and political elite need to stop feeding that bogus line to the public.
 There is no doubt that the better-educated and better-trained get better jobs. But the reality is that there are not enough good jobs currently available to meet the demand of college-educated and well-trained workers in the United States, which is why so many are working in jobs for which they are overqualified.
 A chapter in ''The Disposable American'' details the plight of exquisitely trained airline mechanics who found themselves laid off from jobs that had paid up to $31 an hour. Mr. Uchitelle writes: ''Not enough jobs exist at $31 an hour -- or at $16 an hour, for that matter -- to meet the demand for them. Jobs just don't materialize at cost-conscious companies to absorb all the qualified people who want them.''
 The most provocative question raised by Mr. Uchitelle is whether the private sector is capable of generating enough good jobs at good pay to meet the demand of everyone who is qualified and wants to work.
 If it cannot (and so far it has not), then what? If education and training are not the building blocks to solid employment, what is? These are public policy questions of the highest importance, and so far they are being ignored.

HEADLINE: Why American College Students Hate Science 

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, opened for business in a former cow pasture not far from downtown just 40 years ago. Still in its infancy as universities go, U.M.B.C. is less well known than Maryland's venerable flagship campus at College Park or the blue-blooded giant Johns Hopkins. But the upstart campus in the pasture is rocking the house when it comes to the increasingly critical mission of turning American college students into scientists.
 A study of the university's science program published in the March 31 issue of the journal Science sets forth an eye-opening recipe for remaking science education in America generally -- and in particular, for increasing minority participation, which lags even after decades of federally supported initiatives. 
 But following U.M.B.C.'s blueprint won't be easy. Among other things, it will require the scientific establishment to rethink its approach to teaching from the ground up.
 Science education in this country faces two serious problems. The first is that too few Americans perform at the highest level in science, compared with our competitors abroad. The second problem is that large numbers of aspiring science majors, perhaps as many as half, are turned off by unimaginative teaching and migrate to other disciplines before graduating. 
 The science establishment explains these defections as part of a natural ''weeding out'' -- a view flatly rejected by U.M.B.C. and a few other campuses where administrators are getting top performance from students who would ordinarily have become demoralized and jumped ship. 
 Initiated in 1989, U.M.B.C.'s Meyerhoff Scholars Program is so well known that the university no longer needs to recruit for it. High school counselors and teachers nominate about 1,900 students annually, mostly from Maryland, for merit-based scholarships. About 100 scholarships are offered, and of these about 50 are accepted. The new students are welcomed into a well-established community of scientists and scientists-to-be through a summer program that sets the stage for the next four years. 
 The students are encouraged to study in groups and taught to solve complex problems collectively, as teams of scientists do. Most important, they are quickly exposed to cutting-edge science in laboratory settings, which demystifies the profession and gives them early access to work that often leads to early publication in scientific journals. At the same time, however, the students are pushed to perform at the highest level. Those who earn C's, for example, are encouraged to repeat those courses so they can master basic concepts before moving on. 
 The laboratory approach keeps the students excited and prevents them from drifting off into less challenging disciplines. Indeed, according to Science, 86 percent of the Meyerhoff participants have graduated with science or engineering degrees. Nearly 9 in 10 of those graduates went on to graduate or professional programs, with a significant number earning M.D.'s or Ph.D's, or both.
 Critics have sometimes accused the Meyerhoff program of cherry-picking bright students who would perform spectacularly well wherever they went to school. But the numbers suggest that the school's instructional strategy makes a real difference. Meyerhoff students are twice as likely to earn undergraduate degrees in science or engineering as similar students who declined the scholarships and went to school elsewhere. Most significantly, students who completed the Meyerhoff program are 5.3 times as likely to enroll in graduate study as the students who said no and went elsewhere. 
 The higher education establishment is generally startled to learn that more than half of the high-flying Meyerhoff students are black. This surprise stems from the unstated but nonetheless well-established belief that high-performing science students don't actually exist in the black community. 
 U.M.B.C.'s president, Freeman Hrabowski III, knows better. He has spent years expanding his school's access to high-performing minority students and has taken great pains to reassure black families that their children will be well looked after on his campus. 
 It has long been known that teachers' low expectations, particularly those related to race and racism, can depress student performance. At U.M.B.C., sustained success by minority students seems to have alleviated this poisonous problem. Faculty members who once looked askance when asked to take on minority students in their laboratories now clamor for them. 
 Off campus, meanwhile, the students are much sought after as research assistants and as candidates for summer internships. Those who finish their education and take their places in the ranks of researchers and professors often become powerful proselytizers for science. 
 The Meyerhoff model shows that a vibrant, well-structured science program can produce large numbers of students who excel and remain in the field. It has also debunked the myth that academic excellence and minority access are mutually exclusive goals. 
 The university community needs to absorb these lessons quickly, so the country can begin to train scientists in the numbers that it clearly needs. Without them, America is unlikely to preserve its privileged position in an increasingly competitive and science-based global economy.

HEADLINE: Delays and Higher Costs Expected for Xanadu

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 24 

 BODY:
The developer building the sprawling Xanadu shopping and entertainment complex at the Meadowlands has acknowledged that the project will take longer, cost more and earn less money than originally projected, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 That disclosure -- which comes as the developer, the Mills Corporation, is being pressured by lenders who want to force a sale of the company or its most important assets -- rekindled fears on Wednesday that New Jersey may be spending hundreds of millions in tax dollars to provide infrastructure improvements for what could turn out to be little more than a shopping mall.
But Mills executives and state officials say that there are no plans to curtail construction of the elaborate assortment of entertainment and extreme sports facilities intended to make the complex as much of a tourist destination as a shopping center.
 Mills, based in Arlington, Va., won the right to develop the coveted 104-acre site in East Rutherford by proposing an ambitious complex: retail stores surrounded by a hotel, office space and an assortment of indoor recreational facilities like a trout stream, a surfing wave and a ski slope.
 Construction began in 2004, but in recent months Mills has faced an assortment of financial and legal problems, including shareholder lawsuits, an investigation by the S.E.C. and demands from creditors that the company be sold. As the price of the stock dropped -- in eight months, Mills fell to below $27 a share from higher than $66 a share, closing on Wednesday at $30.70 -- the company fired top executives, slashed its work force and abandoned 10 other projects.
 In its filing with the S.E.C., the company said that Xanadu's opening would be delayed six months to a year beyond the recently announced date of the fall of 2007, and its cost would be higher than anticipated.
 David Douglass, a spokesman for the company, said Mills remained committed to building the snow dome and other entertainment parts of the project, though the company had previously said that plans for a mile-long roller coaster and go-cart track had been abandoned.
 Carl J. Goldberg, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority, said he had been assured that Mills has no intention of trying to renege on its commitment to build the more distinctive but less profitable recreational parts of Xanadu.
 ''There's been no conversation whatsoever that they have any intent to in any way materially change the scope of the project from the approved plan,'' Mr. Goldberg said.
 Mills officials declined to provide an estimate of the expected cost overruns for Xanadu, which was originally projected at $1.2 billion. But Rich Moore, a financial analyst for RBC Capital, said that despite its recent problems, he upgraded his assessment of Mills because the company's record had convinced him that Xanadu would be built as planned.
 The Xanadu project dates to the administration of Gov. James E. McGreevey. As part of the deal with Mills, the state promised utilities and road improvements, a new rail spur to the sports complex, tax exemptions, economic development grants and more, at a cost that could reach $1 billion.
 Robert Sommer, a spokesman for the Xanadu project, said that Mills had already invested hundreds of millions of dollars, including $160 million in rent paid to the state, and intends to see it completed as planned.

HEADLINE: Some in Mexico See Border Wall As Opportunity 

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 24 

 BODY:
To build, or not to build, a border of walls? The debate in the United States has started some Mexicans thinking it is not such a bad idea.
 Nationalist outrage and accusations of hypocrisy over the prospect have filled airwaves and front pages in Mexico, as expected, fueled by presidential campaigns in which appeals to national pride are in no short supply. But, surprisingly, another view is gaining traction: that good fences can make good neighbors.
The clamorous debate over a border wall has confronted President Vicente Fox of Mexico at every stop during a visit to the United States that began Tuesday. While he did not publicly endorse the idea, he made clear that his government was prepared to live with increased border security as long as it comes with measures that opened legal channels for the migration of Mexican workers. 
 Outside his government, several immigration experts have even begun floating the idea that real walls, not the porous ones that stand today, could be more an opportunity than an attack. 
 A wall could dissuade illegal immigrants from their perilous journeys across the Sonora Desert and force societies on both sides to confront their dependence on an industry characterized by exploitation, they say.
 The old blame game -- in which Mexico attributed illegal migration to the voracious American demand for labor and accused lawmakers of xenophobia -- has given way to a far more soul-searching discussion, at least in quarters where policies are made and influenced, about how little Mexico has done to try to keep its people home. 
 ''For too long, Mexico has boasted about immigrants leaving, calling them national heroes, instead of describing them as actors in a national tragedy,'' said Jorge Santibanez, president of the College of the Northern Border. ''And it has boasted about the growth in remittances'' -- the money immigrants send home -- ''as an indicator of success, when it is really an indicator of failure.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. Fox -- who five years ago challenged the United States to follow Europe's example and open the borders and then barely protested when President Bush announced plans to deploy troops -- personifies Mexico's evolving, often contradictory attitudes on illegal immigration.
 Gabriel Guerra, a political analyst, said the presidential election in July and the negotiations over immigration reform in Washington have put Mr. Fox on unsteady political terrain. 
 Toning down his country's opposition to a wall might be the best way for Mr. Fox to convince conservatives in Congress to adopt reforms to legalize the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the United States and expand guest worker programs. 
 On the other hand, bowing to what critics have described as a ''militarization of the border,'' without winning legalization programs, could open Mr. Fox to criticism that he surrenders to the will of the United States. It could also hurt the aspirations of Felipe Calderon, the candidate Mr. Fox supports to succeed him in the July 2 election.
 ''This is a very risky trip,'' Mr. Guerra said. ''If he comes out too strong, he will rattle the conservatives up there. And if he is not strong enough, he will be clobbered by his opponents here.''
 ''Whatever the discourse, it's going to be hard to get it right,'' Mr. Guerra said. ''I think we might be better served by quiet diplomacy.''
 Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Geronimo Gutierrez acknowledged the challenge facing the president. ''We are in the middle of a Ping-Pong of reactions that reflect valid concerns on both sides of the border, as well as an unusually complex moment in the bilateral relationship,'' he said.
 Mr. Fox stepped into the middle of the game on Tuesday, beginning a sweep through Utah, Washington and California, states that have become important trading partners to Mexico and that have experienced both the pains and benefits of illegal immigration. 
 In Utah, where officials estimate that the illegal immigrant population has tripled since 1990, to 90,000, smatterings of protesters followed Mr. Fox's visit to Salt Lake City. ''Take care of your own people, so they don't have to come here,'' some shouted.
 Wary of inflaming the passions of American conservatives as the United States Senate winds down debate over immigration reform, Mr. Fox did not respond directly to the attacks. But he did have his say. 
 In his public remarks in Utah, he recognized that Mexico must do more to create jobs ''so migration becomes a decision and not a necessity,'' and he conceded that it was the right of the United States to take steps to fortify its borders.
 But, he said, it would take more than police enforcement to really resolve the challenges of illegal immigration. ''A comprehensive reform,'' Mr. Fox said, ''will help both our countries concentrate our forces and resources in tending to our security and prosperity concerns.''
 Analysts said it was unlikely that Mr. Fox would ever speak publicly in favor of a wall. But in recent communications to Washington, his government, as well as leaders of all Mexican political parties, have hinted about building walls of their own.
 Last March, in a document published in three of America's largest daily newspapers, including The New York Times, the Mexican government, along with leaders of the political establishment and business community, explained its position on immigration reform.
 In that document, the Fox government said that if the United States committed itself to establishing legal channels for the flow of immigrant workers, Mexico would take new steps to keep its people from leaving illegally. 
 ''If a guest country offers a sufficient number of appropriate visas to cover the largest possible number of workers and their families,'' the document read, ''Mexico should be responsible for guaranteeing that each person who decides to leave does so following legal channels.''
 In a column in the Mexican newspaper Reforma, Jorge G. Castaneda, a former foreign minister, suggested a ''series of incentives,'' rather than law enforcement strategies to keep Mexicans from migrating. They included welfare benefits to mothers whose husbands remained in Mexico, scholarships for high school students with both parents at home, and the loss of land rights for people who were absent from their property for extended periods of time.
 ''None of this is inevitable or desirable,'' Mr. Castaneda wrote. ''Nor is it written that this would necessarily produce a quid pro quo with the United States.
 ''But the elites here should reflect on this matter,'' he went on, ''whether we want something in exchange for nothing?''
 There are, of course, still many people in Mexico who staunchly oppose the idea of walls. Senator Sylvia Hernandez, head of the Senate Foreign Relations Commission for North America, summed up those feelings, saying: ''Walls do not speak of dialogue. They speak of closure.'' Rafael Fernandez de Castro, editor of the magazine Foreign Affairs en Espanol, said, ''We are getting the stick, but not the carrot.''
 The presidential candidates have also hewed closely to the old script.
 ''The more walls they build,'' said Mr. Calderon, of the conservative National Action Party, ''the more walls we will jump.'' Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, of the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party, called Mr. Fox a ''puppet'' of the United States for his tepid response to the planned deployment of troops along the border.
 Still, signs ofa slow but steady change in attitudes emerge in the most improbable places.
 ''It's fantastic,'' said Primitivo Rodriguez, an immigrant activist in Mexico, when asked about plans to build walls. ''It's the best thing that could happen for migrants, and for Mexico.''
 Mr. Rodriguez, who has served as an adviser to the Mexican government and an organizer in the United States for the American Friends Service Committee, said the porous border had for years been an important safety valve of stability for Mexico's economy, allowing elected officials to avoid creating jobs and even taking legal measures to stop the migration of an estimated 500,000 or more Mexicans a year.
 Government reports indicate that the Mexican economy has created about one-tenth of the one million jobs it needs to accommodate that country's growing labor force. Meanwhile, remittances from immigrants -- estimated last year at about $20 billion -- have grown larger than some state and municipal budgets. 
 If Mexicans were really shut inside their country, Mr. Rodriguez said, Mexico might be forced to get its own house in order.
 And if illegal workers were shut inside the United States, Mr. Rodriguez said, the United States might be forced to give them greater legal rights and pay the real value of their labor.
 ''Until now,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, ''the policy of the United States has not been to close the border to illegal migration, but to detour it. And by detouring it they have caused unprecedented levels of death, abuse and organized crime.''

HEADLINE: Rice's Deputy Intends to Resign, Aides Say

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
Robert B. Zoellick intends to resign as deputy secretary of state, the department's second in command, after barely 15 months in the job, aides and associates said Wednesday. 
 From his first days at the State Department, Mr. Zoellick has chafed at his subordinate position, frequently remarking that he was finding the adjustment difficult after running his own office during four years as United States trade representative, which is a cabinet position.
In addition, friends said, Mr. Zoellick had at times felt marginalized at the State Department, where his subordinates, including R. Nicholas Burns, an under secretary of state, manage most of the major issues, including matters related to Iran, Iraq, the rest of the Middle East and North Korea. 
 Mr. Burns would be the logical front-runner to take Mr. Zoellick's job, but State Department aides said Robert M. Kimmitt, the deputy Treasury secretary, was also under consideration. Still, a senior State Department official said there had been no serious discussions about finding a replacement for Mr. Zoellick because he had not officially resigned. 
 Mr. Zoellick declined to comment. Those close to him would speak only anonymously because no announcement had been made about his future.
 When asked about Mr. Zoellick during a news conference on Wednesday, Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said Mr. Zoellick had taken part in morning meetings on Wednesday ''and has a long to-do list.''
 ''He has a full schedule,'' he added. 
 Aides noted that Mr. Zoellick could still change his mind. He has told associates he would like to be Treasury secretary and would probably stay in the administration if given that job -- if Treasury Secretary John W. Snow resigns.
 Within the State Department, however, it is common knowledge that Mr. Zoellick has been talking to investment banks on Wall Street in recent weeks and is expected to take a job there. He worked for Goldman Sachs during the Clinton administration. 
 The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Bloomberg News Service first reported Tuesday night that Mr. Zoellick was looking for a new job.
 A State Department official noted that Mr. Zoellick was one of the last senior officials still in office among a group that had served in the Bush administration for the past six years, so it should not be surprising that he is leaving now. 
 Early last year, Mr. Zoellick was a front-runner to become president of the World Bank, but senior officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, pressed him to take the deputy's job under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Mr. Zoellick agreed, but expressed misgivings from the start about leaving the cabinet. 
 As deputy secretary, Mr. Zoellick has been the primary architect of the administration's policy toward Sudan, and particularly the response to the carnage in Darfur. He was instrumental in pushing Darfur's rebel leaders to sign a peace accord two weeks ago. 
 Mr. Zoellick was also asked last year to be the American representative at what China and the United States called ''strategic dialogue'' meetings. He publicly urged China in September to become a ''responsible stakeholder'' in its business dealings around the world.

HEADLINE: The Persian Complex

BYLINE: By Abbas Amanat. 
Abbas Amanat is a professor of history at Yale and author of the forthcoming ''In Search of Modern Iran.''

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
IT is easy to label Iran's quest for nuclear energy a dangerous adventure with grave regional and international repercussions. It is also comforting to heap scorn on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for his earlier denial of the Holocaust and his odious call for the obliteration of the state of Israel. The rambling intransigence expressed in his recent letter to President Bush offers ample insight into this twisted mindset. Yet there is something deeper in Iran's story than the extremist utterances of a messianic president and the calculated maneuvering of the hard-line clerical leadership that stands behind him. 
 We tend to forget that Iran's insistence on its sovereign right to develop nuclear power is in effect a national pursuit for empowerment, a pursuit informed by at least two centuries of military aggression, domestic meddling, skullduggery and, not least, technological denial by the West. Every schoolchild in Iran knows about the C.I.A.-sponsored 1953 coup that toppled Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. Even an Iranian with little interest in his or her past is conscious of how Iran throughout the 19th and 20th centuries served as a playground for the Great Game. 
Iranians also know that, hard as it may be for latter-day Americans and Europeans to believe, from the 1870's to the 1920's Russia and Britain deprived Iran of even basic technology like the railroad, which was then a key to economic development. At various times, both powers jealously opposed a trans-Iranian railroad because they thought it would threaten their ever-expanding imperial frontiers. When it was finally built, the British, Russian (and American) occupying forces during the Second World War made full use of it (free of charge), calling Iran a ''bridge of victory'' over Nazi Germany. They did so, of course, after Winston Churchill forced the man who built the railroad, Reza Shah Pahlavi, to abdicate and unceremoniously kicked him out of the country. 
 Not long after, a similar Western denial of Iran's economic sovereignty resulted in a dramatic showdown that had fatal consequences for the country's fragile democracy and left lasting scars on its national consciousness. The oil nationalization movement of 1951 to 1953 under Mossadegh was opposed by Britain, and eventually by its partner in profit, the United States, with the same self-righteousness that today colors their views of the Iranian yearning for nuclear energy. 
 Mossadegh was tried and sent into internal exile and Mohammed Reza Shah was reinstalled largely to safeguard American geopolitical interests and with little regard for the wishes of the Iranian people. A quarter-century later, Americans were ''taken by surprise'' when an Islamic revolution toppled the shah and transformed a country that seemed so friendly to the United States. But if Americans suffered from historical amnesia, for many Iranians, among them Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the thread of memory led clearly from the Great Game to the Great Satan. 
 For a country like the United States that is built on paradigms of progress and pragmatism, grasping the mythical and psychological dimensions of defeat and deprivation at the hands of foreigners is difficult. Yet the Iranian collective memory is infused with such themes. Since the early 18th century, Iran has been involved in four devastating civil wars. America's own highly traumatic Civil War was, notwithstanding Britain's sympathy for the South, a largely domestic affair. In the civil wars that Iran endured, however, the Turks, Afghans, Russians and British played major parts. And before the arrival of Western powers, Iranians held bitter memories of the Ottomans, the Mongols and the Arabs. 
 These intrusions punctuated the Iranians' modern historical narrative with conspiratorial fears and have helped to nurture a cult of the fallen hero, from the 1910's guerrilla leader Mirza Kuchak Khan to Amir Kabir, a 19th-century reformist prime minister, and later Mossadegh. Such painful collective memories have made Iran's pursuit of nuclear energy a national symbol of defiance that has transcended the motives of the current Islamic regime.
 If the United States resorts to sanctions, or worse, to some military response, the outcome would be not only disastrous but, in the long run, transient. Just as the West did with Iran's railroad and oil industry, it can for a time deny Iran nuclear technology, but it cannot wipe out Iranians' haunting memories. And no doubt the Islamic regime will amply exploit these collective memories to advance its nuclear program even as it stifles voices of domestic dissent. Even more than before, Iranians will blame outside powers for their misfortunes and choose not to focus on their own troubled road to modernity. 
 If that course continues, Iran will most likely succeed, for ill or for good, in finding its own nuclear holy grail. Legend has it that the Persian king Hushang, an equivalent of Prometheus, introduced fire to the Iranians. But unlike his Greek mythological counterpart, who stole it from gods, he accidentally discovered it while fighting with a dragon.

HEADLINE: The Return of Martha Stewart, the Civil Case 

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A year after her release from prison, her carefully executed makeover complete, Martha Stewart must now confront again the insider trading accusations that turned her world upside down. 
 The three-year-old civil case against her is resuming. Contesting the Securities and Exchange Commission accusations, as opposed to a negotiated settlement, would help give Ms. Stewart the opportunity to not only clear her name but also to win back her title as chairwoman and chief executive of the company she founded, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.
If she loses, the burden will not be onerous. She could certainly afford any financial penalty and while she no longer serves on the board, her current role as editorial director gives her considerable influence. 
 All the same, a trial of the S.E.C. lawsuit could be another embarrassing blow not only to Ms. Stewart's image but to the fortunes of her company. 
 Today, Ms. Stewart faces a deadline to respond to charges that she illegally used nonpublic information when she sold 4,000 shares of ImClone Systems in late 2001. 
 A last-minute settlement is always possible. However, if she denies the allegations and asserts her innocence, which she has done from the outset, then preparations for a civil trial, starting most crucially with her deposition, will begin. Ms. Stewart could also refuse to answer by asserting her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, according to lawyers involved in the case. Lawyers for Ms. Stewart and the S.E.C. remain locked in negotiations.
 Peter E. Bacanovic, the former Merrill Lynch broker who, regulators contend, fed Ms. Stewart privileged information that other large investors were selling their ImClone shares, is on the verge of reaching an agreement with the S.E.C. that would bar him from the securities industry, according to people briefed on the discussions. Richard M. Strassberg, a lawyer for Mr. Bacanovic, declined to comment.
 But the stakes are much higher for Ms. Stewart, who along with Mr. Bacanovic was convicted of having obstructed the original investigation into her sale of ImClone shares. 
 Ms. Stewart has seen her status as America's most popular taste maker reach new heights. She is ever more of a multimedia celebrity; revenues at her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, continue to grow; and as founding editorial director, she earned close to $2 million in salary and perks last year. Bringing up a scandal that she has worked hard to overcome could rattle investors and encourage lawsuits. 
 Ms. Stewart could decide to reach an agreement with regulators at any time during preparations for trial in the coming months. Dennis J. Block, a well-known securities lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, who is currently representing Ms. Stewart, did not return calls seeking comment.
 But last month, at a conference before Judge Richard J. Holwell of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for Ms. Stewart suggested that they might want to contest the insider trading charges brought by the S.E.C. 
 ''We think the case may very well be ripe for summary judgment on the pure legal issues of the S.E.C.'s claims of insider trading, which we think are fairly novel claims,'' said Martin Seidel, a lawyer for Cadwalader, according to a transcript of the proceedings.
 Mark K. Schonfeld, the director of the S.E.C.'s Northeast regional office, said, ''Now that the criminal appeals have been exhausted and the court has granted our request to proceed with our civil action, we look forward to presenting our insider trading case.''
 As part of its original complaint, the commission asked that Ms. Stewart be barred from serving as a director of a public company and be limited in any executive capacity. She consequently stepped down from the board and her position as chief executive.
 In her current role as founding editorial director of Martha Stewart Living, she involves herself in all aspects of the business, from the picayune to the grand. It is unlikely that Ms. Stewart would have to end this role at the company, whatever the outcome of the S.E.C. case, people involved in the discussions said. They explained that such a removal would be seen as imposing an unfair punishment on Martha Stewart Living's shareholders. 
 Shares of Martha Stewart Living closed yesterday at $17, down from their high of $35 in early 2005.
 That Mr. Bacanovic and Ms. Stewart seem likely to finally be going their separate ways, having until now survived such a brutal legal gantlet together, underscores the sharp divergence of their public paths since they left prison last year.
 While Ms. Stewart emerged from jail to a heroine's welcome, Mr. Bacanovic has lived a less glamorous existence, ducking the prying eye of the city's gossip pages and splitting time between Los Angeles and New York. He has been unemployed for four years and must now scramble to pay his legal bills; Merrill Lynch has indicated that it will stop paying his legal expenses and will not pay whatever fine the S.E.C. imposes. The maximum amount is $200,000, or approximately three times the gains that Ms. Stewart made when she sold her shares.
 The civil case against Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic involves Samuel D. Waksal, a client of Merrill Lynch and a friend of Ms. Stewart. The complaint contends that when Mr. Bacanovic learned that Mr. Waksal was selling stock in ImClone, the company he founded, Mr. Bacanovic asked his assistant to inform Ms. Stewart, who promptly sold her small stake for $45,000 in profits. 
 The S.E.C. says that this information was not public and that trading on it was illegal. During a series of lengthy interviews with regulators, Mr. Bacanovic and Ms. Stewart asserted they had made a previous agreement to sell the stock at $60 a share. 
 During the criminal trial, however, federal prosecutors in Manhattan argued that such an agreement was concocted by the two of them to avoid the insider trading accusations. 
 During the criminal trial, which focused on the accusations of a cover-up and not the trades itself, the civil case was frozen and it was not until last month that the stay was lifted, allowing regulators to pursue the original claim. 
 If Ms. Stewart chooses not to settle by the end of today, she will be required to sit for a deposition that could put her in a precarious legal position. She could repeat the original story, despite a jury's having reached the conclusion that no such agreement existed. Or she could claim that there was nothing illegal with the trade in the first place. She could also invoke her Fifth Amendment right and not testify. 
 Such a strategy, however, has its risks, as a judge in a civil case can instruct a jury to draw an adverse inference of liability from Ms. Stewart's refusal to testify. 
 Defenders of Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic have long argued that the information that she traded on was not illegal in that it did not come from an insider. However, her ability to persuade a jury may be marred by her criminal conviction. 
 ''Even if she has a good argument on the charges, a jury may find that a conviction for perjury may be enough to bar her from being an officer or a director,'' said Robert G. Heim, a former lawyer for the S.E.C.

HEALTH CLAIM CHECKUP The claims-processing company Athenahealth plans to present a rare warts-and-all look at how well -- or not -- the nation's seven biggest health insurers pay their bills. [Page C1.] 


VONAGE'S TOUGH RECEPTION In their first day of trading, shares in Vonage, the country's leading Internet phone provider, fell nearly 13 percent below the initial offering price.

TASERS UNDER SCRUTINY The safety of Tasers, the electric pistols widely used by police, is under new scrutiny after a study by a Wisconsin scientist showed that shocks from the guns cause the hearts of healthy pigs to stop beating. Previous studies showed that Taser shocks did not cause heart disturbances in pigs, whose hearts are similar to those of humans. [C3.]

WYETH ADDS TO FEN-PHEN FUND Wyeth won final judicial approval to add $1.3 billion to a $3.75 billion settlement of lawsuits over the fen-phen diet drug combination. The extra money will help settle about 42,000 pending claims, the company said. Wyeth withdrew Pondimin and Redux, part of the fen-phen combination, in 1997 after researchers linked them to heart and lung problems in some users. [C3.]

OFFICIAL'S PLANS Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative, intends to resign as deputy secretary of state after barely 15 months in the job, aides and associates said. He has told associates he would like to be Treasury secretary if John W. Snow resigns. [A14.]

CBS-STERN SETTLEMENT CBS Radio has settled its breach-of-contract lawsuit with the talk-show host Howard Stern, the judge presiding over the case said, but lawyers on both sides said the agreement had not yet been signed.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Another Rate Increase 

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada has raised its main interest rate for the seventh time and has indicated that it would pause after the biggest cumulative rate rise since 1997-98. The increase brings the target rate for overnight loans between banks to 4.25 percent, the highest since August 2001, and narrows the gap with the 5 percent rate for federal funds in the United States. ''With today's increase, the target for the overnight rate is now at a level that is expected to keep the Canadian economy on the base-case path projected in the April monetary policy report and to return inflation to the 2 percent target,'' the central bank said.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise for First Time This Week as Oil Price Falls 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday for the first time this week after oil dropped below $70 a barrel and the government said new-home sales unexpectedly jumped in April.
 Microsoft and General Motors led the advance. Shares of Toll Brothers, the biggest American home builder, rose the most in two weeks.
Shares climbed in the last hour of trading, reversing the pattern of the last two days. A decline in Boeing and industrial shares weighed on the market for most of the day after the government said orders for aircraft and other durable goods, those made to last at least three years, fell last month by more than economists had forecast. 
 ''The inflation scare of the last two weeks is less of an issue,'' said Doug Sandler, chief equity strategist at Wachovia Securities in Richmond, Va. Investors ''should start adding to positions.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.99 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,258.57. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,117.32. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 10.41 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,169.17.
 Roughly 2.24 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the heaviest trading since September. The major indexes gained even as three stocks fell for every two that increased on the Big Board.
 Crude oil declined 2.6 percent, to $69.86 a barrel in New York, after a government report showed a larger-than-expected gain in gasoline stockpiles as imports jumped.
 Microsoft rose 71 cents, to $23.50. The company gained ground in database software sales last year over its rivals, Oracle and I.B.M., according to the research firm Gartner Inc. Gartner said Microsoft raised its market share to 15 percent, from 13.9 percent.
 G.M. surged $2.03, or 8.3 percent, to $26.51 for the top gain in the Dow average. A Merrill Lynch analyst, John Murphy, raised the shares to buy from neutral because of the company's progress on employee buyouts. G.M. wants as many as possible of its 113,000 hourly employees to leave after a $10.6 billion loss last year.
 Boeing, the world's second-largest commercial aircraft maker, after Airbus, tumbled $2.77, or 3.3 percent, to $82.38 for the biggest decline in the Dow average.
 Sales of new homes increased 4.9 percent in April to an annual rate of 1.198 million, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Toll Brothers added 66 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $28.01.
 Gilead Sciences, Generex Biotechnology and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals were among biopharmaceutical companies that gained after the World Health Organization said seven Indonesians might have contracted bird flu from humans.
 W.H.O. officials do not have immediate plans to raise the alert level for a possible avian influenza pandemic because the health agency lacks evidence that bird flu is becoming more contagious among people, a spokeswoman, Maria Cheng, said.
 Gilead added $1.73, to $55.50. Generex jumped 19 cents, to $2.03. BioCryst surged $1.15, to $12.95.
 Vonage Holdings fell $2.15, to $14.85. Shares of the money-losing pioneer in Internet phone service began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company raised $531.3 million in an initial public offering.
 XM Satellite Radio Holdings, the biggest United States pay-radio provider, dropped $1.76, to $13.75, after the company cut its customer forecast. XM expects to end 2006 with 8.5 million subscribers, lower than the previous prediction of 9 million.
 Sirius Satellite Radio, its rival, fell 22 cents, to $3.68.
 In the bond market, prices of Treasuries securities fell, snapping a four-day rally, after the increase in new-home sales curbed expectations that the economy would slow. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 0.02 percentage point, to 5.04 percent. The price fell 4/32, to 100 22/32. The yield moves inversely to the note's price.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: Looking for Mao? Try a Trinket Site, Not the Yangtze

BYLINE: By Michelle Slatalla. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THERE are few things I don't like about overseas travel other than realizing, as the plane lifts off for a 13-hour flight, that the best movie they're showing in economy is ''Big Momma's House 2.'' 
 During a trip to China earlier this month, I didn't mind the jet lag, the 15-hour time difference or even the time I went out and forgot the Beijing street map in the hotel room.
But there's one thing I really hate, and that is when my husband turns out to know more about shopping than I do.
 It happened at the huge Panjiayuan buyer-beware flea market in Beijing, which collectors haunt at sunrise and where tourists troll for trinkets all day long. As far as we could see were aisles of brass Buddhas, piles of glass beads, old typewriters, bolts of silk, dusty framed photographs, strands of pearls and yellowed posters from the Cultural Revolution. 
 My husband homed in on a shelf of kitschy porcelain statues.
 ''I love this,'' he said, pointing to a foot-tall statue of two peasants riding a shiny silver rocket. One peasant held a scroll inscribed with a proclamation that translated, roughly, as, ''China will exceed the United States and the United Kingdom.''
 Too me it looked tacky. ''You can't be serious,'' I said, eyeing the statue's garish colors. 
 ''And this one,'' he said, pointing to a statue of Mao Zedong waving to a crowd from a sedan.
 The seller wanted 300 yuan (about $37) for the Mao statue and 200 yuan (about $24) for the rocket.
 ''Just get one,'' I pleaded.
 ''You'll regret it,'' my husband said, buying Mao.
 ''I will not regret it,'' I said.
 Two days later, I regretted it. It's funny how something that looks common amid the clutter of a giant flea market can be transformed into something that looks striking in a different context like, say, sitting on a coffee table in northern California. 
 Now I loved that statue and wished I had another one, too. And I had a lot of questions. What was the history of these unusual pieces that evoked the Cultural Revolution? And where could I get my hands on that rocket?
 I turned to the Internet for answers. And that's where I learned, almost faster than I could type the keyword query ''porcelain Mao in car,'' that my husband has a better eye for a story than I do.
 These days, I learned, all kinds of memorabilia from the Cultural Revolution have become highly collectible; in addition to porcelain statues, the category includes vintage posters and ticking Mao mantel clocks. And you don't have to travel to the Panjiayuan flea market to shop. 
 At Culturegems.com, I saw Mao's face painted on a porcelain disk ($160). Artelino.com, an online auction site, sells Chinese propaganda posters. At www.Easterncurio.com, I even saw the same statue of Mao in a car, described as Item No. D1S0041. ''Write to Eastern Curio Shanghai Ltd. or call 0086-13621990301 for further enquire,'' the site instructed.
 I sent an e-mail message. ''Can you tell me how old it is and how much it costs?'' I wrote. The response was quick, but a little vague: 1968 and $195, plus unspecified shipping costs to the United States.
 Then I stumbled across the site of a dealer named Victoria Edison, 1930shanghai.com; her large selection of memorabilia included Mao on a dinner plate ($25). As I browsed through pictures -- Mao on an ashtray ($20) and Mao on a jewelry box ($25) -- I came across an item that made me wince.
 I clicked for a bigger image and saw another porcelain statue of peasants on a rocket that looked just like the one we could have bought for $24 in Beijing.
 The price was $209.
 Cursing, I phoned Mrs. Edison, whose store is in Berkeley, Calif., near my house.
 ''It's a very well-known piece,'' said Mrs. Edison, who with her husband, James, wrote the book ''Cultural Revolution Posters & Memorabilia'' (Schiffer, 2005). ''When we were approached to do the book, at that time we were selling primarily to Europe, but now the trend has made its way to the U.S.''
 Mrs. Edison, whose parents and grandparents lived through the Cultural Revolution, said she grew curious about memorabilia from that era during a trip to China in the early 1990's.
 ''I was interested because my folks went through it, my grandfather was in jail during that period for merely having a brother who went to Taiwan,'' she said. ''I was in China and browsing in the same flea market you did, where I saw posters. I thought, 'Wow.' ''
 I asked, ''Why don't people think there's something unseemly about collecting relics from an era that brought so many people so much pain?''
 Mrs. Edison said: ''I don't think people collect Mao because he's cool, because everyone who went through that period thinks he was crazy and power hungry. But the pieces represent the people, too, and what they went through and what they were like. My grandfather finds this fascinating. By talking about it, we won't forget history.''
 In the 1960's, millions of porcelain pieces were made for export in provincial ceramic factories. 
 The intended market was countries friendly to China and people who had left the mainland, Mrs. Edison said. ''There were two industries that were able to flourish when other businesses were shut down. Ceramics factories and printing companies flourished because they made propaganda materials.''
 I told her my husband bought Mao in a car at the flea market.
 ''The car piece is considered one of the best pieces of that period,'' she said. ''But there are a lot of reproductions, and it's almost impossible to tell, because they're using the same molds to make them. My assumption, when I shop in China, is that it's a reproduction unless I know for sure that it was one of the pieces sitting in a warehouse that wasn't distributed during the Cultural Revolution.
 He paid about $37, I said.
 ''Probably fake, but even so, that's pretty good,'' she said. ''He must know how to bargain.''
 ''He has a good eye,'' I said. 
 Then I made an appointment to go to her shop to look at the rocket. It may be expensive, but he deserves it.

HEADLINE: High Price Of Comedy: Fox Just Says No

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 24 

 BODY:
Millions of dollars were spent, sets were ready in Santa Fe, and all was on track for production to start next month on what seemed to be a can't-lose movie for 20th Century Fox: a comedy from the reigning superstars Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller, with Jay Roach, of ''Austin Powers'' and ''Meet the Parents'' fame, as director.
 But this month Fox and its financing partner, Sony Pictures Entertainment, suddenly pulled the plug on ''Used Guys,'' a futuristic comedy about cloned men who are bought and sold like old cars, stunning the project's principals and raising a serious question: What's a good laugh worth in Hollywood these days?
 Apparently, less than $112 million. With a budget that had crept to that level, ''Used Guys'' stood to be one of the most expensive original comedies ever made. And in an industry with crushing marketing costs and top-shelf stars taking a huge chunk of every ticket sale, the studio decided the math didn't add up, to the surprise of filmmakers who were on the verge of shooting. 
 ''How could this happen? I keep asking myself that every second,'' said Mr. Roach, from the Cannes Film Festival, where he was showing another film for Fox, ''Borat.'' ''I'm trying to learn from this, and figure: how did we get this far out of sync?''
 Mickey Birnbaum, the movie's screenwriter, who stood to make millions of dollars if the movie became a success, was equally surprised. ''I'm shocked, like everybody else,'' he said. ''I've been told the party line: that budget issues are at the heart of it.'' 
 Fox executives, citing sensitivity because of other films they are making with the comedy's principals, would speak only on condition of anonymity about the project, which was poised to be a major bet for Fox in the summer of 2007. Those other films include ''A Night at the Museum,'' with Mr. Stiller, which is just completing production, and ''Borat,'' a comedy produced by Mr. Roach and starring Sacha Baron-Cohen.
 The studio's caution is symptomatic of the state of comedy in contemporary Hollywood. 
 The rise of a new network of comic stars who write, act in, direct and produce one another's projects -- also including Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Steve Carrell, Will Ferrell, Jack Black as well as the directors Tom Shadyac and David Dobkin -- has given them a power uncommon in the industry. 
 Many of those stars are represented by the management team of Jimmy Miller and Eric Gold at Mosaic Media, and the agent Nick Stevens at United Talent Agency, who often work together to package movie ideas and shop screenplays for their stable of talent. The three rarely speak to the press.
 But what a couple of years ago was a workshop turning out low-budget, high-concept comedies that made windfall profits, -- like ''Dodgeball,'' which cost $26 million and went on to make $167 million worldwide, or ''Wedding Crashers,'' directed by Mr. Dobkin, which cost about $40 million and took in $285 million worldwide -- has become a far pricier business. 
 It's not just that longtime stars like Mr. Carrey who earn $20 million a film are being kept company by Mr. Stiller, or Mr. Vaughn, whose fees now approach that range. The real problem, said executives at Fox and elsewhere, is the percentage of box office revenues that these stars now command.
 ''At an over-$100 million budget, the talent is making $60 million before the studio can recoup its costs,'' said a senior Fox executive. ''The economics on it make no sense.'' 
 Mr. Roach and executives on the project noted that, to win the studio's green light, Mr. Roach and the stars of ''Used Guys'' had already sharply cut both their upfront fees and their expected participation in revenue. Even so, executives said, the compromise meant that the three principals would take 27 percent of the studio's gross box-office revenues. 
 The project began with Mr. Birnbaum's screenplay, which was bought by Sony's Columbia Pictures unit in 1999. When Sony declined to make the movie, the project went to DreamWorks, where Mr. Stiller became involved, but ultimately that studio also passed. The project then went to Fox, with Mr. Roach signing on as director, working on the script with Mr. Stiller and others.
 They saw the movie as a multilayered comment on gender relations, and conceived of a world 150 years hence in which men make themselves obsolete ''through war and Viagra,'' as Mr. Roach put it. In that future, women rule and use cloned men for amusement. Mr. Stiller and Mr. Carrey were to play outdated models of clones, one more thoughtful, the other more exuberant. 
 A Fox executive said the shooting budget was to be $90 million; Mr. Roach and others disputed that, saying the first full budget submitted in November was $106 million. 
 The problems began in earnest about two months ago, when Fox began to question the $106 million budget. Mr. Roach said it was needed to make a satisfying film; one big cost involved designing and making a fleet of futuristic, egg-shaped cars. 
 ''I try to put layers of meaning, layers of expression that not everybody would think is necessary for comedy,'' said Mr. Roach, who will now receive no money for what he said was nine months of work on the project. ''Why comedies can't have as big budgets as action films is a long story, but evidently they can't. This is an expensive film by any standards, and I was reminded of that all along.'' 
 When various issues -- including delays in the shooting of ''A Night at the Museum'' which required Mr. Stiller's presence -- pushed the budget higher, to $112 million, Fox pressed for cuts, asking the principals to suspend their take of gross revenues until the studio would recoup its costs. Mr. Roach said he gave up two percentage points of his deal, but he could not reasonably ask the stars for further cuts. 
 ''They'd made tremendous discounts on a big-budget movie. This is not some labor-of-love thing,'' he said. ''This film is dead in our center strike zone.''
 At a meeting on May 8 with Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos, the Fox studio's co-chairmen, Mr. Roach recalled, he pleaded for the movie. ''I said, Please give me a chance. Let me do this, I'm in the business of making money for studios.''' 
 But the studio chiefs were worried that the budget was still not firm, and Mr. Carrey had a looming commitment to another movie, ''Ripley's Believe It or Not.'' ''It was a combination of uncertainty, a highly pressured schedule with no flexibility and a tremendous back-end payout,'' said a senior Fox executive, explaining the decision. ''It became a prescription for unhappiness.''

HEADLINE: Hello, Young Workers: One Way to Reach the Top Is to Start There

BYLINE: By Austan Goolsbee. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT being graduation time and all, one could almost hear the seeds of an old-style ''eat your vegetables'' commencement address growing out of Hillary Clinton's recent comments to the United States Chamber of Commerce about the need for a better work ethic among the young.
 She said that ''young people today think work is a four-letter word'' and ''think they're entitled to go right to the top with $50,000 or $75,000 jobs when they have not done anything to earn their way up.'' The remarks certainly got tongue rings wagging all over the country. Senator Clinton's own daughter, Chelsea, who earns high pay while working long hours as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company, called to object that she and her friends work hard, indeed. Mom soon apologized. 
Lost in the argument over whether young people today know how to work, however, is the mounting evidence produced by labor economists of just how important it is for current graduates to ignore the old-school advice of trying to get ahead by working one's way up the ladder. Instead, it seems, graduates should try to do exactly the thing the older generation bemoans -- aim for the top.
 The recent evidence shows quite clearly that in today's economy starting at the bottom is a recipe for being underpaid for a long time to come. Graduates' first jobs have an inordinate impact on their career path and their ''future income stream,'' as economists refer to a person's earnings over a lifetime.
 The importance of that first job for future success also means that graduates remain highly dependent on the random fluctuations of the economy, which can play a crucial role in the quality of jobs available when they get out of school. That is good news for this year's graduates, who are entering the work force with the economy growing, but rather disturbing for recent graduates who were driven by recession into taking less-than-ideal first jobs and are now aiming to work their way up.
 Consider the evidence uncovered by Paul Oyer, a Stanford Business School economist, in his recent paper, ''The Making of an Investment Banker: Macroeconomic Shocks, Career Choice and Lifetime Income'' (National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 12059, February 2006. http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/oyer/wp/mba.pdf). Dr. Oyer tracked the careers of Stanford Business School graduates in the classes of 1960 to 1997.
 He found that the performance of the stock market in the two years the students were in business school played a major role in whether they took an investment banking job upon graduating and, because such jobs pay extremely well, upon the average salary of the class. That is no surprise. The startling thing about the data was his finding that the relative income differences among classes remained, even as much as 20 years later.
 The Stanford class of 1988, for example, entered the job market just after the market crash of 1987. Banks were not hiring, and so average wages for that class were lower than for the class of 1987 or for later classes that came out after the market recovered. Even a decade or more later, the class of 1988 was still earning significantly less. They missed the plum jobs right out of the gate and never recovered.
 And as economists have looked at the economy of the last two decades, they have found that Dr. Oyer's findings hold for more than just high-end M.B.A. students on Wall Street. They are also true for college students. A recent study, by the economists Philip Oreopoulos, Till Von Wachter and Andrew Heisz, ''The Short- and Long-Term Career Effects of Graduating in a Recession'' (National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 12159, April 2006. http://www.columbia.edu/vw2112/papers/nber--draft--1.pdf), finds that the setback in earnings for college students who graduate in a recession stays with them for the next 10 years.
 These data confirm that people essentially cannot close the wage gap by working their way up the company hierarchy. While they may work their way up, the people who started above them do, too. They don't catch up. The recession graduates who actually do catch up tend to be the ones who forget about rising up the ladder and, instead, jump ship to other employers.
 Dr. Oyer himself never bought into the view that young people today are slackers. ''Kids today,'' he said in an interview, ''are harder working and more programmed than any kids in history.'' Although he is a Stanford Business School star, Dr. Oyer said, laughing, ''I don't even know if I could get into college if I were competing with kids today.''
 His research and that of other labor economists point out that hard work is not the only thing this year's graduates ought to have on their minds. But, if these findings represent the new reality of today's labor market, what remains for aspiring commencement speakers to say? Dr. Oyer's advice to the class of 2006 is not lofty: ''Try to get lucky. And also, think carefully about that first job because it can matter for the rest of your career.''
 That advice may not have the inspiring ring of commencement mainstays involving elbow grease, never quitting and paying dues, but it is worth considering. These days paying your dues may be a whole lot more expensive than you think.

HEADLINE: Australian Forces Intervene to Halt Fighting in East Timor 

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Warren Hoge contributed reporting from the United Nations for this article.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 25 

 BODY:
Several hundred Australian commandos landed Thursday in the tiny Indian Ocean nation of East Timor to try to quell escalating fighting in an ethnic dispute involving the country's armed forces and police. 
 Explosions, apparently from grenades, and widespread small-arms fighting were heard across Dili, the capital. Nine people were killed and 27 others were wounded, including two United Nations police advisers, during an attack on the national police headquarters, the United Nations said.
 By midnight, gunshots could still be heard, said an Indonesian diplomat, Budi, who spoke by telephone from his embassy. ''There is danger for everyone in Dili,'' said Mr. Budi, who uses only one name. ''We are protecting about 50 people in the embassy. They are afraid.'' 
 East Timor's foreign minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, appealed for the outside help to disarm ''renegade troops and police rebelling against the state.'' Mr. Ramos-Horta, who shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said his government could not counter a breakdown of law and order, with about 800 loyal members of the army fighting a group of about 600 rebellious soldiers. 
 An additional 1,300 Australian soldiers, as well as forces from Malaysia and Portugal, the country's former colonial power, are expected in the next several days.
 Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, dispatched a special envoy, Ian Martin, to East Timor on Thursday. Mr. Martin, the United Nations' human rights envoy to Nepal, was Mr. Annan's special representative in East Timor in 1999.
 The violence was the worst since East Timor, an extremely poor country of 800,000 people, gained independence from Indonesia four years ago after a United Nations-sponsored referendum. About 1,000 people died after the referendum as a result of violence by pro-Indonesian militias. 
 The current unrest has been simmering since earlier this year. About 600 members of the army, known as Loromonu, from the western part of the country, went on strike to protest what they contend is ethnic discrimination and a lack of promotions at the hands of the military leadership. 
 In April, the strikers were fired, and they formed a dissident group that has battled the remaining army, made up mostly of Lorosae, from the east. 
 The fighting between the groups intensified this week after many policemen of the same ethnic background as the rebellious soldiers defected to the rebel side, officials said. 
 Because of the fighting, roughly half of a contingent of about 200 Americans, mostly contractors for the United States Agency for International Development, left in the last few weeks, said a Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. All 47 Peace Corps volunteers, many of whom were stationed in remote areas, were evacuated at the beginning of May, he said. 
 The shootings outside the police headquarters on Thursday were the worst bloodshed of the conflict, the Western official said. 
 Stephane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said in New York, based on information from staff members in Dili, that after an hourlong attack at the Dili police headquarters, United Nations police and military advisers had negotiated a cease-fire that was agreed to on condition that police officers surrender their weapons and leave the headquarters unarmed. As they were being escorted out, he said, soldiers opened fire on them, killing 9 police officers and wounding 27 other people, including the 2 United Nations police advisers. 
 In the Australian Parliament, Prime Minister John Howard described the situation as ''exceptionally dangerous.'' He said Australian troops, who have helped train the East Timor armed forces, would try to separate the warring factions and disarm them. The Australians will try to create a secure enough environment to conduct a dialogue that would end the conflict, he said. 
 In a hopeful sign, the Australian commandos were warmly welcomed at the airport by women and children holding signs reading, ''Viva Australia.'' 
 Since gaining independence, East Timor has been almost totally dependent on foreign aid, and that is likely to continue for a long time, experts say. The United Nations Development Program estimates that the life expectancy in East Timor is 57 years. 
 The country, depleted of the coffee and sandalwood that once made it a small trading center, has valuable offshore reserves of natural gas. East Timor recently completed an agreement with Australia to exploit those reserves, but it is not expected to reap the benefits for years. 
 Extreme poverty, especially among young unemployed men, has encouraged the formation of gangs that have taken part in the violence.

HEADLINE: Covering a Friend's Back: Leaders Reverse the Roles

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Tony Blair has always served as the world's Bush-whisperer, but at their joint news conference last night, it was almost the reverse. Mr. Blair, the normally silver-tongued prime minister, seemed stiff and defensive, and it was Mr. Bush who tried to smooth things over and help Mr. Blair out.
 British political analysts have repeatedly predicted that Mr. Blair, a lame duck whose popularity in Britain has never been lower, will be out of office as early as next year. But when a British reporter actually suggested that this was his last official Washington visit, he looked dismayed and tongue-tied. 
Mr. Bush jumped in, saying with a laugh, ''Don't count him out, let me tell it to you that way.'' He also asked the British to give his friend another chance. ''I want him to be here so long as I'm the president.'' 
 That role reversal was as good a sign as any of how the two friends' political standing has eroded since they made the case together for war in Iraq. Last week even The Economist, a British magazine that has been more favorable to Mr. Blair than most, called his partnership with Mr. Bush the ''Axis of Feeble.''
 In the past, Mr. Blair always raced to Washington to buck up Mr. Bush with his eloquence and aplomb, spending his own political capital to enhance that of the American. Mr. Bush was obviously grateful for his ally's support, yet last night he hinted that if he had to go it alone, he could take it from here -- even in the realm of the English language.
 Asked what he most regretted, Mr. Bush replied that he was sorry he had used terms like ''bring it on'' and ''dead or alive,'' and that he had learned to express himself in a ''little more sophisticated manner.''
 It was never an even-steven friendship; Mr. Blair risked his popularity in Britain when he stood by Mr. Bush and supported the war. In return he received gratitude, but little else.
 One reason Mr. Blair's reputation is so tattered is his critics dismiss him as a poodle, doing his master's bidding. It did not help that before the war, Mr. Blair was unable to persuade his American friend to seek a second United Nations resolution authorizing military action. 
 He did not have much luck with other issues important to Europeans, from an effort to double aid to Africa to the need to take steps to avert global warming. (It probably did not help Mr. Blair's morale that ''Stuff Happens,'' a play by David Hare that focuses on the imbalance of power between the White House and 10 Downing St., is on the New York stage.)
 No one has been a better bedfellow for George Bush than Tony Blair, but last night the steadfast British prime minister tugged the covers to his side, adding his own, broader agenda to the subject at hand. 
 He spoke of ''the importance of trying to unite the international community behind an agenda that means, for example, action on global poverty in Africa, and issues like Sudan; it means a good outcome to the world trade round, which is vital for the whole of the civilized world, vital for developing countries, but also vital for countries such as ourselves; for progress in the Middle East; and for ensuring that the global values that people are actually struggling for today in Iraq are global values we take everywhere and fight for everywhere that we can in our world today.''
 Mr. Blair came to Washington to help the president, but this time, perhaps for the first time, he looked like he needed the president's help.

HEADLINE: Bush and Blair Concede Errors, But Defend War

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25 

 BODY:
President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, two leaders badly weakened by the continuing violence in Iraq, acknowledged major misjudgments in the execution of the Iraq war on Thursday night even while insisting that the election of a constitutional government in Baghdad justified their decision to go to war three years ago.
 Speaking in subdued, almost chastened, tones at a joint news conference in the East Room, the two leaders steadfastly refused to talk about a schedule for pulling troops out of Iraq -- a pressure both men are feeling intently. They stuck to a common formulation that they would pull troops out only as properly trained Iraqi troops progressively took control over more and more territory in the country. 
But in an unusual admission of a personal mistake, Mr. Bush said he regretted challenging insurgents in Iraq to ''bring it on'' in 2003, and said the same about his statement that he wanted Osama bin Laden ''dead or alive.'' Those two statements quickly came to reinforce his image around the world as a cowboy commander in chief. ''Kind of tough talk, you know, that sent the wrong signal to people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I learned some lessons about expressing myself maybe in a little more sophisticated manner.'' He went on to say that the American military's biggest mistake was the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, where photographs of detainees showed them in degrading and abusive conditions. ''We've been paying for that for a long period of time,'' Mr. Bush said, his voice heavy with regret.
 Mr. Blair, whose approval levels have sunk even lower than Mr. Bush's, said he particularly regretted the broad decision to strip most members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party of their positions in government and civic life in 2003, leaving most institutions in Iraq shorn of expertise and leadership.
 The news conference, in the formal setting of the East Room, was notable for the contrite tone of both leaders. Mr. Bush acknowledged ''a sense of consternation'' among the American people, driven by the steady drumbeat of American casualties.
 The meeting came at a low moment in Mr. Bush's presidency and Mr. Blair's prime ministership, at a time when the decisions that they made to invade Iraq and that they have defended ever since have proved a political albatross for both.
 Just as they joined in the drive to war in 2003, the two leaders on Thursday evening seemed joined by a common interest in arguing that things had finally turned around in Iraq. Mr. Blair, who was in Iraq earlier this week, ventured the closest to a prediction about a timetable for disengagement, saying that he thought it was possible that Iraq's new prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, was accurate in his prediction that Iraqi forces could control security in all of the country's provinces within 18 months. 
 But Mr. Bush quickly fell back to his familiar insistence that he would not begin a drawdown until his commanders said it was possible, and he noted that troops were recently called up from Kuwait to help stabilize Baghdad. He said that in the end he would insist on victory over both insurgents and terrorists linked to Al Qaeda, and he dismissed as ''press speculation'' reports of tentative Pentagon plans to bring American troop levels to about 100,000 by the end of this year. ''A loss in Iraq would make this world an incredibly dangerous place,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Blair had spent ''a great deal of time'' discussing their next challenge: how to put together the right mix of penalties and incentives to force Iran to suspend the production of uranium and give up a program that both men had said clearly pointed to a desire to build a nuclear bomb.
 Mr. Bush bristled at a question about whether he had ''ignored back-channel overtures'' from the Iranians over possible talks about their nuclear program. Mr. Bush said that ''the Iranians walked away from the table'' in discussions with three European nations, and that a letter sent to him by Iran's president ''didn't address the issue of whether or not they're going to continue to press for a nuclear weapon.'' Some in the State Department and even some of Mr. Bush's outside foreign policy advisers have said that Mr. Bush missed a diplomatic opening by deciding not to respond to the letter, though others say it is still not too late.
 But the overwhelming sense from the news conference was of two battered leaders who, once confident in their judgments on Iraq, now understood that misjudgments had not only affected their approval ratings, but perhaps their legacies. The British news magazine The Economist pictured the two on a recent cover under the headline ''Axis of Feeble.''
 And while both men sidestepped questions about how their approval ratings were linked to Iraq, at one point Mr. Bush seemed to try to buck up his most loyal ally, who is expected to leave office soon and may be in the midst of his last official visit to Washington, by telling a British reporter, ''Don't count him out.''
 Outside the White House gates, a smattering of protesters gathered, blowing whistles and chanting, ''Troops out now.''
 Mr. Bush called the terrorists in Iraq ''totalitarians'' and ''Islamic fascists,'' a phrase he has used periodically to give the current struggle a tinge of the last great American-British alliance, during World War II. But he acknowledged that the war in Iraq had taken a significant toll in public opinion. ''I mean, when you turn on your TV screen and see innocent people die day in and day out, it affects the mentality of our country,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 Mr. Blair tried to focus on the current moment, saying that he had heard the complaint that ''you went in with this Western concept of democracy, and you didn't understand that their whole culture was different.'' With a weak smile, he suggested to Mr. Bush that those who voted in Iraq had amounted to ''a higher turnout, I have to say -- I'm afraid to say I think -- than either your election or mine.''
 Mr. Bush did not budge from his long-stated position that conditions in Iraq and the ability of Iraqi security forces to assume greater responsibilities would dictate whether the United States reduced the 133,000 American forces there. He said he would rely on the recommendations of Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top commander in Iraq. In an effort to cajole the new government even while he was praising it, Mr. Bush twice mentioned that it had yet to appoint a defense minister with whom to discuss troop cuts, one of the glaring gaps in the Iraqi cabinet that is symbolic of the continuing struggle over power. ''We'll keep the force level there necessary to win,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 Mr. Blair acknowledged that some of the 260,000 Iraqi security forces, especially the police, suffered from corruption and the influence of militias. But he said a new Iraqi government would be more able than allied officials to cope with these problems. 
 For those who trace Mr. Bush's own reluctance to acknowledge errors in Iraq, his statements on Thursday night seemed to mark a crossing of a major threshold. In an interview with The New York Times in August 2004, Mr. Bush said that his biggest mistake in Iraq had been underestimating the speed of initial victory over Mr. Hussein's forces, which allowed Iraqi troops to melt back into the cities and towns. When pressed, he said he could think of no other errors.
 Over the winter, as public support for the war eroded, he acknowledged other mistakes -- failing to plan sufficiently for the occupation and rebuilding of the country, or to execute the plans that had been made. But he described these as tactical mistakes that had been fixed.
 His answer on Thursday evening, though, harked back to the two statements -- ''bring them on'' and ''dead or alive'' -- that his wife, Laura, had been particularly critical about. While he had apologized before for the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib, his statement on Thursday was his starkest admission to date of the damage that the episode did to the image of the United States. 
 But Mr. Bush emphasized that American soldiers had been punished for the abuses. ''Unlike Iraq, however, under Saddam, the people who committed those acts were brought to justice,'' he said. Mr. Bush's critics have noted that the prosecutions have focused on low-level soldiers and have not held senior officers accountable. 
 Mr. Blair, while saying that the coalition had misjudged the de-Baathification process, added: ''It's easy to go back over mistakes that we may have made. But the biggest reason why Iraq has been difficult is the determination of our opponents to defeat us. And I don't think we should be surprised at that.''

PERSON: James W. Carey

HEADLINE: James W. Carey, Teacher of Journalists, Dies at 71

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
James W. Carey, a respected communications theorist whose intellectual acrobatics added heft to the practical education of journalists at Columbia University, died on Tuesday at his home in Wakefield, R.I. He was 71.
 The cause was complications of emphysema, his son J. William Carey said.
Dr. Carey -- who in 1988 was asked to join the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia as dean, but preferred to start as a professor -- began an academic doctoral program at a school where getting into print as a journalist had long been the proudest badge. His passion for journalism was immediately hailed, even as he published and spoke widely on communications theory. 
 ''As is not universal in the upper-academic realm where Jim dwelt professionally, he loved journalists, and believed that universities have something to teach us,'' Nicholas Lemann, dean of the journalism school, said in a statement.
 The Ph.D. program Dr. Carey originated added scholarly luster to a school that some more ethereal academics had called lightweight. His eclectic interests and focus on real-world problems enticed shoe-leather scribes to address the theoretical subjects that are the staples of most communications schools.
 ''He offered a sense that journalism exists in kind of a seamless web with other forms of communication,'' said Todd Gitlin, a Columbia professor.
 Dr. Carey shunned the increasingly abstruse, highly mathematical theoretical work at the frontiers of his field, preferring instead to focus on underlying values. He drew from anthropology and sociology, James Joyce and Boston Red Sox lore, to explore the cultural dimensions of journalism in democracies. This took him from the quirks of futures markets to journalism in 18th-century France to Marshall McLuhan, the media theorist.
 His own most influential idea was the ''ritual theory'' of communications, a departure from the traditional ''transmission theory,'' which defines communication as getting ideas from one place to another. Dr. Carey argued that a newspaper is not a transmission of facts or truth. Rather, it is a form of drama.
 ''What is arrayed before the reader is not pure information but a portrayal of the contending forces in the world,'' he wrote in 1985. ''Moreover, as readers make their way through the paper, they engage in a continual shift of roles or of dramatic focus.''
 Dr. Carey was greatly influenced by McLuhan, who saw media as a transcendentally involving experience, but he rejected McLuhan's belief that technology trumps human will. He was inspired by John Dewey and other early sociologists at the University of Chicago who saw the mind and its formation as a communal, or cultural, process. Journalism, in his view, became our collective campfire storytelling.
 Dr. Carey, who was the CBS professor of international journalism at Columbia, wrote the books ''Television and the Press'' (1988), ''Communication as Culture'' (1989) and ''James Carey: A Critical Reader'' (1997).
 James William Carey was born in Providence on Sept. 7, 1934. He was found to have a rare heart disease that was likely to be fatal, leading his mother to decide to keep him out of school because an education would never be needed, said Daniel Carey, another of his sons.
 Besides his son J. William, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Daniel R., of Galway, Ireland, Mr. Carey is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Elizabeth Gilman, and his other sons, Timothy J., of Denver, and Matthew F., of West Hollywood, Calif..
 The young Mr. Carey was not allowed to play ball with his friends, but filled his days reading books and having adult conversations with retirees in his neighborhood. At 14, he was finally sent to school, and at 16 he got a job writing copy for a local advertising agency.
 He went on to the University of Rhode Island, where he majored in marketing and advertising. He earned his doctorate at the University of Illinois, where he wrote that he concentrated on ''a field yet to be invented, the economics of communications.''
 He taught at the University of Illinois College of Communications, rising to dean. In 1988, after turning down the Columbia deanship, he accepted a professorial post. He was editor of and contributor to many scholarly publications at a time when Columbia was urging journalism professors to do more academic research.
 In 1996, the deanship was again open and Dr. Carey this time expressed interest. James Boylan, in his book ''Pulitzer's School: Columbia University's School of Journalism, 1903-2003'' (2003), wrote that Dr. Carey was rejected after journalism practitioners demanded one of their own.
 Mr. Boylan went on to say that Columbia was viewed by schools of communication as ''eccentric and a little snobbish'' and that its faculty seldom appeared in lofty theoretical journals. He mentioned Dr. Carey -- who never worked at a news organization, even as a paperboy -- as an exception.
 The Ph.D. program he started began in 1998, and the first participants have begun to graduate. Dr. Carey was also involved in setting up a two-year master's program with more academic rigor than the traditional one-year version for journalism practitioners.

HEADLINE: Broadway, Or Was It Madison Ave.?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVERY now and then, something comes along that makes you think: O.K., this is it, the end of civilized life as we know it.
 The advent of the designated hitter in baseball was one such moment. So was the rise of the oxymoronic phenomenon known as reality television. Same goes for pineapple bagels, blue drinks, casino-themed bar mitzvah parties and almost anything that Madonna has done in the last 20 years.
Through it all, we somehow manage to avoid the on-ramp for the road to perdition. But new challenges keep coming. 
 The latest was a brief performance the other night at the Orpheum Theater in the East Village, where ''Stomp'' has been playing since the Cuomo administration. Actors did a live commercial onstage before the show began. We're not talking about one of those appeals for contributions to help those with AIDS. This was an honest-to-goodness tourism advertisement done while the audience was settling in, a three-minute mini-play on the joys of visiting London.
 Talk about your omigod moments.
 New Yorkers are long used to being blitzed by advertising. They see it on buildings and on sidewalks. They see it wrapping the entire exterior of some buses, like authorized graffiti. They can't escape it in movie houses unless they arrive late, prepared to be relegated to the front-row gulag. But a live commercial in the theater -- the legitimate theater, as some still call it -- was unheard of until this week.
 So, are play lovers now doomed to endure a new assault along with their $100 tickets?
 Not to worry, some of the major theater chains say. ''I can guarantee you it will never happen in a Jujamcyn theater,'' said Paul Libin, the producing director of Jujamcyn Theaters. ''I should say, 'over my dead body.' '' Much the same came from Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization. ''Put it this way: not in Shubert theaters,'' he said.
 But it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone will resist temptation. ''I can imagine the economic strain on many of these theaters is such that they resort to these things,'' Mr. Schoenfeld said. ''But my experience is that the public doesn't want to have anything interfere with their enjoyment.''
 Maybe he's right. He has been in the business long enough to have a theater named after him. Still, we subscribe to the ant-at-the-picnic theory of the universe: if you see one, rest assured that more are on the way.
 That depends, said Philip S. Birsh, the president and publisher of Playbill.
 Depends on what?
 ''It depends on what's the cost per thousand for the ants,'' Mr. Birsh said. The ants in this case are advertisers looking at how much it costs them to reach 1,000 people. When they realize how expensive a commercial can be to talk to a few hundred theatergoers at a time, they will flee so fast, he said, as to ''make Jesse Owens look like a walker.'' (Remind us, kids, to tell you some day who Jesse Owens was.)
 All the same, Mr. Birsh acknowledged that ''there's nothing more interesting than new ideas.''
 This certainly qualifies as a new idea. Should it spread, the doubters notwithstanding, one can imagine what sort of advertisers may be interested. They might be the same types who fill evening news broadcasts with pitches for products to treat calcium deficiency, weak bladders, balky dentures and other indignities that are part of getting older.
 Like audiences for the network evening news, Broadway theatergoers tend to be up there in years; some may have even seen Jesse Owens run. You can tell who they are from the ads in Playbill, which includes page after page devoted to cholesterol reducers, wrinkle creams, bone-loss reversers and collagen serums.
 ''They're a relatively new phenomenon,'' Mr. Birsh said of these ads, though he argued that they don't reflect the average age of audiences as much as their bank accounts. ''Playbill readers are wealthy and they have health care,'' he said. ''Therefore, they have a higher propensity to get what they ask for.''
 All right, maybe the Broadway potentates are correct and the ''Stomp'' exercise is not a sure sign of the future. Don't be surprised, though, if someday you find yourself in the theater, part of a captive audience forced to watch actors run around hawking everything from toothpaste to pantyhose.
 You've been warned. This may yet prove to be the week when we moved closer to that on-ramp.

HEADLINE: Lingering Resentment and aDesire to Move Beyond Rueful Memories

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Maureen Balleza contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 25 

 BODY:
It's finally over. 
 For nearly five years, this city has been trying to focus on something other than the collapse and messy aftermath of Enron.
So as news of the guilty verdict against Enron's former chief executives raced through the city on Thursday, many Houstonians expressed relief, satisfaction and even joy. 
 ''I feel like justice was served,'' said Lois Kidd during her lunch break from her job at a pipeline company, adding that she was thrilled with the verdicts. 
 ''The jury saw that Jeff Skilling and Ken Lay lied, cheated and stole and ruined a lot of lives and a wonderful company,'' Ms. Kidd said. ''It was a golden company.''
 Sherron S. Watkins, the former Enron vice president known for her prescient letter calling attention to shaky deals at the company, said the verdicts brought into sharp relief the lesson about leadership that she has taken away from the episode.
 ''The verdict sends a message that those who have the privilege of running corporations have a corresponding responsibility,'' she said in a statement through her lawyer. ''The verdict sends a message of accountability.''
 For others, the day's news was not enough to erase their resentment.
 ''I'm not about revenge,'' said Lois Black, a former legal secretary at Azurix, a water concern controlled by Enron. ''But we need to think of more creative punishment for these two men, like liquidating their assets and dividing that up among everyone who lost money from Enron, even if it's a dollar.'' 
 Still, Ms. Black, 65, said she was trying to move on. After losing her job, she started Tea Parties to Go, a company that organizes parties for girls. Because her retirement savings were largely depleted by Enron's collapse, Ms. Black said she was trying to sell her house and buy a rental property that could provide some retirement income.
 Her bad memories of Enron? ''You just can't hang on to that stuff,'' she said.
 Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, is trying to move on, too, even though Enron will continue to generate national headlines with sentencings, appeals and civil lawsuits. 
 Enron's fall hurt the city in myriad ways, the inevitable fallout from the implosion of what was once the country's seventh-largest corporation, employing more than 4,000 people here at its peak.
 Many Houston residents have tried to focus on the future. Occasionally former Enron employees and curious residents peeked into the courtroom during the four-month trial, but many of the seats reserved for the public remained empty.
 ''Five years ago is a long time for Houston, which is a city that prefers to focus on striding forward,'' said Stephen L. Klineberg, a professor of sociology at Rice University, describing how Houston's economy grew for 130 years until the bust of the 1980's.
 Professor Klineberg said that even the Great Depression largely passed Houston by in the 1930's, without a single bank being forced to close, as if aw-shucks optimism was a cornerstone for success. 
 ''This was an ugly chapter for us, and there was a motivation to get this behind us,'' he said.
 Enron, when it was thriving, was seen as a way to carry the city into a new era, freeing it from the booms and busts that paralleled the price of oil.
 That post-oil economy never fully emerged in Houston, however. And now, for better or worse, the city finds its fortunes tied once again to petroleum.
 Back in 2001, when Enron was collapsing and Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling were carrying out their crimes, oil was just $25 a barrel. But now oil costs more than $70 a barrel, part of a commodity boom that has lifted the fortunes of Houston's energy companies and their employees.
 The city's economy has grown for 40 consecutive months, driven not just by rising energy prices, but also by inexpensive real estate and a fast-growing population.
 But that sharp jump in the price of oil has hurt others in a diversifying local economy. One of Houston's largest employers, the Methodist Hospital System, said this week that it was distributing 10,000 gift cards, worth $250 each, to employees to help provide relief from rising fuel costs.
 There remains an unease here about what will fuel Houston's next boom when this one peters out, particularly as the price of oil has focused the nation's attention on developing alternative energy solutions. 
 Despite its current prosperity, Houston seems somewhat staid, in sharp contrast to the freewheeling business culture that grew out of Enron in the late 1990's, or the wildcatting days of the 1970's, when Houston solidified its status as a global energy capital. 
 ''Ken Lay had a sickening lifestyle when put in today's context,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, associate director of the energy program at Rice. Ms. Jaffe said today's Houston differed from the city of the 1970's, when ''everyone felt they could get rich.'' 
 ''Now we've gone through traumatic events like Hurricane Katrina,'' Ms. Jaffe added, referring to Houston's efforts to absorb 150,000 new residents from New Orleans. ''It's clear that the trickle-down effect of today's oil boom is minimal.'' 
 Even though Enron will no longer play a big role in Houston's economy, it is likely to remain a big part of its image, said David Thompson.
 Mr. Thompson is an owner of Ttweak, a marketing company that developed a campaign that humorously trumpets life in Houston by listing its drawbacks, like flying cockroaches, sprawl and its array of refineries. 
 ''This has dredged up a morbid time,'' he said. ''Houston will keep rolling on, but its image is another matter. Enron is still right up there with our overwhelming heat and humidity.''

HEADLINE: Finding a Way Back to the Law

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

 BODY:
Arthur Field, a retired partner at the Shearman & Sterling law firm, was concerned. 
 Mr. Field had watched his daughter, also a lawyer, return to her in-house job after several years at home with her children. 
But he knew that many Wall Street lawyers who left the work force were overlooked by their former employers because ''none of the firms are committing to take them back.'' That lack of connection, as he termed it, made neither demographic nor economic sense. 
 ''Firms have a big investment in this group because they have trained them,'' he said, ''while the individual lawyers have an enormous investment in their education. Those who want to come back will work harder. If it's just a dollars and cents decision -- which it shouldn't be -- why wouldn't you hire more highly motivated people who have left and want to come back?'' 
 Setting out to find an answer to that question, Mr. Field urged Linda C. Hayman, the incoming chairwoman of the American Bar Association's business law section, to establish a program for lawyers who have left the work force. 
 Ms. Hayman, a corporate partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, liked the idea and began to organize a group of lawyers from the biggest firms in New York. 
 She asked Kayalyn A. Marafioti, another Skadden partner, to lead the committee. Together they hatched a pilot project, Back to Business Law, to provide seminars and informal networking opportunities for lawyers who had left active practice but were still interested in corporate law.
 The group has a Web site at backtobusinesslaw.org.
 The goal, Ms. Hayman said, was to ''provide a little bit of a lifeline for those not practicing -- to be aware of developments at a high level. And while no firm has enough alumni who are no longer practicing to do a program, the A.B.A. can help us band together to put together some top programs.'' 
 All of the lawyers they asked agreed to participate, Ms. Hayman added. ''No one said no.''
 The free monthly seminars, which will provide continuing legal education credit to attendees, will cover subjects like securities law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, bankruptcy and intellectual property. 
 At the group's second meeting earlier this month, Edward P. Welch, a partner in Skadden's office in Wilmington, Del., spoke about a 2005 case that addressed corporate directors' responsibilities. He not only spoke about advising boards, but also gave what amounted to a pep talk. ''The law recycles itself. The same issues keep coming up,'' Mr. Welch said. ''Taking time off won't hurt -- you can compete with people who are out there if you keep up.'' 
 Networking is not a formal goal of the group, but it seems inevitable. Ms. Marafioti hopes, as the project develops, ''that a lot of the law firms that have advisory board members will start to think about these issues and say it makes sense to utilize these lawyers. Maybe they can, for example, hire some to fill a temporary need instead of hiring contract lawyers.''
 The partners involved understand that many who have stopped practicing may not want to return to the long hours that are typical at most large firms. 
 ''We know that many may choose to go to clients rather than back to the firms,'' Ms. Hayman said.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Marafioti added, ''We can't have this pool of talent and let it evaporate. We need to nurture them. We don't know if it's the right way or the only way but certainly one means to accomplish our goal.''
 Eventually, the founders hope to introduce program nationwide. 
 According to a study by Sylvia Ann Hewlett, president of the Center for Work-Life Policy in New York, 42 percent of female lawyers take time off -- apart from maternity leave -- in contrast to 30 percent of women in business and 21 percent of those with medical careers. Lawyers, the study found, stay out of the work force longer -- an average of three years compared with just over two years for other professionals. And while only 7 percent of all professionals leave for six to nine years, 24 percent of female lawyers leave the work force for that length of time.
 The A.B.A. project mirrors programs recently begun by several business schools. The Harvard Business School ran its first program in April, while the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth is beginning an executive M.B.A. program this fall, with sessions in both Hanover, N.H., and in New York.
 The Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco is creating a similar program geared toward women who have been out of the work force for four years or less, said Joan C. Williams, a professor. The program is likely to focus on legal skills and on networking. 
 ''We want to help them think through the changes that need to occur in the family in order to go back since the demography shows that once a woman drops out, her husband's contributions tend to drop off,'' Ms. Williams said. 
 At least one woman who attended this week's A.B.A. seminar has already bridged the gap successfully. Nina M. Dillon, a mother of four, left Cravath, Swaine & Moore in 2000, not planning to return. But after five years at home, she decided she wanted to resume her career. She floated the idea with a Cravath partner, Julie A. North, who was receptive. Ms. Dillon rejoined the firm last July on a reduced-hours arrangement. 
 Returning to work was ''surprisingly easy,'' she said. ''While my skills were rusty for sure -- I was not in the habit of writing eloquently -- it wasn't hard to get back into the groove.''

 A government report showed that first-quarter economic growth was below analysts' expectations. The data did not add to worries about inflation and interest rates, which have battered the market during the last two weeks.
MasterCard's offering, the largest stock sale in two years, came to market amid growing recent turbulence in world markets, though it listed on a day when many stocks rebounded. 
 The shares rose $7, to close at $46, in contrast to the decline in shares of the Internet phone service provider Vonage Holdings on its first trading day on Wednesday.
 MasterCard's surge was also a turnabout from the pricing of its $2.4 billion initial public offering the day before at a lower-than-expected $39 a share.
 MasterCard, based in Purchase, N.Y., plans to use all but $650 million of the proceeds to redeem its Class B shares. The rest will be used to defend against legal and regulatory challenges and to expand geographically and into higher segments of the payment industry.
 Shares of the Web auctioneer eBay jumped 12.2 percent after it unveiled an advertising alliance with Yahoo. The Prudential Equity Group raised its investment rating on eBay's stock to overweight and upgraded its outlook for the Internet portals and commerce sector.
 ''You've got eBay and a big bank merger, and mergers add support to the market,'' said Jon D. Brorson, managing director of growth equities at Neuberger Berman in Chicago, referring to a banking merger in Alabama. ''Cash hasn't disappeared in the last two weeks from corporate coffers, so we still have a reason why the market isn't going to fall to zero.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 93.73 points, or 0.84 percent, to end at 11,211.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.31 points, or 1.14 percent, to finish at 1,272.88. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 29.07 points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 2,198.24.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 8/32, to 100 14/32, its yield having risen to 5.07 percent, from 5.04 percent Wednesday. Bond prices move inversely to their yields.
 Before the market opened, Regions Financial Corporation of Alabama said it had agreed to acquire a rival, AmSouth Bancorp, for nearly $10 billion. The deal will create one of the top 10 United States banks. But Regions shares fell 3.1 percent, or $1.09, to $34.44, while AmSouth lost 3.1 percent, or 90 cents, to $28.
 Shares of eBay jumped 12.2 percent, or $3.68, to $33.88, while Yahoo's rose 3.6 percent, or $1.13, to $32.92.
 Crude oil futures for July delivery gained $1.46 to settle at $71.32 a barrel, lifting shares of oil companies. 
 The biggest lift for both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 came from Exxon Mobil, up 2.4 percent, or $1.42, at $61.52. Chevron was the S.& P. 500's next-best gainer, rising 3.3 percent, or $1.89, to $59.49. 
 Wal-Mart Stores' shares gained 3 percent, or $1.42, to $49.45 after Banc of America Securities raised its rating on the stock to buy.
 General Motors shares shot up 5.2 percent, or $1.39, to close at $27.90 after reports that more than 20,000 blue-collar workers had accepted buyout offers, surpassing the automaker's initial target. 
 The government said first-quarter gross domestic product grew at an upwardly revised annual rate of 5.3 percent, slightly below forecasts.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year Treasury notes.

HEADLINE: S.& P. May Cut Ford's Debt Rating Again

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 25 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said on Thursday that it might cut Ford's debt rating deeper into junk status, citing concerns that the company's turnaround was falling short of expectations. 
 S.& P. put Ford and its finance unit on CreditWatch with negative implications, citing the ''deteriorating product mix and market share in North America and persistently high commodity costs generally.''
 S.& P. said it would decide in about a month whether to lower Ford's rating, a move that would make borrowing money more costly for the company.
 The company is five months into a sweeping revamping effort called the Way Forward, which aims to close 14 plants and cut as many as 30,000 jobs in North America through 2012. 
 Robert Schulz, an S.& P. credit analyst who follows the auto industry, said that ''2006 looks like it's turning out to be perhaps a more difficult year than we would have thought.'' Ford posted a $1.2 billion loss for the first quarter, its largest in more than four years.
 Mr. Schulz said he was particularly troubled by declining United States sales of Ford's full-size pickups and midsize sport utility vehicles -- traditionally its biggest money-makers -- as high gas prices cause consumers to seek vehicles with better fuel economy. 
 Ford sold 14.5 percent fewer trucks in April; sales of its flagship S.U.V., the Explorer, fell 42 percent. S.& P. first cut Ford's long-term debt rating to junk status a year ago and reduced it further, to BB-, in January. Ford's debt is rated two notches ahead of its rival General Motors, which S.& P. also has placed on CreditWatch, largely because of concerns over a possible strike at the Delphi Corporation, G.M.'s largest supplier, which is operating in bankruptcy.
 The January downgrade was meant to reflect S.& P.'s assessment of the reorganization effort, Mr. Schulz said, but Ford's continued weak performance prompted another review. 
 ''Turning around North America is a multiyear process,'' Mr. Schulz acknowledged. But he pointed out that other automakers seem to be weathering high material and fuel prices better than Ford. Both G.M. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler were profitable in the first quarter.
 A Ford spokeswoman, Becky Sanch, said the company remained committed to its revamping plan. 
 ''We will continue to manage our costs, maintain leadership in the full-size pickup segment and introduce products that connect with our customers,'' Ms. Sanch said, noting that the S.& P. report lists Ford's strong liquidity position as a positive. 
 Ford ended the first quarter with $23.1 billion in cash in its automotive operations, but that was down from $25.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
 Shares of Ford rose 22 cents on Thursday, to close at $7.15.

HEADLINE: Revised Growth Data Eases Inflation Fear

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Concerns the economy might have overheated in the first quarter eased yesterday after revised economic growth figures showed that expansion was indeed strong, but not too strong.
 Investors, who have been jumpy over even the slightest sign of inflation, responded by igniting a rally in stocks. Given the Federal Reserve's focus on inflation in its deliberations on interest rates, the markets have responded lately with a high degree of volatility every time inflation fears rise or subside.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that the nation's gross domestic product expanded 5.3 percent in the first quarter, up from the 4.8 percent first reported last month. That is the fastest rate of growth since 2003. Still, many expected a growth rate of 5.8 percent, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. 
 But instead of showing signs that inflation was even more of a problem in the first quarter than initially thought, the revised numbers suggested fairly tame price pressures. Consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of the gross domestic product, contributed 3.63 percentage points to the overall 5.8 percent growth. Initially, the government said consumer spending contributed slightly more. 
 And core consumer spending, which excludes energy and food, rose 2 percent in the first quarter -- unchanged from the first report. Investors looking for signs that inflationary pressures had ebbed were also reassured by a letter to the chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, from Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that said core inflation appeared stable.
 ''The stability of core inflation, even as many firms have faced substantial cost increases for energy products, has been enhanced by the fact that long-term inflation expectations appear to remain well contained,'' Mr. Bernanke wrote in response to written questions from Representative H. James Saxton, Republican of New Jersey. 
 Although his tone was upbeat, Mr. Bernanke did not indicate what the Fed might do when it meets late next month to discuss raising the benchmark short-term interest rate. ''Of course, inflation expectations will remain low only so long as the Federal Reserve demonstrates its commitment to price stability,'' he wrote.
 Stocks rose broadly throughout the day. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 93.73 points, to 11,211.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.31 points, to 1,272.88. The Nasdaq composite index closed up 29.07 points, at 2,198.24. 
 ''There's the ying and yang of the reports,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist with the economic forecasting company Global Insight. ''When the report comes in a little stronger than expectations, the market falls. When the reports come in a little weaker than expected, you get the opposite reaction.''
 Many economic indicators now appear to point toward a softening economy. For example, the National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that sales of existing homes fell 2 percent in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million. Combined with high energy prices and rising interest rates, the data indicates that the 5.3 percent rate of expansion cannot continue. 
 Much of the first-quarter surge came as the economy bounced back from the slowdown after hurricanes last summer and fall. The fourth-quarter dip and the first-quarter spike will probably be followed by more moderate growth, many economists have said. Economic growth is likely to be more in line with the 3.5 percent rate of last year, they predict.
 Now the question becomes whether the economy will balance itself out. The ideal scenario would be for growth to slow just enough to keep inflation under control. However, if high gas prices drag down personal spending, the economy could stall. 
 ''Spending on gas and energy will rebound, but spending on everything else will slow,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, an economist with the investment adviser High Frequency Economics.
 In a separate report issued yesterday, the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell by 40,000, or 11 percent, last week.

HEADLINE: In Speech to Medical Graduates, Mayor Diverges From Party Line

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Distancing himself from national Republicans and the Bush administration, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg yesterday urged an end to the political manipulation of science, which he said had been used to discredit the threat of global warming and undermine medical advancements in areas like stem-cell research.
 In a speech to graduating students of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Mr. Bloomberg railed against what he sees as ideologically motivated arguments that have fueled debate over hot-button issues like teaching evolution in public schools and the Terri Schiavo case. 
''Today, we are seeing hundreds of years of scientific discovery being challenged by people who simply disregard facts that don't happen to agree with their agenda,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''Some call it pseudoscience, others call it faith-based science, but when you notice where this negligence tends to take place, you might as well call it 'political science.' ''
 Mr. Bloomberg has increasingly been using the bully pulpit to wade into national issues like gun trafficking and illegal immigration, and his latest remarks reflect how he is working to chart a third course in American politics as the national discourse remains polarized. Nominally a Republican, Mr. Bloomberg is fashioning a political framework that borrows liberal social values from the Democrats, pro-business fiscal language from the Republicans and a pragmatic approach from the private sector.
 Mr. Bloomberg chose friendly territory as a backdrop for the comments, among the most politically charged of his tenure. He attended Johns Hopkins as an undergraduate, has given the university hundreds of millions of dollars over the years and spoke before an audience who might tend to identify with his views.
 But beyond the halls of the university, the comments were sure to ruffle feathers and again illustrate the widening gulf between Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat before his run for mayor, and the Republican Party to which he now belongs. 
 Having won re-election last year in New York by a decisive margin and with no clear future political ambitions, Mr. Bloomberg, 64, appears to be reveling in his freedom to say what he wants without worrying about the consequences within the Republican Party.
 On global warming, Mr. Bloomberg echoed criticism from Democrats and environmental advocates who say that the Republicans have been slow to act, questioning how much human activity contributes to it and debating regulations.
 ''Despite near-unanimity in the science community, there's now a movement, driven by ideology and short-term economics, to ignore the evidence and discredit the reality of climatic change,'' he said.
 Mr. Bloomberg also criticized the federal government, which under President Bush has restricted financing to create new stem-cell lines for research. Mr. Bloomberg said that by limiting such financing, the government was leaving its responsibility to protect the health and welfare of citizens to the private sector.
 He also leveled another indirect attack at Congress and President Bush for taking up the position of Terri Schiavo's parents, passing laws to try to keep Ms. Schiavo, the brain-dead woman in Florida, on life support against her husband's wishes.
 ''Was there anything more inappropriate than watching political science try to override medical science in the Terri Schiavo case?'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
 He also went after proposals in school districts to teach intelligent design, which he called ''really just creationism by another name,'' alongside evolution. 
 Many conservatives, including President Bush, support the addition of intelligent design -- which holds that life is too complicated to have been created without an architect -- to curriculums.
 ''It boggles the mind that nearly two centuries after Darwin, and 80 years after John Scopes was put on trial, the country is still debating the validity of evolution,'' he said. ''This not only devalues science, it cheapens theology. As well as condemning these students to an inferior education, it ultimately hurts their professional opportunities.''
 In telling the graduates that science was under attack from ideologues in the public sphere, Mr. Bloomberg compared this era with one more than a century ago, when the medical school was founded, when ''medicine was dominated by quacks and poorly trained physicians.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 12, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 26 about a commencement speech by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, in which he urged an end to the political manipulation of science, referred incorrectly to Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman at the center of a politically charged debate over the right to die. Ms. Schiavo was brain-damaged at the time of her death in March 2005; she had not been brain-dead.

HEADLINE: A Jump in Gas Prices Isn't Deterring Summer Travelers

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Behold the annual migratory ritual that has begun.
 Millions of Americans are loading up their children, packing their suitcases and kicking off that great exodus known as the summer driving season.
Nearly 38 million people will travel this Memorial Day weekend, and most of them will drive on America's roads and highways -- a record number of travelers, according to AAA. 
 High gasoline prices? Not much of a problem, it seems.
 ''People are traveling just as much,'' said Philip Reed, the consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com, an automotive Web site. ''There is much complaining about fuel prices, but there is still no substitute for the car and for the family vacation. That's a priority that people aren't willing to sacrifice yet.'' 
 By Labor Day, drivers will have logged more than 800 billion miles, or 8.6 billion miles a day, and will have consumed 36 billion gallons of fuel crisscrossing the United States, according to the Energy Department. 
 That is why Memorial Day to Labor Day accounts for the peak in gasoline consumption, why refineries have been scrambling to prepare in time and why gasoline imports have risen to near records to make up for shortfalls. Drivers seem undeterred.
 ''I find it painful to pay for gasoline, as I am sure everyone else does, but gas prices didn't occur to me as I was planning a road trip for the weekend,'' said Whitney Radia, 28, an advertising account executive in West Hollywood, Calif. ''It concerns me but it hasn't changed my lifestyle that much.''
 Of course, the difference with previous years is the higher price drivers are paying for gasoline. It now averages $2.88 a gallon nationwide, a 75-cent jump from last year, according to the Energy Department. Despite the extra cost, Americans are expected to make only minor changes in their driving habits this summer. 
 But those changes moderate the growth in demand and may help prevent gasoline prices from rising more than they normally do in the summer. 
 ''So far, $3 a gallon is old hat,'' said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS in New York. ''The question is, What kind of price levels do you need for people to stay at home?''
 This is not to say that Americans are immune to changes in energy prices, whose effects are slowly spreading through the economy. Lower-income households, which devote a higher share of domestic spending to energy, are feeling the pain, certainly, much more than higher-income families. 
 Higher energy prices have eaten into incomes, wiping out almost a third of last year's total wage increases, according to a new report by the United States Conference of Mayors and Global Insights. In 2005, energy expenditures accounted for 5.9 percent of consumer spending -- up 20 percent from 2004, the report said. Households spent $287 billion for gasoline and $225 billion on other energy expenses, or 9 percent of all wages and salaries.
 The Energy Information Administration of the Energy Department, in a recent report, said a lasting increase of 10 percent in the price of crude oil would lead to a 0.4 percent drop in domestic petroleum consumption over two years. While that may not seem like much for a nation that consumes more than 20.5 million barrels of oil a day, it can add up.
 ''The high-price environment of the last few years had caused some analysts to conclude that high energy prices are an intractable fixture and that energy demand is somehow immune to the impacts of higher prices,'' Adam E. Sieminski, the global oil strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a recent report. 
 ''The E.I.A. simulations suggest this is not the case but also point out, correctly, that time lags can delay the effects of price changes,'' he said.
 While the number of miles driven each year has grown 2 percent a year over the last five years, the rate of growth has been just 1 percent in the first quarter this year, according to the agency. ''We expect the lower growth to continue with the higher prices,'' said Tancred Lidderdale, a senior economist at the Energy Information Administration.
 Gasoline prices rose to record highs this spring on the back of a big increase in oil prices. After reaching a high of $75.17 a barrel in April, crude oil remains around $70 a barrel because of concerns over the security of supplies around the world.
 Gas prices are directly affected by oil's movements. A general rule is that a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil adds nearly 25 cents to the price of gas at the pump.
 ''Prices are too high; it's taking a chunk out of my budget,'' said Jerry Davis, a 30-year-old product engineer from Chicago. He has decided for the second consecutive year not to drive on the holiday because of gasoline prices.
 ''Any little blip sends oil futures though the roof; any storm scares the market,'' Mr. Davis said. ''If something happens in Africa or the Middle East, it seems like immediately prices jump. It's ridiculous, don't you think? I'd hate to be somewhere this weekend and something like this happens.''
 The Energy Department anticipates that gasoline will fall somewhat from its current highs, although the average price is expected to remain above $2.65 a gallon nationwide through the summer. 
 Some energy analysts are not so sure. They warn that the average price of gasoline may rise above $3 a gallon again if there is a supply disruption like Hurricane Katrina last year or this year's unrest in Nigeria.
 A third of all leisure travel takes place in the summer. This season, Americans will take 326 million trips, according to the Travel Industry Association, essentially the same as last year. The trade group expects Americans to spend $1,000 on each trip, but travelers are expected to save money on hotels, food and dining to make up for the higher gasoline expense. 
 For an 800-mile round trip, the average during the summer, the extra cost of paying a dollar more a gallon at the pump adds up to $40 for a vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon. 
 ''People are not going to cancel their trips, but what they might do is modify them,'' said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association. ''Instead of taking three or four trips over the summer, people will look for ways to save money, such as staying closer to home.'' 
 Some towns are trying to lure travelers with special discounts. For example, Costa Mesa, Calif., 40 miles south of Los Angeles in Orange County, is promising a $30 check to help pay for gas and an additional $30 a day in rebates for visitors who spend a minimum of two nights in town. 
 ''We're facing a new threshold and that's $4 a gallon,'' said Mr. Reed of Edmunds.com. ''It's going to be interesting to see at what point will people start making substantial changes.''

HEADLINE: A Decade of Soaring and a Month of Stumbling for India's Stocks 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
NEARLY a decade ago, when technology stocks were hot and developing countries were not, a money manager calculated that Intel was worth as much as all the publicly traded companies in India. He thought that a little ridiculous. 
 In recent years, as any investor in either India or Intel knows, tables have turned. Since the end of 2003, Intel investors have lost about 40 percent of their money, while those in India are up around 80 percent.
As capital has flowed in, there have been periodic warnings that speculation might be getting a little out of hand, but those who paid attention to such warnings have always lost out.
 At least until this month.
 From May 10, when the Bombay Stock Exchange 100 index peaked at 6,554.71, through Monday, the index plunged almost 18 percent, to 5,382.22. It then bounced back a bit, reassuring those who recall that the last such rapid sell-off, almost exactly two years ago, was in reaction to a surprising election result: the Congress Party, in coalition with leftist parties, took over the government.
 Since then, that government has won the hearts of foreign investors, and growth has been rapid. Along with China, India has been the most exciting country for foreign investors. And its stock market, unlike that of China, has been viewed as a reasonable place where quality companies can be bought and sold. China's market, which has burned investors too many times and does not even list the country's best companies, has done poorly.
 Eric Fry, the money manager who spoke about India and Intel at a conference sponsored by Grant's Interest Rate Observer in early 1997, is now a hedge fund manager with Solstice Advisors. When asked this week if he still owned Indian stocks, he said he did not. ''Back then, you had a market that was truly undiscovered and ignored,'' he said. ''Now it is anything but. Fundamentals are still terrific, but the stocks have had a big run.''
 Just how big is shown in the accompanying charts. United States Treasury data, as compiled by Bank of America, indicates that Americans put nearly $12 billion into Indian securities last year, far more than in any previous year. Joseph Quinlan, the chief market strategist, notes that in the past developing markets have tended to plunge after big increases in American purchases.
 Moreover, the chart shows that the Indian stock market's rise since late 2001 is similar to the run-up in the Nasdaq composite to its peak in 2000, although the decline since the high has been a little more rapid.
 Shri P. Chidambaram, India's finance minister, pointed out that many markets around the world suffered this month, some worse than India, and he said that ''for some time now, experts have been suggesting that a technical correction of the market was unavoidable.'' He also blamed margin calls for forcing some speculators to sell.
 But he said there was no reason to worry. ''The secular rise in India in the last two years is attributable to the sound India growth story,'' he said. ''The India growth story remains intact.''

HEADLINE: Income Rises, but So Does Inflation

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Personal income rose and consumers continued to spend freely last month, according to a new government report released yesterday. But at the same time, a crucial measure of inflation inched higher.
 Investors were encouraged by the news and seemed to ignore concerns about inflation. The markets rose yesterday, ending the week on an up note.
The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.6 percent in March as income moved up at roughly the same pace. 
 A measure of inflation that excludes food and energy, which the Fed studies closely to gauge inflation, rose 2.1 percent compared with last April just above the 2 percent mark the central bank considers healthy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 67.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 11,278.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.28 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,280.16. The Nasdaq composite index added 12.13 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,210.37.
 For the week, the Dow rose 1.21 percent, the S.& P. 500 gained 1.04 percent and the Nasdaq 0.75 percent.
 Yet, some economists said yesterday that rounding of the inflation number might have been the biggest factor influencing investors. 
 The Commerce Department reported the inflation number for April as 0.2 percent. However, the actual figure was 0.24968, giving some economists pause. 
 ''What's .001 between friends?'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial. ''2.1 has got to be feeling just a bit uncomfortable.'' 
 Had that 0.24968 been rounded up to 0.3, which was the number in March, investors probably would have had a different reaction yesterday.
 ''The economy is slowing down, Mr. Hoffman said. ''But at the same time inflation is speeding up. That's why they have a tough call to make. Is rising inflation a bigger threat to sustained economic growth, or is a softer economy a bigger threat?''
 The Fed, which will decide late next month whether to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate above 5 percent, will look at inflation against the backdrop of what by most accounts is a slowing economy.
 As investors barely blinked at the consumer spending data, they also shrugged off a report that showed consumer confidence is at its lowest point since right after the hurricanes last summer. 
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, an indicator of how well the economy will perform in coming months, moved in May to 79.1, from 87.4 in April. That is in line with what many economists see as a pattern for the economy for the remainder of the year.
 ''A gradually softening trend for consumer spending is the most likely scenario in the quarters ahead,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note, ''particularly as housing cools off. The recent steep rise in gasoline prices will not help any as well.''
 Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan study, called the effect of gas prices on the economy ''corrosive,'' and noted that a large percentage of respondents in the survey's history said gas prices were hurting their financial situations.
 ''Consumers expect a slowdown in economic growth,'' Mr. Curtin said. ''High gas prices and rising interest rates have finally convinced households to sharply realign their expectations.''
 In the currency market, the dollar advanced on the Japanese yen. Gold prices settled at about $650 an ounce.
 Crude oil futures rose 5 cents, to settle at $71.37.
 In the Treasury market, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 100 14/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.05 percent, from 5.07 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: In Big Uneasy, Exit Planning Is Obsession 

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 26 

 BODY:
It begins as a conversation, perhaps over dinner, at the end of the day: Where are you going this year? Then, on to the specifics. Which relative? Which hotel? How many suitcases?
 As a symptom of the general uneasiness here, this year's hurricane evacuation talk ranks among the most acute. Within it are the immediate and long-term threats: the unnamed storm everyone may soon have to flee, and the grim likelihood that the next big one could be the knockout punch for this struggling city.
 ''Everybody I talk to asks, 'What and where is your escape pod?' '' said Joseph Maselli Jr., a lawyer downtown. ''The talk at lunchtime and in elevators is not, 'What route,' but, 'How soon are you going to leave, what's your plan, where are you going to go?' ''
 Never has a coming hurricane season generated as much anxiety, many here say. The official start to the season is Thursday but the unofficial worrying has long since begun. 
 On top of the ever-present reminders of last year's catastrophe -- ruined neighborhoods, piles of debris, empty streets -- the new threat is proving to be too much for some. Everyone here, it seems, knows someone who is picking up and leaving New Orleans for good. 
 Many who swear they will not abandon the city have at least set up an alternative home-place somewhere else. Mr. Maselli said he knew ''dozens'' of people who had already secured a getaway spot -- an apartment or a modest second home. 
 ''It's the fear of a second big shoe dropping this quickly,'' he said. ''Everyone says, 'Please, God, don't hit us this year.' '' 
 Mr. Maselli and his wife have been fixing up a family home in Natchez, Miss., up the river, as their hurricane getaway. 
 The fear may be particularly acute among those relatively unaffected by Hurricane Katrina -- people living in the Uptown neighborhood, for instance. Will it be their turn next? Might the Mississippi River levees fail this time?
 ''Everyone I talk to is filled with a great deal of anxiety,'' said Anne Milling, who started Women of the Storm, a group that seeks to bring attention to continuing problems from Hurricane Katrina. 
 ''I think it's going to be difficult this year,'' Mrs. Milling said. ''Most all of our friends have made plans. It's remarkable to me: people who have never even thought about it have made plans. I think that now people are looking at a lot of things differently.'' 
 At a social gathering this week, ''it was discussed tremendously,'' Mrs. Milling said. ''I couldn't get over it. That was the conversation: 'Where are we going to go?' ''
 Such discussions often end with a vow not to return to the same place as last year, because it was not enough like New Orleans. 
 A recently completed survey by the University of New Orleans on attitudes after Hurricane Katrina detected unprecedented levels of anxiety about what lies ahead for this city, particularly compared with a similar sampling three years ago.
 ''I can't tell you how many people are devising an exit strategy,'' said the director of the survey, Susan Howell, a political scientist. ''They don't see a future. Life is too stressful.''
 Strikingly, Dr. Howell said, the random survey of 470 people in Orleans and Jefferson Parishes, conducted in March and April, was carried out among ''people in the best conditions,'' those with relatively intact dwellings. 
 Though much of the political talk has focused on how to get people to return to the city, Dr. Howell said she noted a challenge that is perhaps equally serious, and that had gone largely unnoticed: ''the steady drip out,'' particularly of middle-class people who see an economy years away from recovery. 
 The daily strain of life among the ruins is proving too much for many people. 
 Jay and Lin Kayser, a doctor and a teacher, respectively, live on one of the few unflooded blocks near Lake Pontchartrain -- an island of relative normality. ''Between my street and Freret Street,'' several miles to the south, Dr. Kayser said, ''all of that was decimated. And that's our world.'' He and his wife are leaving New Orleans, after decades here. 
 ''The thought of me being 57, waiting for it to be normal again -- it's an emotional thing,'' Dr. Kayser said. ''I just don't want to worry about hurricanes and flooding when I'm 70. I just decided I didn't have it in me to stay.'' 
 Another doctor who is departing for good, a resident of unflooded Uptown, spoke of doing volunteer cleanup work in one of the hard-hit areas.
 ''It was heartbreaking,'' said the doctor, Sam Money. ''It was one of these things where, we live in a nice little cocoon, but so much of the city was devastated.''
 Still, for everyone leaving, or thinking of doing so, thousands more are preparing to hunker down, or at least get ready for another temporary exile.
 At the hurricane-preparation stands of stores like Lowe's, and at sporting goods stores selling canoes, boats and boots, clerks report a steady though unpanicked business, so far. 
 When the first storms strike the Gulf of Mexico this year, Vera Triplett, a resident of the city's hard-hit Gentilly section, plans to be ready. ''Our philosophy is, if we need to go, we go,'' Ms. Triplett said. 
 Her plans for evacuating are far more precise, ''thought out,'' than they have ever been, said Ms. Triplett, vice president of her neighborhood's civic association. But planning has not dispelled worry.
 ''There is an underlying fear and anxiety,'' she said, ''because most of the people around here are die-hard New Orleanians.''
 Some people plan to leave for the entire hurricane season -- an approach that harks back to the 19th century, when yellow fever killed thousands here and many abandoned New Orleans for the months when it was likely to be dangerous. 
 Ann Strub and her husband, Dick, have bought a house in North Carolina. They are leaving New Orleans on Thursday, and they will not return until hurricane season ends.
 ''We've got lists of everything were going to take,'' Mrs. Strub said. ''Mainly lots of papers.''
 A resident of Esplanade Avenue, the grand old Creole boulevard, she came through Hurricane Katrina relatively unscathed, but now, like many others here, she is prepared for the worst.
 ''If it floods in the French Quarter, we're done for,'' Mrs. Strub said.
 ''Our whole world is different,'' she continued. ''We live differently. It's very scary.''


GRAPHIC: Photos: Hurricane preparedness has become a daily fact of life in New Orleans. Just as there are cereal shelves in supermarkets, there are ''hurricane essentials'' shelves at hardware stores, like the Lowe's above. Then there is the other kind of hurricane preparedness, by workers at levees breached by Hurricane Katrina. At left, work continued on Wednesday along the storm-battered Industrial Canal in the city's Lower Ninth Ward. An independent report released this month concluded that the city's levee system had been underfinanced and was unable to properly defend the city against hurricanes.

HEADLINE: Fugitives From Somali Capital Describe Horrors of War

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MARKA, Somalia, May 26 

 BODY:
A baby with its leg blown off by shrapnel. Corpses in the streets. The wounded writhing in pain inside wheelbarrows, the only ambulances around.
 Horrible memories have followed those who fled the war-ravaged Somali capital, Mogadishu, this week for the relative safety of this town about 50 miles down the coast. At night, the evacuees still dream of the artillery shells that exploded around them. They cannot get the rat-a-tat of automatic weapon fire out of their heads.
 ''When you witness a 1-year-old whose leg has been cut off by a mortar shell, it stays with you,'' said Halima Ahmed, 50, who left Mogadishu two days ago with her 85-year-old mother in a donkey cart. ''We've witnessed so many things.'' 
 The exodus has come on foot, inside packed minibuses and atop overloaded trucks. Some fled with nothing but their children in their arms. Others took mattresses and cooking pots. All sought to outrun this nasty war, the worst Somalia has seen since the fall of its central government in 1991.
 The fighting pits the capital's notorious warlords against Islamist leaders trying to turn the country into a religious state. The United States appears to be in the mix as well, with officials saying that Washington is concerned about foreign terrorists in the country and is working with Somali leaders. 
 The American officials say a small number of foreign fighters with links to Al Qaeda are operating within an alliance of Somali Islamic groups and hope to turn the anarchic country into a place not unlike Afghanistan under the Taliban. The officials would not confirm or deny reports that warlords were being paid to apprehend the foreigners.
 For many of the people running for their lives from Mogadishu, the fighting is as incomprehensible as so many past conflicts: a shootout between rival militias, both heavily armed with all manner of weaponry, in which civilians are the ones bleeding the most.
 ''I have no idea who is fighting who,'' said Hadiyo Mohamed, 25, who fled Mogadishu three days ago with three young children. ''I was just going about my daily activities as a housewife when shelling began.''
 The fighting erupted in February, only to worsen as the months have passed. Fueled by arms from foreign governments in the region and beyond, the battle for power has cost more than 300 lives, even as the leaders on both sides portray themselves as defenders of the people.
 ''We don't consider either side as good,'' said Issa Ali, 40, who fled with his wife and three children. ''God knows which is the best to rule Mogadishu.''
 The warlords have ruled Mogadishu for 15 chaotic years, using young gunmen to extract as much revenue as they can from checkpoints, ports and airstrips within their turf. They have struck alliances with business leaders, who pay protection money.
 But the Islamic leaders have quietly emerged as a major force, with huge political, economic and military strength. They have slowly filled a void, creating Islamic schools and courts and providing social services unavailable anywhere else. In recent days they have captured crucial areas of the capital, seizing control from the warlords.
 But among the moderate sheiks are hard-liners who American officials say have formed a small Qaeda cell in Mogadishu. To combat those extremists, American intelligence officials have formed a relationship with the warlords, who call themselves the Alliance for the Restoration of Peace and Counterterrorism.
 ''Clandestine third-country involvement'' is what a report released this month by an expert panel convened by the United Nations calls the behind-the-scenes activity by American operatives. Without explicitly naming the United States, the panel suggested that Washington had provided financial support ''to help organize and structure a militia force created to counter the threat posed by the growing militant fundamentalist movement in central and southern Somalia.''
 The situation has eerie parallels to Afghanistan, where warlords so disillusioned the population that the hard-line Taliban were able to move in to fill the void in the mid-1990's, slowly taking over 90 percent of the country, including the capital. That fundamentalist government, which provided safe haven to Osama bin Laden and his backers, was overthrown by the United States and its allies after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 In the case of Somalia, Americans are not the only ones involved behind the scenes. The United Nations panel found that Ethiopians have been arming the fledgling government that has convened outside Mogadishu, in the inland town of Baidoa.
 To counter Ethiopian influence, the government of Eritrea, which broke away from Ethiopia after a civil war, has provided arms to the Islamists, the panel said, detailing precise shipments of weapons provided by each side.
 The panel also accused Italy of violating a United Nations arms embargo in Somalia, saying it had shipped trucks and ''a number of large, long, sealed boxes'' to the transitional government. In addition, Yemen has shipped pickup trucks, military uniforms and boots to the transitional government, the experts found. 
 All of the countries named by the panel have denied violating the embargo. 
 As battles rage on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia's transitional government, which was formed after two years of peace negotiations in neighboring Kenya, largely sits on the sidelines. Its officials have issued declarations calling for an end to the violence, but to little effect.
 In fact, four of the chief warlords involved in the fighting hold top-level cabinet posts in the government and have so far openly flouted calls for them to lay down their arms. The Islamists have also thumbed their noses at the government, especially its call for a foreign peacekeeping force.
 No matter who wins the fight for Mogadishu, residents fear that peace will not be the result. ''Even if one side wins, they will then fight amongst themselves,'' said Issa Mohamed Gaal, 60, who fled fighting in Mogadishu in March.
 Hussein Nour Ali, 43, argued that a religious state would bring order to the chaotic country and allow people to live their lives. ''We support the Islamic courts because they support peace,'' he said.
 But another displaced Mogadishu resident standing at his side objected to that interpretation. ''Peace?'' he said. ''They're fighting too.''

HEADLINE: For Whom the Road Tolls

BYLINE: By Mitch Daniels. 
Mitch Daniels, the director of the Office of Management and Budget from 2001 to 2003, is the governor of Indiana.

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS 

 BODY:
AS Americans hit the roads this Memorial Day weekend, debate is building about how to pay for the first-class transportation network that everyone agrees the United States requires. The money from gasoline taxes no longer comes close to meeting needs. Nationally, the gap between road-building needs and projected tax revenue is estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and growing. Almost every governor I talk to faces a seemingly intractable shortfall.
 When I became governor last year, my administration inherited a gap of at least $3 billion, equal then to 10 years of new road construction. Long-sought, long-delayed projects languished on the drawing board. For Indiana, a centrally located state that calls itself ''the crossroads of America'' and has great promise as a logistics and distribution capital, the opportunity cost of inaction was enormous. 
A case can be made for higher gas taxes, but no economically rational or politically imaginable increase could close a gap this huge, even if leveraged through reckless borrowing. The only alternative to throwing in the towel was to bring to bear that handiest of revenue sources, Other People's Money. 
 This is hardly a novel idea. In much of the world, but only recently in the United States, private capital has begun to play a role, most often in partnerships with public authorities. The Reason Foundation estimated in April that $25 billion of private investments have been proposed or committed for new and existing roads in six states.
 If it were merely a matter of getting hands on money today that would otherwise come in over the years, such partnerships would make little sense. The goal for states is to capture far more value than an asset would be worth if it remained in public hands. That goal is often not difficult to achieve.
 The 157-mile Indiana Toll Road had lost money five of the last seven years. A principal reason was its antique pricing; tolls had not changed since 1985 and were far below what comparable American toll ways charged. 
 As a private citizen, I had always been intrigued to stop at a concrete booth and fish out a dime and a nickel to pay the 15-cent toll at Gary. As governor, I asked, ''What does it cost us to collect a toll?'' This being government, no one knew, but after a few days of calculation, the answer came: ''About 34 cents, we think.'' I said, only half in jest, that we should just go to the honor system and we'd come out way ahead.
 Why would a losing enterprise with an underpriced product drift on in that way? Because it was run by politicians, who are rarely businesslike and deathly afraid to annoy anyone. So the state lost money on the road, postponed repairs and expansions and failed to install the electronic technology that makes toll ways elsewhere faster, more convenient and more efficient.
 Just as many business units are more valuable if separated from their conglomerate parent, an asset like a highway can be worth vastly more under different management. When we offered our road for long-term lease, we received a high bid of $3.8 billion, cash, from Macquarie-Cintra, an Australian-Spanish consortium. The highest estimate of the road's net present value in state hands was less than half that amount, and even that estimate assumed regular toll increases of the kind past governors steadfastly refused to impose. Noting the road's record of losses, one finance professor remarked, ''If they'd gotten a dollar for it, it would have been a good deal.'' Instead, Indiana will soon cash a check that closes a gap most had believed insoluble. Future toll increases will be capped at the level of inflation.
 Of course, the ultimate success of this policy depends on how the state uses these new funds. As in business, in government it is a mistake -- a misdeed, even -- to take value from a capital asset and use it for short-term operating purposes. That's why we insisted that the value liberated from our road be redeployed swiftly into new, long-term public assets that will strengthen our economic backbone: thanks to this deal, we will be able to quadruple the amount of state money devoted to new road construction projects over the next decade. 
 As clear as the business case was, politics intruded; in fact, Indiana very nearly tore up its equivalent of a Powerball check, with public sentiment running almost two to one against the deal before its passage by the General Assembly this spring. 
 While every business group, building trades union, and local government organization of consequence weighed in with support, the animosity in Indiana was as genuinely grassroots as it gets. Many Hoosiers convinced themselves either that our proposal borrowed from the future, or that it gave away a part of America to ''foreigners.'' 
 Their hearts were in the right place, but not their logic. The economic case is ironclad; Indiana has scored a multibillion-dollar financial gain. And the reflexive patriotism that saw this transaction as a loss of control has it backward: in a world competing for globally mobile capital, repatriating $4 billion that Americans spent on Sonys, Audis, or, in my case, Foster's beer, to put Hoosiers to work is not a loss but an emphatic win. 
 As governor, I should have done much more than I did to walk Indiana through, in advance, both the business case and the realities of today's global economic competition. But I urge my fellow governors in other states now examining similar deals to focus on these facts: Within a few years, Indiana will be home to some $5 billion of new public assets that otherwise would not have existed. Tens of thousands of jobs will be created in their construction, and in their exploitation by businesses of the future. Neither statist dogma nor xenophobia should be allowed to block huge public benefits of the most, so to speak, concrete variety.

HEADLINE: Ted Schroeder, 84, Winner Of Tennis Titles in 1940's

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Ted Schroeder, a tennis champion who won Wimbledon and the United States singles titles in the 1940's but steadfastly declined to turn professional, died yesterday at his home in La Jolla, Calif. He was 84.
 The International Tennis Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 1966 and announced his death, said the cause was cancer.
Schroeder won the men's singles at the United States National Championships (the precursor to the United States Open) in 1942 at Forest Hills, Queens, and the singles title at Wimbledon in 1949. He won three United States men's doubles championships with Jack Kramer (1940-41, '47) as well as four Davis Cup titles. From 1940 to 1951, he was ranked in the top 10 nationally nine times, including No. 1 in 1942. From 1946 to 1949 he ranked second in the world. 
 In 1942, Schroeder, a tenacious player with a powerful overhead stroke, became only the second player to win the national intercollegiate and the United States Nationals titles in the same year. He graduated from Stanford University with an economics degree that year.
 His No. 1 ranking in 1942 was further bolstered when, again at Forest Hills, he also won the intercollegiate doubles title with his Stanford classmate Larry Dee, and the United States Nationals mixed doubles title with Louise Brough.
 A native of Newark, Frederick Rudolph Schroeder moved to Southern California as a child and learned tennis there under Perry Jones, whose program produced stars like Bobby Riggs, Gene Mako and Kramer, who became Schroeder's lifelong friend and doubles partner.
 As students at Stanford, he and Kramer were 19 in 1940, when they became the youngest team to capture the men's doubles at the United States Nationals. They defended the title the next year but were unable to do so in 1942, when Kramer was stricken with appendicitis.
 Just days after winning his 1942 title in the men's singles, Schroeder enlisted in the Navy, serving on destroyers and as a fighter pilot in World War II until his discharge in 1945.
 After the war, he returned to the West Coast to establish himself in business and have a family with his wife, the former Ann de Windt, whom he had married in 1944. He is survived by his sons John, of Encinitas, Calif.; Richard, of Las Vegas; and Robert, of Denver; and a sister, Janet, of Arizona.
 When he was named a vice president by his employer, a commercial refrigeration equipment company, in 1949, he decided not to follow Kramer onto the professional tennis circuit. Schroeder always said he took his tennis far too emotionally to allow him to treat it as a full-time job. 
 Schroeder competed sparingly in tournaments, playing only often enough with Kramer to maintain a doubles ranking of third in the nation in 1946. Kramer, the national singles champion at the time, and Schroeder played every match for the 1946 Davis Cup final in Australia, and the two defeated Australia, 5-0. They won their third national doubles title together at Forest Hills after the war, in 1947. Schroeder continued to play in the Davis Cup until he retired from tennis in 1951.
 In 1949 at Wimbledon, Schroeder, using his vacation time to enter the tournament and with Kramer as his coach, won his only other Grand Slam singles title. He did it the hard way, surviving with daring volleying in four five-setters and a total of 29 sets. He also captivated London as an outgoing, straightforward Yank smoking a corn-cob pipe and earned the nickname ''Lucky Ted'' there for his five-set escapes.
 He ended his summer at Forest Hills, with his first appearance at the United States Nationals since his victory in 1942. There, he faced Pancho Gonzalez in a memorable final in which Schroeder won an epic first set, 18-16. He then squandered a two-sets-to-none lead and lost the match. 
 Schroeder refused offers to turn professional and joust with Kramer on the pro circuit. Instead, he maintained his amateur status and went back to work in California, where he and Kramer bought several racehorses together.

HEADLINE: From Top of the Corporate World to Appeals Court

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
JUDGMENT day arrived for the two top executives at Enron, and the jury found both men guilty of fraud and deceit. The case was perhaps the most closely watched corporate crime trial of the decade.

GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY -- Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling did in fact deceive investors about the real financial straits at Enron, the once-highflying energy company that imploded in a wave of accounting scandals, as a midlevel executive once predicted.
 After hearing four months of testimony and deliberating for five days, jurors convicted Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman and for many years its chief executive, on six counts of conspiracy and fraud. He is 64 and could be sentenced to as much as 45 years in federal prison.
The jury also convicted Mr. Skilling, who was an important adviser to Mr. Lay and was briefly Enron's chief executive, on 19 counts of conspiracy, fraud, insider trading and making false statements; it found him not guilty on nine counts, mostly insider trading. Mr. Skilling, 52, faces a maximum term of 185 years. 
 Separately, in a nonjury trial, Federal District Judge Simeon T. Lake found Mr. Lay guilty of bank fraud for not telling Bank of America that he intended to use $75 million in personal loans to buy stock.
 Judge Lake said he would sentence Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling on Sept. 11. Both men were released on $5 million bond until then. 

FEEDING FRENZY -- Having been outflanked in its effort to acquire the London Stock Exchange, the NYSE Group, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, turned its attention to Euronext, the pan-European exchange, which it offered to buy for as much as $10.2 billion. If successful, the takeover would create the first trans-Atlantic stock exchange.
 Almost as soon as the NYSE offer was broached, another exchange, Deutsche Borse of Germany, stepped up and offered to buy Euronext for about $10.6 billion. Euronext, which runs stock exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portugal, as well as a derivatives exchange in London, dismissed the German offer because it is partly payable in Deutsche Borse stock.
 Exchanges are interested in merging because that gives them access to more investors, which makes the exchanges more attractive to companies with stock to sell.
 NYSE's move may encourage the Nasdaq Stock Market to accelerate its incremental takeover of the London Stock Exchange. In a series of transaction, Nasdaq has amassed a 25 percent stake in the London market.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING -- Federal investigators expanded their inquiry into how some companies granted stock options to their senior executives, suspecting that they may have been backdated to guarantee the executives the biggest possible gains.
 More than 20 companies have received subpoenas from the Justice Department seeking information on their executive stock option plans going back as far as a decade. The UnitedHealth Group is the biggest company to acknowledge receiving a subpoena so far. Many others are technology companies, including Juniper Networks and the KLA-Tencor Corporation.
 Legal experts say it is unclear whether backdating option awards is illegal, but several groups of investors have filed class-action lawsuits against companies suspected of the practice.
 UnitedHealth has told its shareholders that it may have to restate its results for the last three years, acknowledging a ''significant deficiency'' in its options program.

SUSPICIOUSLY SMOOTH -- Senior executives at Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, ''deliberately and systematically'' manipulated the company's financial results for years as part of an $11 billion accounting scandal, federal regulators concluded.
 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, said the manipulation was intended to smooth fluctuations in the company's earnings, letting Fannie Mae regularly meet or exceed earnings targets set by Wall Street and thus set in motion large bonuses for its executives.
 Ofheo said Franklin D. Raines, the former chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae, was paid $90 million from 1998 to 2003. At least $52 million was tied to his meeting earnings targets that regulators say were reached by manipulating accounting.
 To settle civil charges by Ofheo and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fannie Mae will pay $50 million to those agencies and create a $350 million restitution fund to cover losses suffered by shareholders when the accounting irregularities came to light.

WARNING SIGNS -- The economy grew at a brisk 5.3 percent rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said, but economists said much of that represented pent-up demand after last year's hurricanes and they forecast slower growth for the rest of the year.
 Sales of new homes rebounded last month from March, but sales were down 5.7 percent from the month last year, prices were essentially flat and unsold homes piled up.
 At the same time, factories said orders for so-called durable goods -- planes, appliances and other products designed to last more than three years -- fell by 4.8 percent in April. Orders for computers and other electronics suffered their biggest decline in almost six years.
 The government is scheduled to release two important statistics next week: consumer confidence on Monday and job creation on Friday.

REGIONAL BEHEMOTH -- The Regions Financial Corporation agreed to acquire the AmSouth Bancorporation for about $9.8 billion in stock. Both banks are based in Birmingham, Ala., but have large branch networks in Texas, Florida and other fast-growing states.
 The merger, which the banks said would result in the nation's 10th-largest bank, will help both banks cut costs as they cope with higher interest rates, which squeeze banks' profit margins.
 Because the banks currently compete in so many states, the merger may face particularly close scrutiny from antitrust officials.

READ ALL ABOUT IT -- The shake-up in publishing advanced on two fronts this week, in Hollywood and Philadelphia.
 A group of private investors said shareholders had accepted their $9.7 billion offer for VNU, a Dutch company that owns Billboard magazine, The Hollywood Reporter newspaper and Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings company.
 Another group of private investors won the right to buy The Philadelphia Inquirer and its tabloid sibling, The Daily News, from McClatchy, which acquired both papers this year when it took over the Knight Ridder chain. The purchasers agreed to pay $562 million.
 McClatchy is still seeking buyers for six other newspapers that it acquired in the Knight Ridder takeover but that it has said it does not want to keep.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Sands Is Chosen To Build Singapore Casino 

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, May 26 

 BODY:
The government said Friday that it had chosen Las Vegas Sands to build and run the first of two planned casino resorts here, selecting the company's vision of a $3.2 billion, entertainment district over three competing bids that included two backed by government-owned companies.
 Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian Casino Resort in Las Vegas, beat out the Malaysian casino operator Genting and two Las Vegas rivals: MGM Mirage, which had teamed up with a local developer, CapitaLand, and Harrah's, which had joined with another local company, Keppel Land. Both companies are controlled by the government's investment arm, Temasek Holdings. 
 Las Vegas Sands promised to open the new resort by 2009. Bidding for the second casino resort, on a tourist island off Singapore's southern coast, will begin in October.
 It was just more than a year ago that Singapore lifted a 40-year ban on casinos as part of an effort to bolster tourism as more manufacturing jobs shift to countries with lower labor costs.
 While the final bids were not submitted until late March, the victory for Las Vegas Sands culminated a process that began in 2004, when Singapore first began approaching casino operators and experts as part of its study into how to introduce casinos while addressing fears that gambling might alter the country's low crime rate. 
 While Singapore's initial request for concepts drew offers from about 19 prospective bidders, all but the final four gradually pulled out, with some, like Stephen A. Wynn, the chief of Wynn Resorts, criticizing Singapore for micromanaging the projects out of profitability.
 While the companies' proposals were kept largely under wraps throughout the selection process, Las Vegas Sands disclosed plans to create a district with features like a waterfall and a museum designed by Moshe Safdie, the architect who designed the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem.
 The company also played on its strengths as a leader in the convention industry -- its chairman Sheldon G. Adelson created the Comdex consumer electronics trade show in 1979. 
 Dangling an economic lure, the company promised its project would create 10,400 jobs, 75 percent of them for local residents, and would account for 1 percent of Singapore's entire economy.
 ''I don't see any downside to it,'' said Richard Moray Armstrong, executive director of the CB Richard Ellis real estate services group in Singapore.
 Analysts said the project was already shaping up to be the world's most expensive casino resort. It will sit on 51 acres of reclaimed waterfront property opposite downtown Singapore that city planners are turning into a new central business district. Las Vegas Sands will receive a 30-year concession to operate the casino, which analysts estimate could bring in as much as $3.4 billion a year in revenue. The government has also included enticements like a low 15 percent tax on revenues and, bidders said, assurances that it will allow no additional casinos into the country for at least 10 years.
 Shares of Las Vegas Sands surged on the news, rising $5.96, to $69.63.
 Officials have played down the role of the casino in the project, referring to it as an ''integrated resort.'' To allay fears that the casino would bring in organized crime, bidders are being subjected to strict probity checks and Singapore has created regulatory bodies modeled on those in Nevada and Australia. 
 Some analysts are troubled, however, by the safeguards Singapore has put in place to try to reduce the temptation the casinos might present to local residents. To ensure that gambling at the casinos is no cheaper than the overseas alternatives Singaporeans already have, the government will require that locals pay either a daily entrance fee of 100 Singapore dollars ($63) or an annual fee of 2,000 Singapore dollars ($1,265).

HEADLINE: Evans Seen Atop List To Head Treasury

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
President Bush is leaning toward having one of his oldest friends take over the Treasury Department after a fruitless effort thus far to woo a star from Wall Street.
 Republicans with close ties to the White House said on Friday that Donald L. Evans, the former commerce secretary and a longtime Texas friend of the president, was a leading contender to succeed John W. Snow, who has indicated his desire to step down by early July.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Evans were to spend the weekend together at the presidential retreat at Camp David. Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, advised reporters not to read anything into that, saying it was not a last-minute invitation. 
 And a senior administration official, granted anonymity to discuss internal personnel deliberations, warned against drawing any conclusions when no decision had been made and when those most intimately involved in the discussions are not speaking about them.
 But Mr. Evans, who declined to comment, has been involved in some of the discussions over the Treasury secretary's successor, and has focused on ways to provide a smooth exit for Mr. Snow.
 That Mr. Evans is even being considered underscores the shift in focus of the search from Wall Street outsiders to Bush insiders. Among other people mentioned as potential successors to Mr. Snow are Carlos Gutierrez, the current commerce secretary, and Robert Zoellick, currently the deputy secretary of state and previously the United States trade representative.
 Administration allies said that senior officials had made overtures to prominent executives on Wall Street, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chairman of Goldman Sachs. White House strategists had been hoping to appoint a big name from the finance world that could help promote positive news on the economy that is being overshadowed by high gasoline prices and a generalized anxiety about the country's direction. 
 But Mr. Paulson and other executives expressed little interest in taking the post, in part because neither Mr. Snow nor his predecessor, Paul H. O'Neill, had any substantial role in shaping economic policy. 
 The real power to set priorities, whether it was cutting taxes in 2001 and 2003 or the failed effort to overhaul Social Security in 2005, has always been held by a small circle of advisers in the White House, including Vice President Dick Cheney.
 ''They couldn't get someone from Wall Street because nobody wanted the job,'' said one senior Republican aide in Congress, adding that the next Treasury secretary will essentially be a caretaker during Mr. Bush's last two years in office. 
 ''Think about it,'' the Republican said. ''If you're coming in at this particular stage, the most you can hope for is to have a little bit of influence on the fiscal 2008 budget.'' 
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a White House economist in Mr. Bush's first term and later a director of the Congressional Budget Office, said Mr. Evans would fit closely with Mr. Bush's desire for a Treasury secretary that serves primarily as a promoter rather than as an architect of his policies.
 ''He's reliable, and he can toe the party line without compromising his principles,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.
 Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation, said Mr. Evans would be a logical choice given Mr. Bush's strong inclination to rely on people he has known for a long time.
 ''In times of difficulty for a president, the president very often turns to his closest friends,'' Mr. Bloomfield said.
 Mr. Evans, 59, grew up in Texas and spent most of his career in the oil industry. Beginning as a ''roughneck'' working on oil rigs, he worked his way up to become chief executive of Tom Brown Inc., a big independent oil producer.
 His friendship with Mr. Bush dates back more than 30 years, when both men lived in Midland and worked in the oil industry. But their friendship evolved from business to politics as Mr. Bush set out to run for governor of Texas and then for president.

HEADLINE: In Springtime, Talk of Gloom If Not Doom 

BYLINE: By Conrad de Aenlle

 BODY:
AN adage on the investment show circuit is, ''Buy San Francisco, sell Las Vegas.''
 The enthusiasm for stocks that often envelops investors in springtime -- and sometimes accompanies market tops -- is often on display at the annual Las Vegas Money Show in May. Glumness is more likely to be evident at the California conclave in autumn, a time when stocks may be prone to reach a trough.
But if investors in Las Vegas earlier this month were euphoric, they had a funny way of showing it. When 1,500 or so were asked if they expected a further 10 percent rise in the market this year, no more than a few hands went up. Not many more were willing to go out on a shorter limb and forecast a 5 percent rise, either. 
 That was before the 214-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on May 17. The vote of no confidence also occurred before several speakers at the event made compelling cases for bailing out of stocks.
 Martin Weiss, chief executive of the Weiss Group, an asset management firm and investment newsletter publisher, said the stock market was traveling one of two unappealing paths: ''the inflation superhighway'' or ''the bumpy road to deflation.''
 ''If you're invested in the stock market,'' he said, ''the issue is which sectors you should be in and which you should avoid with a 10-foot pole.''
 Whichever outlook plays out, he said, there are likely to be far fewer stocks worth owning than steering clear of. If inflation is about to grip the economy, shares of commodity producers should continue to do well. If deflation is in store, there are fewer places to hide, with home builders and mortgage companies facing especially bleak prospects.
 An economy that may move toward one pole or the other ''doesn't leave much in the middle'' to latch onto, he said. He advised investors to ''short stocks that could get killed,'' like subprime mortgage lenders.
 As gloomy as Mr. Weiss's forecast was, Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, offered a bleaker outlook. He pointed to a number of imbalances in the economy, especially the trade deficit, and predicted a plunge in the dollar that would take stocks down with it once Asia decides to stop recycling dollars.
 ''The world, mainly Asian central banks, is preparing to pull the plug on the dollar,'' Mr. Schiff warned. ''When they do that, this artificial economy will go down the drain.''
 He agreed that real estate could be in particular trouble. ''We have a glut of housing, with a lot of homes owned by speculators,'' Mr. Schiff said.
 He attributed the rise in gold to fear of a dollar collapse, and he implored investors, ''Do not wait to watch your life savings evaporate with the dollar.''
 The bullish case was not without its supporters. Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan, Beck & Company, dismissed Mr. Schiff's alarmism and attached less importance to the spike in gold by reminding investors of the lean decades before the last few fat years.
 ''Gold buyers have been waiting 25 years to make a buck,'' Mr. Battipaglia said. ''Now they're saying gold is the answer.''
 If investors are overestimating the value of gold, they are not giving the dollar its due, he said. Foreign creditors would be engaging in the economic equivalent of murder-suicide, Mr. Battipaglia said, if they were to let the dollar fall precipitously and cripple their biggest customer.
 Louis Navellier, chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates and the editor of several advisory newsletters, said the dollar, even a falling one, posed no great threat.
 ''As the dollar gets cheaper, we export more,'' he said. Trade and currency flows form ''a symbiotic relationship,'' he said.
 Mr. Navellier was almost giddy in his appraisal of economic and market conditions. ''Not only do we have the second-longest economic expansion since the Reagan era, but it's accelerating,'' he said.
 Perhaps taking a little for granted, he added, ''The Fed is obviously done raising rates.'' Evidence of higher inflation last week, and the steep drop in stocks afterward, suggests others have not reached the same conclusion about Federal Reserve policy.
 Mr. Navellier did his best to lift spirits, but if investors remain unconvinced, that could be a positive sign, too. It is rare for bull markets to end amid such widespread skepticism, so selling Las Vegas this year may prove to be the wrong move.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS DEBATING TALKS WITH IRAN ON NUCLEAR ISSUE

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; David E. Sanger contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is beginning to debate whether to set aside a longstanding policy taboo and open direct talks with Iran, to help avert a crisis over Tehran's suspected nuclear weapons program, European officials and Americans close to the administration said Friday.
 European officials who have been in contact with the administration in recent weeks said the discussion was heating up, as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice worked with European foreign ministers to persuade Iran to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium.
 European leaders make no secret of their desire for the United States to join in the talks with Iran, if only to show that the Americans have gone the extra mile to avoid a confrontation that could spiral into a fight over sanctions or even military action.
 But since the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the crisis over the seizure of American hostages in November that year, the United States has avoided direct talks with Iran. There were sporadic contacts during the war in Afghanistan, in the early stages of the Iraq war and in the days after the earthquake in Bam, Iran, at the end of 2003. 
 European officials say Ms. Rice has begun discussing the issue with top aides at the State Department. Her belief, they say, is that ultimately the matter will have to be addressed by the administration's national security officials, whether talks with Iran remain at an impasse or even if there is some progress.
 But others who know her well say she is resisting on the ground that signaling a willingness to talk would show weakness and disrupt the delicate negotiations with Europe. Ms. Rice is also said to fear that the administration might end up making too many concessions to Iran.
 Administration officials said President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have opposed direct talks, even through informal back channels. As a result, many European officials say they doubt that a decision to talk is likely soon.
 The prospect of direct talks between the United States and Iran is so politically delicate within the Bush administration that the officials who described the emerging debate would discuss it only after being granted anonymity. 
 Those officials included representatives of several European countries, as well as Americans who said they had discussed the issue recently with people inside the Bush administration. Some of the officials made clear that they favored direct talks between the United States and Iran. 
 State Department officials refused to talk about the issue, even anonymously. But over the last week, administration spokesmen have been careful not to rule out talks. 
 Discussion about possible American contacts with Iran has been fueled not simply by the Europeans, but by a growing chorus of outsiders with ties to the administration who have spoken out in favor of talks.
 Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in a recent column in The Washington Post, raised the possibility that the recent rambling letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to President Bush -- dismissed by Ms. Rice as an offensive tirade-- could be seen as an opportunity to open contacts.
 Both Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former top aide to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Richard L. Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state under Mr. Powell, have also advocated talks with Iran. 
 ''Diplomacy is much more than just talking to your friends,'' Mr. Armitage said in a telephone interview. ''You've got to talk to people who aren't our friends, and even people you dislike. Some people in the administration think that diplomacy is a sign of weakness. In fact, it can show that you're strong.''
 Mr. Armitage held the last high-level discussions with Iran, after the Bam earthquake. In November 2004, Mr. Powell sat next to the Iranian foreign minister at a dinner during a conference in Egypt on Iraq, but he said they engaged only in small talk.
 The United States has stayed out of the talks with Iran, which began in late 2004 and got new life last summer when, with American endorsement, the Europeans offered to help Iran integrate politically and economically with the West if it ended its nuclear ambitions.
 Also on the table were unspecified security guarantees suggesting that Iran would not have to worry about outside efforts to topple the government. 
 The Europeans are now working with the United States, Russia and China on a revised package of economic, political and nuclear energy incentives if Iran ended its nuclear enrichment activities. Also being sought, at least by the Europeans and the United States, is an agreement to take Iran to the United Nations Security Council if it continues to defy the demands for compliance on nuclear issues.
 European officials say the discussions about possible American-Iranian contacts are not part of these talks, but would be a way to improve the atmosphere with Iran.
 Among the European diplomats who have urged Ms. Rice to consider direct contacts with Iran are Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, raised the issue with President Bush when she visited Washington earlier this year. 
 ''What's interesting about Rice is that she listens when you make your case,'' a European official said. 
 Another European diplomat said, ''It's a European aspiration for talks to happen,'' but added, ''Nothing is likely at the moment.'' Still another European diplomat said of the Americans that ''everyone and their brother has been telling them to do it.''
 One reason senior administration officials do not like the idea of talking with Iran, many of them say, is that they are not certain Iranian leaders would respond positively. A rebuff from Iran, even to a back-channel query, is to be avoided at all costs, various officials agree.
 The administration, for example, has been embarrassed by the on-again, off-again possibility of talks with Iran on Iraq, which were authorized by Ms. Rice late last year. 
 The concern, some say, is that talking to Iran only about Iraq will anger Sunni dissidents in Iraq, reinforcing the Sunni-led insurgency while enhancing the status of Iraqi Shiites, whose strong ties to Iran make Washington uneasy.
 On the other hand, the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, was said to be eager to enlist Iran in helping to deal with Iranian-backed Shiite militias, which are accused of carrying out killings and kidnappings of Sunnis in Iraq.
 Some Europeans favor American participation in the European-Iranian talks, at least down the road. Others raise the possibility of informal contacts through nongovernmental organizations or policy institutes.
 Incentives and possible sanctions against Iran are to be the focus of negotiations between the United States and the European nations in coming days and weeks.
 The United States is resisting the Europeans' desire to increase economic incentives for Iran, because that would involve a lifting of American sanctions on European businesses that helped Iran. At the same time, Russia and China are resisting the idea of seeking a new resolution at the United Nations Security Council that could be seen as clearing the way for sanctions or possible military action against Iran.

HEADLINE: Mexican President Thanks Bush for Support on Changes in Immigration 

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON; Antonio Betancourt contributed reporting from Mexico City for this article.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 26 

 BODY:
On the last day of his four-day visit to the United States, President Vicente Fox of Mexico spoke with President Bush to thank him for his support for the sweeping immigration changes that were passed by the Senate this week.
 Deputy Foreign Minister Geronimo Gutierrez said Mr. Fox had reached President Bush Friday morning. Mr. Gutierrez said President Fox ''recognized President Bush's leadership'' in standing against fierce opposition from within the Republican Party, promoting increased security along the United States-Mexico border and expanding guest worker programs. 
 Mr. Fox also restated Mexico's commitment to working with the United States to strengthen security along the border and to create more jobs so that its people do not feel the need to migrate.
 Mr. Gutierrez said: ''We know that this visit came at a sensitive time. But all the comments that have come to us from Washington have told us that President Fox did a good job, and that his visit was a positive, not a negative.''
 A White House spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said, ''The two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to work together to secure the border and build economic prosperity in both countries.''
 Political analysts here and in Mexico said it might be too early to tell if Mr. Fox's visit had an impact on Washington, where legislators have yet to resolve stark differences over immigration. But they said Mr. Fox achieved his goal of making Mexico's views heard by the conservative forces opposed to them, without appearing to meddle in American affairs.
 That, on its own, the analysts said, seemed a small triumph.
 ''Mexico has been demonized in the last eight months of the immigration debate,'' said a close adviser to Mr. Fox's government, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about these matters. ''When he is at a distance, it's easy to put horns on him.
 ''But when people have the chance to see him,'' the adviser said of Mr. Fox, ''to hear him talk about how Mexico is working to create jobs, and to increase security on the border, it has an impact.''
 Mr. Fox did not deviate much from those messages during his sweep through Utah, Washington State and California. 
 Wary that his words could inflame the passions of Republican conservatives, Mr. Fox canceled a press conference that had been scheduled at the start of his trip and then refused requests for interviews. Still, during his appearances, he made some of the strongest statements ever to come from a Mexican head of state about his country's responsibility for the problem of illegal migration. At the same time, he urged the United States to do more than build walls.
 Time and again during his trip, Mr. Fox said his government was committed to ''continue expanding jobs in Mexico so that migration is no longer a necessity.''
 Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said he did not believe that those messages had been heard in Congress. But in the meantime, he said, Mr. Fox had succeeded at beginning to build a political base for his cause from the bottom up.
 ''What the Mexican government can do effectively is to build support for its cause at the state level,'' Mr. Selee said. ''It's a longer-term effort, but if you want to change votes in Washington, it's important to reach their constituents. That's where the real debate lies.''
 In Mexico, political analysts like Denise Dresser and Rafael Fernandez de Castro of the Technological Autonomous Institute of Mexico were skeptical about the chances of immigration reform and said they lamented that President Fox had failed to sway the debate.
 ''There are people worried about the Latinization of the United States, because there has been a browning of the United States,'' Mr. Fernandez said. ''This is a very serious and very difficult debate. And Mexico, for better or worse, is not being taken into account, not even when the president is in the United States.''

HEADLINE: Whew: Relief from Bad News in the Markets

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market rebounded last week, and all three major Wall Street indexes advanced after two weeks of losses. 
 The gains were part of a global rally in stocks, which recovered after a steep sell-off that began on May 17 with a report suggesting that inflation was on the rise in the United States. The data set off speculation that the Federal Reserve might continue its long-running campaign to raise short-term interest rates. 
On Thursday and Friday last week, though, stocks rose with the release of fresh numbers indicating that American consumer spending remained strong while inflation held at expected levels. On Friday a report on personal consumption, excluding food and energy, showed an annual increase of 2.1 percent in April.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 134.55 points, or 1.2 percent, to close at 11,278.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.1 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,280.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 16.49 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2,210.37.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond dropped to 5.05 percent from 5.06 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Quick Course in the Economics of Confusion

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY nephew, Jonathan, a historian, likes to make a humorous toast that was heard at George Washington's dinner table during the Revolutionary War. It goes simply, ''Confusion to the British.'' 
 Of course, we now love the British; in fact, we have for a long time. But the toast that we seem to be making to ourselves these days is simpler, on both sides of the aisle:
''Confusion to ourselves.'' 
 On the Democratic and Republican-in-Name-Only side, we have the idea of ''windfall profits taxes'' on energy companies. These would presumably mandate a desirable level of corporate profits in one sector on which we depend. (And how long do you think it would apply to only one industry?) If profits exceeded that level, they would be taxed. 
 As far as I can tell, there is no plan to give a rebate to the companies if their profits have fallen below that desired level.
 In other words, the plan is to send this message to energy-company investors, including retirees and pension funds: ''Yes, we are in a situation of oil and gas shortage. Yes, we want you to risk billions of dollars exploring for and producing and refining oil and processing gas. But if you succeed for any reason, and even if no price-fixing is found, we will punish you for it.''
 This is what I would call confusion. You usually get more of something by rewarding people for doing it or producing it, not by punishing them for doing it or producing it. 
 Yes, the human instinct of envy demands that we get some licks in against people who are doing well, even if we are doing only slightly less well ourselves. But economies built on the politics of envy are rarely successful. Ask the Cambodians or the Chinese or the Russians before they went capitalist.
 On the right side of the aisle, there is breathtaking confusion about supply-side economics. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has been touring the money programs on television, touting the effects of the Bush tax cuts on federal revenues, ''explaining,'' as one might say, that this proves that supply-side theory really does work and you really can get something for nothing. He is partly right, in the same sense that you could borrow a bit more than $4 trillion to buy stocks and then tell people you are worth $4 trillion -- if you don't count the money you owed. 
 Supply side has a genesis in respectability that comes largely from my idol, the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago. Professor Friedman said that if we cut taxes, government would be kept from being so big and intrusive and such a threat to civil liberties. That makes sense if you have a government of responsible adults. (Alas, we don't.) 
 Then along came another friend, Arthur Laffer, a likable and intelligent man who, with no substantial backup at all in data that I am aware of, said that if you cut taxes on income, you would stimulate so much economic activity that you would collect as much in tax as you did when rates were higher.
 Note that this was actually a supposed refinement on Keynesian economics, which indeed predicted economic growth if you cut taxes and ran a deficit because government would spend at a higher rate than consumers. (This is wildly oversimplified, and I apologize for that.) John Maynard Keynes also did not have a lot of data for his theories, but they appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, so they were tried on a tiny scale during the Depression.
 Did they work? They did not work in the Depression, probably because the scale of the deficits was far too small. But they worked like gangbusters in World War II, when federal deficits were running roughly 40 percent of gross national product and the economy was exploding with growth.
 What we saw in the years of President Ronald Reagan -- and now President Bush -- was not in any sense a vindication of the genius Professor Friedman or the persuasive and charming Mr. Laffer. 
 Cutting taxes has not produced the federal spending cuts that Professor Friedman was hoping for. Not even close. Federal spending as a percentage of G.N.P. barely changed under President Reagan. The gusher of income tax receipts that was promised to shrink the deficit to as low or lower than the level before the tax cuts didn't happen, either. 
 Indeed, under my pal Mr. Bush, whom I still love and admire despite his human flaws, government spending has risen as income tax receipts have fallen. (The missing responsible adults again, perhaps.) Five years into a recovery, income tax receipts are still lower than they were in merry President Bill Clinton's last year at the helm. (Corporate profits receipts have risen.) 
 We have deficits such as have never been dreamed of in the absence of a world war, with more than $2 trillion added to the total national debt since 2001. And all that borrowing and spending has worked as Keynes guessed they might.
 YES, we do have a very strong economy by many metrics -- alas, not including personal hourly income, but that's for another day. We have full employment and stupendous corporate profits. We even have a labor shortage. 
 But this is not a redemption of supply side theory, which promised growth that was enough to cause tax receipts to rise. It is a redemption of old-fashioned Keynesianism. 
 As it turned out, Mr. Reagan and the current president were and are the real Keynesian disciples, not F.D.R. or any other Democrat. The Republicans turn out to be the party of Keynes, as President Richard M. Nixon long ago acknowledged when he famously declared in 1971: ''Now I am a Keynesian.''
 Supply side is fun in the same way it's fun to rationalize spending as if it were saving, and in the same way any theory is fun when it says that the easier, softer way is better than the hard way. But it doesn't work, or at least it hasn't worked yet.
 ''Tax and spend'' was the old way, but people did not like to be taxed. The new way seems to be ''don't tax, but keep spending and things will be fine.'' 
 Wouldn't it be pretty if it were true?

HEADLINE: Jobs Report May Signal Soft Landing

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THIS is the point in the Federal Reserve interest rate cycle when traders act like economic air-traffic controllers, watching for signs that the Fed is raising rates just enough to engineer a soft landing. 
 One indication of whether the economy is on the right course and speed will come on Friday, when the May employment report is released. A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that 175,000 net new jobs were created, up from 138,000 in April.
Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services, finds that forecast a bit ambitious and predicts ''mildly disappointing'' job growth.
 ''I'm looking for a number in the 150,000-to-170,000 range,'' he said. ''We have had some weaker-than-expected numbers cropping up in the last week or two. That makes me wonder whether we've been having job growth'' as strong as it was earlier this year, when 200,000 new jobs each month was typical. 
 But a little disappointment could persuade the Fed to pause before raising rates again. Mr. Cheney said that he -- and the stock market -- would be pleased to see a slightly smaller total. ''The perfect Goldilocks number is in the 150,000 range,'' he said.
 That is few-enough jobs to allow investors to hope that the Fed will slow down, but not so few as to stir fear of a slump.
 ''People, on balance, think there's a pause coming up, and a weak number will reinforce that,'' Mr. Cheney said. Jobs growth close to the April figure means that ''the Fed is much more likely to pause and stay paused for a while,'' he predicted.
 But he warned that significantly lower numbers for job creation might convince traders to pause themselves before buying stocks, because of the possible impact of weak job growth on consumer confidence.
 ''There are things weighing on consumers,'' Mr. Cheney noted. ''The housing market is slowing down, and gas prices are helping to empty your wallet. As long as we've got employment and incomes rising, we're going to get consumer spending growth.''

DATA WATCH -- The state of the consumer's psyche may become clearer on Tuesday when the Conference Board, a private research organization, offers its assessment of consumer confidence in May. The Bloomberg News poll foresees a sharp decline to 100.0 from 109.6 in April.
 Conditions in the manufacturing economy may not be much better. The Institute of Supply Management index is expected on Thursday to show a decrease in the expansion of the nation's factories in May, with a reading of 55.8, versus 57.3 in April.

HEADLINE: Home Sweet Home, Built in a Factory

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
THE DATE PALM COUNTRY CLUB near Palm Springs, Calif., operated by Equity Lifestyle Properties, offers stylish homes with dazzling views of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains. It also has three swimming pools, a golf course and tennis courts. Homes at Sunlake Estates in Grand Island, Fla., near Ocala National Forest, which are sold by American Land Lease, have spacious kitchens and scenic lake views, along with access to a 41-slip marina and a community garden.
 A casual observer would probably never know that both of these communities were essentially planned and built in a factory -- or at least the homes were. But investors who are looking for that next big real estate opportunity are well aware of the rise of such developments in the industry. (Just ask Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway recently paid $1.7 billion for Clayton Homes, a big manufactured-housing company based in Knoxville, Tenn.)
Manufactured-housing communities have come a long way from the days of flat-roofed ''single wides'' and ''double wides'' in trailer parks. Investors are hoping that the new upscale neighborhoods and others like them that are springing up around the country may further enhance the sector's image. 
 But the industry, which includes mobile home parks as well, has many challenges to overcome. It is still recovering from a spate of foreclosures and repossessions at the start of this decade stemming from overproduction and lax lending standards during the 1990's. Low mortgage rates have also hurt sales by making conventional ''site built'' homes more affordable for those who might otherwise have bought a manufactured unit. 
 ''It was really a perfect storm against this industry,'' said Paul E. Adornato, a senior research analyst at Harris Nesbitt.
 As a result, the real estate investment trusts that focus on manufactured-housing communities -- the main vehicle for average investors interested in the sector -- have woefully underperformed most other REIT's. In 2005, the sector lost 2.58 percent, on average, and its annualized return over the last five years has been just 9.73 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. By contrast, equity REIT's over all returned 12.16 percent last year and 20.81 percent, annualized, over five years, the association said. (The sector's dividend yield averages 3.56 percent, versus 4.21 percent for all equity REIT's.) 
 Some industry analysts, though, say the sector, which consists of four REIT's, is now poised to rebound as interest rates rise and as more cities face a growing need for inexpensive housing. (The average price for a manufactured home is around $60,000, excluding land leasing fees, compared with more than $200,000 for a site-built house, also excluding land, according to the latest data provided by the Manufactured Housing Institute.) Also helping, analysts say, are shifting demographics, namely aging baby boomers looking to downsize or to buy affordable second homes.
 ''You're going to see demand from baby boomers who are selling their homes up North and relocating down South,'' said David B. Rodgers, who follows real estate for RBC Capital Markets and is cautiously optimistic about the sector. 
 But others say they believe that any recovery will be slow. ''Investors should concentrate their focus in other REIT sectors,'' the Atlantis Investment Company, based in Parsippany, N.J., said bluntly in a recent report. 
 Robert McMillan, who covers real estate for Standard & Poor's Equity Research, agreed, adding that he thought the market was ''inherently risky.''
 ''People who decide to live in manufactured housing, for the most part, aren't as well off as the mainstream,'' he said. ''They have limited disposable income, which makes them more susceptible to economic shocks, and I also think that somehow limits the companies' ability to pass increased costs or to raise rents as much as they might like.''
 But Mr. McMillan sees some bright spots. In particular, he said, he likes Equity Lifestyle Properties, which has a controlling interest in 294 resorts in 30 states and British Columbia. The REIT, whose chairman is the billionaire investor Samuel Zell, reported a 16 percent increase in first-quarter earnings from a year ago, after reporting a loss in all of 2005. The company, based in Chicago and formerly known as Manufactured Home Communities, focuses on resort and age-restricted retirement communities like the Date Palm Country Club in California. 
 ''That differentiates them from the others,'' Mr. McMillan said.
 Mr. Adornato of Harris Nesbitt likes Equity Lifestyle, too, along with American Land Lease, a REIT based in Clearwater, Fla., which also caters to the retirement market. American Land Lease has interests in 29 residential communities, including a recreational vehicle park, in Arizona, Florida and New Jersey. The company recently reported a 4 percent increase in its first-quarter net income, compared with a year ago.
 Mr. Adornato and other analysts are more cautious about the other two REIT's in the sector: Sun Communities and UMH Properties, which recently changed its name from United Mobile Homes. They focus more on all-age communities, they say, which have fewer amenities than the age-restricted or resort versions and typically a less financially stable customer base. 
 Sun Communities, which has its headquarters in Southfield, Mich., recently reported a $429,000 net loss in the first quarter, while UMH Properties, based in Freehold, N.J., said its quarterly net income fell 13 percent from the first quarter of the previous year.
 (Affordable Residential Communities, an Englewood, Colo., company that focuses on all-age communities, recently eliminated its REIT status. The company, which reported a net loss of $3.9 million in the first quarter, had suspended dividend distributions last year.) 
 ''This is kind of the tougher side of the business,'' Mr. Adornato said of the all-age communities. ''A family lives in a mobile home partly because they can't afford a single-family home elsewhere.''
 Still, Ralph L. Block, a senior REIT portfolio manager at the Phocas Financial Corporation and author of ''Investing in REIT's'' (Bloomberg Press, 2002), sees potential in the sector over all. (After all, a distressed industry can yield big returns -- if it recovers. Just ask Mr. Buffett.)
 As a market sector, manufactured-home communities ''may not be doing so hot, but there are several distinct advantages in holding these kinds of assets,'' Mr. Block said. 
 For one thing, he said, such communities ''have a pretty low rate of capital expenditures required -- the tenants own their own homes and keep the maintenance up on their homes and the owners of the park take care of common property like the clubhouse.''
 The turnover rate of residents is generally low in land-lease communities, he added, explaining that it is often difficult to move a unit out once it is set in place. 
 The Manufactured Housing Institute forecasts shipments of around 145,000 housing units this year, slightly lower than the 147,000 last year. The 2005 production, however, was up sharply from the 130,000 or so in 2004 and 2003, according to Thomas Beers, the trade group's vice president for economics, who attributed the increase largely to a need for temporary housing after the hurricanes that struck the Gulf Coast. 
 Since 1976, most homes have been required to meet strict certification standards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that focus on design and construction, strength and durability, transportability and fire resistance, among other things. The HUD code also sets performance standards for the heating, plumbing, air-conditioning, thermal, and electrical systems.
 Many manufactured units, Mr. Beers says, are often indistinguishable from stick-built housing. They can have pitched roofs, vaulted ceilings and myriad amenities like fireplaces, porches and spas. Two-story versions are also available. ''Really,'' he said, ''the sky's the limit.''

HEADLINE: What to Do When the Oil (Or the Innovation) Is Gone?

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
WITH global economic growth near its fastest pace in decades, is there a chance that we'll finally run out of the resources we need? 
 Oil, copper and even people will someday be noticeably scarcer than they are today, and technology may not always provide a way out.
In the last few years, rapid growth in China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies has coincided, not surprisingly, with an upward trend in the prices of commodities like oil. In the short term, there's not enough time for suppliers to cope with ballooning demand; that's part of why prices rise. But market dynamics in the long term are likely to be more significant.
 It's simple mathematics. Even though the world's population may peak sometime in this century, the global economy is likely to keep growing. Yet the planet is, for now, a closed system: we have finite amounts of every single raw material. At some point, surely, we'll use them up. 
 Or will we? This sort of thing has already happened. ''There was a time when whales were being hunted to get oil for lamps,'' said Jorge E. Montepeque, global director for market reports at Platts, an energy industry information firm. ''The number of whales started to decline. The price for it started to increase and, at some point, new technology kicked in.''
 Rather than paying higher prices for whale oil, people found new ways to light their homes -- kerosene, propane and even electricity. Crude oil, however, may present more of a conundrum.
 ''Is there any source of energy that will be cheaper, for example, than Saudi oil?'' asked Robert U. Ayres, an emeritus professor of economics, political science and technology management at Insead in France.
 In his opinion, even with conservation and innovation, the answer is no. Professor Ayres said companies and homeowners would eventually have to pay a higher price for their energy. He also said that other commodities were in danger of scarcity, sooner rather than later.
 ''The big problem probably will hit with the very scarce metals or semimetals that are used in semiconductors, superconductors, LED's and that sort of thing, or platinum,'' he said. ''Platinum is very important because of its catalytic property. There's no substitute for it.''
 Copper wire -- a standard in homes and factories -- may also be harder to come by. Silver is more conductive, but there's much less of it, Professor Ayres said. Aluminum is less conductive, so you need a lot more of it, and passing a current through it generates heat. 
 At the moment, he added, only about half a percent of the copper ore mined in the United States ends up as useable copper, an amount that is much less than in the past.
 Technology and innovation are still likely to find a way around shortages, though, argued Dale W. Jorgenson, a university professor at Harvard. ''This debate occurred before,'' he said. ''The very rapid growth of the 1970's, which was fully as impressive as the current growth that we're experiencing now, didn't result in any increase in the price of oil or other commodities, and isn't likely to do so this time, either.''
 The supply of crude oil will benefit from technological improvements, Professor Jorgenson predicted. ''People figure out clever ways to explore for oil, to produce it and transport it,'' he said. ''All of that goes in the other direction.''
 There is also the chance that a burst of innovation will lay low the entire market. Imagine, for instance, what would happen if scientists finally developed a portable nuclear fusion reactor -- the kind that could power a house or a car. But it's tough to say when, or if, that will happen. ''The whole fusion program -- people have being saying for the last 40 years that it's 50 years out,'' said John L. Staub, an industry economist at the Energy Department's energy information administration. ''Well, it's still 50 years out.''
 And even ignoring technological changes, Mr. Montepeque said, it's a dangerous game to make dire long-term forecasts about the supply of commodities like crude oil -- or any forecasts at all, for that matter. 
 ''Being sensible people, we can say that the amount of oil, coal, shale, gas is finite,'' he said. ''Do we know how much there is down there? The plain answer is, nobody has any idea.''
 There are a couple of areas, however, where scarcity is more predictable. ''The long-run scarcities are for human labor and land,'' said Peter H. Lindert, a professor of economics at the University of California, Davis. He said their value, in terms of goods and services, would continue to rise forever.
 Professor Lindert said the market for low-skilled labor, in particular, was likely to tighten in the coming decades. In the case of high-skilled labor, there are moderating factors. 
 ''Low fertility won't hurt us in that respect, because you will get probably a slight improvement in development per kid by having so few,'' he said. ''The family puts more resources and parental time into each kid, schools are less crowded and so forth.'' 
 The competition for talent is already intensifying, Professor Jorgenson said. He recently saw signs for a Microsoft recruiting session at a hotel in Sofia, Bulgaria. ''These people aren't even members of the European Union, but they graduate engineers that Microsoft would like to hire,'' he said. ''There is going to be a labor shortage, I don't think there's any doubt about that.''
 IN Europe and Japan, populations are shrinking already -- a trend that Professor Jorgenson attributes to hostility to immigration. As this occurs, he said, wages will begin to rise as each worker in the thinning labor force gains access to more capital. But even as workers become more valuable, more of their income will be siphoned off to support the growing legions of the elderly.
 Economic growth will also slow, Professor Jorgenson added, since you can't keep substituting capital for labor forever. ''The question is, when do you encounter those diminishing returns?''
 The best proof that even the experts don't know the answers to these questions may be that they're still busy being experts. When asked if he had forecast the point at which the world would find the limits of its oil supply, Mr. Staub responded, ''If I knew that, I wouldn't be working where I'm working.''

 BODY:
Many spring and summer cookbooks are like plays that get tried out in New Haven in hopes of making it to Broadway. Publishers nudge them onstage before a small house, hoping they won't choke, praying for a sleeper hit.
Yet even at this Off-Broadway time of year it's hard to get anyone's attention, because there's a glut of grilling books, as well as celebrity cookbooks. This spring, Giada -- aren't we on a first-name basis by now? -- Mario and Rachael all have new marketing tools to peddle. Still, the careful shopper can find some quietly terrific cookbooks. 
 The most entertaining among them is SAUCEPANS AND THE SINGLE GIRL (Warner, $13.95) by Jinx Morgan and Judy Perry, a reissue of their 1965 edition. Entertaining, other than in the Martha Stewart sense, isn't a word that applies to many modern cookbooks, which have become so serious, so earnest, so painfully dry. But not nearly so dry as the pitcher of martinis Morgan and Perry recommend keeping chilled in the refrigerator. Drinking a lot was a good idea back then, because -- except for Julia Child -- the 1960's weren't a high point for the American culinary arts. A single girl's staples included such divine edibles as instant potatoes, garlic powder, dried parsley and MSG. And smoked salmon was as rarified as goat gizzards. So how did two young women from California survive? By making do, with dishes like onion-glazed pork chops, prepared with dried onion soup mix, that aren't half bad; sardines and cream cheese; and the flawless ''Ye Olde Snack Mix'' (that is, homemade Chex mix).
 Morgan and Perry write in a fast-paced, amused tone that recalls Lucille Ball. Dishes aren't served, they're carried ''flaming to the table.'' Shrimp are cooked for 5 minutes ''or until you get bored.'' When shopping for a honeydew for ''Soused Melon,'' they advise: ''Ask that nice motherly lady pushing her cart around the produce section to find a ripe one for you.'' Punctuating a list of variations on scrambled eggs is this: ''Haven't you any imagination?''
 Rather than updating the book within the original text, Morgan and Perry have smartly added footnotes that sustain the flair of the original. Beneath a recipe for heating up canned wild rice, they write: ''Someone should have held our heads underwater in a distant rice paddy when we even gave voice to this idea.'' With a Jell-O and ice cream parfait pie, they add, ''Oh, dear.''
 Maida Heatter's recipes have aged more gracefully than Morgan and Perry's. The reprint of her 1980 work, MAIDA HEATTER'S BOOK OF GREAT CHOCOLATE DESSERTS (Andrews McMeel, $24.95), includes whoopee pies and Doris Duke's bittersweet chocolate ice milk (which makes more than three quarts of iced chocolate pudding; you eat it blissfully, then die).
 Craig Claiborne, to whom the book is dedicated, called Heatter ''one of the world's best home dessert makers.'' Heatter's gift, like Julia Child's, is an ability to record her recipes precisely and in a tone that makes you feel she's peering over your shoulder, always a few steps ahead. She knows when a spring-form pan will leak and tells you to place it on top of a baking pan. She senses that you'll have a tendency to over-whip a batter and warns you not to.
 If Heatter were a mechanic you'd want her working on your car. Her mind is a catalog of economy and refinement. You learn how to choose the best baking sheets (those with just one raised edge); how to ice a cake without smearing icing on the cake plate; and how to freeze egg whites properly. Yet Heatter's no snob -- she recommends Revere ware for cooking, and un-self-consciously marches through a repertory that includes a three-page recipe for eclairs along with ones for chocolate soda, chocolate merry-go-round cake and brownies. She's not a schoolmarm either. Enthusiastic without being sappy, she writes of a chocolate chiffon cake: ''This fantastically dramatic cake is over four inches high, as light as a cloud, moist, and very dark.'' And it is.
 I've cooked countless recipes from this and other books by Heatter and -- with the possible exception of an oddly mushy orange chocolate loaf cake -- she's no slouch. I loved her recipes for ''The World's Best Hot Fudge Sauce'' and an intense, downy 86-proof chocolate cake, doused with bourbon.
 The book that surprised me most was TOWN/COUNTRY: 150 Recipes for Life Around the Table (Clarkson Potter, $37.50) by the chef Geoffrey Zakarian. What makes this highly stylized cookbook one of the best of the year is a risky but unusually well-executed gimmick. Using the names of his two New York restaurants -- Town and Country -- Zakarian explores his 65 favorite ingredients by making both ''town'' and ''country'' recipes with each. Grapefruit gratin with a grapefruit-ginger sorbet is a town recipe; grapefruit ambrosia is country. Beets are combined with strawberries in a risotto for the city and are baked over salt in the country.
 This is the way many people think about cooking: there's an easy-going style of cooking when you're with family and a more ambitious kind of cooking when you're having a dinner party. With Zakarian, both can be interesting. A fantastic chilled corn soup with fresh nutmeg is blended with a broth made from water and corncobs. Apple puree is seasoned with miso paste. Serrano ham with melon is given an extra splash of flavor with yuzu juice (an Asian citrus) and pistachios.
 Zakarian can also be a helpful technician -- he tells you how to apply an olive and herb crust to a rack of lamb without having it fall apart (by rolling and chilling it) -- and this allows you to forgive his occasional over-the-top chef lapses. His recipe for hot crab tea with tomato-caper raviolini is going to paralyze the average town or country home cook. How about just the crab tea and calling it a day?
 Another new restaurant cookbook is CASA MORO (Ebury Press/Trafalgar Square, $35) by Sam and Sam Clark, the married couple who run the popular Moro restaurant in London. Published in England in 2004, this second cookbook by the Clarks is just now being distributed in America. For every crisp, modern detail in Zakarian's book, the Clarks provide a wallop of grit. Many of the pictures show them preparing Spanish and Moroccan dishes in their house in Andalusia, their hands smeared with oil and herbs and sweat on their brows, sauteing in cheap pans and serving with mismatched spoons. At a certain point you realize, ''Oh, this looks just like my kitchen.'' But it doesn't detract from the fantasy of eating and living well that so many cookbooks provide. The Clarks look happy, their kids appear playful and content; their food seems so lusty and pure that you want to climb right into the photos and dig in.
 I made a number of their recipes and plan to continue foraging through the book. Asparagus was served with two wildly fragrant sauces, one a paste of garlic, blanched almonds and sherry vinegar, the other made with parsley, garlic, Serrano ham and lemon juice. Medjool dates were macerated in a tar-colored espresso syrup teeming with cardamom and cinnamon and served with thick Greek yogurt. Lamb shanks were simmered with tomatoes, cumin and saffron, then showered with fresh peas shortly before serving.
 There's nothing precise in the Clarks' cooking and certainly not in their recipes, which may send some readers into cardiac arrest. With the lamb, for instance, once all the ingredients are in the pot, they write: ''Cover and cook for 1*-2 hours, or until the meat is almost tender.'' Good luck!
 For more hand-holding, turn to a sensible American author like Deborah Madison. Her latest book, VEGETABLE SOUPS FROM DEBORAH MADISON'S KITCHEN (Broadway, paper, $19.95), drew me in with a recipe for Mexican tomato broth. It's first infused with zucchini, cilantro, beet leaves, jalapeno and what seems like at least 83 other things, which are later strained out to form a peppery tomato consomme topped with slices of avocado and a pinch of dried oregano. After all the chopping, it's the kind of recipe that could lead you to burn the book. But this broth has great depth and a simmering heat, and the vegetables are so hideously limp after cooking that you don't mind throwing them away.
 Madison's pragmatism lures you into the kitchen. Fluidly blending Asian and European ingredients, like soy sauce in a roasted vegetable broth, she has a knack for small but original ideas and a palate that hews to classics. Black bean soup, which I've never thought could amount to more than sludge, is nicely finished with coconut milk, lime and chilies; a tomato bisque is given a touch of wood fire with smoked paprika; and lentil soup is seasoned with pounded walnuts and cream.
 Because it's nearing summer, the lentil soup will have to wait. Instead I made a snappy chilled avocado soup, sharpened with buttermilk and yogurt and textured with chopped herbs and slivered radishes.
 At a weak and hungry moment, I picked up A PASSION FOR ICE CREAM (Chronicle, $35) by Emily Luchetti, which is not the definitive ice cream book and perhaps not even a great ice cream book -- but who can resist coffee sherbet? Luchetti, the pastry chef at Farallon in San Francisco, thinks like a professional. For her, ice creams aren't singular achievements but elements of composed dishes. Creme fraiche ice cream is piped into rolled cinnamon tuiles. Lime ice cream is topped with sugared mint leaves and a blueberry sauce.
 Stick to the recipes and skip Luchetti's headnotes, which can be painfully wistful and saccharine. To introduce black cow sundaes she writes: ''Kids slurp them down until they get brain freeze. Girls on stools at the ice cream counter sip root beer floats and bat their eyelashes at boys. Older folks enjoy the refreshing jolt of cold root beer and ice cream.'' Where -- on ''Leave It to Beaver''? It's true that at most shops, you won't get ice creams as flavorful as Luchetti's. Although her mint chip ice cream could have been more mint and less chip, it wasn't shy. And her strawberry and passion fruit ice pops were profoundly flavored and -- the true sign of a good recipe -- worth the trouble of straining out all those microscopic strawberry seeds.

Lives of the Cooks
If taste is ephemeral, so is the memory of those who have influenced that taste. ''In putting this book together,'' writes Alice Arndt, the editor of CULINARY BIOGRAPHIES (YES PRESS, $48), ''we were surprised to note how many of our biographees were renowned in their own time, yet had later been almost completely forgotten. The names of the most famous cooks of their day, the most influential writers and thinkers, the most fashionable restaurateurs, often bring blank looks when mentioned today.'' Among these are Eliza Acton, the 19th-century English cookbook writer who came up with the idea of ingredient lists in recipes; Nicolas-Francois Appert, who figured out how to preserve food in glass bottles and tin cans, spawning an entire industry; and Count Rumford, a British military officer of the late 18th century, who invented an early form of the convection oven.
 With entries written by nearly a hundred contributors, the book is a pleasure to read: it makes you grateful that so many were possessed by their hunger to further our understanding and enjoyment of food. To her credit, Arndt took great pains to make the book as international as possible, including figures like Yuan Mei, a Chinese poet and epicure, and K. T. Achaya, an Indian food historian. And she opens the door for readers to suggest more culinary biographies in future editions.
 One of the book's most helpful aspects is its system for cross-referencing. In the entry for Poppy Cannon, author of ''The Can-Opener Cookbook,'' contemporaries like James Beard, M. F. K. Fisher and Alice B. Toklas are mentioned in bold print -- so you can skip from biography to biography, building your own map of people and shifts in the culinary world. Amanda Hesser

HEADLINE: A Refuge in the Arts 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL L. ROYCE; As told to Claudia H. Deutsch.

 BODY:
I GREW up in Miami, with a complicated, tortured and volatile father and a mother who tried everything to make a bad marriage work. My father abandoned the family in 1982, but I'm still sure that growing up with him was the reason I wound up in the arts. 
 When my dad married my mom, he was 23 and she was 18, and they had my older brother, David, just one year later. My dad felt trapped by the parental and fiscal responsibilities. He found his peace through drinking and Valium and beating David, sometimes severely. 
I did everything I could to fade into the background so my father would have no cause to beat me. My younger sister, Lori, was daddy's princess, but she was affected by all the chaos, too. 
 Even as teenagers, we turned to the arts as a way to escape the dynamics of our home life. Lori took up painting; David played electric guitar. I joined the drama club, because when you don't enjoy being yourself, it's good to try on other characters. 
 I studied drama at N.Y.U., but I dropped out because I just couldn't pay attention to the academic part of the courses. I was a waiter, a busboy, even ran my own cleaning service. And I took courses at various acting studios. 
 I was doing O.K. -- until I went home for Hanukkah in 1982. I kept asking Mom where Dad was, until she finally told me: he'd walked out a week earlier, leaving a note wedged in the frame of the bedroom mirror saying he was starting a new life. He didn't even take his clothes, just a couple of guns I'd never even known he had. 
 I was in shock. My father had always insisted he loved my mother and his children. Suddenly none of it seemed real. I became distrustful of everyone. I withdrew, turned into an observer of life, not a participant. I desperately wanted my own family, my own children, and to provide stability for all of them. I was in psychotherapy, but I still wasn't sure I could ever achieve a loving, stable family life. 
 At 26, I went to Baruch, and by 30 I had a bachelor's in business administration. But I couldn't bring myself to go to the corporate world. So I took a job managing the Shadowbox Theater Company in Manhattan. I made only $22,000 a year, and I lived in a studio in a five-flight walk-up where the heat and electricity went out all the time. I didn't care -- for the first time I was getting a regular check and I had a place that was all mine. 
 But I soon realized that women were unlikely to marry a man who made so little money. So I decided to leave the arts. In 1994 I went to the Empire State Development Corporation, managing projects to revitalize psychiatric hospitals. I got terrific benefits and $48,000 a year, which to someone like me felt like $1 million. I met my wife there. She would have married me if I'd had 2 cents in my pocket. 
 But the job just didn't speak to my heart. So a couple of years later I went to work for the New York State Council on the Arts, then for the Theater Development Fund, and then as treasurer for Victory 2000, a New York program to get people to vote. In November 2000 I was unemployed again. And I received a letter, telling me my father had died. It came from some woman he apparently had been living with, and she included some pictures but not many details. I didn't need to learn more. I realized I'd lost my connection to him years ago, and that his leaving was probably the best thing that could have happened to our family.
 Still, it made me again take stock of my life. Empire State invited me back, this time to work on the project to redevelop Penn Station. And I accepted. I stayed there until last December.
 But now I'm back where I belong, in the arts. I'm not acting anymore, but I'm supporting other artists in their work. I know that many of them must create art to survive -- or, at least, to get a sense of what their lives are about. 
 It certainly worked that way for me.

HEADLINE: Today, Homeownership Is Next to Godliness 

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
MARGUERITE WILLIAMS always wanted to own a home in Bridgeport, Conn., the Fairfield County city where she grew up, but it took a gentle nudge from the pastor of her church to move her out of her rental rut. 
 It wasn't a lack of money that held her back -- she works in admissions at Southern Connecticut State University --as much as a lack of information. A widow for more than 20 years, Ms. Williams feared that someone would talk her into a bad decision, or that the cost of keeping up a property would be more than she could handle.
Last year, however, after attending a church-hosted orientation on home buying, Ms. Williams followed up with a volunteer financial counselor, who worked out a step-by-step plan for resolving her credit issues and applying for a mortgage. 
 ''They showed me I could almost do the same thing purchasing as renting,'' Ms. Williams said in the four-room co-op she bought for $54,000 at Seaside Village Homes, a community of green-shuttered brick houses a few blocks from Seaside Park in Bridgeport. ''Once you start going through it, you find, 'Ohhh, it's not as hard as I thought it was.' '' 
 Churches serving minority communities throughout the region are reaching out to people like Ms. Williams who, though perhaps financially capable of buying a home, are unsure how to go about it.
 In the past few years, Freddie Mac, the federally chartered financier of mortgage loans, has joined with churches, community development corporations and lenders to initiate faith-based efforts aimed at increasing rates of minority homeownership in Bridgeport, Queens and central New Jersey. 
 While the homeownership rate for the nation as a whole is approaching 70 percent, according to the Bureau of the Census, fewer than 50 percent of African-American and Hispanic families own their own homes.
 Surveys and focus groups conducted by Freddie Mac show that a primary cause of the gap is uncertainty within minority communities about whom to trust in the home buying process, said Craig Nickerson, vice president of the corporation's Expanding Markets division. 
 ''We needed to find an emissary they trust to help them take the first step, and we found it to be the faith community,'' he said. Members of the clergy involved in the initiatives vigorously preach the virtues of self-sufficiency and the financial benefits of homeownership at Sunday services, an aspect of their ministry that they say is critical to stabilizing their communities and halting generational cycles of poverty.
 ''For a church not to deal with the economic plight of its people is a dereliction of its responsibility,'' said the Rev. Mitchell Taylor, pastor of Center of Hope International and chairman of the East River Development Alliance (ERDA), a nonprofit organization that recently began a homeownership initiative in western Queens.
 The Faith Fellowship Ministries World Outreach Center, a 7,000-member congregation in Sayreville, N.J., started its ownership program three years ago through its nonprofit affiliate, the Faith Fellowship Community Development Corporation.
 Some 300 people a year go through the education program, which includes financial literacy coaching to ''give people the tools to improve their credit, and to take responsibility for it,'' said the Rev. Clarence Bulluck, the corporation's founder and executive director. 
 Though the three programs operate somewhat differently, the basic structure is similar: sponsoring churches serve as the host of weeknight orientation sessions on home buying, where participants are encouraged to enroll in a more comprehensive education program developed by Freddie Mac. Financial counselors -- typically trained church volunteers or community development corporation employees -- review each participant's credit history and, in one-on-one sessions, help them plan how to pay off debt barring access to a mortgage. 
 In addition to supplying the curriculum, Freddie Mac provides seed money as what Mr. Nickerson calls ''a one-time kick start'' -- $35,000 in Bridgeport's case -- to pay for marketing materials and staff training. Partner banks provide access to flexible mortgages with low down payments. 
 The key element, however, is the churches, which promote the program to their members, who in turn spread the word. About 10 African-American and Hispanic churches are involved in the Bridgeport initiative, now a year old, run by the Faith Community Development Corporation, an affiliate of Shiloh Baptist Church.
 ''We're getting to people who are credit-injured or have what I would call a down payment disability -- that's the preacher in me,'' said the Rev. Carl McCluster, a consultant on faith-based initiatives and the pastor at Shiloh, where Ms. Williams is one of about 250 members. 
 More than 200 people have either gone through or are enrolled in the education program, according to Bridgette Russell, the interim director. Six people have closed on homes so far, but, she said, the number would be higher if home prices were lower.
 ''One of the greatest frustrations is you can get a person to address credit delinquencies and have sufficient savings to technically qualify for a mortgage,'' Ms. Russell said, ''but the housing market's prices are limiting what people can do.
 Housing costs are also a sticking point at the ERDA Homes program in Long Island City, Queens. ''The reality is, it is hard,'' Pastor Taylor said. ''But the unique thing about our program is that we're going to stay with you. If you work hard and play by the rules, I believe you can find a place.'' 
 ERDA Homes targets some of the neediest New Yorkers: the roughly 15,000 residents of the Queensbridge public housing development, as well as the estimated 15,000 more who live in Ravenswood, Woodside and Astoria public housing. While the end goal is homeownership, ERDA's larger aim is to build financial knowledge within a population where, surveys have shown, roughly 30 percent of residents don't even have bank accounts.
 Since a clergy coalition and tenants associations began promoting the ERDA program about six months ago, about 100 residents have developed personal financial action plans, 104 have opened bank accounts and eight have been preapproved for mortgages of $130,000 to $250,000. 
 Rosemary Allette, who lives at Ravenswood, credits her financial counselor at ERDA with giving her the confidence to begin working toward mortgage approval.
 An employee of the State Department of Education, Ms. Allette, 46, said the program motivated her to rein in her spending: she takes a bag lunch to the office, stays away from the shopping center across the street, pays her bills the day they arrive and has a set sum deducted from her paycheck for deposit into her savings. She has also paid off some old medical bills and had a $4,000 judgment removed from her credit report. 
 After 20 years of living in public housing, Ms. Allette said, ''I'm saving up for, if not a house, at least for a co-op or a condo, something tangible, something to show for all my hard work all these years.''

HEADLINE: Eminent Domain's Pre-Eminence

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
EMINENT domain is a habit in New Jersey. On this point, experts including the state's comfortably liberal new public advocate, Ronald Chen, and the nation's leading conservative property-rights group, the Institute for Justice, agree.
 Indeed, they say it is easier in New Jersey than in any other state to take private property and turn it over to developers. It is so easy, Mr. Chen told an Assembly committee this month, that when he consulted a state listing of potential redevelopment areas, he found that his own house could be subject to condemnation.
 As opposition to the state's redevelopment law mounts, much of the concern centers on a familiar complaint in New Jersey: legislation meant to lure investment to sagging communities has become a brokerage mechanism for politically connected developers.
 Interestingly, legislators here murmured sympathetically when Mr. Chen made his presentation. 
 Like politicians around the nation, most here have voiced disapproval of a United States Supreme Court decision a year ago in an emotionally wrenching case, Kelo v. New London, that allowed local officials in Connecticut to raze a modest but healthy neighborhood to make way for more lucrative development. And like Mr. Chen, legislators in New Jersey say property owners need stronger protections. 
 ''The post-Kelo case I see going to the U.S. Supreme Court one of these days, and it could very well be a case from New Jersey,'' said Ted Zangari, a Newark lawyer who represents developers, ''would be one involving a hastily hatched redevelopment designation intended to benefit a developer who's a benefactor of some local politician.''
 But for now, this state is a hard case. The Institute for Justice, which has represented the New London property owners and many others around the country, lists 24 cities and towns in New Jersey where there are ''current controversies'' involving condemnation for redevelopment; by contrast, Pennsylvania has 6, Massachusetts 2 and New York 7. In addition, even though lawmakers seemed sympathetic to Mr. Chen, they have often been seen as part of the problem rather than the problem's solution. 
 More than 70 municipalities have designated ''areas in need of redevelopment'' -- which confers the power of eminent domain on local officials -- since the state started requiring notice of these declarations in 2003. Others carved out redevelopment zones earlier and could still act on them. 
 Most redevelopment projects proceed uneventfully, and most eminent domain fights, when it comes to that, are about the compensation owed to displaced owners. But to change the rules now would hamper redevelopment planning nearly everywhere in the state.
 William Potter, a Princeton land-use lawyer who is chairman of the statewide group the New Jersey Coalition Against Eminent Domain Abuse, put it another way. ''I imagine a good bill is going to bring out all the big guns -- the consultants, the law firms, the developers -- to oppose it,'' he said. 
 The consultants, the law firms and the developers are entrenched for a reason. New Jersey, like most states, acted more than 50 years ago to give local governments the power to condemn blighted property. But a 1992 law invited developers to New Jersey's hollowed-out cities by expanding the definition of blight. Growing public subsidies were to follow. 
 ''It led to a frenzy of redevelopment efforts,'' said Mr. Potter, who also teaches land use at Princeton and Rutgers. ''It was a long, slow leading edge, but all these developers and cities saw that this was a gravy train and they better get aboard.'' 
 Three years ago, the Legislature gave towns the authority to declare an ''area in need of redevelopment'' wherever it is ''consistent with smart-growth planning principles.'' It is that criterion -- because it applies to suburban as well as urban areas -- that could arguably ensnare Mr. Chen's house in Berkeley Heights. 
 In New Jersey, developers and cities relying on the power of eminent domain have remade broad swaths of Atlantic City and New Brunswick. In addition, they plan to displace 1,200 households and small businesses in Camden, demolish blocks of oceanfront houses in Long Branch and a working-class neighborhood in Lawnside, and take industrial land in Pennsauken and North Arlington. 
 All those plans would bring in builders of new, more dense and upscale housing.
 ''It's happening all over the state,'' said Scott Bullock, a lawyer at the Institute for Justice who represented the New London homeowners and is now involved in the Long Branch case. ''It's just a climate, a willingness of government to work with private developers. It's just the climate that says that's acceptable.
 ''There are a lot of other places in the country that are as densely populated as New Jersey and you don't see rampant eminent domain abuses,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''You don't see eminent domain abuse in Chicago or Los Angeles.''

Cozy Arrangements
 Assemblyman Michael Panter, a Democrat from Shrewsbury who is proposing a two-year moratorium on eminent domain, said the Supreme Court decision ''really opened a candy store for the developers'' -- especially in New Jersey. 
 While most local officials are honestly trying to improve their towns, Mr. Panter said: ''There's much to cozy a relationship between local officials and wealthy developers. If mayors and council members, some of whom take money from developers, are approached by a wealthy developer who pitches them the idea that they're going to revitalize a neighborhood if the town takes it by eminent domain, that's very troubling.''
 ''You're never going to read about it in the newspaper,'' he said, ''because those discussions take place behind closed doors.'' 
 That is the contention of business owners on Porete Avenue in North Arlington, who stand to lose their property along the rim of the Meadowlands to a 1,600-unit condominium development.
 The plan was negotiated by borough officials and a subsidiary of Cherokee Investment Partners, a company that buys contaminated property, cleans it up and usually sells it to home builders. In the last five years, Cherokee, which is based in North Carolina, has come to dominate the development landscape of New Jersey. 
 Porete Avenue is a small strip on the edge of Cherokee's main project in North Arlington, the site of a former landfill. But Bill Gauger, the president of Cherokee Northeast, the company's development arm, said it needed the profit yield from housing to finance the landfill cleanup. And the company could not put $500,000 condominiums between the golf course and the existing industrial occupants, he said, ''because I can't create a sense of place with the businesses right next door.''
 Some of the dozen or so owners on the street want to sell, but others are bringing suit to stop the project. Their anger is not directed at Cherokee so much as at their own representatives, and at the way the deal was struck. 
 According to Councilman Peter C. Massa, who voted against the deal and is trying to unseat the mayor, the city attorney and a lawyer for Cherokee negotiated the plan without any citizen participation and then presented it as a fait accompli last March. In October, Mr. Massa said, the council members were given a memorandum of understanding. ''They said: 'This is a great deal for everybody. Sign it and pass it.' ''
 Then, Mr. Massa said, the council members received the 334-page final agreement on April 18, for a vote scheduled April 19 -- a vote that was added to the agenda at the last minute. The resolution was adopted without discussion among the council members. 
 Mayor Russ Pitman says no one was caught by surprise, including the owners, whose property was identified for possible redevelopment more than 15 years ago, or the council members. Mr. Pitman and Cherokee officials noted that the project was under negotiation for three to four years as the mayor and the city attorney insisted on scaling down the original proposal for high rises. Moreover, Mr. Pitman said, the agreement approved in April was substantially the same as the one that all the council members approved in October. 
 The owners respond that earlier proposals would have allowed them to stay, and that it was only after the deal was done that they learned that Cherokee wanted them out.
 Damon Y. Smith, a professor of property and local government law at Rutgers-Camden, said the complaints in North Arlington echoed those in the Cramer Hill section of Camden, a working-class neighborhood in a city with several abandoned areas -- which is also to be acquired by Cherokee -- about the steps leading to a decision to use eminent domain. ''The problem as I hear it from people in Camden was not only that these processes were not followed but that the decision was already made and the whole process was a ruse,'' said Professor Smith, who is also a former urban planner. 
 ''The fear is that you have very sophisticated private actors who have in mind what they would like to do, and then you have public actors who have certain powers to designate something as blight,'' he said. ''A major concern of critics of eminent domain and its use in the last several decades is that the process has largely been taken over by these private actors.'' 
 Underscoring the point, Mr. Chen noted that a local government can choose a developer without any bids and that the current law requires only one public hearing before designating a redevelopment zone. Nor does the law require that the municipality present studies or other evidence. 
 ''Sometimes the process is so abbreviated,'' he said, that there really is no record by which a court could tell whether local officials complied with the criteria set out in the law, however loose they are. 
 In addition, studies and projections assessing a proposed development are often financed by the developer, as are other costs. Cherokee, for example, put money into escrow funds that paid part of the salary of the Camden Redevelopment Agency's director and fees to the municipal attorney in Pennsauken, where Cherokee has also won a contract for a huge redevelopment project. While these officials were supposed to be negotiating with Cherokee, state law does not restrict the way developers' fees are spent. 
 In New Brunswick, where a bookstore owner is fighting a plan to raze his block for a 30-story building across from the Rutgers campus, most downtown projects are collaborations among the city, Rutgers and the New Brunswick Development Corporation, known as Devco, a private nonprofit developer created by the city in the 1970's. 
 They made a joint announcement of the new tower in February 2005, several months before the New Brunswick Planning Board was asked to begin the required study to determine whether the area is in need of redevelopment. Bill Bray, a spokesman for Mayor James Cahill, said the redeveloper is ''likely to be Devco,'' as it has been in almost all downtown projects.
 As a private company, Devco does not have to disclose its finances, or its relationships with local officials. But Mr. Bray said, ''It's easy for some people to criticize Devco today, but there was a time when New Brunswick had to create its own corporation to get something built.''
 A report written by Mr. Chen's office, in addition to recommending a tighter definition of blight, calls for greater public participation in the eminent domain process, better notice to owners and more opportunity to appeal, and ethics rules to insure that public officials working on a redevelopment project do not benefit personally from it. 
 In the Legislature, about a half-dozen bills, including Mr. Panter's proposed moratorium, have been introduced in the 11 months since the Supreme Court's Kelo decision. The Assembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee has held four hearings, concluding with Mr. Chen's testimony on his report. 

Call for Stricter Measures
 Still, some who are urging stricter eminent domain laws say the New Jersey Legislature is not the most likely place to find relief. Among New Jersey's 120 legislators are dozens of other mayors and other local officials as well as lawyers, engineers and consultants who work for developers and local governments. 
 For instance, the Democratic chairman of the Assembly Commerce committee, John J. Burzichelli, is also the mayor of Paulsboro, which has five redevelopment zones. The vice chairman, Assemblyman Joseph Vas, is the mayor of Perth Amboy, where a court recently halted the city's designation of a six-acre tract and its small businesses as a redevelopment zone. 
 Mr. Burzichelli, for one, says he fully supports a stricter law and more careful procedures -- and that his town had taken ''great pains'' in designating redevelopment areas. ''The more public awareness there is, the more transparency, that can only help,'' he said. ''If you can make your case, it will rise on the merit.''
 On the Senate side, the chairman of the committee that is handling eminent domain legislation, Ronald L. Rice, is a Newark city council member, while the vice chairman is Senator Sharpe James, who as Newark's mayor has overseen the removal of small businesses for the city's new hockey arena and a proposal for a condominium and retail development that would displace more than 60 property owners. A host of other influential legislators work for towns and developers. Senator Raymond Lesniak of Elizabeth is a lawyer who represents many developers, and the law firm of Senator Wayne R. Bryant of Camden was hired by Cherokee for eminent domain work.
 ''He's on retainer to evict his own constituents,'' Mr. Potter of the Coalition Against Eminent Domain Abuse said. The state's courts could take a stricter approach than the Legislature, since the New Jersey constitution limits the use of eminent domain for redevelopment to ''blighted areas.''
 The lower courts have used varying degrees of scrutiny in interpreting that provision. Mr. Chen said that while he believes that sections of the 1992 law exceed the constitutional limit, it has not been tested in the State Supreme Court. 
 Mr. Zangari, the Newark lawyer who represents developers, said that even the United States Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision in the Kelo case expressed lingering reservations about redevelopment deals.
 New Jersey's redevelopment binge may also be slowed by federal investigators. 
 The United States Attorney's office has subpoenaed officials in at least a dozen towns, including New Brunswick, for records relating to projects involving former State Senator John A. Lynch and his partner and clients in a consulting business that worked for developers.
 While it is not clear what projects or developers are under investigation, many of those towns have redevelopment projects.

HEADLINE: How About 'If You've Got the Time, We've Got the State'?

BYLINE: By Vincent M. Mallozzi. 
E-mail: mallozzi@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WELCOME to New Jersey, the sloganless state.
 Twice in the past year, officials failed at finding a clever catchphrase to promote tourism, and now comes word that the think tank is empty.
''The project is on hold until later this year,'' said Karen Wolfe, a spokeswoman for the State Commerce, Economic Growth and Tourism Commission. ''We had to move forward with our spring and summer campaigns that we hope will lure visitors to the New Jersey Shore and to other gems around the state.''
 Last October, Richard J. Codey, awaiting the kind of slick and savvy slogan from a marketing company that a $260,000 contract should produce, was presented with ''New Jersey: We'll Win You Over.'' 
 To his credit, Mr. Codey, then the acting governor, tossed that lame offering into the discard pile, insisting it was too negative. He was rightfully owed a refund, and the people of New Jersey were owed an apology.
 Residents need not worry about winning over any visitor, tourist or otherwise. The only sweating we'll do this summer, thank you, will be on the beach, and not a single bead of that sweat should be wasted trying to win over a flip-flop-wearing out-of-towner in tank top and shorts with a Boogie board in one hand and a road map in the other. 
 We'll Win You Over? Did Jersey Central Power and Light clip the voltage wires during those brainstorming sessions?
 We'll Win You Over? For $260,000, you had better bowl us over. New math or old, that's $65,000 a word. Whoever signed off on that deal, please know that I am interested in part-time marketing work.
 After failing to win over Mr. Codey, the campaign was turned over to New Jerseyans, as it should have been in the first place.
 In January, Mr. Codey (whose title by then had been upgraded to governor) announced that after his office had judged about 8,000 ideas, including one apparently mailed from Tony Soprano's house -- ''New Jersey: You Got a Problem With That?'' -- he had settled on a much more appropriate and less expensive slogan, ''New Jersey: Come See for Yourself.''
 But a few weeks ago that slogan was scrapped -- other states, including West Virginia, had already used it.
 Excuse me, but had anyone in Mr. Codey's office ever heard of Google or Yahoo? Mr. Codey, who had egg on his face after the selection was made public, added to the embarrassment by clinging to someone else's idea even after state tourism officials suggested dropping it.
 ''It's not as if West Virginia is using it now,'' Mr. Codey said recently.
 Huh? 
 Why has it become so difficult, so time-consuming and so expensive to come up with a few smart and, dare I say, original words that best describe New Jersey? I've seen tougher contests on cereal boxes.
 I'm not sure which is worse: paying $260,000 for a slogan not worth the taxpayers' paper it is printed on, or borrowing a hand-me-down from, of all places, West Virginia. Almost heaven, my eye. 
 We're not talking issues of global importance, like forming an exit strategy in Iraq, or finding a decent left fielder for the Yankees. As easy to fix as the problem seems, we remain frozen in a sloganless state. 
 ''In trying to attract people to your state, you want your message to be unique,'' said Ms. Wolfe, whose agency should be applauded for its unwavering commitment to finding words that will inspire New Jersey and its visitors, not insult them.
 At the moment, she said, tourism officials are content with using New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi as a pitchman. A $3.5 million television campaign features his hit single ''Who Says You Can't Go Home.''
 ''But certainly we would have liked to have had a slogan in place by now,'' Ms. Wolfe added.
 Say no more. Here are three ideas that Ms. Wolfe and company can throw into the mix. How about ''New Jersey: The Perfect Fit'' or ''New Jersey: One State Fits All,'' or ''New Jersey: Your Sand Castle Is Waiting''? (Please note that a Google search turned up the fact that Honda makes a subcompact called Fit, and although some related news releases were labeled ''A Perfect Fit,'' it apparently is not an actual slogan.)
 At the going rate of $65,000 a word, my first idea would net me a cool $195,000. (I have waived fees for the words ''New'' and ''Jersey.'' ) My second entry, four words of sheer marketing brilliance, would earn $260,000. And my third -- five words guaranteed to win you over (Where have I heard that before?) -- costs a paltry $325,000.
 If those don't work, don't call a news conference or hire another team of marketing geniuses. Just ask me for another.
 My think tank is always full.

HEADLINE: If It's Really Expensive, We'll Take It

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: STONE HARBOR 

 BODY:
OF all the possible business investments over the last decade, real estate at the Jersey Shore has been among the rosiest. While this is still largely true, real estate brokers say they have noticed an odd twist this season: extravagant houses in the $5 million to $10 million range are moving quickly, but sales of midpriced housing have slowed.
 ''Sometimes you don't know when a market is changing until it actually happens,'' said Ron Soldano, an agent with James C. Otton Real Estate in Stone Harbor. ''Suddenly, those meat-and-potatoes properties in Avalon and Stone Harbor, those that go for between $1 million and $2 million, these are just lying fallow.'' 
But the market is still strong for the most exclusive homes at the beach, according to Mr. Soldano, the mini-estates that walkers see when they look up from the sand, seaweed and driftwood just past the dunes in towns like Avalon, Stone Harbor, Mantoloking, Harvey Cedars and Loveladies. People who can spend $6 million or $7 million are still spending it. 
 ''There is word that a property in Avalon went for $9 million in cash,'' he said. ''That person is clearly not worried about rising gasoline prices.''
 Two islands north from Mr. Soldano, Mark Grimes, a broker with Ocean City Realty and who grew up on the island, is seeing the same trend.
 ''I think the oceanfront and the bay are holding up really well,'' Mr. Grimes said. ''But I would say that four-bedroom, two-bath place a couple of blocks in from the ocean, the ones that were appreciating so rapidly in recent years, those are not going so well.''
 Prices in general have always been a little lower in Ocean City than in Stone Harbor and Avalon, but Mr. Grimes said that a four-bedroom, two-bath house was selling for $700,000 to $900,000 last year, and would probably bring that again this year, if a seller were patient.
 ''What I see in that range is that prices are the same as in 2005, but some people thought they would go up and up again, so they have priced them too high,'' he said, noting that last year, his office had 600 to 700 listings at this time, but now has about 1,400. ''We just had some really great years. Now this is back to normal. People who are greedy won't get what they ask for. People who are reasonable will still find buyers, but it is definitely slower in that midrange category.''
 It is that strange upside-down market at the Shore that is unusual, though. Joel Naroff, the chief economist for Commerce Bank, whose headquarters are in Cherry Hill, said that there is anecdotal evidence that high-end homes inland are not doing so well, while midpriced homes are continuing their hot pace of recent years.
 ''Of course, it's hard to know what is midlevel anymore in New Jersey,'' Mr. Naroff said. ''Some people would say that $750,000 is a midlevel house these days in many parts of New Jersey, and that is about the price we see being stalled, but I would still consider that quite high.
 ''There are scattered discussions of Realtors saying they are having trouble selling, but it just may be that things were so good for so long that this is a normal pulling back. It is possible that high-end buyers are just holding on to their properties right now, and those few who are buying are buying second homes at the Shore.''
 Farther north, where a lot of the Shore towns have more year-round residents than in the south, the trend appears to be similar, with high-priced homes on or near the ocean still selling well. The catch may be, according to Gwen Pastorelli, an agent for Mary Holder Real Estate, that high-end sellers are more savvy in the first place.
 ''Some people have waited out the boom and still see that their neighbors are getting $3 million to $5 million for something they paid a couple-hundred thousand for some years ago and are willing to cash out, but are not in a hurry,'' she said. 
 Those people, Ms. Pastorelli said, are willing to spruce up their houses so they show well. ''They are willing to take the time and effort to pull up the dirty carpet, splash some new paint on the walls, fix up the garden. People who just want to flip a property that they bought on the cheap won't do that, so those houses aren't selling now.''
 She said, too, that developers who are putting up grand new homes are getting sales.
 ''At the Shore, people seem to want new,'' she said. ''They don't want to put up with fixing. Developers are smart enough to build a big new Victorian-looking home to fit in, say, in Ocean Grove, and they are getting their price, while the older, more inexpensive one may not.''
 Still, it is not like anyone with Jersey Shore real estate is about to land in the poorhouse any time soon.
 ''Little condos in decent areas are going from $429,000 to $1 million,'' said Jo Ann Lo Duca, of HCH Realty in Harvey Cedars, on the northern end of Long Beach Island. ''A $799,000 house a block from the main road here was considered a teardown. We're seeing things selling for $7.9 million in some cases.
 ''Even if people say some things are slowing down, it's still pretty amazing. Prices of air fares are going up, even bread is going up. I think that soon the number of buyers will catch up with the sellers in the middle class. I wouldn't wait around for prices to go down.''

HEADLINE: When the Surf's Up, and Gone

BYLINE: By John Weber. 
John Weber is the East Coast regional manager of the Surfrider Foundation, a coastal environment group based in California.

DATELINE: Bradley Beach 

 BODY:
COASTAL towns and cities all around America are deciding whether to let the government pay 90 percent of the cost of having the Army Corps of Engineers protect property along their shore by dredging and pumping sand to replenish beaches that have suffered from decades of erosion and overdevelopment. With sea levels rising and stronger, more frequent storms all but certain, how can communities pass up this offer? 
 Recently, though, the City Council of Long Beach, N.Y., the largest coastal community in Nassau County, voted unanimously against a corps proposal to protect them from storms. 
The reason? These projects do bring in sand that then protects storm waters from damaging coastal property, but they can also make swimming more dangerous and surfing the waves less appealing. The projects often destroy fishing and marine habitat and dump coarse, dark sand on the beaches, making them less aesthetically pleasing. (In 1994, a beach replenishing project in New York's Coney Island brought dredged up rocks and mud to the beach there.) 
 So while these projects may sound like a good idea, there are several downsides. Communities like Long Beach are right to say no if they don't feel that the corps is taking into proper consideration the effect that a project will have on the beach. 
 In the mid to late 1990's, 11 municipalities here in Monmouth County, received a huge dredge and fill replenishment project -- one of the biggest in our nation's history. Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach and the beaches from Asbury Park to Manasquan had become severely eroded for a variety of reasons, including natural erosion and poorly planned development. 
 The corps's design for these beaches was essentially a big box of sand about 10 feet high and 140 feet wide. Immediately after construction, these enormous beaches were very steep, especially at the watermark. Swimming was hazardous because of the steep slope and deep water close to shore. Furthermore, the project buried sandbars and rock jetties, which had broken up incoming waves, so now the waves crash directly onto the beach, making swimming even more dangerous. 
 Normally, sandbars and rock jetties shape waves, making them suitable for bodysurfers, body boarders, surfers and kayakers to ride. But to this day, there are very few surfable waves in Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach because of what the corps did to those beaches. 
 Moreover, sandbars and rocks attract and harbor bait and fish. When the corps smothered the sandbars and rocks, marine life disappeared too. In the southeastern United States, altered beaches like these have made it nearly impossible for endangered sea turtles to nest.
 What's worse is that these expensive projects -- the one for Long Beach, N.Y., was estimated to cost $98.5 million -- offer no guarantee of protection from storms and the resulting wind damage. For instance, the plans for barrier islands like Long Beach Island, here in New Jersey, which is working out final details with the corps on a replenishment project, do not offer protection from bay-side flooding. 
 It's clear that we need to redefine success in these projects. An engineer's idea of a good beach is very different from a beach user's view. And while the corps claims that its projects are intended to protect property -- the most desirable and expensive property in the country -- they often destroy or diminish the very things that make that real estate so valuable.
 Part of the solution is to change how Congress finances and reviews these projects and the corps. Bills have been introduced that would subject these large projects to an independent review board, but their passage is a long way off. So in the meantime, states and municipalities dealing with the corps should recognize that they have some control.
 Even though corps guidelines say their plans must maximize the economic benefits of protecting structures, communities have the right to lobby for an alternative. Project designs can and should be modified to consider recreation in light of local needs and how the beach is used. Smaller, less expensive projects should be options even if they provide less storm protection. 
 The decision reached in Long Beach, N.Y., reflects that view of local control. Many residents said they knew and accepted the risks of living on a barrier island. And while some risk to their homes was acceptable, the possibility of a damaged beach was not. They decided to take their share of the project cost and put it toward real storm-preparedness measures like evacuation plans, stricter building codes and devices to reduce wind damage -- all good alternatives to replenishing beaches. 
 In the long run, the health of our economy and that of our environment are inseparable. The coast is where this realization is easiest to see, and where an unlikely decision by an unlikely city council -- like that in Long Beach, N.Y. -- represents a small but promising step in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Biosphere 2: Sprawl Outruns Lofty Experiment

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: ORACLE, Ariz. 

 BODY:
IN 1991, eight researchers in dark blue Star Trek-style uniforms entered Biosphere 2 -- a vast terrarium in the Arizona desert north of Tucson -- hoping to spend two years inside without importing food, water or even air. The goal was to see whether the sealed environment, considered a microcosm of the Earth's, could become self-sustaining.
 As it turns out, the real science experiment was going on outside, as development conquered vast swaths of the Sonoran Desert. The Biosphere, miles from nowhere when it was built in the 1980's, is now within the reach of a building boom streaking north from Tucson and south from Phoenix (and which some demographers say will eventually join the two cities, once 100 miles apart).
The Biosphere was designed to simulate the Earth's environment. By succumbing to sprawl, it may have done just that. 
 After spending a reported $200 million on the Biosphere, the Texas oil heir Ed Bass is about to sell the building and its surrounding 1,658 acres to Fairfield Homes of Tucson. 
 Richard Foerster of Tucson Realty & Trust, a veteran broker in the area, estimated the property to be worth about $25,000 an acre, or $40 million. At that price, Mr. Bass would be losing at least $160 million.
 Martin Bowen, the president of Decisions Investments, a holding company controlled by Mr. Bass, said that there were ''ongoing discussions'' with Fairfield Homes about ways to save the three-acre Biosphere building, and that Mr. Bass would ''prefer that it be used for the purpose it was built for.'' 
 But, Mr. Bowen said, Mr. Bass's contract with Fairfield does not require the buyer to preserve the structure. That means, he said, that ''when the deal closes, probably later this year, our options for saving the Biosphere will be over.'' 
 It could be replaced by a housing development called Biosphere Estates. In January, Fairfield registered that name and a number of variants with the State of Arizona.
 David Williamson, the president of Fairfield, said only that the deal is ''in escrow,'' and that he would not comment on plans for the site.
 If Biosphere Estates is built, it will join dozens of other new developments in Pinal County, including SaddleBrooke Resort, an upscale retirement development just south of the Biosphere property.
 Last year, there were nearly 19,000 building permits issued for new houses in the county, triple the number in 2003, according to Paul Larkin, the county's tax assessor. 
 ''And that's just the tip of the iceberg,'' he said. ''Driving in to work this morning, I took a different route, and I saw two new subdivisions that I didn't know existed.'' 
 The population of Pinal (rhymes with canal) County, currently about 250,000, will probably reach one million by about 2020, said Elliott D. Pollack, an economist and real estate analyst based in Scottsdale, Ariz. ''The growth is coming from Tucson in the south and Phoenix in the north,'' he said. ''Pinal is where the available land is.'' 
 Twenty years ago, Mr. Bass chose the Biosphere site, in the town of Oracle, because of its remoteness at the base of the Santa Catalina Mountains. The goal was to bring in groups of ''bionauts'' for two years at a time for 100 years. 
 But during the first two-year mission, which began in 1991, the Biosphere was beset by one problem after another: Oxygen dwindled, and the sea became acidic. Crops failed, causing the bionauts to lose weight rapidly, while ants and other insects thrived.
 Biosphere administrators later admitted that they had secretly pumped 600,000 cubic feet of fresh air into the Biosphere, supplemented the bionauts' home-grown diet with stored food and smuggled in emergency supplies. Then, two bionauts were arrested for breaking the Biosphere's seals. Soon the 100-year experiment was abandoned, and the Biosphere was reopened as a tourist site. Visitors were now allowed inside, where the sights include 3,800 species of plants and a million-gallon sea.
 Joaquin Ruiz, the dean of the College of Science at the University of Arizona in Tucson, said that because of its size, the Biosphere is ''an important instrument.'' 
 Dr. Ruiz participated in a conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington in March 2005 to determine whether the Biosphere could still serve a useful function. 
 ''The consensus was that it could,'' Dr. Ruiz said. ''It is indeed an enormous terrarium, but the scaling of that terrarium allows you to do large-scale ecology experiments that cannot be done anywhere else.'' For example, he said, the Biosphere could be used to simulate the effects of the loss of small amounts of moisture in a desert, helping scientists understand the effects of a drought.
 Now it looks as if those experiments will never happen.
 On a recent Friday, traffic was bumper to bumper on Oracle Road, outside the entrance to the Biosphere grounds. Roads were torn up, as construction crews dug trenches for water mains to serve the growing population. But at the Biosphere, there were about 10 cars in the parking lot and about that many people in the visitor center.
 ''Clearly, you can't run it as a tourist attraction,'' said Mr. Bowen, the president of Decisions. ''It's too expensive to maintain.'' (According to a sales brochure for the Biosphere property, Mr. Bass has spent $18 million on maintenance and another $9 million on major improvements in the last eight years.) 
 Because of the investment and maintenance costs, ''you can't just keep it sitting empty,'' Mr. Bowen said. 
 He compared the Biosphere with the Spruce Goose, the giant plane built by Howard Hughes. ''That's a good analogy,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''The Spruce Goose is a fantastic aircraft, but what good is it sitting in a hangar?'' 
 Mr. Bass, who is 60, was not available to answer questions. His spokeswoman, Terrell Lamb, said that Mr. Bass still considers the Biosphere ''a unique apparatus for the study of ecological science.''
 Mr. Bass, who serves on the boards of the New York Botanical Garden and the World Wildlife Fund, has made efforts to save the Biosphere. In 1995, his company brought in the Earth Institute, a respected environmental program at Columbia University, to operate the site. But the partnership unraveled, and Decisions ended up suing Columbia for breach of contract. The lawsuit was settled in September 2003, and Columbia ended its involvement that December. 
 Soon thereafter, Mr. Bass directed CB Richard Ellis to sell the 140 acres at the center of the site, where the Biosphere and dozens of auxiliary buildings were constructed. According to the sales brochure, the property presented ''an unmatched redevelopment opportunity.''
 But Jerry Hawkins, a vice president of CB Richard Ellis, said that potential buyers proved to be more interested in the land than in the buildings. So Decisions opted to sell the entire Biosphere site of 1,658 acres. The property ''was offered unpriced,'' Mr. Hawkins said. 
 Decisions eventually received 11 bids, he said, and Fairfield Homes' offer was not the highest. ''Price was not the No. 1 issue for the seller,'' Mr. Hawkins explained, suggesting that Fairfield was open to discussions about the Biosphere's future. 
 Mr. Hawkins would not say how much Fairfield is paying, but Mr. Bowen said that Mr. Bass was more interested in finding ''the highest and best use'' for the Biosphere than in recovering what he spent.
 ''Forget the money,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''It's sunk money. What matters is that it's a fantastic piece ofequipment.''

Fossils in the Walls

Q. My children and I love fossils. Lately I've heard that there are some great-looking ones in Manhattan building walls and pillars. Can you recommend any buildings for fossil viewing?

A. Sidney Horenstein, geologist and environmental educator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, recommended these: 
 The Sherry-Netherland Hotel, on 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, has 40-million-year-old snails and clams from France.
The museum's own rotunda has sponges and corals from southwest England that are about 360 million years old, and rudistids, oysterlike animals that became extinct the same time as the dinosaurs. They are embedded in Portuguese rock.
 Rockefeller Center's facade (in various places where the limestone is coarser) contains bryozoans (sea moss), snails and crinoids, all about 300 million years old. 
 New York in general has few fossils, Mr. Horenstein wrote in an e-mail message, because the bedrock is metamorphic: schist, gneiss, marble. Fossils are more frequently found in sedimentary rock, like sandstone.

Taking Private Property

Q. The use of eminent domain for the benefit of private entities is a hot topic nowadays. Was it ever used that way in New York?

A. Your question alludes to a decision last year by the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the right of New London, Conn., to take private property, without the owner's permission, for economic development.
 As it turns out, Lisa Bova-Hiatt, deputy chief in charge of condemnation issues for the city's Law Department, said that New York State law, unlike Connecticut's, allowed municipalities to take property for economic development only if the property is blighted. 
 Officials of the Empire State Development Corporation, for example, have suggested that the corporation may use eminent domain to help make room for the Atlantic Yards project near Downtown Brooklyn, arguing that the blocks that make up the proposed site of the project -- on and around a railyard in Prospect Heights -- meet the state's definition of blighted. But many who live and work there dispute that description, saying the neighborhood is thriving.
 Ms. Bova-Hiatt cited Lincoln Center, Times Square and the MetroTech office park in Downtown Brooklyn as three developments that were based on the condemnation of blighted property.

By the Name of Lane

Q. Ever since I learned that the mob boss John J. Gotti dropped out of Franklin K. Lane High School in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, I have been curious about who the school's namesake was.

A. As we learned from ''Brooklyn by Name,'' a new book from N.Y.U. Press by Leonard Benardo and Jennifer Weiss, he was a number of things.
 Franklin K. Lane (1864-1921) was President Woodrow Wilson's interior secretary. He is best remembered for introducing the National Park Service in 1916. He later became vice president of a petroleum company. 
 When his private letters documenting Wilson's war cabinet were published, they included the following Prohibition-era observation: ''The whole world is skew-jee, awry, distorted and altogether perverse. The president is broken in body and obstinate in spirit.'' He went on: ''Drink, consoling friend of a perturbed world, is shut off; and all goes merry as a dance in hell.'' MICHAEL POLLAK
