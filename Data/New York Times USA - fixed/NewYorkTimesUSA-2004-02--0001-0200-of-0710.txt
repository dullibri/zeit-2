 PERFECTLY LEGAL
The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System
to Benefit the Super Rich -- and Cheat Everybody Else.
By David Cay Johnston.
338 pp. New York: Portfolio. $25.95.
 READERS of this important book may be misled by the routine material up front. Here David Cay Johnston recounts two oft-told tales: the rich getting richer and the rich escaping tax. Thus he tells how from 1970 to 2000 the income share of just 13,400 households / the richest hundredth of 1 percent -- rose from 1 percent to 5 percent of all income, and from 100 to 560 times the national average. And he tells how one of those households, that of William and Melinda Gates, "devised a way . . . to reap $200 million in profits on Microsoft stock without paying the $56 million of capital gains taxes that federal law required."
Yet really, what's so shocking? In the late 1990's, the United States ran an experiment unseen since 1926: a drive to full employment based solely on private capital investment. Under capitalism, private capital is invariably held by a minority, so such prosperity must mean a rise in the wealth of the rich. The United States is not a people's republic. And it was those gains precisely that financed the surge in business investment, producing full employment and actual rising wages and income for working American families for the first time in 30 years. 
The tax take also rose, by 2 percent of total income between 1995 and 2000. The federal budget went into surplus. For a moment states like California, riding a bubble in options realizations and capital gains, also had more revenue than they could use. The prelude to recession was a rising tax burden, paid from the bite on exploding upper incomes. It should have been offset by rising public spending, to meet national needs, fight poverty and prevent the slump of 2001. But with blind faith in the New Economy, that didn't happen until terrorism and war split open the public purse. 
As Johnston knows, the real scandal of our federal tax system isn't so much what the rich didn't pay. It's what the rest of us now have to -- particularly the middle and upper middle classes, with incomes from $50,000 to $500,000. This is the group Bush is squeezing, to benefit what Johnston aptly calls the "political donor class." This truly shocking story emerges later on in "Perfectly Legal."
First we have the repeal of the estate tax, which shifts the tax burden downscale and from the dead to the living. Johnston, a business and financial reporter for The New York Times, explains how this tax, affecting only a handful of the very, very rich, fell victim to the arts of propaganda: "The term death tax is a superb example of marketing triumphing over reasoned debate. So thoroughly has the phrase been infused into Washington that many journalists . . . employ this term of advocacy instead of the neutral, and correct term, estate tax, without rebuke by their superiors." He notes that the pollster Frank Luntz, the carnival barker of this operation, would have advised the Democrats to call it the "billionaire's tax." No such luck.
Next there is the Alternative Minimum Tax, the "stealth tax," designed for the very rich but now set to overrun Middle America. In 2000 this tax hit just 1.3 million households; Treasury estimates held that it would affect 17.9 million by 2010. But the Bush tax cuts doubled this number to 35.6 million by design: "Between 2003 and 2012 the Bush tax cuts will force an increase of $560 billion in taxes to be paid under the alternative minimum tax. . . . It is a subsidy of the super rich paid for by the middle class and the upper middle class." And it is a horror -- attorney's fees in legal settlements or medical expenses can't be deducted (to the same degree), or even the costs of having many children. Still the very rich escape. Promises that this train wreck will be averted are not credible, in Johnston's view. The tax was a betrayal, and the Bush people who committed it knew exactly what they were doing.
Then there is the payroll tax, a travesty ever since 1983, when Alan Greenspan sold the public on the myth of paying for Social Security in advance. And the difference between the amount brought in through the payroll tax and the amount needed to pay benefits underwrote Reagan's tax cuts for the rich, while the government stuffed a "Trust Fund" with I.O.U.'s. But with what? Paying them off will require either more borrowing or a rise in taxes -- exactly as if the trust fund did not exist. Meanwhile, the $1.7 trillion in excess payroll taxes already paid would be enough to completely pay off all consumer debt in 2001. And we are told that there is a "crisis" because the Trust Fund will eventually "run dry." In+fact,+there's+no+need to cut the benefits for which soon-to-be-retired workers have been overcharged for decades, or to raise payroll taxes even more on the next generation. The only issue is whether wealthy Americans will pay any part of the bill. 
Finally, Johnston surveys the decrepit, undercomputerized, legislatively crippled, mismanaged and harassed Internal Revenue Service, shanghaied in recent years to pursue supposed low-income abusers of the earned-income tax credit while the returns of the criminal rich escape audit and their money slips to havens overseas. The I.R.S. is a police agency under extreme pressure to treat big perpetrators with kid gloves. This material is, all in all, perhaps the most shocking stuff, particularly when one notes names like Harken Energy and Halliburton among the defectors. 
What should be done? Perhaps daunted by deep knowledge of how the cheats work, Johnston is cautious. He considers, and then rejects, shifting to a consumption tax like the flat tax. Sensibly, he leans toward a leaner, meaner income tax, with higher top rates, few deferrals, a broad definition of income and reform of the alternative minimum tax. Add a stiff estate and gift tax to recover from the largest fortunes at death, treat capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, then cut or offset the payroll tax and you would have the elements of a fairer system. 
Interestingly, the progressive tax bill of 2003, introduced by Representatives Dennis J. Kucinich, Barbara Lee and Bernard Sanders, comes close to these goals. It would claw back $107 billion from Bush's cuts and provide $88 billion in relief to working Americans, mainly through an attractive simplified family credit. Happily a few leaders remain, in these venal days, who are prepared to think boldly about our tax problem.

 THE FOUNTAIN AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD
By Robert Newman.
339 pp. Brooklyn:
Soft Skull Press. Paper, $14.95.
 ALL novels are, to some extent, political novels -- that is, they are concerned with the nature and deployment of power. But some novels are pushier about their agendas than others. Take Robert Newman's "Fountain at the Center of the World." It's a mucky title for a sublimely frisky novel, one that throws more acid-tipped darts at Nafta and the World Trade Organization than a foot-high stack of Mother Jones and Nation back issues. Newman's book follows three characters (one in London, one in Mexico, one in Costa Rica) in the years leading up to the 1999 W.T.O. protests in Seattle, and it reads like what you'd get if Tom Wolfe clambered inside the head of Noam Chomsky -- it elegantly and angrily scorches a lot of earth. You wouldn't want to read many novels that were as hyper-politicized as this one is, but there's something almost old-fashioned about the way Newman wears his heart utterly on his sleeve.
I wouldn't be surprised, in fact, if "The Fountain at the Center of the World" became the talismanic "Catch-22" of the antiglobalization protest movement, the fictional complement to Naomi Klein's influential treatise "No Logo." Expect to see copies of it peeking out of battered rucksacks from Berkeley to Burlington. Though if you are the kind of person who will want to retch at the notion of a novel in which one of the primary characters is named after Daniel Ortega, consider yourself warned.
Newman is such a fleet and funny writer -- in a scene set during one protest march, cops don't merely arrest the "legal observers in lime-green bibs," they snatch them "like a fruit particularly delicious to the gorilla" -- that you will begin to ask yourself, about 10 pages into the novel, Who is this guy? Newman, it turns out, is a big deal in his native England. He's a 39-year-old chain-smoking political comedian who, in the late 80's and early 90's, was a cast member of a very silly and very popular comedy show called "Mary Whitehouse Experience," which ran on BBC radio and television. (A video of the group's sold-out performance in Wembley Arena sold 800,000 copies in its first three days of release.)
In recent years Newman has largely abandoned performing for fiction; he has published two previous novels in Britain, though this is his first to be issued here. But he remains so popular over there that a BBC documentary was made about the writing of "The Fountain at the Center of the World." It's pretty entertaining, too, for a film that often seems to consist of shots of Newman pacing outside while taking nervous drags on his cigarette. None of this would matter if Newman didn't deliver on the page, but he does -- his characters squirm to life, and his punches land. The problem with most left-leaning novels is that they're as earnest and mopey as a Sarah McLachlan ballad on a rainy day. "The Fountain at the Center of the World," on the other hand, is as ferocious as a jar of freeze-dried Paul Krugman columns.
At its bleeding heart, this book is a Dickensian adoption novel -- it's about two Mexican-born brothers, Evan and Chano, who have never met. Evan was adopted by English parents, went to Cambridge and is now a high-level corporate flack; Chano was raised by Mexican relatives and now makes beer in a shack in northeastern Mexico. Both men are desperately looking for something. Evan has discovered he has leukemia and needs to find Chano for a blood and bone marrow transfusion. Chano is searching for his own son, Daniel, who was also given up for adoption and believes Chano is dead.
Newman is as good on Evan's world as he is on Chano's. He nails the trappings of Evan's life, including the "weird corporate glamour" that comes with dressing impeccably while at the same time looking wizened and ill. Evan is an expert at massaging public opinion for his multinational clients; he keeps "hands-on control of the intellectual thermostat" surrounding globalization issues, and is fully cognizant of the fact that "it is easier and less costly to change the way people think about reality than to change reality."
To spend time with Evan is to get a master class in how P.R. guys deploy their resources, from how to ruin an opponent's book tour to why certain kinds of advertisements are more important than others. You know those enormous, full-color, nonspecific corporate ads that you sometimes see in magazines and newspapers, the ones with the company's name under, say, a photograph of a leopard beside a waterfall? Here's Evan's take on producing one of those: "It's not for the readers, it's for the owners. The message says We are your largest advertisers. We giveth and we taketh away. And that's all. The more profligate you are with the space the stronger that message comes across. . . . Anything to take up a double page."
Evan ultimately leaves London to look for his brother in Mexico, but Chano can't be found -- he's a bumbling eco-terrorist on the lam after a halfhearted attempt to sabotage a toxic waste plant that was polluting the groundwater in his town. Chano is as jumpy and conflicted as a character in a T. C. Boyle novel, and his usually mushy politics come in for almost as much fire as Evan's. Chano is one of those guys, another character observes, who always shy away from recommending direct action while managing to "sound more revolutionary than everybody else in the process."
Upon Evan's arrival in Mexico, the action of "The Fountain at the Center of the World" grows almost absurdly complicated -- there is a plot to privatize the world's water supply, multiple dangerous border crossings, surprises about the nature of Evan's illness and, once all the characters arrive in the Pacific Northwest, some startlingly vivid scenes of the Seattle W.T.O. protests. Newman writes about all these things like a man who has done his research. But he is just as good on the little things -- how it feels to be seriously ill in a remote foreign country or how Chano's son's face "was transnationally identifiable: he had that look of the international poor (and would've had even in brand-new clothes)."
Newman's book is about as bleak as a comic novel can be, but he leaves multinational corporations, at least, with some room for optimism. Once the cheap labor has vanished in Mexico, they can still move to other countries. And after that, there's always the hope of finding "little green women in space" to exploit.

HEADLINE: SPRING-SUMMER CRUISES; 
More Docks, Closer to Home

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER SOLOMON; CHRISTOPHER SOLOMON lives in Seattle.

 BODY:
WHEN Texas was young, Galveston was a star: a major port for cotton, coffee and tin. Trade was so vigorous that the Strand downtown was called "the Wall Street of the Southwest." 
 It was not to last. By the mid-1990's the port was faltering, and for many, the only thing that came to mind when they heard the word Galveston was Glen Campbell's melancholy ballad. 
 But now the port of this beach town on the Gulf of Mexico is in the midst of a renaissance. On a recent Saturday morning two massive white cruise ships, stacked and gleaming like wedding cakes, disgorged passengers at the wharves, then loaded up the next batch and headed out again. Two more ships were scheduled to arrive the next day. 
Five years ago Galveston was not a home port for cruise ships. This year, seven cruise ships will call the city home for at least part of the year, and 384,000 passengers are expected to embark here,which would make Galveston one of the top 15 cruise ports in the world.
The city had a lot going for it as a potential port. Its 40-foot-deep channel can accommodate the biggest boats. The piers are about 30 minutes from open water, which saves time. Galveston, a popular summer sandbox for Houston residents, already has plenty of hotels and attractions as well as a historic downtown of Victorian-style buildings within a block of the ships. 
Most important, 30 million people live within a 500-mile drive of the cruise ship terminal, including nearby Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city. And "Texans love to drive," said Melody Smith, director of tourism for the Galveston Island Convention and Visitors Bureau. At least 70 percent of Galveston's cruise passengers drive here, said Michael Mierzwa, the port's director of facilities and operations. 
Galveston is perhaps the most dramatic example of a national trend. In a push to literally bring cruising to a wider public, cruise lines are no longer concentrating their ships in a few hubs like Miami or San Diego. Instead, they are placing more ships in second-tier or industrial ports around the nation that historically are known for longshoremen, not the Love Boat. Cruise ships today sail from almost anyplace that has a deep-water port: Galveston; Charleston, S.C.; Philadelphia; Bayonne, N.J.; Norfolk, Va.; Seattle; New Orleans. 
Many factors are driving this expansion. Cruising is the fastest-growing segment of the travel industry, according to the Cruise Lines International Association, with an estimated 8.3 million people -- a record -- taking cruises from North America last year. Eighty new ships set sail in the 1990's; some 50 more will have joined the fleet by next year, including some megaliners that can carry 3,000 passengers or more. 
But use of regional ports is about more than a need for more docks. The industry is keen to entice the estimated 85 percent of Americans who have not cruised before, especially those who fall outside the traditional cruising demographic that is sometimes disparaged as "the overfed, the nearly dead and the newly wed." The added cost of flying to established ports like Miami, Fort Lauderdale or San Diego has been a deterrent, said Len Polsky, a spokesman for the cruise association. Regional ports give more passengers the option to drive to their ship, something skittish fliers seem to appreciate since the terrorist attacks of 2001. 
"We're bringing cruising right to the consumer," said Bob Dickinson, president and chief executive officer of Carnival Cruise Lines. This year Carnival will have 20 ships in 19 locations around the country, including new home ports like Jacksonville, Fla., Baltimore and Mobile, Ala. (Carnival sold out three "test market" cruises from Mobile in eight hours, a record for the company.) The regional home ports help Carnival compete with destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando, which the cruise line considers its main competition, said Mr. Dickinson. 
Offering cruises from ports nationwide also saves consumers time, said Mr. Dickinson. As Americans take shorter vacations, the demand for two- to five-day cruises has grown to more than a third of North American cruises. Someone who lives in Seattle can board a flight to Galveston on a Thursday morning, catch a four-day cruise leaving for Cozumel, Mexico, in the afternoon and return to Seattle on Monday. 
Technology has also helped redraw the cruise map. For years Seattle couldn't wrest a share of the popular Alaskan cruise market from Vancouver, British Columbia, in partbecause liners couldn't reach Alaska and return in seven days. But the recent introduction of new, faster ships means that United States passengers can now leave from Seattle instead of taking an international flight to Vancouver or taking a four-hour bus ride across from Seattle's airport. This year the Port of Seattle expects a 40 percent increase in the number of sailings to Alaska, to 140; five years ago there were just six cruise ship calls. 
New York City, Bayonne and Philadelphia have also had more cruise business thanks to faster ships. In May Norwegian Cruise Line's newest ship, the Norwegian Dawn, became the first cruise ship in decades to make New York its year-round home port. Cruising at 25 knots, or 20 percent faster than older ships, the Norwegian Dawn can stop in Florida and the Bahamas and return in seven days. 
Among the many changes, though, Galveston's transformation stands out. "If you go back to the mid-1990's this port was really struggling," said Steven Cernak, the port's director.
In 1999 Carnival committed to using Galveston as home port for 72 cruises the next year. With that commitment in hand, the port began an ambitious program of improvements to docks, terminals and parking lots that will total $35 million by the end of this year, said Mr. Mierzwa, the Galveston port official. Other lines followed, with Royal Caribbean and Carnival lending the port money for the upgrades. This year Carnival offers four-, five- and seven-day cruises to the western Gulf of Mexico with stops in places like the Yucatan Peninsula, starting at $429. Royal Caribbean offers trips of up to 12 days. Celebrity also calls Galveston home this year, and Princess Cruises' Grand Princess will be Galveston's largest catch yet when it arrives in November: a ship taller than the Statue of Liberty, nearly 1,000 feet long and able to carry 2,600 passengers. 
The city has hitched its wagon to the cruise industry. "We're not doing anything else with our port; why not make it the cruise ship capital of the Gulf Coast?" said Pat Healy, a lifelong Galveston resident and co-owner of Morgan's on the Strand, a dress shop within sight of the boats. Mr. Healy said his business had increased "probably a good 10 percent or so" since the big ships started arriving. 
Tourism and business officials are working to get more passengers to arrive before their cruise, or stay afterward, to tour Galveston. Statewide, the cruise industry contributed $445 million to the Texas economy through direct purchases in 2002, according to a recent study commissioned for the International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents 15 major cruise lines.
One day last month Royal Caribbean's 2,076-passenger Splendour of the Seas and Carnival's 1,486-passenger Celebration loomed at the Galveston wharves, both so mammoth that it was hard to say whether the ships were moored to Galveston or the city to them. Longshoremen wearing Hawaiian shirts pushed baggage carts through debarking crowds. 
"Since 9/11 anything you can drive to is a benefit," said Lynne Billman, looking slightly toasted and relaxed, as she waited for her husband to retrieve the car. The Billman family had driven from Charlottesville, Va. Its 12-night cruise on the Splendour of the Seas included climbing Maya ruins in Belize, eating formal dinners at sea and entering the Panama Canal. Mrs. Billman said the canal was the biggest draw, but she was also glad to avoid the crowds and annoyances of Miami's large port. 
"Part of the attraction of coming here was that we knew the people would be classic Texans -- warm and open and genuine," she said. Her son Tom, 15, agreed, and said he liked "the quickness to the first port" -- Cozumel from Galveston. 
SOON after the Billmans departed, Peggy and Wendell Neufeld were aboard the same boat, tucking into spiced salmon and chicken in the Windjammer Cafe atop the ship. "It was even easier to get here than Miami or Fort Lauderdale," said Mr. Neufeld, who is 63 and a retired wheat farmer from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. When the couple's cruise ended, he added, they will be able to fly home the same night. 
The Neufelds' view from atop the ship is a snapshot of the changes at hand in Galveston. Out one window, past an ice sculpture and the buffet line, a shrimper motored past a retired off-shore oil rig that listed drunkenly on rusty feet. Through the near window, just steps from the gangway the Neufelds had crossed, construction scoops clawed at the remains of an unused grain terminal that has been razed to make way for expanded cruise facilities. 
"The indications from the cruise lines are that we should start planning Terminal No. 3," Mr. Cernak, the port director, said later. A new terminal, he said, could be needed in just two or three years.

HEADLINE: SPRING-SUMMER CRUISES; 
First Hands on Deck

BYLINE:  By ANN COSTELLO; ANN COSTELLO is a freelance journalist in Beverly Hills.

 BODY:
Last January, my husband, Dick, and I sorted through the day's mail at home in Los Angeles and almost threw away a nondescript bulk mailing from Radisson Seven Seas Cruises. Stunningly, the letter inside offered us our choice of two free Mediterranean cruises in early March on the cruise line's newly completed luxury ship the Seven Seas Voyager. 
As loyal passengers (we spent four months circling the globe on a Radisson Seven Seas ship in 2002 and sailed with them in French Polynesia in 2001), it announced, we would have to pay only for an air-fare-and-hotel package (if needed), plus a port charge of $180 a person; the cruise itself would be free. 
 In nautical parlance, these were shakedown cruises, meant to get the crew of a new ship operating as a team and uncover any defects, mechanical or human, before taking on paying passengers. 
 In the almost-discarded letter, Janet Galiszewski, the manager of the Seven Seas Society (a program for returning passengers, to build brand loyalty) offered 2,000 households two cruise dates: March 3 to 9 or March 25 to 30. To be eligible, passengers had to have sailed 75 nights with Radisson. 
The inaugural cruise for Voyager's first paying passengers would sail from Nice to Venice on April 1.
Dick and I didn't hesitate. We began to clear our calendars and call friends who were also frequent Radisson sailors and would be receiving the same invitation. 
We chose the March 3 sailing, but later discovered that the cruise line would accommodate its society members who could not make either date on other short, regularly scheduled trips. Our friends Tom and Susan took one of these make-up trips in October -- seven nights, Rome to Venice. 
According to Andrew Poulton, the director of strategic marketing, Radisson also offered other free cruises "to our best travel agent partners and our society members and prospective clients in our two major European markets, the U.K. and Germany." 
The 700-passenger Voyager carried 361 guests on the first shakedown cruise and 395 on the second, with a full crew of 445 on both. The second cruise would also begin in Nice and would stop in Barcelona, Palma de Majorca and Cannes, and end in Monte Carlo. 
On the fourth day of our cruise, Mark Conroy, the president of Radisson Seven Seas, came aboard and asked the happily freeloading passengers for their opinions and feedback at a sort of town meeting in the largest lounge. Most of the suggestions involved the line's policy of having passengers on regularly scheduled cruises pay for mixed drinks, rather than including it in a slightly higher fare. We were drinking free on the shakedown cruise, but memories of past bar bills lingered in many minds. 
Skirting the coasts of France and Italy, the ship was never too far from land, in case of major problems, but there were none. There were minor hitches: a restaurant ran late and the computers were not installed yet in the topsy-turvy computer room, so there would be no easy e-mail communication with friends and family back home. Nor did the beauty salon have all of its supplies. But these minor distractions just added to our sense of adventure. 
Perhaps the biggest inconvenience was arranging our flights. Los Angeles to Italy was a long flight for a six-night cruise, and there were uncertainties on top of that:
There was some initial difficulty securing our desired airline tickets as part of the Radisson travel package. Then, in calls to a shakedown hot line that Radisson had set up and to our travel agent we discovered after booking our flights that the final sea trials for the ship had been delayed, leaving us in a cliffhanging position. If the ship flunked its sea trials, our trip would be off. 
The Voyager passed its tests, and on Feb. 28, we flew on Lufthansa from Los Angeles to Frankfurt, then over the Alps to warm, sunny Nice. We opted for Radisson's business class fare of $2,868, rather than its $1,269 economy fare, given the 14 hours we'd be spending each way in airplanes and airports. We chose to stay in the least expensive Nice hotel in the package, the West End, paying $205 a person a night.
Three pals from our world cruise joined us. Karen and Woody, who live outside San Francisco, explored Nice on foot with us -- the museums, the Carnaval floats, parades and raucous end-of-Lent crowds. After we all boarded the Voyager in the Nice harbor on March 3, Bill, who lives in south Florida, joined us for activities and dinners. 
The mood on board was festive, the international cuisine top-notch, the ship luxurious, with glass elevators and a dramatic central atrium. Our captain, Dag Dvergastein, was tall, erect, blond and jovial. Meeting a few people we knew from the world cruise, passengers and crew, added to the fun.
We were upgraded to slightly larger quarters than the standard deluxe suite we would ordinarily have taken. Our 320-square-foot "penthouse" suite had a 50-square-foot balcony and came with a butler (shared with other suites) -- a new experience for us. 
Though hardly a behemoth, the Voyager was several hundred passengers larger than any ship we'd previously sailed on, and we would probably not want to try anything larger. But we found its size did not bother us. The ship's four restaurants offered more choices than we were used to.
Built and launched in Genoa, Italy, the ship's first baby steps were taken close to home. From Nice, our cruise stopped in Catania, Sicily; Sorrento and Livorno, on mainland Italy; and Cannes, before returning to Nice. Dick and I had been to Sicily and the south of France, but we found new things to do or took day trips to places we'd avoided as too crowded during summer trips: Pisa, Capri, St.-Paul de Vence in the hills above Nice, and Antibes. 
We had one day at sea, between Nice and Catania, and I was the only participant in several exercise classes and in the beauty parlor when I got a manicure. Clearly, the other passengers were on the ship to relax and enjoy their good fortune -- another big difference from our world cruise. 
I was always the first person on deck in the morning, when we came into port. On the top deck at 7 a.m., I was alone when taking pictures of Mount Etna and of Mount Vesuvius, and wondered how my fellow passengers could sleep through such an exciting approach, even if they had seen it all before.
Between ports, I squeezed as much into each day as I could: fitness classes, lectures, debarkation briefings, afternoon tea, evening entertainment, cocktail parties and receptions.
Dick and I especially enjoyed the Voyager's four open-seating dining rooms. Room service was also available for all meals, and we had tea served by the butler in our room once, but otherwise, we preferred to dine with our friends. The men enjoyed not having to pack black tie gear, which is required at least once a week on most Radisson sailings. Every night, the dress code was casual or informal. 
The largest dining room, the Compass Rose, had waiter service for all meals. A more casual, buffet-style restaurant, La Veranda, also served breakfast, lunch and dinner -- mostly Mediterranean fare. At the two smaller, elegant, reservations-only restaurants for dinner, Signatures and Latitudes, we managed to eat as a group on four evenings. 
At Signatures, the purpose of a shakedown cruise was evident one night when slow service caused us to miss the evening entertainment. The cruise director apologized but said that there was no time for another show. 
AT a memorable dinner in Latitudes, the chef, Siegfried Zanier, literally set the stage in a theatrical presentation of the meal from an unusual open galley. What followed was a five-course extravaganza, including a superb New England clam chowder, spinach and cheese-stuffed chicken breast with marsala sauce, and espresso gelato. The wines were a California Central Coast viognier and a Sonoma cabernet sauvignon. 
Unlike other Radisson cruises, where passengers pay for mixed drinks but are entitled to selected wine at dinner and two free bottles of alcohol per cruise, all drinks were free. We ate, drank and made merry on the cruise line's nickel.
After debarking on March 9, a Sunday, we had to stay in Nice overnight to catch a flight to Frankfurt, connecting to the only nonstop flight to Los Angeles. The cruise line picked up the tab one last time -- at Le Meridien.
Dick and I dropped our bags at the hotel, consulted railroad timetables and headed by train to nearby Antibes and its Picasso Museum, with Bill as company. We arrived during the museum's lunch break, so we found a harbor-side restaurant for our own Sunday meal, securing an outdoor table at the venerable-looking Les Vieux Murs. 
As we enjoyed a substantial meal and drank a bottle of wine, we discussed the cruise, mutual friends and hoped-for future trips together. We watched sailboats glide over the smooth, deeply blue surface of the Mediterranean and French families strolling together to their own luncheon destinations. Great art awaited us next door, in an ancient castle-turned-museum. 
Life was good that sunny Sunday in the south of France, a deeply satisfying end to our first shakedown experience.

Short but free
 Most shakedown cruises take place before the new ship's first paying passengers board for the inaugural cruise. They are usually by invitation only, and not all cruise lines offer them. 
Those that do may invite only their best customers, or they may invite travel agents, cruise line employees, friends and family. Shakedowns are short and free, and may involve some slight on-board disorganization.
Between Dec. 31 and Jan. 6, Cunard Lines, (800) 728-6273, www.cunard.com, offered three two-night shakedown cruises in the English Channel on its mammoth Queen Mary 2. The company invited employees, their families and friends.

 THE PRICE OF LOYALTY
George W. Bush, the White House,
and the Education of Paul O'Neill.
By Ron Suskind.
348 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $26.
 WHEN Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill took his famous trip to Africa with Bono, the lead singer of U2, in May 2002, the odd-couple label was, predictably, tossed around quite a lot in the press. In fact, the two men shared a deep interest in the developing world; the really curious pairing of George W. Bush's Washington, an authentically star-crossed duo that had no chance from the start, was O'Neill and Bush's political guru, Karl Rove.
Their first conversation took place on Dec. 30, 2000. That morning, the Associated Press had run an article announcing that a two-day economic forum with the president-elect in Austin, Tex., would feature O'Neill, the Treasury secretary-designate; Donald Evans, his counterpart-to-be at Commerce; and Lawrence Lindsey, who would be chief economic adviser. O'Neill learned about his participation while reading The New York Times. And when he got Rove on the phone, O'Neill, who considered politics the enemy of good policy, learned a lot about what his next two years would be like.
"I think it would be better, Karl," O'Neill said, "if someone had bothered to first ask me whether I thought this was a good idea and then whether I thought it would be a good idea for me to attend. My answer to both questions is no." Ron Suskind goes on in the "The Price of Loyalty" to describe a "penitent" Rove (let's see how Rove characterizes his mood when he writes his book) eventually acknowledging that the event was chiefly designed to give air time to key corporate donors. O'Neill hung up and dashed off a quick memo to self that read in part: "Get KR and others in the press/media operation to agree we're going to coordinate our outside face and that the outside face will be driven by substance, not by the need to have a line of the day." I'm guessing here that you can see why the relationship came to naught.
The Rove chat aside, O'Neill entered the Bush administration confident that he could effect change and reform. After all, he was assuming arguably the most venerable position in the cabinet, and he was no Washington neophyte. He first came to the city in 1961, when he landed a job in the Veterans Administration. He had worked in high-level capacities in the administrations of Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. In 1988, George H. W. Bush's transition team approached him to consider becoming Secretary of Defense (demurring, he recommended his old pal Dick Cheney). So he knew the town and most of the principals with whom he would be serving, and his ideological credentials -- he backed privatization of Social Security, large tax cuts and so forth -- seemed sound. But he had settled in Pittsburgh, where he had been the chief executive officer of Alcoa since 1987. Washington -+and, more to the point, conservatism -- had changed.
"The Price of Loyalty" -- so tight was the publisher's embargo that even the title was not released until just before the book itself appeared -- has run its course through the news cycle by now. Some of the first reported bits are certainly compelling, although it could well be argued that at this point one has to be a bit naive to believe that this administration was not looking for ways to oust Saddam Hussein before Sept. 11; crumbs were dropping along this neoconservative trail for more than a decade. Other revelations are of greater interest, especially those concerning the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, an O'Neill ally (and thus a hero of the book). Greenspan and O'Neill tried to insist that Bush's tax cuts be made conditional on budgetary health, a battle they lost in the Senate by one vote. Greenspan has denied using the word "irresponsible" with regard to the tax cuts, but there's enough material here that he hasn't denied to suggest that his opinion was exactly that.
But the news-cycle controversies have obscured the book's central, and important, thesis. It is the contention of O'Neill -- and of Suskind, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of "A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey From the Inner City to the Ivy League" -- that in this White House, evidence and argument have been routinely pushed aside when they got in the way of previously decided political outcomes. That we've heard before. What enriches "The Price of Loyalty," aside from the accretion of persuasive detail, is its assertion that in this administration, a time-honored notion of public service has been deeply corrupted.
When O'Neill worked in the Nixon and Ford White Houses, Suskind writes, he served presidents whom he respected as policy makers, whatever their other faults, for two reasons: first, they were knowledgeable about the details of policy; and second, they made it a point to have their aides present them with different, and sometimes starkly warring, points of view. Nixon called on the Office of Management and Budget (where O'Neill worked) to prepare so-called Brandeis briefs, named after Justice Louis Brandeis of the Supreme Court, that presented thorough analyses of opposing arguments and made everyone "really think deeply about the ideal of good government and how to get there," in O'Neill's words. The people in the room may have all been from one political party or shared a general world view. But they understood that when spending the people's money and acting on behalf of the entire country, including that segment that did not vote for their president, their obligation to fact-based inquiry and rigorous testing of hypotheses was self-evident.
This book serves as that standard's obituary notice. First, Bush himself is portrayed as disturbingly unengaged. From O'Neill's first meeting with him through his last, Bush asked some questions here and there about politics and perception, but he rarely asked a specific question on a policy matter. The weekend after the Sept. 11 attacks, when O'Neill was among the group invited to Camp David to discuss responses, he espied a large stack of intelligence briefings brought by the director of central intelligence, George Tenet, and found himself thinking, "I hope the president really reads this carefully. It's kind of his job."
Second, O'Neill smelled at many high-level meetings the odor of a conversation set up in advance to drive the discussion toward the conclusion that Rove and the political team had already settled upon. One example: At a meeting on steel tariffs, which the administration put in place in 2002 against all free-market principle, O'Neill could tell where things were going when the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, "made several oblique references to 'political realities.' " The pattern repeated itself over and over, on tax cuts and the economy and energy policy and Iraq. In time, O'Neill grew aghast, and went to his old friend Cheney to suggest that the administration try Brandeis briefs. But Cheney -- the book's chief villain and, if Suskind and O'Neill are to be believed, our functional president -- just sat passively. "He thanked Paul, as always, 'for his sharp insights,' " Suskind writes. And that was the end of it.
The end of O'Neill finally came in December 2002, when Cheney -- not Bush -- called to give him the sack.For all of the arguments "The Price of Loyalty" advances deftly, one point it allows only grudgingly is that the administration had several legitimate beefs with its man at Treasury. In early passages, Suskind turns somersaults to establish O'Neill's probity, apparently so great that even inanimate objects reflected it (at one point, O'Neill settles into a "ladder-back chair" that was an "emblem . . . of rectitude and transparency"). And though Suskind does acknowledge O'Neill's maverick nature and tendency for unguarded comments, the missteps are usually represented as the frank talk of a courageous truth-teller, when sometimes they were just impolitic mistakes. Finally, there are one or two surprising omissions. In the section on the Africa trip, Suskind doesn't even mention that while O'Neill was abroad, the Dow Jones industrial average suffered a drop of more than 350 points, and that it was kind of his job to be in Washington to steady the markets.
But even so, whether O'Neill was a brilliant Treasury secretary or a mediocre one, he did regard the public trust as a serious matter, and the case "The Price of Loyalty" makes about the debasement of the policy process is a strong one. "Politics, as it's now played, is not about being right," O'Neill concludes. "It's about doing whatever's necessary to win. They're not the same." One finishes this book hoping that those who consider themselves the guardians of Washington integrity will do more to demand that the distinction be honored.

HEADLINE: The Company They Kept 

BYLINE:  By Roger Lowenstein; Roger Lowenstein is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of "Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing."

 BODY:
In the old days in Coudersport, a tiny Pennsylvania town at the northern edge of Appalachia, if you had trouble with your cable hookup, you simply called John Rigas to come over and fix it. If you needed a loan, or a few bucks for a local charity drive, you darn sure called him too. There didn't seem to be anyone in this town of 2,600 that Rigas wouldn't help, or didn't like, which is maybe why Rigas seemed cut from the same cloth as his idol, the pundit Will Rogers. Rigas's other hero was Sam Walton, and like the folksy Walton, Rigas built his company, Adelphia Communications, from scratch into a giant corporation. 
 This sort of story has become so familiar in recent years that you almost don't have to add the kicker. Yes, it all came tumbling down. Yes, Rigas's company failed, and Rigas himself, along with two of his sons, is sitting in the dock, accused of the worst case of looting of any C.E.O. of the Enron era. 
 The difference is that unlike other supposed villains, Rigas, a 79-year-old son of Greek immigrants, was a genuine business hero, a pioneer in cable television. Many of the current corporate miscreants -- think Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco -- appear to be calculating and utterly unrepentant. Rigas, who has spent much of the past two years in a state of shock, is nothing if not likable. And when he goes on trial this month in Manhattan's federal courthouse, the jurors will confront the improbable: a central figure in a white-collar scandal who is as ordinary as they are. 
The mystery of how Rigas, a frail, white-haired man who seemingly had neither the motive nor the disposition to commit a fraud, came so undone, has riveted his hometown. Some say the answer lies with his sons, who directed the company's frantic growth in the late 90's; others cite the family's habit of blurring private interests and public ones, which was pretty easy to do in a remote company town like Coudersport. Mystery or not, Rigas's fall says a lot about America's wave of business scandals. The explanation put forth by people from Alan Greenspan on down is that executives got greedy (as if that were something new), but Rigas, who never sold a share of his company's stock, and didn't get stock options either, doesn't quite fit the mold. So what else was it? However badly the Rigases behaved, they were helped along the way by lenders and investment bankers, auditors, lawyers, analysts -- just about anyone whose job it should have been to protect the public. And this is what truly distinguishes the latter stages of the last bull market: not that a handful of executives got greedy but that the safeguards supposedly built into our financial culture stopped functioning. 
Even to people familiar with Wall Street scandal, the central detail of this one remains astonishing. Somehow, the Rigases persuaded a network of commercial banks to lend to them more than $3 billion that not only the family, but also Adelphia, a public company with public shareholders, would be liable for repaying. The money was used, in large part, to buy Adelphia securities, which subsequently lost most of their value, as well as to make payments on stock the family had bought on margin. It was also used as a sort of A.T.M. to finance extravagances of the Rigases both small and not so small. 
For instance, roughly $150 million was lent to John's money-losing hockey team, the Buffalo Sabres; $3 million was blown on "Songcatcher," a movie produced by Rigas's daughter, Ellen. Then there was the $13 million plowed into an unfinished golf course, a pet project of his son Tim, who had memberships in some 12 other golf clubs courtesy of Adelphia as well. Millions more were squandered by the Rigases' use of the corporate Gulfstream III as a family taxi, particularly to shuttle John's wife, Doris, on shopping trips, and some $45 million was advanced to John, apparently to finance his private businesses. The Rigases never bothered to disclose that they had borrowed all this -- and with Adelphia's guarantee. So when the news broke, two years ago this March, the public stockholders discovered that they had bought into seriously misrepresented goods. The company collapsed and filed for bankruptcy, and the stockholders were wiped out. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a civil complaint parallel to the criminal case, called it "one of the most extensive financial frauds ever to take place at a public company." 
John Rigas; 47-year-old Tim, who made many of the major decisions in recent years; and 50-year-old Michael adamantly deny the charges. (A third son, 46-year-old James, also worked for the company but wasn't indicted.) John and Tim Rigas, who talked at length for this article, admit to mistakes but not to any criminal scheme. The hockey money, the margin payments, the jet expense and the rest wasn't looted, they say; it was borrowed. What's more, they argue that the bank loans were sanctioned by accountants, lawyers, outside directors and even regulators and that, had the family's former allies not turned against them, Adelphia would not have collapsed and their collateral would still be good. 
Though that may be a stretch, it is undeniable that a lot of people in official capacities were in a position to prevent, or force the disclosure of, the curious coupling of family and company credit before it got out of hand. For one, Adelphia's independent directors approved the "co-borrowing" loans. Adelphia's outside auditor, Deloitte & Touche, did urge Adelphia to disclose them but acquiesced when Adelphia resisted. Adelphia's longtime securities counsel, the distinguished Pittsburgh firm Buchanan Ingersoll, knew about the co-borrowings as well. Finally, investment banks floated billions of dollars of securities to the public with detailed descriptions of Adelphia's finances that somehow neglected to mention the extra $3 billion of indebtedness. Even the S.E.C. was aware that Adelphia and the Rigas family each let the other borrow on its own credit, an unusual arrangement that, by its very nature, was vulnerable to abuse. But the S.E.C. apparently never investigated it.
Later, when the loans were disclosed and the stock began to fall, each of the above parties affected aggrieved shock. It is not surprising: the scandal has spawned dozens of civil lawsuits, and no one is eager to admit any responsibility. That's the downside of a country run by lawyers. And now that the stock market is back in the pink, a collective amnesia has settled over Wall Street, which takes comfort from the notion that the system essentially worked. The only problem is, it didn't. 
The mere fact that outsiders knew about the co-borrowings may not get the Rigases off the hook, of course. The indictment charges them with numerous instances of securities fraud, including making false disclosures, inflating Adelphia's results, concocting phony deals with vendors to bolster appearances and manufacturing evidence. Half a dozen former employees are cooperating with the government, and Adelphia's former vice president for finance has pleaded guilty. Nonetheless, the larger truth is that plenty of people were in a position to have blown a whistle and didn't, for the simple reason that Wall Street during the 90's operated like a grander version of Coudersport, a place where big fish had license to do as they pleased. "The failed gatekeeper is a lesson you take away from all of these cases," says Steve Thel, a Fordham University law professor who specializes in security fraud. "Auditors who didn't want to lose a client, bankers who were doing a ton of deals -- there was a sense in our society that people who have a lot of money are supposed to have it." 
Coudersport is a six-hour drive from Manhattan, though you can fly to Buffalo and cut the drive to only two and a half hours. There are four motels in town, two stoplights and a newsstand that sells the Buffalo paper. As a lawyer who has had to travel frequently to Coudersport noted, "The food is awful." 
The Rigases' presence here is conspicuous. Start along North Main Street with the movie theater, a prewar, vaguely Art Deco structure that John owns; two fronts down lies the elementary school where his kids got straight A's and that was later converted to Adelphia's headquarters. A bit farther sits the company's new corporate palace with its gaudy Italianate marble columns. Leaving town, you come across a welter of family properties in the shape of curved, stylized barns, as if belonging to a giant child's toy set, each sporting fresh coats of paint and identical split-rail fences. The family's main residence is graced by a pond and a weatherproof "condo" where swans stay warm in winter; down the road there is an unattached kitchen for John's chef, a building for Doris's antique furniture collection, a home used for parties, a storage barn for surplus automobiles, a barnlike home that has been given over to the family's lawyers and a working farm where John produces maple syrup, honey, Christmas trees and corn. 
The Rigases dominated the town's finances; in fact, of Coudersport borough's $564,000 in tax receipts, they and Adelphia contributed close to 40 percent. Their presence in this perpetually depressed region was also felt in other ways, like the hockey tickets they distributed to school kids and the concerts they staged by out-of-town orchestras. When Gary Francis lost his linen service to a fire, a Rigas assistant drove by at 6 the next morning and offered to help. For the next seven months, Francis ranhis business rent-free from a building owned by Adelphia. People in Coudersport didn't much know whether it was Adelphia or Rigas who was footing the bill for such charity, and they didn't care. 
People bought Adelphia stock with a similar mind-set -- because it was "Mr. Rigas's company." Some were upset when the scandal broke, but a few months later, when U.S. Postal Service inspectors handcuffed the Rigases at dawn in their New York apartment and paraded them in front of waiting TV cameras, the home folk rallied. Many people still see John Rigas as a town pillar. Incredibly, even those who have lost money on the stock show no sign of rancor toward him, though their feelings about Tim, who ran the financial side of the company, are not always so charitable. 
Charles Updegraff Jr., the beefy president of the local Citizens Trust, a century-old bank, said he assumed that John simply could not have behaved as badly as the indictment makes it appear. "People are concerned about John," the banker said. As a kid, Updegraff played baseball for John and worked for him at the movie theater. Then, when he was 28, John, a bank director, tapped Updegraff to be Citizen Trust's president. So Updegraff is hardly impartial. But around here, no one is impartial. Donald Gilliland, managing editor of The Potter Leader-Enterprise, who has written perceptively about the case, admitted, "It's hard not to like John." 
I met Rigas, accompanied by his public relations consultant, in the family's two-story legal barn overlooking a hillside where some Rigas sheep were grazing. Rigas was friendly and talkative on two favorite subjects, Will Rogers and baseball. But he seemed confused on various aspects of his case -- for instance, when he noted defensively that he didn't own a private jet. (It's his personal use of the corporate jet that has been deemed improper.) He also insisted that he aims to recapture control of his company, despite the fact that his stock is worthless. The overriding impression is of a man still dazed by his fall. "It's pretty frightening," he told me through tears. "I am thankful my parents aren't here to witness this." 
Rigas was born above his father's restaurant in nearby Wellsville, N.Y. After serving in the infantry in World War II and then earning a degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute courtesy of the G.I. Bill of Rights, he moved across the state border to Coudersport, at 28, to buy the movie theater. The price was $70,000, which he borrowed from his father -- the first of many business deals for which he would overpay and go into hock. 
It was his friendship with a movie distributor named Sam Milberg that got Rigas thinking about cable. Milberg, a salesman for RKO Pictures, was likewise a child of immigrants, and the movie business was, for each of these men, a laboratory in becoming fully American. Milberg began to warn of the threat to movies posed by television. Hill towns like Coudersport did not get reception, but sooner or later, Milberg said, somebody was going to wire the town for cable. 
Anyone could climb a hill and build an antenna, but to run a wire across city streets, you needed a license from the city. Operators in remote towns in Pennsylvania, Oregon and Arkansas began to offer rudimentary cable service in the late 1940's and early 50's. Some of the industry's first "moguls" were just TV-set dealers who figured that cable would drive demand. In Coudersport, a hardware dealer had gotten the license because he figured cable would be good for hardware sales, where the real money was. But he didn't act onit. So Milberg started bugging Rigas to see about buying the franchise. Rigas finally did, in 1952, for $300. He had to borrow that too.
With some local movers and shakers as partners, Rigas wired Coudersport. He started with two channels, both of them snowy. A few years later, Adelphia, as he dubbed the company (the name means "brothers" in Greek), began to acquire more cable systems and, with every one, went deeper into debt. The rub with expanding a cable business was that you had to invest upfront and then recoup your capital from advertisers and subscribers only later. By the time a system broke even, the operator was usually investing in a new system, or in an upgrade of the old one. "It's a hard business for a small-town banker to understand," Updegraff said. "Normally you borrow money and repay it. In cable the debt just grows." 
Not that there wasn't plenty of upside. In what other industry could you get a government monopoly to provide a service to which people became hopelessly addicted, using a product you could pull out of the air free? The model evolved over the years, as networks like ESPN began to charge operators for their programs, but cable companies raised their rates accordingly. In 1975, when HBO transmitted a Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight via satellite, cable took off. Instead of a handful of snowy pictures, systems could begin to offer dozens of clear ones. Operators who had picked up franchises in the early years for the equivalent of $100 a customer became fabulously rich as the price per subscriber vaulted into the thousands. As Leonard Tow, a septuagenarian mogul who sold his cable concern to Adelphia in 1999, put it, "A moron can make money in the cable-television business." 
But the persistent need for fresh capital put Rigas in an uncomfortable spot. His competitors were raising money on Wall Street, but Rigas felt strongly about keeping the company under family control. Had his sons not entered the business, Rigas would have kept the company small, he told me. "I had no plans of being large or wealthy," Rigas said. "The first time a banker called on me, I was shocked." The boys all went off to elite colleges and, in two cases, top law schools, but the transition to life outside Coudersport was hard. Michael had to be talked into going to Harvard. Tim, who went to the University of Pennsylvania, was uncomfortable in the big city. He made a point of telling me that the family had to move from one rented home to the next when the boys were young, which seems to have reinforced their need for roots. 
James married a pediatrician, started a family and established something of a separate life. Tim and Michael remained weirdly attached to the homestead, where, in fact, they still reside with their parents. The shorthand in Coudersport is that Michael, who took charge of Adelphia's operations, is deferential and humble, like his father, though something of a recluse. Tim, who is more socially adept, even charming, takes after Doris, a competitive woman who would berate her husband for being a soft touch. Tim quickly became the finance guy. Tiny Adelphia had trouble getting municipalities to award it franchises over better-known companies, but Tim could persuade the banks to lend Adelphia money so it could purchase systems. The company paid high prices but generally made its purchases pay off. "We were good operators," Tim said proudly. 
In 1986, Tim and James persuaded their dad to take Adelphia public. Like other cable families, the Rigases created two classes of stock -- one with supervoting rights to ensure their control. However, the Rigases kept a few of their cable properties separate, in a private partnership, because some partners were reluctant to sell. And then the Rigases continued to buy properties for the family, privately, as well as for Adelphia. "I wasn't exposed to all that high finance," John said, "but I was always inclined to keep control."
When I asked the purpose of such parallel operations, he said he figured that if something ever went wrong with Adelphia, he would always be able to count on the private businesses -- as if going public had been some newfangled experiment he hadn't quite bought into. Psychologically, he didn't make the transition to being public. Tellingly, the family paid real-estate taxes for Adelphia and for themselves with a single check. 
In some ways, John's old-style management was endearing. The Rigases were liberal with employee medical benefits and tight with executive bonuses. They generally ignored Wall Street, and like the small-town operators they were, they kept cable prices lower than others. 
John, however, was in over his head. By the early 90's, he was telling associates that he wasn't fit to run his own company. The line between public and private was hopelessly blurred as the two wings of the House of Rigas traded cash payments, real estate and personnel too. The Rigases would pay Adelphia for managing their properties, then turn around and insist that the company buy its furniture from Doris, who ran an upscale shop known as Eleni Interiors. The blurriest part of all was Adelphia's board, which supposedly represented the public: a majority of the directors were family members. All this fuzziness didn't seem to bother the increasingly imperious Tim, but it greatly bothered James. He refused free flights on the corporate jet, questioned Tim's plan for the golf course and even made a point of paying his taxes separately from the others. An employee recalls that James also observed that the family's responsibility was "to create value for the shareholders." (James refused to be interviewed for this article.)
The Rigases were usually able to get past such differences and arrive at a consensus; that's how John wanted it. However, when the Internet arrived in full force, James increasingly diverged from the family and was eventually made head of a fiber-optic subsidiary. It would file for bankruptcy, too, but for reasons relating to economics rather than ethics. 
The Internet turned the cable world on its head. Silicon Valley types began to toss around the term "convergence," by which they meant that the telephone, the cable and the computer-based information highway would become one and the same. It was a repeat of the cable industry's beginnings: forecasts of great profits to come, but in the meantime huge capital outlays. In the latter part of the 90's, cable companies essentially rewired the country for digital TV and the Internet at a cost of $75 billion. This was paid for by the public in the form of stocks and bonds. In effect, the cable industry handed investors a gigantic promissory note. 
The rush on Wall Street created a parallel rush to consolidate; for many cable operators, it was acquire or be acquired. The Rigases were adamantly opposed to selling out. Adelphia wasn't just their company; it was their life. The brothers, none of whom pulled down more than $250,000 a year, were in for the long haul. They weren't about to move to Chicago or Denver and work for a conglomerate. 
But the need for capital just wouldn't let up. In 1996, when Adelphia acquired an interest in some cable systems in Florida, the Rigases arranged for the first co-borrowing loan -- one that either they or Adelphia could tap. It was only $200 million, and it arguably benefited Adelphia more than the Rigases. But the enabling agreement stated openly that the family would use some of the money to purchase stock, and any director who bothered to read it would have known that. The board also might have wondered about the family's strangely cloistered style. Virtually every expenditure had to be approved in Coudersport, usually by the Rigases themselves. When a field office in Colorado needed a truck, it had to be driven from Pennsylvania clear across the Rocky Mountains. 
The outside world never seemed to quite get the Rigases, which reinforced their tribal ways. For instance, when a group of big cable companies banded together to form @Home, to manage the Internet side of cable, they refused to let Adelphia become their partner. "People said we marched to our own drummer," Tim said, "but they wouldn't let us join in their parade." Whichever, the Rigases closed themselves off to virtually everyone outside the family. The exception was James Brown, the young, cocky vice president for finance who had no formal training in finance but who became a confidant of Tim's. 
Tim Rigas and Brown were convinced that in the newly wired world, Adelphia had to grow quickly to stay independent. In 1999, they struck. Three large acquisitions in a single month put Adelphia on the map in California, Colorado, Kentucky, Virginia, Michigan and parts of New England -- 30 states in all. The company was vaulted into sixth place among cable operators, its subscriber total jumping to more than five million from a little over two million. Adelphia was suddenly big time. In Coudersport, the family started to strut. Members would boast about jetting off to Los Angeles to see the mayor. Back home, they were demanding improvements to the borough's water facilities and working with architects on plans for a glitzy new headquarters, for which Doris was supervising the choice of fabrics, carpet colors, wall colors and wood stain. Meanwhile, Adelphia's debt shot up from $3.7 billion to $9.7 billion. It's not unusual in cable for a company to borrow five or six times its cash flow; Adelphia's debt had risen to a perilous eight or nine times.
Understand that when cable people speak of "cash flow," they mean the money that is earned before companies pay interest and taxes and also, significantly, before capital projects like system upgrades. The money that is truly left over -- the money that the owners can put in their pockets -- is known as "free cash flow." It can take years for cable companies to earn free cash flow. Adelphia never got there; as far as investors were concerned, it was always a story about tomorrow. 
Wall Street has two opinions of such a story. It hates it or it loves it. In the late 90's, Wall Street loved it. Cable values soared past the $5,000-per-subscriber barrier. In 1998, Adelphia's stock more than doubled, and by May of '99, just after the last of the deals was announced, its stock had doubled again, to $86 a share. 
Most entrepreneurs accept as a matter of course that over time, as the business grows, their ownership will become diluted. But the elder Rigas was dead set against it. Tim was, too. "US West didn't have control, and they were snatched up by AT&T," he pointed out. "We all felt strongly about this." Given that the Rigases controlled 20 percent of Adelphia's stock and about 60 percent of the votes, they were hardly takeover bait. But every decision relating to the stock was a test of their loyalty; when their sister, Ellen, sold a few shares, the Rigas men snubbed her, as if she had broken with the faith. And they insisted on participating if Adelphia issued more stock. The problem was, they couldn't afford to. 
Their solution was bold: borrow money from banks to invest. Normally banks don't like to lend for such purposes, because their collateral can go down the drain with the stock market. So Tim Rigas and Brown, his trusty Sancho Panza, proposed that the Rigases share a line of credit with Adelphia, to reassure the banks. Tim pitched the idea to the independent directors as a replay of the earlier loan. As then, Adelphia and the Rigases would be co-liable for borrowings by either. 
Why would the directors let the Rigases borrow on the shareholders' credit? What they say now is that they figured the Rigases would use the money for their cable assets, which would provide ample collateral. However, it was clear then that the Rigases intended to buy securities -- to keep hold of their company -- as well as finance their private cable properties. After all, they had done it in 1996. And according to the minutes of a special board meeting on Aug. 23, 1999, at which additional co-borrowings were authorized, the Rigases not only made plain that they intended to keep buying stock, but, indeed, the directors also encouraged them.
On Wall Street, the conditions for a capital-raising binge were ripe. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era banking law, had paved the way for commercial banks like Citibank and Bank of America to get into the more lucrative business of underwriting. Adelphia's Brown shrewdly exploited the banks' greed. In a memo to bankers early in 2000, which cordially began, "I hope your New Year is off to a great start," Brown pitched the co-borrowing idea and pointedly observed, "All of the lead managers and co-managers of each of these credit facilities are expected to have an opportunity to play a meaningful role in . . . public security offerings." 
In others words, if the banks lent the Rigases/Adelphia money, then Adelphia would spill some gravy onto their investment-banking divisions. When the bankers saw that, their mouths watered. This was exactly the sort of conflict that Glass-Steagall had been intended to prevent. The banks went for it. From 1999 to 2001, three banking syndicates, led by Bank of America, Bank of Montreal and Wachovia Bank, allowed the Rigases/Adelphia to borrow a total of $5.6 billion, a staggering sum. Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Deutsche Bank and scores of other banks participated. 
Adelphia, meanwhile, was true to its word. From 1998 to 2002, it went to Wall Street more than a dozen times to issue stock, bonds, notes, convertibles -- every flavor in Wall Street's pantry. It raised something like $10 billion, while shelling out $233 million in fees. And syndicate banks like Bank of America were rewarded with lucrative underwriting assignments for their investment-banking affiliates. 
The banking organizations have declined to comment. Generally, they maintain that their two functions, lending and underwriting, were separated by a Chinese wall and that the underwriters were in the dark with regard to the loans (even though they were arranged by their own affiliates). This does not square with the facts. In February 1999, Brown bluntly informed a large group of bankers and investment bankers, "The Rigas family intends to use the proceeds of this distribution to purchase equity securities fromAdelphia."
Anyone looking for mere gaps in the Chinese wall is missing the larger point: banks weren't trying to separate departments but to integrate them. That was the whole reason they had lobbied for Glass-Steagall's repeal. Thus, the banks would send teams of 8 or 10 investment bankers and commercial bankers -- no distinction was evident, according to Tim Rigas -- to Adelphia pitching every financial service under the sun. 
Bank of America's securities unit was so proud of the way it combined its services, which it referred to as "delivering the one-stop shop," that it produced a case study for interns in 2001 on how the technique had worked with a particular client. The client was Adelphia. Page after page describes how Bank of America had devised "an integrated financing solution" for Adelphia, including underwritings, strategic advice, supportive (i.e., positive) research from its analyst and co-borrowing debt. Apparently, the only time Bank of America did not have an integrated approach to Adelphia was when it added up the debt that was disclosed in Adelphia prospectuses. 
And the Rigases were on an investing binge, all of it on credit. From 1998 on, the family bought a phenomenal $1.8 billion of Adelphia stock and other securities -- an extravagance made even more reckless by the securities' high prices. Both Tim and his father were incredibly cavalier about the risk. They craved the growth of a public company and the control of a private one; apparently, none of their advisers pointed out that these priorities were in conflict.
To anyone who knew about the co-borrowing loan, investments of such magnitude could have had only one source. But most investors didn't know about it. Most assumed that Adelphia was selling stock in normal, arms-length transactions, thus replenishing its capital. Had they known that Adelphia was acting as a guarantor in those sales, they would have realized that Adelphia wasn't really selling stock -- it was recycling its own credit. 
Alvin Davis, an attorney for three of the outside directors, said: "None ever had an understanding that a portion of co-borrowings would be used to purchase Adelphia stock. That was so manifestly improper as to be inconceivable." However, materials distributed at a board meeting in October 2000 made it clear that the Rigases were doing just that. One page of the briefing packet said, "Rigas family to purchase $250 mm" of an Adelphia stock offering. Another page disclosed that the Rigases were drawing an identical $250 million of the co-borrowing. 
Such details almost put too fine a point on it. Corporate directors weren't in the habit of challenging management, certainly not on a board where the founding family had a majority of seats. And the interests of the outside directors were, in many cases, somewhat tied to the company's. Erland Kailbourne, a prominent civic booster in Buffalo, was a Rigas family friend and a promoter of Adelphia's plans to build a skyscraper downtown there. Two other directors, Dennis Coyle and Les Gelber, were executives at Florida Power and Light, Adelphia's partner in some cable systems in Florida. F.P.L. wanted out, and it was hoping that Adelphia would eventually buy its share, which it did.
Davis, the lawyer, said that those directors relied on the independence of the board's audit committee. But by then the audit committee consisted of only Pete Metros, a John Rigas chum from upstate New York, and Tim Rigas, who was the chairman of it. No minutes of the audit committee meetings have been produced, and it isn't clear that the committee formally met. In other words, Metros seems to have been a rubber stamp allowing the company's chief financial officer to supervise himself. 
The Rigases still had to suffer their outside auditing firm, Deloitte & Touche. Early in 2001, Deloitte began an intensive review of Adelphia's annual report for 2000, due at the S.E.C. early that spring. Deloitte was particularly worried about how to account for the co-borrowing. In previous years, Adelphia disclosed the size of the credit line but not how much the Rigas entities had actually borrowed under it. In an early draft of the 2000 report, Adelphia stuck with that approach. Deloitte, however, wanted more disclosure. One auditor scribbled in the margin, "Disclose how much drawn." 
Adelphia's next draft looked no different. So again, a Deloitte auditor suggested the change. Under generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP), a company that guarantees a third party's debt is required to show the loan on its own books if it thinks a loss is probable. But even if that standard isn't met, if the guarantor believes there is at least a reasonable possibility of a loss, it has to disclose the contingency, say in text or in a footnote. This was the path advised by Deloitte. 
Meanwhile, Adelphia was furiously discussing the matter with its securities counsel, Buchanan Ingersoll. Adelphia was one of the firm's top clients, worth $6 million to $7 million in fees a year. Buchanan handled all of Adelphia's securities filings and was intimately acquainted with the company. A spokeswoman for the firm gave me a boilerplate description of its involvement: "Appropriate and professional legal advice based on the information we were given." She added that Buchanan didn't know the "breakdown" of the Rigases' private debt.
But on March 27, just before the filing deadline, a secretary in Adelphia's finance department e-mailed Buchanan: "The managed entities have outstanding borrowing of 1,599,733 000's omitted ." Allowing for a convenient memory lapse, Buchanan also says that the decision about what to disclose was left to Deloitte. Funny, according to Deloitte, the auditors heard from Adelphia that Buchanan had signed off.
In any case, Deloitte was still seeking fuller disclosure on March 29, just before the filing was due. An auditor scrawled on draft No. 5, "The Managed Entities have outstanding borrowings of $1,599,733 as of December 31, 2000." An Adelphia employee wrote over it, "No."
Tim Rigas, who was glib and low-key in answering almost any question, told me he figured it was enough to disclose the potential size of the credit line -- not the amount borrowed. And ultimately, he noted, Adelphia's auditor agreed. That will no doubt be the theme of his defense: blame the gatekeepers. "The outside directors approved the co-borrowings," Tim repeated. "Deloitte was comfortable with the disclosure. Buchanan Ingersoll was comfortable." He allowed that in retrospect, full disclosure would have been better, but he maintained that at the time, the accounting treatment hadn't been a big deal either way. However, in an instant message that Brown sent to a colleague with whom he had been discussing the co-borrowing, Brown said pointedly, "Tim has this as his highest Audit priority." So it appears likely that Tim Rigas was actively involved in the decision not to disclose. 
That didn't mean Deloitte had to acquiesce. It could have refused to sign the annual report, known as the 10-K -- in fact, it was required to do so if it felt the disclosure was misleading. And the filing omitted $1.6 billion of debt. Even if it did sign, Deloitte was obligated to notify the audit committee of any disagreement it had with management. But Deloitte blinked. 
Greg Dearlove, a 25-year veteran at Deloitte who was the lead partner on the Adelphia account, justified Deloitte's silence by maintaining that Deloitte hadn't disagreed with Adelphia but had merely suggested changes to its filing. Indeed, Deloitte (but not the S.E.C.) still maintains that the filing was in accord with GAAP. But the real truth behind Deloitte's passivity lies in Dearlove's admission that on occasion, when he did call the audit committee, only Tim Rigas would show up. In effect, the Rigases had found a way to short-circuit the early-warning system. 
That September, Dearlove resigned from Deloitte -- which news Jim Brown described, in an internal message, as "a huge bummer." A colleague of Brown's responded hopefully that perhaps his replacement would, similarly, be Adelphia's "advocate." A collection of these messages shows the employees in Adelphia's finance department to be increasingly engaged in keeping the lid on the company's accounting. Messages about Sabres games and getting haircuts are interspersed with notes on "stretching" the numbers, and it is clear that the people in Coudersport were starting to worry that Deloitte could be pushed only so far. In November 2001, Brown queried, "I wonder if we can use the impairment rules to create some cookie jars?" ("Cookie jars" are places to hide expenses.)
Tim Werth, a fellow employee, replied, "D.T." -- Deloitte & Touche -- "will be watching that like a hawk."
Brown shot back, "Hawks don't catch all the mice."
Ominously, the Street was focusing on Adelphia's debt, and Adelphia's stock was falling. Moody's, the credit-rating agency, downgraded Adelphia's bonds. The one bright spot, Moody's allowed, was the persistent support shown by the Rigases. Indeed, Adelphia maintained that the infusions of capital from the Rigases were "deleveraging" the company. This was patently untrue. 
The Rigases weren't infusing capital but borrowing it. In most cases, their infusions consisted of mere accounting entries, whereby money that Adelphia had borrowed from the banks, under one of the co-borrowing arrangements, was "reclassified" as debt pertaining to the Rigases. And, voila, the debt would vanish from Adelphia's books, though Adelphia, according to the terms of the co-borrowing agreement, remained co-liable for it. By 2002, the total of such vanished debt had soared to $3 billion.
Moody's, which couldn't know this, issued a bulletin early in 2002 saying that the outlook for Adelphia was improving. Most of the securities analysts on the Adelphia beat seconded the "deleveraging" story. 
Much has been written about stock analysts: they were, it was said, dishonest arbiters and hype-artists. Those who followed Adelphia certainly remained bullish, even as the market retreated from its dot-com-induced high. But what stands out from the analysts' reports is less the hype than the utter superficiality. Nowhere does a reader gain a feeling for what distinguished Adelphia -- its cloistered weirdness, its familial obsessions, its precarious capital structure and persistent deficit of free cash flow. The analysts beat their breasts over minutiae, they obsess over stock charts, they deliver pages upon pages of spread sheets crammed with figures, yet nowhere do they scrutinize, or even critically question, the convenient company projections on which the numbers are based. 
In the end, it was a bond analyst who sniffed out the problem. Oren Cohen at Merrill Lynch had followed the company since 1992 and had been perturbed by the stream of payments that went back and forth between Adelphia and a Rigas entity. Cohen didn't suspect fraud; he only knew that there was something he couldn't figure out and that the company was chary with answers. In particular, no one would tell him how the Rigases were paying for all that stock. Therefore, he wondered about Adelphia's "deleveraging" story. "The large equity issuance does raise some questions," Cohen wrote early in 2002. "We are somewhat hesitant to fully endorse the notion that Adelphia is plainly deleveraging for all the right reasons." 
Around that time, the S.E.C. had persuaded the stock exchanges to amend their rules, so that listed companies had to appoint an outside director as head of its audit committee. As of mid-2001, Tim Rigas was out, and Kailbourne, his dad's old friend, was in. Kailbourne wanted to make the committee more rigorous, and in particular, he wanted to know more about the co-borrowing. 
Deloitte was also insisting on more disclosure. The firm says that its change of heart was triggered by an S.E.C. bulletin from January 2002, which reminded auditors to consider "the amounts of any guarantees." But the S.E.C. bulletin didn't change the rules; it merely affirmed them. The real change was that the Enron scandal was headline news. No one wanted to be the next Enron.
At the end of February, Adelphia informed the Deloitte team that as of the end of 2001, the Rigases had drawn $2.3 billion under the co-borrowing. Deloitte and Kailbourne agreed that this should be disclosed in a footnote in Adelphia's next 10-K, due on March 31. There is no sign that either regarded the disclosure as scandalous or even as grounds for rebuke. Adelphia's board meeting in the first week in March, held in Cancun, went off without a hitch. In fact, the outside directors agreed to a substantial raise in the younger Rigases' pay. And by the morning of March 27, the Deloitte team had no major issues with the company outstanding. 
Adelphia reported its earnings before the opening bell, including a footnote reporting "co-borrowing credit facilities balances of approximately $2,284,000 000's omitted ." Wall Street paid more attention to the headline "Management Increases 2002 Guidance for Digital and Data Deployments." The stock, which closed the previous afternoon just above $20, headed upward. Then, at 10 a.m., the analysts dialed into a conference call during which each, in succession, was able to put a question to Adelphia's financial team, Tim Rigas and Brown.
Such conference calls are usually scripted affairs in which executives try to seem candid and analysts pretend to be curious. And that's how this one started off. But occasionally, as in presidential debates, a truth is laid bare.
Rigas and Brown affected a jocular, eager-to-please manner. The stock continued to rise during the call, suggesting that some analysts were phoning their trading desks. After an hour, Brown said he had time for one last question, which turned out to be from Oren Cohen.
Cohen referred to the footnote. "That's an awful lot of debt," he pointed out. Indeed, it was too much debt to be supported by the Rigases' cable assets. "What is backing up that debt?"
Either Brown or Tim Rigas replied, "We've not provided any further breakout of that."
The unsung Cohen persisted, "Well, is there any way you can provide further breakout?"
Investors may not read footnotes, but they know when a company is ducking. By day's end, the stock was under $17. Bank of America coyly suggested to Adelphia that they prepare a coordinated spin to handle investor questions. But neither it nor the Rigases guessed they were on the verge of a crisis.
The stock, however, continued to fall. Deloitte, which had been on the verge of approving the annual report, now wanted more information. Eventually, it refused to proceed with the audit. Without a 10-K, Adelphia was in violation of loan covenants, and the news of such troubles kept pounding the stock. The S.E.C. opened an investigation into the co-borrowing, and within six weeks, the Justice Department was probing an array of supposed wrongdoing, from falsifying subscriber numbers and cash-flow totals to creating phony payment receipts. In the middle of May, the directors Kailbourne and Metros, John Rigas's former buddies, made a late-night trip to Coudersport and met with the family till well past midnight. Within 48 hours, Tim and his father had resigned from management. Adelphia sent a man to repossess the family's 22 cars; John wondered abjectly, "What will I drive?"
The government investigation revealed that the intermingling of private and public accounts was deeper than suspected -- indeed, downright epidemic. Because the co-borrowing funds were generally deposited first at Adelphia and then tapped by the family on an as-needed basis, the Rigases had come to treat the corporate treasury as their own. Usually, when they "purchased" stock, they didn't pay for it as others did; they merely shifted some of the co-borrowing debt from Adelphia to themselves. And when John needed money for the farm, the money was simply disbursed and noted by a journal entry. Then, at the end of each quarter, the entries were toted up and an appropriate amount of co-borrowings were reclassified.
This process became so routine that even after March 27, when Adelphia came under intense public scrutiny, the Rigases still tapped $170 million of corporate funds to meet margin calls on their stock. This became Rigas "co-borrowing" debt as well. Then, as the stock tumbled toward zero, the Rigases' collateral vanished, meaning that the infamous co-borrowing debt had become Adelphia's problem after all.
The investigation, of course, has revealed numerous problems unrelated to the co-borrowing, like Ellen's movie project, the free use of apartments for family members, a timber deal that seems to favor the Rigases personally and the supposed manipulations of the company's cash flow and subscriber numbers. The outside directors, as well as Deloitte, and also the bankers and lawyers, are right to say that most of these were undetectable. However, they didn't occur until after the co-borrowing began. So you have to wonder if the family's history would have been different if any of its advisers -- or even the S.E.C.- had acted on what they did detect and delivered the family a lesson in corporate civics.
For the one trait that distinguishes the Rigases from virtually every other culprit on Wall Street is that they didn't sell their stock. The evidence suggests less that they intended to defraud than that they intended to hide inconvenient facts until they could be righted. This is also, of course, against the law; it's just a more tragic crime than ordinary looting. 
Tim Rigas is bitter about his ouster and the way that David Boies, the celebrity litigator hired by the directors, engineered it. According to Tim, the Rigases stepped down for what they were told would be a temporary respite, then watched in horror as Boies and the directors locked them out of their company and needlessly put it into bankruptcy. "We built this company from 45,000 subscribers to five million. How did it get to filing for bankruptcy in two months?" he asked. Tim is fond of pointing out that Adelphia's business did not suffer a downturn. But Adelphia is hardly the first company to suffer a crisis of confidence. The question is always whether a debtor has the financial strength to withstand a crisis; Adelphia did not. 
The aftermath has been nasty. The independent directors, who oversaw the initial phase of bankruptcy proceedings, produced highly sanitized versions of events to the S.E.C. and to the bankruptcy court. In an effort to renounce a contract between Adelphia and Merrill Lynch regarding a cable system in Puerto Rico, the directors produced a second set of minutes for the board meeting at which the deal was approved. Merrill says the minutes were altered to hide the fact that the directors, who have sought to distance themselves from the Rigases, had O.K.'d the deal; the directors say their minutes are the accurate ones. All have resigned from the board. 
Adelphia hopes to emerge from bankruptcy this year, but meanwhile it is in litigation with Merrill, Deloitte, the Rigases and the banks too. The new C.E.O., a former AT&T executive, is trying to put all that behind him. A corporate type, he has taken a stock-option package and moved the company headquarters to Denver. 
People in Coudersport, where Adelphia still employs 1,200, are nervous about the company's commitment to the town, but some things have changed for good. The water system is being improved, and they have started serving espresso at City News. And a Chinese restaurant opened. 
I mentioned to residents that the Rigases weren't very neighborly in what they chose to include in their disclosures, but that isn't what people here are focusing on. They wonder if John will take the stand and how he will fare, and in the meantime, 300 turned out late last year to wish him a happy birthday. "Are we angry?" said Kim Mitchell, a bookkeeper. "I wouldn't say so." Although the company's collapse caused four of her clients to file for bankruptcy and to stick her with unpaid receivables, she remains loyal. "The Rigases did so much for the community. They hired contractors, they modernized the schools," but now she was unconsciously confusing the Rigases with their company and with their town, and further embroidering their unhappy saga.

 BODY:
Baraka Cheeseboro noticed something going on behind the poinsettias. While prayers were raised and the choir sang on a recent morning at the Community C.M.E. Church in Columbia, S.C., Howard Dean was chattering away on the altar with Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. Labrena Aiken noticed it, too. "Baraka," she leaned in to whisper, "those flowers need to be moved. We want to see his face." The service was well under way, but a sign from Cheeseboro to an usher, a quick word with the pastor, and the flowers came down. Dean, now in plain sight, assumed a respectful mien. A bit later the two women were joined in the pew by a third, and the young pastor, the Rev. Joiquim Barnes, acknowledged for his audience the arrival of Gilda Cobb-Hunter.
 "You do know what they call those three -- Gilda, Labrena, Baraka," a friend long involved in South Carolina politics said afterward. "They call them the Marvelettes." If you want something to happen politically, especially in their home base of Orangeburg County in the heart of the state's Black Belt, you need to know them. 
 Like every candidate trolling for votes in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary -- the first in the South and the first with a substantial black electorate -- Dean had eagerly sought Cobb-Hunter's endorsement, and like every one, he had failed. At the church doors he embraced her, this six-term state representative, former minority leader of the State Legislature (the first woman and first African-American to hold the job), member of the Democratic National Committee, superdelegate to the 2004 Democratic convention. He said he hoped to see her at a meeting of black leaders he was holding later that day. Cobb-Hunter smiled her most gracious smile, her lovely silver-ringed fingers light against his shoulders. Aiken smiled, too, and gave him a professional handshake, the one she has used to greet politicians of no particular favor since back when she was an officer in the county Democratic Party. Officially, she doesn't have, as she puts it, "a dog in this race"; neither, at the time, did Cheeseboro, who has been mobilizing Democratic voters in Orangeburg County since she was 9. At a subsequent hotel rally awash with white faces, "the girls," as some call Aiken and Cheeseboro, weren't interested in sticking around to lend their assent to all those signs proclaiming "African-Americans for Dean." But Cobb-Hunter stayed on. 
Cobb-Hunter said she was impressed that Dean had chosen a small church (membership, 85) and that even 20 to 25 African-Americans showed up in the crowd of 400 for a Sunday-afternoon rally. She said she was also impressed by the directness with which Dean told them all: "In 1968, Richard Nixon won the White House. He did it in a shameful way -- by dividing Americans against one another, stirring up racial prejudices and bringing out the worst in people. They called it the Southern Strategy. . . . Nixon pioneered it, and Ronald Reagan perfected it, using phrases like 'racial quotas' and 'welfare queens."' White candidates never talk like this in public, Cobb-Hunter suggested. As for why she didn't attend the black leaders' gathering after the rally, though, she drew up her mouth, arched her brow and said in a been-around-this-pony-show-before kind of way, "I'm not on the Dean plantation." 
If the Marvelettes are an indication, there's trouble for the Democratic Party in black America. Most people don't have a passion forpolitics to offset the skepticism born of being dragooned into service every election cycle to cover the spot on the political gaming table labeled "the black vote." And skepticism reigns among the Democrats' most loyal constituents on the eve of what is being called the "black primary." African-Americans could account for up to half the vote in South Carolina on Tuesday, so for months candidates have been visiting black churches, dropping in at football games and fish fries, collecting black endorsements and welding themselves to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. or Bill Clinton, sometimes both. 
Some say the outcome here will forecast how the candidates will sell to African-Americans nationwide. As of early January, the most compelling message appeared to be "sellers beware." A schoolteacher and choirmaster in the county seat, the city of Orangeburg, told me, "I'm disgusted with the whole process." A store owner said he'd vote for Al Sharpton because "what choice do we have?" One 21-year-old hip-hopper wasn't even having that; he said of Sharpton, "All he's trying to do is manipulate the black people against the white people to vote for him to be leader of black America." At a meeting early last month of Concerned Citizens of House District 66, a civic group in the area Cobb-Hunter represents, there was no debate about "the presidentials," as she calls them, but heated words about a sheriff's race in June. 
A couple of weeks later the state party reported a heartening uptick of interest among Democratic voters. Still, nobody could guess whether the candidates' shifting fortunes -- and the presence on the ballot of two Southerners, John Edwards and Wesley Clark -- would galvanize the electorate. Some election officials said a 20 percent turnout among all Democratic voters for the primary would be an achievement. 
Blacks who vote in South Carolina overwhelmingly want George Bush out. But as one black South Carolinian told me, a party can't just depend on "a bogeyman" or identify with a community when it's convenient and expect consistent identification in return.
"The Democratic Party is the party that talks about the black vote and attaining it by any means necessary," Aiken said. "Now, that does not equate with 'We value the black vote' as much as 'We have to attain it in order to get what we want."' The routine currency in this exchange is emotion -- for white candidates a little soul power soaked up from a gospel choir and shed just as easily. Candidates parade through church, Aiken noted, but, she said: "Has anyone done a follow-up visit after a campaign? You know, 'I came to your church, asked for your vote, the preacher gave me the pat and we prayed. Now I'm in; I'm going to make one more trip back, at least to thank you."'
It is commonly recognized that whichever passing churchgoer ultimately becomes the party's nominee, he will not be seen here again. In the Democratic National Committee's markup of battleground and nonbattleground states for November, South Carolina falls definitively into the latter category. (Bush easily won the state in the 2000 election with nearly 60 percent of the vote.) Some Democratic strategists say that the party might be smart to write off not just South Carolina but the whole South (except Florida) and concentrate on states more demonstrably in play. It is less commonly noted that writing off the South, home to 55 percent of the country's black population, symbolically means writing off African-Americans as well.
At a Democratic National Committee meeting last October, members of the D.N.C.'s Southern Caucus confronted the committee chairman, Terry McAuliffe, about the national party's failure to sponsor a single debate in the South and about fears that the region will be starved of resources for November. The D.N.C. insists that this is not the case and that some Southern states are on its target list. But Cobb-Hunter, like every African-American I spoke with, has not forgotten that in 2000 the party pulled virtually everything out of the South to concentrate on Florida, then refused to see beyond hanging chads and go to the mat over the tens of thousands of voters, the majority black and Hispanic, said to have been improperly labeled felons and stripped from the rolls. "Any message that the Democratic Party wanted to send, they sent in 2000, and '04 is just a continuation of that message," she said. "It's up to the Democratic Party whether they want to change the story. Because if they don't, we will not carry one Southern state. Let me just add that if the Democratic Party is not serious about dealing with the issues of race and class that are so prevalent in this country but particularly in the South, then they may as well write it off, because there's no point in coming in here with cosmetics."
There's something imposing and at the same time familiar about Gilda Cobb-Hunter, something that makes her seem taller than she is and draws you to feel more acquainted than you have a right to -- but suggests too that it's best to call her Ms. Cobb-Hunter until you get the green light for "Gilda," and that comes pretty quickly. Her district includes Orangeburg, a small city of 12,765, plus the surrounding cotton country and little county burgs. In town, she directs a women's shelter and a center for the prevention of sexual and domestic violence called CASA/Family Systems. On one of my visits, the tiny waiting room, adorned with prints by her husband, Terry K. Hunter, as well as with posters advising that H.I.V. is preventable and "Real Men Don't Hit Women," stirred with the children of a murdered woman, a woman on the ragged edge and a lone bowed man, remanded there by the courts. South Carolina has the highest rate in the nation of men killing their wives, girlfriends and exes. Orangeburg is among the leaders in the state in H.I.V./AIDS, and is high up in all the indicators of illness, stress and financial insecurity. 
Cobb-Hunter started as a volunteer with CASA's precursor in 1979, a couple of years after she and Terry moved to Orangeburg. She had once floundered when trying to help a friend who had been raped, she told me, and vowed never to be so powerless again. She started attending County Council meetings because she was bored in a notoriously insular town. She had little political experience beyond some work with the McGovern campaign while she attended Florida A&M University. In Orangeburg, she met Baraka Cheeseboro in a karate class. Cheeseboro was an activist, working against police brutality, and by the early 80's the two were full into local politics. Almost five years ago, Cheeseboro came to work at CASA and is now a case manager there. Labrena Aiken, the agency's deputy director, has been there since 1990, fresh from college.
Temperamentally, the three are a combination, in different measure, of brass and tact. Politically, Cobb-Hunter, who is 51 and has a reputation as both hell-raiser and negotiator, works the state connections and troubleshoots for constituents getting the runaround locally. Aiken, 37, works her circle of young professionals, women who turn off the phone when it's time for "Sex and the City," shun partisan gatherings and won't rule out Republican candidates. Cobb-Hunter says she and Cheeseboro had to pull Aiken into politics, but in the shops along Russell Street, like College Corner, a minimart where her father is among the regulars assessing the shape of things, Aiken mixes pop and politics with the best of them. 
Unlike Aiken, whose people are from Orangeburg but whose childhood was spent on military bases, and Cobb-Hunter, who is from Gifford, Fla., Cheeseboro has spent all her 46 years here. She holds "office" under a venerable pecan tree in Martha (Bay-Bay) Hooks's front yard in the hard-time neighborhood of Sprinkle Avenue, where locals plan for political campaigns, organize events and gossip. They say Cheeseboro knows everyone and his cousin-once-removed in Orangeburg, and she holds its history close. Back in 1968, when she was 10, her 17-year-old cousin Delano Middleton was among three people shot dead by white Highway Patrolmen at South Carolina State University in one of the civil rights era's bloodiest events; known as the Orangeburg Massacre, it was the first such use of force on an American campus. That attack ripped her world of cowboy shows and country and western on the radio; she never would be so carefree or so unconscious of what people call the state's "race culture" again.
Cheeseboro can chart the class matrix and power gaps within white society as well as black, but Orangeburg isn't a place presidentials come to woo the white vote. They come here when they want to be sure of a black audience and sure that their words aren't wasted. The center of a county that is 61 percent black and nearly 100 percent Democratic in elected offices, it is more or less midway between Columbia and Charleston, midway between rural and urban, midway between abject poverty and the high life, meaning that while some African-Americans reside in the suburbia of cathedral ceilings and others live out of rusty vans off a main road, most people occupy the space where dirt alleys of trailers and shotgun shacks seem to melt into potholed lanes of bungalows, which in turn melt into smooth streets of ranch houses and pretty lawns. Just outside the city limits, there are vast medical complexes and factories making ibuprofen, sterile tubing and more lawnmowers and garden tractors than anywhere in the world. Countywide, unemployment is 14.5 percent and the average wage is $8.72 an hour, but a more palpable measure of the area's financial state is the generous presence downtown of pawnshops and all manner of loan-fixer and car-title repurchaser. Candidates rarely, if ever, do walk-arounds through this slice of Americana, preferring readymade audiences across the tracks at the historically black colleges, State and Claflin University. 
"The Democrats lost the White House because they forgot the street, the corner, the people who put them in office," George R. Dean, who owns a clothing business in town, offered soon after Aiken said he'd have an opinion or two for me. A member of the Chamber of Commerce, he made a straight-up Keynesian argument for investment in infrastructure, education, the environment, small-business relief, "the needs of the people": "The divide in America ain't black and white; it's the haves and the have-nots, and that's the truth, darling. Until we start disbursing this stuff, as we say in the Deep South, us'en in a heap of trouble."
I'd heard this kind of thing throughout Orangeburg: the Democratic Party is reactive, "spinally challenged," populist only intermittently while the people sink. More than 27 percent of the county's households survive on $15,000 a year or less, a condition of persistent poverty that ensnares so much of the South, especially the rural Black Belt. For some, the drug business is a way out, and Cheeseboro can spot the "movin' on up" homes that drugs bought. But more are caught than lucky, particularly if they're black. African-Americans make up 30 percent of South Carolina's population but 70 percent of its prisoners. Officially, one out of 13 black men in South Carolina is barred from voting because he is in prison, on probation or on parole; nationwide the rate is one in 8. And everyone says it: the poor have been written off. The poor, the state, the South. Who's next?
Cobb-Hunter takes this all personally. She, too, can list policy proposals, but talking about party disarray and how it leaves her and her constituents powerless makes her voice burn. For 30 years, Republicans, with ideological clarity, organizational discipline and deft manipulation of cultural insecurities, have been building their power base through sewing circles and school boards, statehouses and small-time talk radio as surely as through their friends at Fox and the Fortune 500. In the past 10 years they've gained control of the South Carolina House, Senate and Governor's Mansion. This year, Ernest F. Hollings's United States Senate seat will open up, one of five vulnerable Democratic seats in the South. Meanwhile, what Cobb-Hunter calls the Democratic Party's "identity crisis" filters down to all those more parochial levels where a party needs to give the common person, whatever his or her color, a reason to care.
At lunch one day at a local restaurant, I watched the three women trading the small change of politics as constituents and officeholders, black and white, stopped by the table for a quick word. "I'm a firm believer, like Tip O'Neill, that all politics are local," Cobb-Hunter stressed. "That's right," said Cheeseboro, casually scanning the room, occasionally interjecting a barb at politicians ("No offense, Gilda." "None taken.") while Aiken listened for her opening and Cobb-Hunter continued. "If you want to know what's wrong with the Democratic Party, just look right here. There's this perception that there's a strong Democratic toehold in Orangeburg County, but really the party itself is almost nonexistent. There's no real concerted effort to involve young people. And at the state level, until the old guard got thrown out in '02, it was like, to hell with the base vote."
Separately, each woman noted that the former state party chairman, Dick Harpootlian, who is white, had once quipped, "I don't want to buy the black vote; I just want to rent it for a day." That was in 1986, he told me, an offhand joke that no one takes seriously, adding that as a state and a country, "we've got to get beyond racial division, and we can't seem to do that." Memories are long; the three women were not the first to mention his quotation to me. Nor were they the first to assert that white Democrats would jump party (and have) before accepting black leadership. Or to say they'd felt used by the former Democratic governor, Jim Hodges, who was elected in 1998 with the help of black party activists and who then, some say, ignored black, poor and working-class voters. 
Many fault Hodges for skimping on grass-roots campaigning in his 2002 re-election bid. He went down on Nov. 5, Cobb-Hunter's birthday. It was, her friends joked, the best present she got. "'Y'all ain't got nowhere to go,' Dick Harpootlian would tell me in meetings for the 2002cycle," she said. "'Are they gonna vote Republican?"' One of her best friends, a born Democrat, did. More than 10,000 South Carolinians left the top of the ballot blank or, like at least one of Cobb-Hunter's fellow legislators, voted for Kevin Gray, a black write-in candidate. Gray, who later served as an adviser to Carol Moseley Braun's campaign, studied state Election Commission statistics and found that almost 289,000 blacks stayed home in the 2002 election, more than went to the polls. 
The state Democratic Party executive director, Nu Wexler, maintains that as a percentage of overall turnout, that was among the better recent performances, which can't be reassuring. In any event, it's hard to overstate the residual bitterness. Just last November the Rev. Hayes Gainey of Edisto Fork United Methodist Church, in Cobb-Hunter's district, got "amens" when in a Sunday sermon he mentioned black voters' feeling of being used and abused by the Democrats, specifically noting 2002. It's a sensitivity that carries over in assessing national candidates now. "John Kerry had his people in Orangeburg one night," Gainey told me. "They were trying to push his platform to a group of us, and one of them says, 'If we decide to use you -.' Well, 'Hold on,' I said. 'You're not going to use anyone in this room. If we decide to support John Kerry's campaign, we'll let you know.' Thought to myself, Man, you talking to us as if you're the pimp and we're the workers." 
Cobb-Hunter said she's hopeful that the new leadership in the state Democratic Party will bring a change. Some 260,000 eligible black voters in South Carolina aren't registered. Added to registered no-shows, that means half a million or so African-Americans are "missing voters," a group sizable enough to turn any statewide election for the Democrats -- if they saw a reason to. But everyone I met who's doing voter registration in town, on campus or in the countryside said they're up against it. Cheeseboro recalled that two years ago, "folks actually ran me out their yard. They'd say: 'Get out! I'm not voting. I don't want anything to do with it. Ain't nothin' gonna change.' I have heard that over and over again."
Pessimism didn't seem logical when Cobb-Hunter and Cheeseboro were coming up in the 60's. Both their fathers did janitorial work and their mothers worked as domestics. Cheeseboro's family was not political. With civil rights undiscussed at home, little Baraka (then Diane) imagined Martin Luther King from out of her Westerns, "a tall, skinny black man in a black suit with six-guns by his side." 
Both women remember their schooling as a fount of possibility. "Get an education, because the white man can't take that out of your head," Cobb-Hunter's people repeatedly told her; and Cheeseboro credits her black teachers, who "taught unity" and organized the children to leaflet homes before Election Day, as instilling a sense of communal responsibility. The two girls learned of the full volatility of the period in other ways. From fourth grade Cobb-Hunter was captive to the evening news, and after the horror of the Orangeburg Massacre, Cheeseboro says, "it was always about trying to make a change somewhere."
The memory of that world, the hopeful part, is what John Edwards invokes among black audiences in this, his natal state. His pitch may interest middle-agers who work for HeadStart, or alumnae circles where ladies draped in mink cheer the Marching 101 at S.C. State football games or discuss interest rates in the trustees' skybox. 
But on their children's campuses at State and Claflin,in the rural streets where young blacks seek distraction, among the many who listed the "triple evils" of poverty, racism and war as their chief concerns, the talk was of Sharpton, Dean and Clark; once or twice, of Kucinich, whom one student said he'd support partly as "a show of dissatisfaction." They'd vote for Al Sharpton out of black pride, some young ones told me, or against him for the same reason. Either way, he got marks for talking about the world as it is. Dean got marks for being "angry," for championing "the democratic wing of the Democratic Party." Clark, for sensitivity to veterans and the chance that maybe he'd know how to get out of Iraq. 
Particulars aside, what defined those choices was a perception of relative candor and relative independence. As January slid toward King Day, Cheeseboro came out for Wesley Clark. He "seems open," she said, and comfortable in a world of colors. Aiken, who is considering Clark, suggested: "I think it's the military thing. Not that everyone in the military is okey-dokey, but if he lived on post, and I know he did, he didn't have a choice as to who his neighbor was." Aiken said she was looking at Edwards too.
No one I met in the 18-to-35-year-old cohort said, as did James Sulton, at 80 the lion of one of Orangeburg's grand families, "I'd vote for the Devil if he was a Democrat." Often, younger blacks called themselves independent or libertarian or said they thought the two parties didn't differ fundamentally, supporting national data showing that about a third of African-Americans of this age (and almost 40 percent of the men) identify with neither party. Lately, the hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons announced plans to register millions of young voters nationwide, but as in South Carolina, that still leaves unaddressed the turnout question (in 2000, almost two-thirds of registered blacks between 18 and 24 didn't vote) and the matter of whether people believe voting can change anything. In the hamlet of Elloree, in Cobb-Hunter's district, half a dozen hip-hoppers spent four hours telling me about the jobs that were not there, the cops that always were, the runarounds and racial disequilibrium in the smallest things. They said they'd vote (except for one, who had a drug rap), but as I heard repeatedly, you might perform the act without having confidence in it. As for Elloree, "It ain't ever gonna change." 
Cobb-Hunter winced when I recounted this and remembered the day a maid led a group of girls into her Statehouse office. "They're in training," the maid told her. "And I just got so depressed, because they were young, 19, 20, early 20's, and they were training to become janitors. That to me just suggests that we -- meaning those of us in leadership positions -- we have really failed our community. We are raising a generation who believes there is no hope, and we can't put the total blame on white folk. Because we aren't any different from white officials once we get in there. We are selfish -- and there are exceptions to every rule -- but in general people of color tend to act just like white folk when they get into power. They're very selective about who they share it with; they're selective about who they bring into the inner circle; and they're interested in taking care of themselves and their own and not much beyond that."
The last time the question of energizing, even expanding the base came under serious debate in the Democratic Party was in the 80's. Labrena Aiken remembers 1984, when at 18 she cast her first ballot, for Jesse Jackson, as something "electric." She and her friendsknew, she said, that he would not win the nomination, but "even when you know, you still want to believe." Cobb-Hunter was a Jackson delegate that year, her first national convention. It's often forgotten that Jackson's campaign registered more than a million voters in 1984 and that two years later the Democrats regained the Senate, picking up four seats in the South. In 1988, his Rainbow Coalition came in first or second in 46 of 54 primary contests, registering another two million along the way. But as Ronald Reagan had in 1980, Michael Dukakis took his general-election campaign to Neshoba County, Miss., to court white votes, never mentioning the murder of three civil rights workers there in 1964. The white Democratic leadership's interest in rainbow populism, never enthusiastic, was officially terminated.
Bill Clinton was supposed to have made up for all that. "He had the moves," Cobb-Hunter said. Her voice had a weariness. "He'd been around black folk, and he had that cadence; he knew how to speak the language." People do like "Bill." In Elloree they have warm hearts for "Hillary" too. Yet assessing the Clinton program -- with its signature triangulation, mollifying the base while co-opting Republican themes -- Cobb-Hunter said, "I'm a realist, honey; I'm not snowed by much." Still, Aiken insisted, "it was a happier time"; nearly 74,000 jobs have been lost statewide since 2000. "You can't lay that all on George Bush," Cheeseboro argued. "You can't blame Bush for Nafta" or, as others attested, for "ending welfare as we know it" while cutting other social spending. "There wasn't a war," Aiken said. And to that I heard amens all around. It seems the war, and the death of three young Orangeburg men in Iraq, has concentrated attention on issues that Clinton's personality once papered over. 
"Bill just rubbed me right," Paul Robinson Sr., the 70-year-old patriarch of an establishment called Professional Barber Shops, declared one Saturday. "But now at my age, I don't need no rubbing. I need action. I'm not a Republican, but I like their strategy: 'If we don't get you today, we'll get you tomorrow.' With the Democrats, it's 'Oh, I lost my ball, I'm goin' home.' It's time that our party stop shucking and jiving and get down to the real thing." 
Against this backdrop the campaign commercials roll, and the only thing anyone knows for sure about "the black vote" is that it's not monolithic. The days when African-Americans took cues from the local pol or preacher are passing, according to Cobb-Hunter. It's part of the reason she has been neutral in the primary, she said; to encourage people to decide for themselves. How those decisions play out, not just on Feb. 3 but also down the road, bears watching.
On our last day together, Aiken observed: "The Republicans have a strong white base, a very strong white base, an unwavering white base. And the Democratic Party is being threatened because we're wavering." In 2000 some of her professional friends were impressed by the Republican convention's "black night." She and Cheeseboro watched it on TV from their own homes while talking together over the phone. Cheeseboro wasn't impressed; she was more interested, she said, that apart from "liveliness" (where Democrats had the edge), she couldn't detect much difference in what the two major parties presented on so-called black issues. That year Cheeseboro, a county party officer "raised to vote Democrat or you'd die," voted against Al Gore and for Ralph Nader.
I remembered the look on Cobb-Hunter's face when I, surprised, mentioned this -- one of those looks that says, "Girl, where have you been?" What she actually said was, "It's the Democratic Party; it's not a blood oath."

A Town House on E. 74th, Fleurs-de-Lis on W. 26th

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
 A Town House Tale

Q. I found a very detailed article in a scrapbook at the East Hampton, N.Y., library about a town house with a half-timbered facade on East 74th Street. A Jules Pickard commissioned an illustrious American architect to design it but interfered with the design and hated the result when he returned from France. Two years later, he hired another architect to rebuild it in limestone and hated those results too. So he bought a chateau in the Loire Valley and never lived in the 74th Street house. I'm writing a murder mystery, "Murder in East Hampton," where the lead character lives in the former private house, but want to check this information. . . . Nancy Hyden Woodward, East Hampton.

A. It's the kind of far-fetched story you might hear on a walking tour, but the article is not that far off. In 1883, a dye importer, Wilhelm Pickhardt, did build a house at the southeast corner of 74th Street and Fifth Avenue. Born in 1834 in Berghausen, Germany, he studied architecture, intending to follow his father in the profession. But he came to the United States in the 1850's and became more successful as an importer than perhaps a dozen architects combined -- in 1896 his fortune was estimated by The New York Times at $10 million.
Pickhardt's architect, Henry G. Harrison, could hardly be considered illustrious. The Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals, "The A.I.A. Guide to New York City" and similar sources do not mention him. He did design a synagogue in Savannah, Ga., and a church in Omaha, and in 1885 he sued Cornelia Stewart, the widow of the merchant A. T. Stewart, for $95,000 in fees for the initial design of the Episcopal Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, N.Y., built by the Stewarts.
In 1893, The Times said that Pickhardt still owned the house, which had been built "several years ago," although the exterior was not quite complete. The account said that "the owner may (as he has in the past) change the exquisite carving about the windows and cornice to suit his changing mood" and that it was occupied by only a watchman -- "the owner, for reasons of his own, has never cared to reside there," and often lived abroad. Abroad apparently meant Germany, not France, because Pickhardt's obituary in 1895 said that he had lived in a row house at 13 West 82nd Street until 1893, when "he had a bad attack of the grip" and returned to Germany.
An 1896 account in The Times said that Pickhardt had wanted his house "to eclipse the marble palace of A. T. Stewart" (at 34th and Fifth, since demolished) and had included features like a $50,000 organ, but that Pickhardt had "altered his plans and employed new architects and builders. He did this several times, and finally completed the house in 1889 at an expense of $1 million." But only the original new-building permit of 1882 seems to have been taken out for the building. 
An 1899 photograph shows a house designed in what would at the time have been called the "Renaissance" style, with heavy projecting decoration.
The carved relief panels above the windows, and the busts set into the lintels on the second floor, indeed look as if they could have come from the hand of an amateur, but the rest of the house does not seem out of character with other works of the period. The stone seems to be dark, probably brownstone.
The Pickhardt house was demolished in 1916 for the present 927 Fifth Avenue, the apartment building where red-tailed hawks often nest with their young.

Francophiles at Work?

Q. The building on the northwest corner of Fifth and 26th has repeating sculptural decoration of an American eagle atop an American shield. But within the shield, instead of the stars and stripes is a large fleur-de-lis. The upper floors are a spectacular collection of architecture forms and decorations that look like a mixture of the Loire Valley and Notre Dame Cathedral.
Was the architect French? Or a Francophile American? . . . Richard Wengenroth, Manhattan.

A. The short answers are no, and not necessarily.
This 1910 building, known originally as the Croisic, was named after Richard de Logerot, the Marquis de Croisic, whose Croisic apartment house had been on the site in the 1880's and 90's. Le Croisic is on the west coast of France, seaward of Nantes. A news story about a fire at the building in 1888 listed as residents several show people, including the renowned actor Richard Mansfield. At the time, the building was in the heart of the entertainment district, with Delmonico's and the Cafe Martin at the same intersection. 
In 1893, de Logerot lost the building; he died in 1896. He and his wife, Blanche, were once part of Newport, R.I., society, but she later earned her living with a bookstore on Bellevue Avenue in Newport. 
In 1909, a developer, Louis M. Jones, bought the corner lot, and his architect, Frederick C. Browne, designed a Loire Valley Gothic/French Renaissance-style building, 20 stories high. The dramatic elegance of what was really just a showroom and loft building turned critics' heads. In 1911, The Real Estate Record & Guide praised the sloping mansard roof, because it "avoids exposure of tanks and those other protuberances, which disfigure many otherwise handsome buildings." 
In a 1913 critique, the architectural magazine Brickbuilder noted that, with the Croisic and buildings of its class, "their designers are learning to exercise a little restraint in the matter of design out of consideration for their neighbors, and are endeavoring as far as possible to suppress heavy projections which tend materially to decrease the light area; this suppression of the cornices naturally involves the exclusion of Classic detail." 
The neo-Classical style usually depended on heavy horizontal elements like cornices, and thus the verticality of the Gothic style was a natural adaptation. Even so, the topmost floors were the most valuable for rental purposes, and they were cramped by the sloping mansard. "Economically the peaked roof cannot be justified, although artistically it appears to be the only satisfactory method yet devised," the journal said, referring to similar structures, including the Woolworth Building and 90 West Street.
The Croisic building may have been an architectural success, but there were financial troubles early on, and Jones had to sell off part of his stake within a few years. 
Were Jones or Browne French? It's not clear where Browne was born; Jones was born in Germany.

 CORRECTION:
An answer to a question in the Streetscapes column last Sunday about the 1883 construction of a mansion at 74th Street and Fifth Avenue designed by the architect Henry G. Harrison referred incorrectly to citations in the Avery Index to Architectural Periodicals. While there are no references to articles about his buildings published during Harrison's lifetime, the index indeed mentions him: it includes both an obituary and a biographical article published in 1982.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE; 
Ground Zero Finally Grows Up

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
THIS is more like it. The World Trade Center PATH Terminal by Santiago Calatrava, the renowned Spanish architect and engineer, is what we should have at ground zero. Not modified suburban malls with water fountains, but a major cultural contribution to our city.
 Here is how it happened: The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, acting on its own, invited qualified professionals to apply for the job and selected Mr. Calatrava, the presiding master builder of bridges, airports and rail stations. No jury. No pandering to populism. No public performances. Alternate proposals were not displayed and debated. The result was presented, and the reaction has been appropriately ecstatic. 
 Too bad the memorial hasn't turned out so well. But then, the process was different. An open competition, ballyhooed as a democratic, grass-roots enterprise, elicited 5,201 entries from around the world, which the jury, stuck with those choices, dutifully whittled down to eight mediocre finalists, and later to three. Notwithstanding all the noble rhetoric about the openness of the competition, jurors then did what was necessary: they demanded changes and help from outside experts. The design by Michael Arad, a young architect with the New York City Housing Authority, won only after he brought on Peter Walker, a well-known veteran landscape architect from Berkeley, Calif., as a full partner. Mr. Walker had an idea about how to make Mr. Arad's concept more winning; he turned the rough and barren plaza, centered on two voids where the towers used to be, into an orchestrated grove of sycamore, locust and linden trees. 
But perhaps more important, Mr. Walker had a 45-year track record. During that time he has headed his own firm -- working on Millennium Park for the Sydney Olympics, on a large fountain at Harvard, on the Toyota Museum and on Disney City in Orlando, Fla. -- and served as chairman of the departments of landscape architecture at Harvard and at the University of California at Berkeley. His inclusion enhanced public confidence and satisfied jurors.
Call this tactic elitism, if you want. I did, writing in Arts & Leisure in December that jurors should scrap the populist palaver and seek out better ideas from the most talented people they could find. Elitism is an incendiary word. When the article appeared, the jury bristled. "Smug cultural superiority" was reportedly how one juror reacted. With art, however, elitism is a blunt term for expertise. And clearly the jury wanted that quality: as Vartan Gregorian, its chairman, put it after the winning design was announced: "Without Walker there would be no Arad."
Then public attention moved on. We're a distracted and impatient society. It was similar with the evolution of ground zero's signature tower. Daniel Libeskind, who has never built a skyscraper, proposed a design with big problems. The developer felt nervous and insisted on involving his own expert on high-rise architecture, David M. Childs, of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who has built many skyscrapers. Mr. Libeskind was ordered to work with Mr. Childs. Their joint design turned out to look better than expected.
So, two nominally public processes, altered by the authoritative imposition of outside expertise, produced plans that have come as a relief to many people who feared the worst. Relief. Not, on the whole, as with Mr. Calatrava's work, ecstasy.
Ironing out the details of the memorial will now require experts besides Mr. Walker to join in: engineers, horticulturists, electricians, plumbers. According to the plan, water is supposed to drop from the plaza into reflecting pools matching the tower footprints, then again into smaller rectangular shafts even deeper down. Visitors will be able to descend below ground to see a museum of artifacts. Mr. Arad has said he doesn't want any glass between the water and the public in those spaces.
But as Eric Lipton reported in The New York Times last weekend, cold, wind and ice are among various predictable problems that the design faces. Many public fountains don't function. They are pathetic. This memorial should be inspiring and haunting. The plan has already been significantly altered from its original scheme with the changes by Mr. Walker and now requires further practical modifications. It's not clear how much its eventual form will resemble the design we've been shown.
Rhetoric versus reality: advertising the competition as a model of democracy and ending up with a dose of constructive elitism is not the only example of what seems like political dissembling at ground zero. Officials insist that having the best memorial is the site's top priority. But if that were true, they would have waited until enough time had passed to grasp the proper historic meaning of the event being remembered. Instead, there has been a rush. Partly to console the grieving. But also driven by the need to show big corporate employers downtown that their workers will not be walking indefinitely past what looks like a war zone.
That's understandable. Maybe there was no alternative to haste. Jobs and the economy are critical, after all; they're about survival, too. More square footage at ground zero will go to retail shopping than to the memorial. But everybody should at least be frank about the agenda behind the timetable.
Speed itself isn't even the issue. It's possible to work well quickly, if the goal of the project is clear. Mr. Calatrava has proved that. At this point his design, with its soaring wings and cathedral-like space, opening to the sky, may be the best memorial we have. It certainly brings people together.
Some people find spirituality and rebirth in the voids and flowing water of Mr. Arad's and Mr. Walker's design. Others see a polar bear grotto and spider holes. Kinship with a monumental work by the artist Michael Heizer at the Dia:Beacon museum in Beacon, N.Y., has also been noted.
Mr. Heizer's "North, East, South,West," a variation of a sculpture he did in the 1960's, consists of four big vertigo-inducing steel-lined holes cut into a concrete floor, up to 20 feet deep, in the shapes of a wedge, a cone, part of an upturned cone and a double-stepped square, very similar to the voids Mr. Arad has for his waterfall fountains. Those voids exploit what Mr. Heizer has called "negative sculpture" to preserve the footprints of the towers, the most profound act of memorialization in the design.
The power of Mr. Heizer's minimalist work derives from its necessary scale and abstract simplicity. Whether the addition of water and trees at the memorial elevates the concept or dilutes it remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, Mr. Calatrava's rapturous plan for the terminal, conceived in collaboration with the Downtown Design Partnership of DMJM & Harris and the STV Group, has its own historical precedents in the work of engineering-minded artists and builders like Robert Maillart, Felix Candela, Anton Pevsner, El Lissitzky, Eero Saarinen and Robert Ricolais. The allusion to a bird might be hokey, but here strong form born from creative engineering saves it from kitsch. The central metaphor also rescues flight from the violent image of the planes crashing into the towers and raises it poetically to the level of something beautiful and romantic.
We can thank an enlightened patron. The Port Authority might have hired Hack & Hack. The terminal might have been awful. But the authority acted civically. Everybody should be grateful. Building a PATH station is, of course, less emotionally, politically and morally vexing than designing a memorial. Even so, the public hungers for models of uncompromising excellence, and to repeat the truism that no memorial could please everyone is to settle on an easy excuse for compromise.
The lesson is not that commissions without oversight are better than open competitions. It is that substance trumps rhetoric and quality is what people value in the end. Maya Lin's black granite wall at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is not prized because it won an open competition. It is prized for its eloquence.
The quality of Mr. Calatrava's design speaks to the most serious aspirations of the nation. Inventive and transcendent, it establishes a metaphor and benchmark for the evolution of downtown as a place of cultural significance and symbolic weight. The standard for development has been raised. The stakes could not be much higher. Now we should demand that everything at ground zero rise to this challenge.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 1 comparing the design selection processes for the World Trade Center PATH Terminal and the ground zero memorial misstated the name of an architect whose work could be seen as a precedent for Santiago Calatrava's design for the terminal. He was Robert Le Ricolais, not Robert Ricolais.

HEADLINE: Small Is Beautiful on Lexington Ave. 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
ELEANOR LAMBERT, the legendary fashion publicist, who put Halston and Calvin Klein on the international fashion map, was known for her uncanny prescience. But when Ms. Lambert, who died at 100 last October, insisted that Lexington Avenue above 60th Street was gathering steam as a fashion destination, it was tempting to think she was joking. 
 At the time, just over a year ago, that artery on the Upper East Side of Manhattan was steeping in a soupy torpor. Flanked by streets of 19th-century brownstones and lined with four- and five-story walkups, it languished as a resolutely old-fashioned commercial strip, its greengrocers, antiques shops, bespoke tailors and camphor-scented chemists frequented by locals but no one else. 
 A winter stroll up that thoroughfare suggested, however, that Ms. Lambert might have been on the mark again. In the last months, Lexington Avenue has emerged as an increasingly lively, if still somewhat musty, alternative to Madison Avenue and its high-priced corporate-run emporiums. In the last year alone, more than a half-dozen gem-size boutiques have sprung up between 68th and 76th Streets, in the area known as Lenox Hill. Slow-paced and starchily conservative compared with Madison Avenue, two blocks to the west, that stretch, some say, is the anti-Madison -- its intimate scale, inelegant signs and patent indifference to glamour forming the bedrock of its charm. 
"To us, Lexington is the most appealing of all the avenues," said Camilla Bradley, the owner of CK Bradley at the corner of Lexington and 74th Street, a boutique painted pink and green and stocked with the totems of preppydom: grosgrain belts in candy-color stripes, handbags patterned in toile de jouy designs, skirts embroidered with pompoms and fitted shirts in pink or navy gingham checks ($75). 
Ms. Bradley, who moved to the neighborhood last September, chose it after long deliberation. "I wanted a store off the beaten path," she said, "on a street with the feeling of small boutiques that were individual and original." Lexington's stately pace commended it, she said, but the clincher was "there are no chains."
The street is, for the most part, inhospitable to chains, since the newest of its shops -- stores like Peiper & Kojen, a jeweler; Che Che New York, an outpost for hand-embellished bags and accessories; and Jackie Rogers, a boutique for custom and ready-made fashions -- rarely measure more than 500 square feet, barely room to house a pair of racks. To some, however, their postcard proportions are part of their quaint allure.
"Lexington has the Old World flavor that Madison Avenue used to have in the early 1970's, before the European retail boom," said Ronald Solomon, a real estate broker, who has leased commercial space in the neighborhood for 40 years. "The attraction is obvious. It's a matter of economics. Most of the independent retailers can't afford to be on Madison, where they used to be. Lexington gives off the same cachet for less."
Indeed, the retailers drawn to Lexington Avenue seem to be put off by Madison Avenue's high rents and hauteur. "Lexington has become very boutique-oriented," said Laura Pomerantz, a partner in PBS Realty Advisors. "As the greengrocers and drugstores move out of the area between 68th and 77th Streets, more and more small fashion and home-furnishings stores are moving in."
Lexington Avenue has long been home to neighborhood institutions like the Butterfield Market. Other stalwarts include Paul Mole, a barbershop known for its shaves, and Lexington Avenue Bar and Books. Until four years ago, Gloria Vanderbilt could be spied on weekend afternoons tucking into a frugal lunch at Mortimer's.
Today, some of the newer institutions like the restaurants Orsay and Swifty's (where the former Mortimer's crowd congregates) and Payard Patisserie, the amber-lighted, Belle Epoque-style bistro and bakery, are contributing to Lexington Avenue's draw. 
Patrons crowding Ms. Rogers's gallery-style boutique near 73rd Street last Wednesday included Pia Lindstrom, a film and theater critic, and Maria Cooper Janis, who is married to Byron Janis, the concert pianist. Against a backdrop of black-and-white pictures showing Ms. Rogers in her early-60's heyday as a Chanel mannequin, the women tried on identical versions of the designer's signature tie-front blouse in pink organza ($795). Then, as Miss Lilly, Ms. Rogers's dachshund yelped in the background, Ms. Lindstrom ignored ostrich feather chubbies ($1,250), zeroing in instead on a gabardine suit the color of creme fraiche.
At Cantaloup, a year-old addition to Lexington Avenue's budding fashion scene, the scene was funkier and more democratic. The shop, which opened a year ago, is the neighborhood's first purveyor of aggressive, youth-oriented hip. Best sellers include La Cosa racer-back tank tops ($43) in shades of coral, camel and pistachio and an extensive selection of jeans with labels like True Religion, Blue Cult and Ingwa Melero. 
"We are trying to bring the whole downtown feeling uptown," said Liz Friedrich, who works at Cantaloup. "There still is some room for that here."

HEADLINE: A Little Detour From Life in the Fast Lane 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
IT didn't take long for the residents of sleepy Lake Helen, Fla., to realize that their newest neighbor, a young entrepreneur from California named Dan Rubin, was not your average Joe.
 Mr. Rubin, a 32-year-old self-made millionaire with a degree from Princeton, showed up in Lake Helen in 2002 after buying a local legal-referral company called 1-800ATTORNEY. He raised eyebrows his first day at the office when he handed out $20 bills to any employee who asked him a question. Mr. Rubin roared through the quiet streets in an outrageous 12-cylinder Lamborghini Diablo. He began buying up houses -- eventually acquiring nine -- and a rumor got out that he had once dated Paula Abdul. It was all a bit mysterious, but not nearly so as Mr. Rubin's next move: he ran for mayor. 
 Townspeople were so unsettled by this interloper -- who promised to cover shortfalls in the city budget out of his own pocket -- that they mobilized against him. They forced him out of the race when they found that he wasn't registered to vote locally, a requirement to run. "He basically said he would buy things for the city," said Mark Shuttleworth, who opposed Mr. Rubin and went on to win the mayoral race. "He was a checkbook kind of character -- a Donald Trump kind of guy." 
Skipper Morgan, who owns the Lake Helen Gas-N-Shop, a convenience store, said: "He put everyone on edge, is what he did. They didn't know what the heck he was up to."
These days it is relatively easy to figure out what Mr. Rubin is up to: he spends a lot of time with his own lawyers, working to fend off a federal investigation into charges of stock fraud. He was arrested last fall at his offices on the 50th floor of the Chrysler Building in New York and, along with three other associates, was charged in a complaint filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn with running an old-fashioned Wall Street con, a pump-and-dump scheme involving penny stocks. The United States attorney's office in Brooklyn has taken the case before a grand jury, and a wave of new subpoenas was handed out last week.
While the trials of Martha Stewart and L. Dennis Kozlowski stand out as grand examples of end-of-the-millennium excess, Mr. Rubin's case shows another trope of the age: the peril of small-time players who wanted desperately to be big. To many who know Mr. Rubin -- his old Princeton classmates, business associates, the citizens of tiny Lake Helen -- his arrest, like his mayoral bid, is the latest odd development in a Gatsby-like life that from the outside, at least, has struck many as more than a little improbable. They describe him as a young man who encountered remarkable early success -- and who made no secret of it. Mr. Rubin arrived at Princeton, for example, with no obvious wealth, but by his sophomore year was being chauffeured to campus in a Mercedes S-Class.
While other students spent days poring over economics or art history texts, he bought and sold real estate around the university, precociously pursuing the 1990's boom. He became something of a campus legend, and also a polarizing figure.
"It's either love or hate with Dan," said Rob Lyszczarz, a friend and business partner of Mr. Rubin's for the better part of a decade. "He's a very strong personality, and even sometimes people on his own team aren't exactly sure where he's heading. To that extent he's somewhat of an enigma: what is it that motivates him?"
Mr. Rubin would not comment for this article, but his lawyer Alan Vinegrad, a former United States attorney in Brooklyn who prosecuted the mobster Vincent Gigante, issued a statement expressing confidence that "at the end of the investigation this matter will be favorably resolved for Dan."
Mr. Rubin is originally from Woodland, Calif., a suburb of Sacramento, where, friends say, he grew up in circumstances that were not lavish, but for one notable amenity. Mr. Rubin's father, an anesthesiologist originally from South Africa, built a squash court for his three sons, who all went to Princeton and played varsity squash.
At Princeton, where he enrolled in 1989, Mr. Rubin's first business foray was a T-shirt company he started with Greg Lauren, a nephew of the designer Ralph Lauren who is now a painter and an actor. The venture turned a modest profit, and Mr. Rubin was soon on to more ambitious things. His next big idea, he told friends, came from watching late-night infomercials on how to buy real estate with little or nothing down.
Realizing the inherent advantage of buying from desperate sellers, Mr. Rubin sought out homeowners on the verge of bankruptcy, offering them cash and then either selling the property at a quick profit or renting back to the original owners.
While such schemes might seem predatory, Mr. Rubin used his personal charm to pull them off, apparently without leaving the homeowners feeling they had been exploited. Sandra Adase and her husband were facing severe financial hardship in the early 1990's when Mr. Rubin called them out of the blue and offered cash for their condominium in a New Jersey retirement complex. Mr. Rubin flipped the property three months later at a profit, but Ms. Adase said she was delighted with the deal.
"He helped me out of the woods," she said last week. "It was like God sent him to us."
As those real estate deals netted gains, Mr. Rubin's profile on campus began to change to reflect his newfound wealth. He bought a 5,000-square-foot house in Princeton, and hired that chauffeur. Though he played on the squash team and was a member of Cloister Inn, a university eating club with a hot tub out back, he was rarely seen on campus, preferring instead to tend to his real estate deals and his new company, the Rubin Investment Group. He took semesters off, disappearing for long stretches, and for a time commuted by plane from Los Angeles.
Mr. Rubin became a source of campus intrigue. Rumors circulated that he was related to Robert E. Rubin, then the secretary of the Treasury. (He's not.)
James Gillespie, a member of the class of 1997 at Princeton who is now a lawyer in Paris, described Mr. Rubin's campus reputation as "something that combines arrogance and flamboyance."
"He created an image for himself so that people were ready to believe anything about him," he said.
In fall 1995, when a story began to circulate on campus that a student had handed in a paper inadvertently including a receipt showing that it had been purchased, suspicion fell on the mysterious Mr. Rubin. The student newspaper, The Daily Princetonian, reported the incident, mentioning no names, but to this day -- despite a lack of evidence -- Mr. Rubin is associated with the tale, which remains part of campus lore.
Asked about the incident, Michael Hiles, a spokesman for Mr. Rubin, said, "Dan Rubin graduated from Princeton University because his work and conduct there met the university's high code of moral and academic requirements."
Mr. Rubin left Princeton for three years (he returned in 1998, and completed his degree nine years after enrolling) and devoted himself completely to business. In addition to his real estate dealings, he invested in a failing fast food chain called Country Star Restaurants. Though the company was hemorrhaging cash, it happened to own a valuable lot off the Strip in Las Vegas, which Mr. Rubin was able to sell to the casino developer Stephen A. Wynn. In recounting the story to newspapers and business publications, Mr. Rubin portrayed himself as having outwitted the legendary developer, saying that Mr. Wynn offered $1.5 million for the property, then raised his bid to $1.65 million. 
Mr. Rubin also made money brokering block trades of over-the-counter shares, which can be hard to unload because of their low trading volume, and invested in other financially distressed companies. In an interview with The New York Times in 1997, Mr. Rubin described his m.o. this way: "I trade big positions in small companies and terrorize the chairman."
As Mr. Rubin's bank account swelled, so did his public profile. He was featured on tabloid shows like "Extra" and "National Enquirer TV" as the flamboyant "millionaire bachelor" and occasionally appeared on financial programs on CNBC and Fox News during the market boom. Many news accounts from the time, which Mr. Rubin posted on the Rubin Investment Group's Web site, included his boasts of owning half a dozen Lamborghinis; a sky box at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, for Lakers games; and even a Picasso and a Renoir.
In 2002, Mr. Rubin heard about 1-800-ATTORNEY, a struggling company in Lake Helen. He invested $1.23 million in it, and as majority shareholder appointed himself chief executive. Friends say he was taken by the simple life in Lake Helen, whose residents sometimes ride horseback through town, and moved there in part to pursue a quieter lifestyle.
But what was quiet to Mr. Rubin was noisy for Lake Helen -- sometimes literally so. Neighbors called the police to report that he was cutting down trees and having construction done on his Arts and Crafts-style home without proper permits. But it was his run for mayor that really stirred people up.
After he was forced out of the race, one former employee of his business said, Mr. Rubin went back to work, struggling -- so far unsuccessfully -- to bring the money-losing 1-800-ATTORNEY to profitability and working trades, mostly in penny stocks, through the Rubin Investment Group. The former employee said Mr. Rubin was particularly close to an employee named Andrew Saksa, who had been barred from the New York Stock Exchange for two and a half years in 2001, the exchange said, for lying to customers.
It was with Mr. Saksa, the government contends, that Mr. Rubin got into real trouble. The complaint filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn says that last August, the two men met with the officers of two struggling companies, Marx Toys, which makes action figures, and a New Jersey company called the Classica Group, which makes microwave sterilization devices, and arranged to buy large blocks of their shares at a deep discount.
Then, the complaint says, Mr. Rubin's company issued press releases announcing that it was acting as an investment banker for the two companies to help them find buyers -- a claim that the government says was untrue. Then, as the share prices spiked on the news -- Classica, for example, shot up to $1.34 a share from 63 cents -- Mr. Rubin and Mr. Saksa sold off their shares, the court papers say. In the Classica case, the filing says, the two men sold 1.2 million shares they had bought for just 40 cents apiece. While Mr. Rubin and Mr. Saksa made out handsomely, the government argues, average investors were left holding the bag when the share prices collapsed to near their old levels.
To make matters worse for Mr. Rubin, Mr. Saksa was recorded telling a government witness that their company had conducted a number of similar schemes in the past.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Saksa were arrested on a chilly October day by F.B.I. agents in the Rubin Investment Group offices in Midtown. A few days later, after he was releasedfrom custody, Mr. Rubin returned to his Lake Helen offices and called a meeting of employees, where his defense strategy became clear.
"He said Andrew was doing things he wasn't aware of," said a former employee who was present. "He pretty much threw Andrew under the bus." Mr. Saksa's lawyer, Timothy McInnis, declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors have until Feb. 9 to issue indictments in the case. In the meantime, friends say, Mr. Rubin is keeping a low profile. The millionaire bachelor has sold his Lamborghinis, and he recently became engaged.
Mr. Rubin still has his house in Lake Helen, but local residents say their little town is once again quiet.
"Ever since that other stuff happened he's dropped out of the public eye," said Mr. Morgan, the Gas-N-Shop owner. "You don't see him anymore. He's totally clammed up."

SECRETS OF THE CITY
By Anne Roiphe
Shaye Areheart
($24, hardcover)
 At first there had been a run on the Korean markets as well as the chain food stores, but then no one wanted to buy anything fresh, arriving at checkout counters with jars and cans of nearly out-of-date applesauce. No one bought anything from the hot dog vendors who stood on street corners staring at passersby with the sad dark eyes of far-off places they now wished they had never left. 
 The entire city was hungry. Slim-Fast and Ensure sold and frozen food sold, but most of it ended up in the trash unopened. When it came right down to eating, most people preferred to go hungry. But the death count was rising: 64, 72, 89, 114. With each passing hour the number climbed. In neighborhoods poor and rich, victim after victim was found reeling around, passed out, beyond help. 
The media reported huge economic losses. Pizzerias rolled down their metal gates, waiting for graffiti artists to do their worst; restaurants kept the tablecloths fresh, but waiters had plenty of time to regret they had not won a part in a play, completed high school, taken a computer course.
Everyone who could was trying to leave the city. The airports were jammed with reservationless would-be passengers. The mayor had declared an emergency and closed the toll booths on the bridges and tunnels, and still the cars moved like reluctant snails, never more than a foot or two apart, hour after hour.

FULL HOUSE

Southern Methodist University Press
($22.50, hardcover)
Now, though, we sat at Eclair on West 72nd Street, the down-at-heels, past-its-prime little pastry shop to which Willy had introduced me.
"I can meet you for a cup of tea after my recorder lesson," I had said, calculating the time available to fit him in between recorder and dinner. I liked the daring of the moment, when, emerging into the street from Courtly Music Unlimited, I would disengage from Leslie, who played the tenor recorder, and our other friend Mary, who played the alto in our little trio.
"No I'm not taking thesubway. I'm meeting a friend," I would murmur, and they didn't seem to give it a second thought. While Leslie and Mary disappeared into the station house, I would cross 72nd and walk the half block to the restaurant. Dependably, Willy would be waiting out front. ... 
In warmer weather he might be wearing one of his checked short-sleeved shirts, which I liked so much because they reminded me of the shirts boys wore to school in junior high. His shirts made Willy seem innocent, as did his taste in restaurants. At Eclair the pastries had too much cream in them, and the old Russian waiters had spots on their white shirts. 

THREE BEDROOMS IN MANHATTAN
By Georges Simenon
New York Review Books
($12.95, paperback)
His footsteps resounded in the nearly empty streets of Greenwich Village, and he was still thinking about the couple who once more had made it impossible for him to sleep. He had never seen them. He didn't even know what the initials J.K.C. stood for. He'd read them, painted in green, on his neighbor's door.
And he knew, after passing by one morning when the door was open, that the floor was black, probably varnished. ... 
He knew a lot about the two of them, but only in pieces he couldn't quite fit together. That J.K.C. was a painter. That Winnie lived in Boston.
What did she do? Why did she always come to New York on Friday nights, and only on Friday nights? Why didn't she ever stay the whole weekend? Well, of course there were jobs where people had different days off. She came by taxi, probably from the train station, just before eight. Always the same time, give or take a few minutes -- that's what made him think she'd arrived by train.

AN ALMOST PERFECT MOMENT
By Binnie Kirshenbaum
Ecco
($23.95, hardcover)
In Brooklyn, in a part of Brooklyn that was the last stop on the LL train and a million miles away from Manhattan, a part of Brooklyn -- an enclave, almost -- composed of modest homes and two-family houses set on lawns the size of postage stamps, out front the occasional plaster-of-paris saint or a birdbath, a short bus ride away from the new paradise known as the Kings County Mall, a part of Brooklyn where the turbulent 60's never quite touched down, but at this point in time, on the cusp of the great age of disco, when this part of Brooklyn would come into its own, as if during the years before it had been aestivating like a mudfish, lying in wait for the blast, for the glitter, the platform shoes, Gloria Gaynor, for doing the hustle, for its day in the sun, this part of Brooklyn was home to Miriam Kessler and her daughter Valentine, who was fifteen and three-quarter years old, which is to be neither here nor yet there as far as life is concerned.
Therefore, on this Tuesday afternoon, mid-November, it was in a way both figurative and literal that Valentine stood at the threshold between the foyer and the living room, observing Miriam and her three girlfriends -- she, Miriam, called them that, despite their middling years, my girlfriends, or simply, The Girls -- who were seated around the card table, attending closely to their game.
For Miriam and The Girls, mah-jongg was not recreation, but passion. Nonetheless, and in their Brooklyn parlance, a nasal articulation, they were able to play while carrying on a conversation, which was not so much like juggling two oranges, because, for them, talking was as natural as breathing.

HEADLINE: Uptown Girl 

BYLINE:  By By ADRIAN NICOLE LeBLANC; Adrian Nicole LeBlanc is the author of "Random Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble, and Coming of Age in the Bronx," which will be published in paperback this month by Scribner.

 BODY:
IT seems significant that on one of my first outings to the South Bronx, I couldn't find my way back home. I lived in Chelsea then, and I was still new to New York. I worked days as an editor at Seventeen magazine and did my freelance reporting at night. The Village Voice had assigned me a piece on drug dealers' girlfriends. I borrowed a friend's clunking car to take some of the girls clubbing. Entering a pool hall on the Grand Concourse, I had my first experience of being frisked. It was after 4 A.M. when I dropped off the last girl. The rain dumped down. 
 Back then, in the early 90's, the South Bronx still seemed to me like the iconic ghetto it was purported to be; that night, as I drove up and down its desolate boulevards, the shapes of the ordinary world disappeared. All I saw beyond the fogging windshield was threat. No hint of the pace of well-lit, clipped Manhattan. Rain slashed the signs of unfamiliar streets. Elevated subway tracks loomed overhead. At a gas station, I anxiously left the car to ask directions, but my questions got drowned out by the pleas of the Indian attendant, barricaded in behind his bars, urgently waving me, please, away. 
 My own fear increased with the resulting chill. Eventually, I was flying by the Whitestone Cinema, headed east. Blessedly, I spotted the "New England Thruway" sign, a friendly highway green.
Originally, I come from Leominster, in northern Massachusetts. Absurdly, I seriously considered driving the four hours home. In a panic, one reverts to what one knows. At least from Leominster, I knew my way back to New York. What I wouldn't realize for another decade was that the homecoming would ultimately occur the other way around: the pull of the Bronx, and the connection to the family I found there, not the fear of it, would carry me home to my blood family.
Only now, a year after its publication, is the full meaning of the title of my first book, "Random Family," revealing itself to me. The book documents more than a decade in the life of one extended family from the South Bronx. Had I been asked midway through the reporting what the title meant, I might have answered, "The families my subjects inherited and those they chose" or "The family that teenagers create among their friends." 
But from where I stand now, I'd say that a sense of belonging can also spring from a geographical affinity, the comfort we feel in places both known and discovered or, in some cases, the places that are within us even before we arrive, their streets coursing through our personal histories. 
MY strongest early memories of my father involve him driving away. Off he'd go, in the orange pumpkin, our nickname for the rust-colored American Ambassador supplied by the union when he left a chemical factory job and turned to organizing full time. My father drove to faraway destinations -- Pittsburgh, Akron, Detroit -- and returned with exotic tales infused with the urgency of the mundane world, compelling stories about regular people struggling to make ends meet. 
Once we spent a family holiday at a roadside Ramada Inn in Delaware. While my mother sunned by the pool, I trailed Edie, an elderly maid whose gentle presence made my father's hotel room a home. Edie let me refill the vending machine with miniature toothbrushes, their silver tubes of toothpaste as slim and shiny as smelts. She let me push her tidy hallway cart. In the sweet-smelling laundry closet, which doubled as her office, we counted her tips. 
As I was growing up, my mother liked to tell me that every woman needs an education and a car. (The education was something no one could ever take away from you, while a car could take you away from anywhere you suddenly didn't want to be.) After high school, I was always driving away -- for college, for graduate school, on assignment, back to my apartment in New York. 
Like my father's, my visits home were brief; I was using my education the way I was supposed to, to escape the working class that my ambitious mother had found herself trapped in. She devoted her life to making my escape possible, struggling to balance her love without letting me feel entirely at home. But if I wanted to succeed -- whatever that meant -- I couldn't stop moving. Irrationally, I worried that if I ever slowed down, or slipped up, I'd somehow end up on my father's old slot on the assembly line. 
When I started my reporting in the Bronx, however, suddenly I was like my father with his union: I knew that this was the work I wanted to do. I felt a sense of purpose, energized and fully alive. The work drew on my deepest self, yet, unlike the elite worlds to which my education exposed me, didn't require that I bury my working-class alliances. 
In fact, those initial nights of reporting -- listening to music and watching the girls dress up to go dancing, hanging out in front of bodegas and in courtyards and on stoops, driving around as they shouted out of the car to thewindows of the boys they liked -- took me back to an earlier time. It was a lot like my teenage years with my hometown friends, aimless and open-ended, not about the things we didn't have, or some distant future, but about the vitality and wonder of the life that was already ours, and within our reach. 
It turns out I wasn't the first of my relatives to do time in the Bronx. Not long after I began serious work on my book, I called my mother from the pay phone of a cafe in the Italian neighborhood of Belmont. "I don't know why," I told her, "I feel so at home here." I supposed it was the familiarity of the Italians on Arthur Avenue. My mother neglected to mention that her parents had lived there for a decade before moving to Leominster, where, not long after, my grandfather died. It would be years before an uncle, in an emotional moment after a family funeral, confessed that the greatest love story in my family's history had taken place in that neighborhood - perhaps the site of the loss of promise the most painful to bear. 
My mother's father rented a room as a boarder from my grandmother's older sister, who had come from a neighboring village in Italy. He saw my grandmother's photograph, and they started corresponding; he dictated his letters because he didn't know how to write. Eventually, he helped pay her passage; her younger brother, Orazio, escorted her. There was a swoon after the first kiss in Central Park, another legendary kiss in the stairwell of the sister's house.
Six months later, on Oct. 8, 1905, the Rev. Thomas T. Lynch officiated at the marriage at St. Elizabeth's Roman Catholic Church in Washington Heights. My grandmother liked to tell my mother how she looked like a princess that day, dressed in white, perched atop a carriage driven by six white horses that delivered her to the church. She was adorned in jewelry, including a gold chain that my grandfather had given her and a bracelet, etched with a delicate scroll. Over her heart, she pinned a bird with four tiny pearls, two on each wing, and a ruby balanced on its beak. 
It was a hopeful beginning, but things got harder quickly. As my grandmother began having children, nine in all, my grandfather took whatever work he could find -- lighting lamps, maintenance, delivering coal. For a time, he was a superintendent in a building in Belmont, just two blocks away from Thorpe house, the homeless shelter on Crotona Avenue where, 90 years later, I would be spending my weekends and nights. 
By then, I'd met Lolli, the young woman who would become one of my primary subjects (and who is identified as Coco in my book). In the restroom at Seventeen, I'd slip out of my black blazer and miniskirt at the end of my work day and put on a T-shirt and jeans. We happily explored her Bronx streets, pointing out our favorites among the trays of gold medallions and door-knocker earrings in the jewelry shops on Fordham Road; admiring the dusty baby shower cakes decorated with miniature pacifiers in the window of the cuchifrito-bakery on Burnside Avenue; watching the bright fake fish that paddled spastic laps in a plastic aquarium at the dollar store. 
On Mount Hope Place, where her first love had lived before he went to prison, Lolli showed me the graffiti heart she'd etched into the wall of a stairwell where they used to kiss. One Sunday morning, on Tremont Avenue, we waved to a young bride and groom gleefully shouting from the sun roof of a white stretch limousine. 
I gradually realized, however, that Lolli had never ventured the few blocks from her Puerto Rican neighborhood to the Italian section. So one afternoon, when her 3-year-old daughter was hungry, I suggested lunch on Arthur Avenue. I was slowly becoming a familiar face on the street; the bakery clerk nodded hello, and the butcher at the Arthur Avenue Market tutored me about what to look for in a proper cut of beef. 
Lolli was uncharacteristically reluctant as we stepped into a coffee shop where I'd been a few times. Helping her daughter climb onto a stool, she stood behind her, pressing her pregnant belly against the little girl's back so she wouldn't topple off. We waited while the waitress chatted with a customer at the far end of the counter. I asked for menus. It was 11 A.M. The short order cook was flipping eggs on the grill. From the opposite end of the room, without looking in our direction, the waitress said, "Kitchen's closed." 
IN the meantime, I had moved to SoHo. I didn't find it an easy fit. On weekends, when it teemed with shoppers buying things I could never afford, I'd linger around the corner of Something Special, Lenny Cecere's small store on Macdougal, just to hear the banter of Italian men. On the rare days I didn't go to the Bronx, I'd head out to Coney Island, to stroll on the boardwalk among the old Russians, or to Bensonhurst, to eat panelle at Joe's of Avenue U. My apartment was rent-stabilized, so I couldn't think of leaving permanently, but it was more like a hotel than a home.
The parts of the Bronx that I was getting to know didn't require the same stretching. Uptown, on the sidewalk, in the Laundromat, at the Western Union office, my movements came naturally. What became taxing were the transitions. 
I remember the day I realized that I had to leave my Midtown job. I'd spent a spate of nights out reporting in the Soundview projects, where the elevator doors rattled and ached, and that tired morning I was struck by the silence of my ascent at Seventeen. The bell for my floor gently sounded, and I stepped noiselessly off the elevator onto the red carpet that led to my office. I no longer knew what I was doing there. 
Whenever I was downtown, which was less and less, I felt that life was elsewhere. Uptown, I was learning to surrender to the slower rhythms of my subjects' days. Ordinary acts absorbed me utterly. Even the most mundane things -- children playing, a trip to the grocery store, watching an old dog sleeping -- gave me a sense of discovery. After all, I was supposed to spend hours hanging out, observing. I started to crave the street. On the best days, I was keenly aware of the sensory environment but unaware of myself. I knew I was in precisely the right place, at the right time. Doing my work meant remaining still.
Like that of a child shuttling between divorced parents, my behavior changed with my surroundings: at a welfare office in the Bronx, I could be endlessly patient, numbed. Yet if I had to wait in line at the Gourmet Garage, I became irritable. Increasingly at ease in the places most white New Yorkers thought of as impossibly dangerous, I'd tense up at book parties and gallery openings. I preferred to brave the stairwell in a housing project than walk into a roof-top party. A college friend, now a psychologist, declared me counter-phobic. Possibly true, but what good do labels do? 
But the greatest threat to my reporting wasn't the danger, which was erratic and unusual, but the frustrations and despair, which were relentless, pervading every task of daily life. In the Bronx, survival regularly felt impossible, escape unimaginable. Even hope became a risk. 
Back in SoHo, I slept, a lot. I'm generally an early morning person, but I came to love the bed. I'd sleep a solid 12 hours after a prison visit, a whole day after a weekend in Lolli's mother's courtyard. One afternoon, one of the girls from the Bronx called to wake me; I used to be prompt, calling up to their windows, waking them. Now, I was late, I answered the telephone cranky. "You sound like my mother," she said critically. 
Poverty is a climate. Within a few years, I had adapted to its weather's unpredictability: I stopped believing that institutions functioned in any reliable or useful fashion. I would be surprised, delighted, when anything went smoothly. I developed a sense of humor. I stopped wearing black, started wearing fuchsia. I became an optimist, and a fatalist. I cared more about my sex appeal. My downtown friends commented that I'd become more defensive, suspicious and sarcastic. My uptown friends told me I needed to gain weight and relax. 
Surely some of this was a result of my immersion in my subjects' world, my experience of their profound economic and physical vulnerability. I wish I'd been strong enough to move to the Bronx and live in the spaces that, for 24 hours a day, filled my head. 
MY own family's crisis took me back to Leominster; my father was found to have cancer. During the 18 months that I cared for my him, my city life receded; my hometown roots were renewed. Over the phone, my downtown friends expressed their worries about me: I needed to rest, I needed to eat, I needed to get back to New York. My Bronx friends told me to stay strong, to fight the terror, to try to make my father laugh, to fill the house with children. They'd shown me what my Italian ancestors had buried in their stoic formality. When it's not possible to protect the people you love and make things better, you grab onto the good moments when you can.
A Bronx friend, who had survived a spinal injury, coached my father through a similar trauma and gave me indispensable caretaking advice. Another friend, who worked as a home health aide, prepared me for what to expect as my father moved closer to death. Lolli and her children came to visit. ("You mad skinny," said her 9-year-old, taking in my father. "That's for sure," my father said.) As I watched Lolli holding my father's bony hand, I felt the reconnection of something broken running through my life. When my father passed, Lolli's mother told me to take care of my own. "Your mother's the only one you've got," she said.
Not so long ago, I returned to New York and reintroduced myself to my apartment and my neighborhood. I walked to the Angelika, became a morning regular at Once Upon a Tart, swam laps at a nearby pool. Photographs got framed, dinners cooked, walls painted. I moved into my place, then I got restless again. Nights, I reported a story about a rapper and drug dealer who lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant. I was back at work. Absorbed, I watched him get his weekly trim among the men debating politics at his barbershop. Sitting in the passenger seat of his S.U.V., flying down the low Brooklyn streets, windows open, his music blasting, looking out at the new neighborhood, I felt life pouring over me. 
To be where I am is to accept where I came from, to be both a visitor and an escapee. Maybe always-leaving is my closest kinship, but I've learned to claim the life I live here, wherever that may be. The open invitation is what I cherish most about my work in this city -- the righteousness of my ignorance, the job of getting lost again and again.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
The Weightof the World on Our Shoulders

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney @nytimes.com.

 BODY:
EVERYONE seems worried about an exodus of high-skill jobs from the UnitedStates to third-world countries. But those fears are probably misplaced. 
 While some such jobs are moving overseas, the American economy will generate many more at home. And a lot of the jobs that go overseas will be more in the nature of 4 a.m. technical support for personal computers. Americans benefit from that, too. The savings from that phone center in India are built into your new $350 PC. 
 There is no great shortage of jobs in this country anyway. Unemployment is at a level that, a generation ago, would have been considered hard to achieve without significant inflation. Immigrants continue to pour in, and to find work. Well-educated Americans will do just fine; foreigners are so confident in our economy that it is the beneficiary of huge capital inflows.
Indeed, the real threat to the American economy is not competition from successful foreign lands but the enormous drag imposed by countries that cannot produce the kind of strong, consistent growth required for global prosperity. A world that depended for so long on American military power for political security now depends on American consumer spending for economic security, and I suspect that this new dependence will prove just as troublesome. Over the long run, it's probably not sustainable.
By most accounts, the global economy is on an upswing. So why the worries? 
Consider the European Union, collectively the world's second-largest economy, after that of the United States. With aging populations, high social welfare costs, rigid labor policies and lagging productivity gains, European countries appear condemned to slow growth for years to come. The demographics of Europe are especially worrisome; an older population is likely to be more focused on preserving the status quo than on taking risks, and fewer young workers will be supporting ever more retirees.
Then there is China. Its torrid growth may not be all that it seems, as Alwyn Young, an economist at the University of Chicago, has shown. China reported average annual growth of 9.2 percent from 1986 to 1998, but systematic underreporting of inflation accounts for perhaps three of those percentage points, Dr. Young says. Another big chunk is attributable to rising participation in the labor force and a shift of workers out of agriculture. 
All of this assumes that the data are correct, and they may not be. The numbers come from China's closed political system, which I suspect lacks the flexibility, transparency and responsiveness to cope with the challenges of modernity. The country's banking and legal systems are weak. If tapped-out American consumers stop spending, its economy could be in trouble. 
On to Japan. Despite some modest signs of life recently, its problems continue. Having an aging population of its own, and yet unwilling to embrace immigration, Japan still has not undertaken the fundamental reforms needed to bolster its economy. 
Large sections of the globe, meanwhile, are not even within shouting distance of sustainable prosperity. Africa's problems are nearly overwhelming, and the Middle East remains addicted to oil revenue and autocracy. As for Latin America, every time one country starts doing well, another appears to falter. Even recent bright spots like India, Russia and Brazil are by no means on track for guaranteed steady growth. And this says nothing of the threat of terrorism.
The world's great hope is that materialistic Americans will buy enough goods to propel everyone else forward. I, for one, am ready to do my part. But what if financial markets turn sour? Or the domestic housing market crashes, or the dollar collapses?
Most discussions about the American economy should end by acknowledging that everything will probably be O.K., because that is how it usually turns out. But if we must worry, we should worry about the right things, not about job flight. Let's help American workers with the cost of adapting to economic changes and redouble our emphasis on education -- and then focus on nudging the world's other big economies to get themselves growing again.

For SomeTaxpayers, the Refund Is in the Plastic

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
THIS tax season, consumers can choose another way to receive their refunds: on plastic. 
 Instead of waiting for refund checks to arrive, taxpayers can have their refunds loaded onto "stored value," or prepaid, cards. Some tax preparation services are offering the cards to their customers, and some workers who already receive their wages on prepaid cards may be able to have their refunds deposited on them, too. 
 Jackson Hewitt, the second-largest tax preparation service, is offering refund cards at its 4,500 offices, while H&R Block, the largest tax preparer, is testing them in three cities: Washington, El Paso and Fresno, Calif. Some banks may soon promote similar cards, all of which have the Visa or MasterCard logos and can be used anywhere those brands are accepted. 
The cards are aimed at the roughly 25 million workers without bank accounts, including many teenagers and low-income or part-time employees. Because these consumers often have poor or insufficient credit histories, they may have trouble getting traditional credit cards.
"These are the people who have been cut out of the traditional financial institutions," said Craig Marshall, president of UniRush Financial Services, a joint venture of the Unifund Corporation and Rush Communications. The company is working with Jackson Hewitt on its card program but also promotes prepaid cards for other uses. 
In one way, such cards are electronic versions of the check-cashing services used by millions of people without checking accounts. The card issuers make their money through an upfront fee and, in some cases, a fee for each transaction. 
Prepaid cards offer some advantages for people without checking accounts. The cards can be replaced if lost or stolen, and can be used to shop online or to pay bills.
But consumer groups say the cards' fees can add up quickly. Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said that bank accounts remained consumers' least expensive and most secure option. "That way, you get all of your refund without so many fees," she said, "and you're protected under the banking regulations."
Prepaid cards already have a variety of uses. Merchants use them as gift cards, or electronic gift certificates. And more and more companies, including McDonald's, Sears and FedEx, are using prepaid cards to pay some of their workers, while a few employers are turning to them to give their workers easier access to flexible-spending accounts. Some states are even using the cards to disburse child-support payments or unemployment benefits.
Tonie Williams, 34, an accountant in New Orleans, filed her tax return two weeks ago but had been unsure about how she would cash her refund check. Ms. Williams, who is recently divorced, said that she closed her credit cards and checking account late last year to get a better handle on her finances, but that she disliked the idea of cashing and carrying around her $3,100 refund.
The amount "is a lot of money when you don't have a checking or savings account to put it in," she said. "At the same time," she added, "you want the option to use it, and not have to worry about it being stolen."
Ms. Williams decided to have her refund sent to a prepaid Visa card that she received from UniRush. She has used her card to buy plane tickets and reserve a hotel room, and now has the value of her paycheck added to the card through an electronic transfer, using the card's routing number. "In more ways than one, it's already served as a bank for me," she said. 
Mr. Marshall of UniRush says that more than 100 customers have arranged to receive refunds on their cards in the last two weeks. The company's typical customer, he said, is 28 years old, earns $30,000 or less a year, and does not have a checking account. 
The tax refund cards can cost such consumers less than traditional check-cashing services, especially if they receive big refunds. Although rules vary by state, check-cashing services, on average, deduct 3 percent from the total amount of a check. The UniRush card, meanwhile, charges a $19.95 activation fee and $1 for each purchase on the card. There is no fee for direct deposit of wages to the cards. 
H&R Block charges a $25 initiation fee once a tax refund is received, but there is no fee for purchases or for two cash withdrawals a month from a Bank of America A.T.M. Further withdrawals cost $1.50 each, on top of any fees charged by an A.T.M. H&R Block plans to charge a monthly service fee of $2.50 after the first four months, although it may waive that fee if the card is loaded with enough money; the amount has not been determined.
Many prepaid cards have routing numbers, just as checking accounts do. To send a payment to the card, a cardholder just provides the routing number. To the government or to an employer, making a direct deposit to the card is often indistinguishable from an electronic transfer to a checking account. As a result, many prepaid cards are already coded to receive tax refunds.
Visa says several banks that already issue prepaid cards are considering promoting them for accepting tax refunds. 
"It is a big opportunity because the card really is designed to provide a lot of benefits to the consumer as well as to the tax preparation company and the I.R.S.," said Nizam Antoo, a product director in Visa's prepaid product group. Consulting firms have estimated that it costs companies and the government $1 to $2 to issue a check, versus less than 40 cents for an electronic transfer.

This Winning Streak Is Moving Up the Charts

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE stock market's broad rally, which had a rocky start last March, is now heading toward its first anniversary without so much as a stumble. Since the end of March 2003, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has never declined 5 percent from any new peak.
 As of Friday, that meant that the S.&P. 500 had rallied for 305 trading days without what Wall Street calls a correction, defined here as a fall of 5 percent or more. Such a decline is usually nothing to worry about. Instead of signaling the end of a rally, a sell-off of that size can let the market consolidate and evolve into the rally's second leg. Already, this is the 11th-longest run without a correction for the S.&P. 500 since 1932, according to Birinyi Associates, a money management firm in Westport, Conn. If the uncorrected rally continues to Feb. 23, it will be the 10th longest. A run to March 9 would move it up to No.9. 
 Analysts have been wondering when the inevitable correction will come. The strong earnings reports coming in for the fourth quarter of 2003 should support the rally, maybe helping to put it in the top 10. But the Federal Reserve's surprise hint last week about interest rate increases, and the fact that February is traditionally not a good month for stocks, won't help. 
The biggest decline for the S.&P. 500 since last March 31 has been 4.57 percent, which took place from June 17 to Aug. 5. The biggest sell-off for the Dow Jones industrials since March was 3.98 percent, from Sept. 18 to 30. The Nasdaq composite index, however, has already had several declines of at least 5 percent, the largest being a fall of 6.42 percent, also from Sept. 18 to 30.
Since last Monday, the recent high for all of these market indexes, the Nasdaq has fallen by 4.1 percent, the Dow by 2 percent and the S.&P. 500 by 2.1 percent. Most of these declines came in the sell-off after the announcement on Wednesday of the Fed's policy shift. 
On the bright side, the more than 300 companies in the S.&P. 500 that have reported fourth-quarter results had overall earnings growth of 26.3 percent, compared with the corresponding quarter a year earlier, according to Thomson First Call. If that performance holds up, it will be the best since the third quarter of 1993. Companies in the capital goods sector, including United Technologies, and technology companies like Advanced Micro Devices have been leading the onslaught of better-than-expected earnings.
Earnings expectations for the first quarter this year have also risen modestly, The forecast for the S.&P. 500 is now 14 percent, up from 13.4 percent at the end of last year.
Fed policy makers have clouded the outlook. At the regular meeting last week, they left their benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent. But they took away the pledge they made in August not to raise this short-term rate for "a considerable period."
Many analysts have expected the Fed to raise this benchmark rate between late this spring and the middle of next year, but the withdrawal of the interest rate promise has made an increase seem more imminent. And after such a long, uninterrupted stock rally, just a heightened awareness of interest rate increases could upset stocks.
THERE is also a historical reason to worry about the rally. February is one of only two months when the market declines, on average. (September is the other.) And in presidential election years, February is the only such month, with a decline of 0.12 percent, on average.
History also shows that a decline after such an uninterrupted run can be painful. The average decline after long runs is 9.8 percent, according to Birinyi Associates. After the most recent correction-free rally, which ended in May 1996, the decline was 7.6 percent before the rally resumed. 
William Rhodes, the chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, says a sell-off is coming but should not be feared. The continuation of strong earnings should cushion the fall, he said, making it unlikely that a bear market will follow.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: KNIGHT A. KIPLINGER; 
Conservative Advice, Yes, but in Flavors Beyond Vanilla

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
KNIGHT A. KIPLINGER is not just the president of the Kiplinger financial advice machine. He is also a client.
 Let others make and lose fortunes on Internet stocks. He bought nary a one. Let others live the high life now and figure that the future will take care of itself. He will not live above his means (end of discussion). And let others seek quick profits from initial public offerings or sleeper stocks. He favors blue chips every time. 
 "I don't swing for the fences; I don't go for home runs," Mr. Kiplinger said. "That makes me a true Kiplinger-type investor." 
It sure does. For more than 80 years, the Kiplinger family has been spewing forth economic forecasts and investment advice that, to oversimplify, says that when the tortoise races the hare, back the tortoise. And Mr. Kiplinger, 55, president and editor in chief of Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine, the Kiplinger Letter, and a few spin-off newsletters on taxes, agriculture and California business, clearly has made slow-but-steady a successful investment mantra.
His money is spread through mutual funds, bonds, real estate and other holdings that, if not very sexy, feel awfully safe. His individual retirement account money is in the Fidelity Magellan fund, "a very solid performer over many years," he notes. 
What about individual stocks? He reckons that, in the three decades or so since he started investing, he has averaged an annual return of better than 10 percent from buying shares in established companies like Merck, J.P. Morgan Chase and I.B.M., and holding on even after they have hit temporary earnings blips.
"Some assets you buy for income, some for growth," Mr. Kiplinger said. "And some" -- he cites cash equivalents here -- "just so you sleep well at night." 
It is pretty conventional investment advice. And in many ways Mr. Kiplinger is the personification of old-line American conventionality. He went into the family business, as his father did. He loves and collects antiques. His first name is a family surname (his maternal grandmother was Daphne Knight), as were the first names of his father, Austin; his grandfather Willard; his son, Brigham, 22; and daughter Sutton, 20. (Daphne, 18, got grandmother's first name, a slight change to the family nomenclature rule). And he wears a suit and tie with the comfort that most people manifest in jeans. 
But spend a long lunch with Mr. Kiplinger, and you soon realize that he is not a plain-vanilla moneyed guy. 
For one thing, he's a share-the-wealth advocate. Each of his 180 employees gets stock, profit sharing, a defined-benefit pension plan and unlimited free stays at a company-owned Florida resort. He writes hefty checks to charity and has often written advice columns that list philanthropic contributions as morally, and fiscally, right. 
You can picture him driving a Mercedes. And he does. But, it's a 1955 Gullwing 300 SL, a bright red two-seater that he bought in 1969 for $3,900 and has lovingly restored over the years -- or more accurately, has paid to have restored. ("I'm just not good with cars," he said.)
And he is left-handed, a trait that many studies have linked to creativity and out-of-the-box thinking. As lunch progressed, those descriptions seemed ever more fitting. Every time his hostess figured that she knew the advice he was about to give, he offered the opposite. 
The expected wisdom: Pay your bills and invest what's left over. The Kiplinger wisdom: "Pay yourself first. " In other words, never skip a payment to your I.R.A., your 401(k) or whatever your chosen savings vehicle. "If you go into arrears on your bills," he said, "it'll focus your attention on cutting back spending." 
The expected wisdom: Check those ubiquitous lists of the best-performing mutual funds, and buy shares of the best ones. The Kiplinger wisdom: Look askance at funds that make everyone's list of top 10 performers. "They are often shooting stars that temporarily benefited from a falling dollar or a boom in health care, and they can just as quickly flame out," he said. Instead, stick with funds like Oakmark Equity and Income, Meridian Growth, CGM Focus or others that, even if not in the top 10, are consistently strong performers.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Mr. Kiplinger's forecasts are often eyebrow raisers, obvious only in hindsight. Three days before the last presidential election, The Kiplinger Letter predicted that a lot would hinge on Florida, and that George W. Bush would ultimately win that state, and thus the office. (The year Mr. Kiplinger was born, 1948, was the only year when The Kiplinger Letter erred on a presidential race. Like so many others, it predicted that Thomas E. Dewey would trump Harry S. Truman.) In March 2000, just days before technology stocks came tumbling down, The Kiplinger Letter warned that "most dot-coms have been bid up to WILDLY inflated levels" and suggested that readers start moving away from tech stocks. 
"What we do best is puncture the popular mania of the moment," Mr. Kiplinger said.
HE is no newcomer to the role of contrarian. He attended Cornell University from 1965 to 1969, when leftist activism ruled the campus. While his fellow students were protesting the Vietnam war and fighting for civil rights, Mr. Kiplinger was deriding them for shouting down anyone with different views. 
"I hated the way the fascism of the new left trampled on the First Amendment," Mr. Kiplinger said. "I thought the war in Vietnam was a well-intentioned tragic mistake, but I protested in writing and conversation, not in riots."
After Cornell, Mr. Kiplinger went to Princeton for graduate work in international affairs. He said he was soon "disgusted" with the way protesters ran roughshod on campus. "The university was so intimidated by the new left that it abandoned its role as guardian of free speech," he recalled. 
So he dropped out and became a reporter for a small newspaper in Rockville, Md. Having a fine tenor voice, he joined the Washington Chorus. So did Ann Miller, a special-education teacher and a fine soprano. They met in the spring of 1979; they were married by December. Four years and two children later, the long hours and stress of newspaper work had gotten to him, and he joined the family business. 
As out of sync as Mr. Kiplinger may have been with his peer group, his personal odyssey is very much in sync with Kiplinger family history.
Knight Kiplinger's grandfather Kip -- actually, Willard, but "he just hated it when anyone called him that," Knight recalled -- was one of the first journalism graduates at Ohio State and covered economic policy for The Associated Press well before he published the first Kiplinger Washington Letter in 1923. Kip's son, Austin, was an evening-news anchor for a Chicago station before running the family shop. Knight's son Brigham has not yet decided on a career. For now, he is teaching in an inner-city school in Washington, and his father does not rule out the chance that he, or one of the daughters, will wind up at the Kiplinger helm as well. 
"Don't ever discount the pull of loyalty and affection and pride in family name," he said. 
For now, though, Knight Kiplinger wears the leadership mantle himself. And, so garbed, he acquiesced good-naturedly when his luncheon companion asked for some investment tips. Basically, his advice boiled down to this: Forgo the possible highs to avoid the heart-rending lows. Here are some of his specific recommendations: 
Avoid I.P.O.'s, no matter how delicious their business model appears. "They're a fool's game, because insiders always get the preferential prices," Mr. Kiplinger said. Wait a year or two, and even if the business model was sound, he said, "I'll bet you can pick up the stock for less." 
Don't confuse a promising premise with a promising company. Yes, the Internet is here to stay. And, yes, it made sense -- and perhaps still does -- to bet on Intel, Cisco Systems or other established companies whose products make up the Internet's infrastructure. But it never made sense to buy stocks of dot-com start-ups. "Don't ever be tempted by shares of companies that don't have earnings," he said. 
Shun mutual funds that do not limit the amount of money they will accept. "Ethical funds will stop accepting new money as soon as their money manager runs out of ideas for new companies to invest in," Mr. Kiplinger said. If those funds open their doors down the road, buy in. 
Leave day trading to the professionals. "It's gambling, not investing," he said. "You'll wind up buying momentum and hype and sizzle, not quality."
Realize that no class of assets has unlimited upside potential. Residential real estate -- even your home -- can be a great investment, but it can also be a sinkhole. Right now, he sees real estate and many bonds as fully priced at best, overpriced at worst. Stocks are not the "screaming bargains" they were a year ago either, he said, but they are still well priced, "and over the long term, nothing really does as well."
Don't buy shares of foreign companies, no matter how strong their performance seems. "It is too hard to closely follow their activities and prospects," he said. "Mutual funds are the one smart way to invest overseas."
Don't turn up your nose at index funds, which rise and fall with the market as a whole. "They really are a way to own an infinitesimal slice of the American economy," he said. 
Trust the experts, but only after you have verified their expertise. For example, if you are buying or selling a house, choose a real estate agent who has completed many transactions in your neighborhood, not just in your price range. 
Don't think that fees are set in stone. Choose an agent who will agree to a lower commission if your house sells quickly, or if he or she represents the buyer as well. The same applies to stockbrokers: many of them will agree to lower their commissions to keep your account. "Buy the highest-quality service you can afford, but don't assume you have to pay top price for it," Mr. Kiplinger added. "We are living in a negotiating society, so don't assume that things that were once nonnegotiable still are."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Quickening the Pace for Bonds

BYLINE:  By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM

 BODY:
IT never quite captured the public's imagination the way, say, Pets.com did with its sock puppets or Kosmo.com did with its plan to deliver videos and ice cream to the masses. On the other hand, those Internet upstarts, and hundreds like them, fizzled a long time ago, while the Web company that Jim Toffey founded in 1998 to make bond trading more efficient has grown into a Wall Street powerhouse.
 Maybe it has something to do with the size of the fixed-income market, which is measured in the tens of trillions of dollars. 
 Late last month, Mr. Toffey's company, TradeWeb, announced that its trading volume in 2003 had surged for the fifth year in a row, reaching $18.3 trillion, up 70 percent from 2002. In its six-year history, TradeWeb has executed more than four million block trades with a total volume of more than $38 trillion, making it the leading electronic trader of fixed-income securities. As Mr. Toffey, 42, likes to say, that is a higher daily dollar volume than passes through the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq combined. 
Institutional investors, TradeWeb's main customers, say the company has taken the mystery out of a once-maddening process. Tim Frechette, director of fixed-income trading at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, describes a simple United States Treasury bond transaction in the days before TradeWeb. 
"Say I was going to trade one of the most liquid bonds in the world, a 2- or 10-year Treasury," he said. "I'd be able to look on electronic screens and determine what people were buying and selling. Then I'd have to call one of my brokers and ask them to give me a price. Meanwhile, that takes time, and the market is moving around. I might like the price. If so, I'd buy. If not, I'd have to hang up and call another broker."
Using TradeWeb, Mr. Frechette says, he can compare offers from five sellers within seconds and pick the best. And that means that he -- and other fixed-income traders -- have a lot more time for analysis and talking with clients. 
Mr. Toffey was a bond trader at Credit Suisse First Boston in 1996 when his boss, John Costas, asked him to figure out how to use the Web to automate the buying and selling of government bonds. He assembled eight programmers and went to work with them in a loft in the TriBeCa neighborhood in Manhattan.
Unlike so many other Internet start-ups back then, he said, TradeWeb shied away from hype.
"My business plan didn't even use the word e-commerce," he said. "We just put our head down and focused on execution. Our mantra was underpromise and overdeliver." 
Credit Suisse First Boston and three other banks put up the initial $12 million investment in the company. Mr. Toffey is no longer employed by Credit Suisse First Boston, but it is the majority investor in TradeWeb. Over the years, four other banks joined. 
First, TradeWeb tackled the market for Treasury bonds, highly liquid securities that lend themselves to electronic trading. It had plenty of competition, said Sang Lee, an analyst at Celent Communications in Boston, who recalled receiving calls or news releases "every other week" about start-ups that were creating electronic bond trading rooms.
Several investors, including some of TradeWeb's backers, put their money into two or more rival firms because they figured that electronic trading was the wave of the future but "weren't sure who'd come out on top," Mr. Lee said. He said many of the early players had either gone out of business "or are just limping around."
The ones that survived the shakeout and are thriving today generally specialize in different markets, like MarketAxess for corporate bonds and the MuniCenter for municipal bonds, Mr. Lee said. 
"But TradeWeb is the clear leader in the electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries in the client-to-dealer market, which means investors who go to a dealer to buy or sell bonds," he said. 
After working out of a 1,000-square-foot loft space four months, Mr. Toffey and his original eight programmers moved to larger offices in the World Trade Center in 1998. 
Then came 2001, the year that the company was supposed to break even -- and the year of the terrorist attacks. With about 70 employees on the 51st floor of the north tower, TradeWeb survived Sept. 11 without any loss of life. By chance, it had installed a disaster recovery system in London a few months earlier, and was able to route all transactions through the London office. 
"We got back up in two weeks, but it involved a lot of scramble and hustle," Mr. Toffey said. By the end of the year, though, it had met its break-even goal.
The company moved to temporary offices in Jersey City, and later into a 38,000- square-foot space there that it has made its home.
TradeWeb's current focus is breaking into new markets and providing extra services for the clients who use its platform. 
But some industry insiders warn that this could be a tricky proposition if it starts dealing in less-liquid securities than it does now. In such markets, margins are generally higher, and traders might resist competition that would lower their profits, said Bruce Usher, former chief executive of TreasuryConnect, an electronic platform for interest rate swaps that was acquired by eSpeed in 2001.
"If TradeWeb tries to enter less-liquid margins, it may face resistance from dealers," Mr. Usher said.
MR. TOFFEY comes by his interest in bonds almost genetically -- his father was in charge of fixed-income trading at First Boston. But he says he did not fully understand the importance of the bond market until his college years at Dartmouth. 
"As a student of economics you really realize that bond markets drive a lot of the economy," he said. 
Today, Mr. Toffey says, he struggles to explain to his three children, ages 10 to 14, exactly what he does. "We play these games, but it will take awhile for them to understand," he said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Growth Forecasts, Without The Wait

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS; Daniel Gross writes the "Moneybox" column for Slate.

 BODY:
THE accusation that the Bush administration stifled internal debate on its tax-cut proposals wasn't the only surprise in "The Price of Loyalty," Ron Suskind's new book about the stormy tenure of Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary. 
 Buried deep in the book was the news that the Treasury Department had developed a new and apparently effective means of forecasting economic growth as it was taking place. 
 In the fall of 2001, as Mr. Suskind relates, Mr. O'Neill asked Richard H. Clarida, a Columbia University economist who became assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy, to help bring the department into the 21st century. Despite the huge advances in information technology and forecasting methods, policy makers were still gauging gross domestic product -- the broadest proxy for the performance of the economy -- in much the way they had in the 1970's. 
At the end of each quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis combines ingredients like retail sales, investment spending and exports, and whips them up into the official G.D.P. figure. But this souffle takes time to rise. On Friday, the department released its first estimate of G.D.P. for the fourth quarter of 2003 -- some 30 days after the quarter ended. In an era when body temperature, stock prices and many other measurements can be readily made in real time, that is not good enough. After all, assumptions about economic growth affect almost everything, from government budget projections to automakers' production schedules. 
Under Mr. Clarida's direction, a team led by Ralph Monaco, a career economist at the Treasury Department, began adopting forecasting techniques developed by the economists Mark W. Watson of Princeton and James H. Stock of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. They examined the monthly flow of 30 pieces of data that the government uses to tally G.D.P. and then figured out how each bit influenced economic growth, based on historical statistical relationships. 
By adding them up, "you amass a collection of forecasts for real G.D.P. that can give you a weighted average, relative to how well that economic indicator performed in the past," said John Kitchen, chief economist of the House Budget Committee. 
Work began in October 2001. After the team tested the method on previous quarters, the real-time forecasting system was put into action. 
In December 2001, with the economy still reeling from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, most forecasters -- including those in the administration -- expected the G.D.P. to contract in the quarter. But the real-time forecasting system produced an estimate of 1.1 percent growth, as Mr. Suskind reports in his book. Sure enough, in late February 2002, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the quarter. By taking into account the real-time dynamics of the nation's highly complex economy, the new system had shown that things weren't quite as bad as most economists thought in late 2001.
Since then, the system has not always been as accurate in predicting quarterly results. According to an article by Mr. Monaco and Mr. Kitchen in the October 2003 issue of Business Economics, the system had difficulty picking up the rapid growth in the first quarter of 2002 and offered a too-optimistic prediction for the second quarter of that year.
Still, Ben Herzon, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm in St. Louis, applauds the system for the way it relies on established relationships. "I think it's a really good approach, because it takes a lot of the judgment out of the process." (Macroeconomic Advisers has its own "current quarter G.D.P. tracking sheet," which uses a mix of models, real data and estimates.)
BESIDES, said Mr. Clarida, who left the Treasury Department last May to return to Columbia, the real-time model tracks economic growth more realistically. 
"Usually, we measure it over a quarter," he said, "but conceptually it's evolving constantly." 
The economy may have grown at an annual rate of 8.2 percent for the third quarter of 2003 and by an estimated 4 percent for the fourth quarter. But it didn't shift suddenly from the higher rate to the lower rate on Oct. 1. By adjusting for new pieces of information, the real-time system is measuring the overall trend of the economy.
The system will produce the first reading on the current quarter in a matter of days. But the Treasury Department has no plans to post the forecasts on the Web. Apparently real time isn't ready for prime time.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
New Math Aside, Earnings Still Reign

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
DOES the quality of a company's earnings bear any relation to the performance of its stock? 
 The answer, of course, is usually a resounding yes. But after the stock market's behavior last year -- when shares of many companies with low-quality earnings outperformed their higher-brow brethren -- investors can be forgiven for wondering whether it still pays to be choosy about the caliber of a company's earnings. 
 David Bianco, accounting analyst at UBS, has a message for the doubters out there: It still pays, big time. 
In an analysis of earnings quality among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, Mr. Bianco found that since 1998, stocks of the highest-ranking companies outperformed the index by a considerable margin. While the index returned 3.3 percent, annualized, during that period, the 50 companies with the best-quality earnings generated average annual returns of 12.3 percent, including dividends. Conversely, shares of the bottom 50 companies showed zero return, on average, over the same time. 
Mr. Bianco's measure of earnings quality takes into account one-time or special charges that companies often take to reflect what they consider unusual events, like major restructurings or widespread layoffs. 
But many companies take such charges all too regularly. And they often do not reflect them in their so-called pro forma earnings, the results they want investors to focus on. So, Mr. Bianco's view is that the more significant the charges over time at a company, the more questionable its quality of earnings. 
Studying companies' reports from 1991 to the present, Mr. Bianco found eight companies that have ranked consistently in the top-quality earnings camp. (See table.) Five companies that regularly formed the bottom of the pack were the Ball Corporation, maker of metal and plastic packaging; Safeco, the property and casualty insurer; Symantec, a provider of Internet security technology; Unisys, the information technology concern; and Whirlpool, the appliance maker.
Although special charges are now ubiquitous at many companies, Mr. Bianco said the practice actually did not become prevalent until the 1990's. And in 2001 and 2002, such charges soared, which was perhaps predictable, given the economic slump. But the fact that the one-time charges just keep on coming at some companies, even in the improving economy of recent months, is plenty surprising. 
"A lot of investors say, 'Isn't the one-time issue going away or getting better?"' Mr. Bianco said. "But there's no evidence it's going away. We are still collecting numbers for 2003, but I think there is going to be just as big a level of one-time charges as there have been, on average, since 1991." 
THE evidence in Mr. Bianco's study confirms what some investors have long suspected: that calling these charges nonrecurring is laughable. In fact, he found that companies taking "one time" charges tend to do so repeatedly. 
For investors, this makes poor historical earnings quality a pretty good indicator that more of the same can be expected from a company in the future, according to Mr. Bianco. Companies with high-quality earnings also tend to be consistent over time. 
"I think a lot of investors think that in 2003 doing this type of work hurt your performance, that in 2003 it helped to own the junk," Mr. Bianco said. "But earnings quality does outperform over long periods of time." 
Paying attention to earnings may not be sexy. But this much is clear: Investors who ignore the caliber of a company's earnings do so at their peril.

On the World's Stage, It's Merely a Curiosity

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
HERE at Super Bowl XXXVIII, we are made to feel as if we are covering something astoundingly far-reaching, truly global and universally profound.
 We are apprised of the growing number of countries carrying tonight's prized television feed, aiming for millions of wide-eyed admirers of the United States in 229 countries who will be screaming "Go for it!" in 21 languages and fighting serious sleep deprivation to not miss Janet Jackson in the halftime show. 
 No fewer than eight Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots have been reminiscing about how they persevered in N.F.L. Europe only to be handsomely rewarded by fateful bounces of the odd-shaped all-American ball. International journalists abound deep in the heart of Texas, an estimated 400 in all, reaching the apex of Super Bowl recognition: their very own party with a bulked-up buffet. 
"One of the greatest sporting occasions in the world," raves Zhigong Shi, producer of the first Chinese Super Bowl broadcast team from CCTV, in a dispatch on NFL.com.
But I wonder: Is this really the way it looks around the world, or is it more a case of bombast without borders, a satellite-fueled extension of the now-legendary Super Bowl week hype? With all due respect to Zhigong's claim, why am I reminded of my former colleague Maury Allen, who years ago had a standard line while packing up after a quick filing on deadline: "There's a billion Chinese who don't give a damn."
The most famous of them, at least in this country, considered my American football question with a wry smile for a few seconds the other night and pretty much came to the same conclusion.
"I don't think there's a big chance that the Chinese people would get too interested in this," said Yao Ming, relaxing in the Houston Rockets' locker room before a game. "Not just because of the physique of most people, but the way people think about the game, the way they think about sports and life."
In other words, while some may hook into American football for the cultlike experience and others may be intrigued by the Academy Awards-like pageantry of the Super Bowl, popularizing our gladiatorial (and gambling) obsession as a game for the global masses may be akin to selling the sport utility vehicle as economically and environmentally prudent.
"It's like soccer here, football there," said Joe Andruzzi, the Patriots offensive lineman from Staten Island, who played one season for the Scottish Claymores in N.F.L. Europe. "Soccer is coming up here a little bit; football is up and coming over there."
Andruzzi recalls bands of hard-core fans chasing their hometown teams around the continent, wearing cheesehead-type paraphernalia, becoming fluent in football military speak. The six-team N.F.L. Europe still exists after several years as a developmental vehicle, so it must be resonating with some segment of the European sporting public.
But there's a difference between soccer here and football there that stretches as far as the Texas plains. However marginal on the American professional level, soccer is a grass-roots phenomenon in the United States, practically a suburban rite of passage for the athletic boy and girl.
Basketball and hockey are played by young people on a far more diverse scale and therefore are the more appropriate North American exports to compare with soccer. When young people play, they are more likely to develop some interest in watching the world's best. 
In line with the global celebration and the party line, youth teams have been trotted out here this week from Russia, Japan and Mexico to compete in the N.F.L. Global Junior Championship VIII. The first round of games on Wednesday served its purpose as a catchy television sound bite. But it's difficult to imagine too many countries where the youngsters are running down-and-outs and where the Super Bowl feed won't mainly service American combat forces and citizens living abroad.
One possibility is Israel, where readers of The Jerusalem Post this morning were encouraged in a short commentary to root, root, root for the Patriots tonight -- or tomorrow morning, which is when the game will be shown in the Middle East -- by a former New Yorker, Steve Leibowitz, a television news editor and president of American Football in Israel, or A.F.I.
Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots' owner, is the majority shareholder of Israel's largest packaging plant, and he and his wife, Myra, are known for their philanthropy with Jewish causes in the United States and in Israel. In 2000, Kraft donated $250,000 to build a sports complex called Kraft Family Stadium, where Leibowitz operates his 54-team, 500-member flag football league, whose four-month season ends next month with the annual Holyland Bowl.
"I built it, he paid," Leibowitz said by telephone from Jerusalem. "More recently, he's put up another $250,000 for an artificial surface, and Myra is funding our women's national flag team, which is going to the World Cup of Flag Football."
Flag, Leibowitz said, is the "international standard" for American football and an area the N.F.L. has actively promoted in the United States and abroad. The league, Leibowitz said, makes a donation every season to A.F.I.
It's a canny marketing strategy, given the costs and risks of tackle football, and, internationally, the less flattering perception of the spectacle that tonight will transfix Americans everywhere.
"Rugby for sissies," one British journalist here was overheard describing our most macho team game. That's a characterization not soon to be posted on NFL.com.

HEADLINE: Colorado Takes Strides to Polish Thin and Fit Image 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Everyone here has buns of steel and rock-hard abs laced across the zero-fat body of a vegan marathon runner. Everyone hikes and bikes and has climbed Pikes Peak.
 That is not really true, of course. But as a stereotype, it resonates and lingers -- like the absurd idea that New Yorkers are rude or Californians are flaky -- because it has always been easy to find an example that makes it seem true. 
 For years, Colorado has worn the crown as the least obese state in the nation, according to federal studies, and Denver has been the jewel in that crown, invariably ranked among the leanest metropolitan areas by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. There was a powerful demographic engine at work: People were more fit partly because fitter people moved here, drawn by the active lifestyle and abundant sunshine that encouraged more time outdoors. 
Healthy living became part of the culture, and things cruised along for years on a self-sustaining autopilot of svelte.
But here's the skinny: Colorado's obesity rate surged to nearly 17 percent of the adult population in 2002 and has more than doubled over the last decade. Though still the thinnest state, its lead is slipping, according to the most recent federal figures. Only 10 states did worse in 2002 in holding down or reducing the number of severely overweight residents.
And Colorado can no longer count on a cavalry of buff rock-climbers moving in to hold down the average. Population growth in the future, demographers say, will be increasingly driven by "natural increase" -- the children of people already here, many of whom are more apt to reach for a soda than a snowboard, as national health studies show. 
"Our population demographics aren't going to work in our favor in the future," said James O. Hill, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado in Denver. "We're going to look more like the other states."
But Dr. Hill and other experts say Colorado may still have a secret weapon against fat. The culture of fitness has been woven into the state's fabric, they say, backed by a deep pool of scholarly capital in Colorado's colleges and medical schools about nutrition and exercise. Those forces, many medical experts say, are now coming into play as never before, partly in response to the alarm over obesity.
"Colorado is doing a lot of the right things, and I think some of it can be copied elsewhere," said Dr. Andrew L. Dannenberg, an obesity researcher at the disease centers.
This year, for example, a fitness walking program called Colorado on the Move, founded in 2002 by Dr. Hill and others at the University of Colorado, will go national with its first 12 state affiliates. The new organization, America on the Move, working through partnerships with companies, government and schools, aims at getting people to walk more, literally step by step. By using stride-counting devices, organizers say, people can set modest goals of a few added steps a day, with big health dividends over time.
Farther south, Denver's suburban counties have incorporated fat-fighting goals into building and zoning decisions, Dr. Dannenberg and other experts say, creating a hybrid formula of land-use planning and fitness.
"We'll say, 'We'd like to have the opportunity for people to take regular physical exercise during the day -- can you incorporate that?' " said Carol Maclennan, the environmental health policy coordinator at the Tri-County Health Department, which covers Douglas, Arapahoe and Adams Counties.
Even the Denver International Airport is healthy. It was ranked first in the nation last year in the percentage of restaurants offering a healthy entree choice, according to a group called the Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine.
But researchers say the real main course in Colorado's fight against fat is a supersize planned community under construction on Denver's east side, at the site of the old Stapleton International Airport, which closed in 1995 when the new airport opened.
Stapleton, which will be a mixed-income city-within-a-city of 30,000 people when completed over the next decade, is being designed and marketed by the developer Forest City Enterprises around the concept of an active lifestyle. Parks and trails lace through the property, connecting to grocery stores, banks and restaurants. The first residents began moving in last year, and exercise groups like the "Stapleton Strollers," a confab of parents who gatherto run or walk behind their baby carriages, have become part of the social whirl. 
It is a fat-researcher's dream, and at 4,700 acres by far the biggest test case of its kind in the nation. 
"It's the grand experiment," said Dr. Ned Colange, the chief medical officer at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
Doctors at the University of Colorado School of Medicine say they hope to reinvent the idea of neighborhood medicine at Stapleton with a flagship clinic aimed less at treating sickness than at keeping people healthy, through things like nutrition counseling and exercise programs. 
Issues of race, ethnicity and class will come into play. Blacks, Hispanics and people with lower incomes tend to have higher obesity rates than whites, and Stapleton sits in the middle of a racially and economically diverse section of the city. A major goal of the School of Medicine team is to see how much the culture of fitness inside Stapleton can change the patterns outside it.
"If I were to put one pin on the planet, it goes on Stapleton," said Dr. Frank V. deGruy III, chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at the School of Medicine. "This is a real opportunity to rethink some of things we do. The place is being designed with a lot of green zones and walking trails -- we're going to use the built environment and piggyback on that."
Some medical experts say the Stapleton experiment is rigged, because even a somewhat fatter Colorado is healthier and thinner than the nation as a whole. That means many of the people attracted to the new community will already be living a healthier lifestyle. Other obesity researchers say Colorado's history makes it the perfect proving ground.
"Because Colorado is one of the better states, this is where we start in the intervention efforts -- you start in a place where you've got a chance of it actually working," said Dr. Hill at the University of Colorado.
Some health experts and urban planners say the real national impact of Stapleton could be its sales pitch: that "quality of life" equals "quality of health."
For years, advocates of so-called smart growth have urged politicians and developers, usually without success, to build neighborhoods that get away from dependence on the automobile, by creating opportunities to walk and take mass transit. The usual argument is that better-planned communities will help the environment by improving air and water quality.
At places like Stapleton, fitness and fat consciousness are redefining that debate.
"Smart growth and new urbanism are very politicized issues," said Rich Killingsworth, the director of Active Living by Design, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which issued a $200,000 grant to Stapleton last year as part of its national anti-obesity campaign. "But most people can relate to the idea that 'Hey, maybe where I live and work does relate to physical activity, to my family, and maybe my weight.' "
Todd Pfeufer does not think his physique has changed much since moving into Stapleton last year from another neighborhood in Denver. He has always been a regular at the gym. But Mr. Pfeufer, 37, says he has been walking more with his three miniature schnauzers, and he is seeing a difference in them, at least.
"Our dogs definitely are losing weight," he said.

HEADLINE: For Houston, It's Party First, Game Second 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Roger and Debbie Clemens dropped by. So did the Hilton sisters, Nicky and Paris, the American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken and the wrestler The Rock. And at midnight everyone pulled up chairs over the covered-up swimming pool and listened to Willie Nelson sing.
 "Amazing what a football game will do for a guest list," said John Thrash, who turned a little family natural gas business into the giant eCorp. 
 On Friday night Mr. Thrash and his wife, Becca Cason Thrash, one of the city's most indefatigable hostesses, opened their mansion for 500 guests to team up with the Olympian Carl Lewis and Anthony Kennedy Shriver (yes, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's brother-in-law) to help their charity, Best Buddies, raise money for people with mental disabilities.
It has been that kind of week in Houston, where they gave a party and everyone came. By Friday, 450 private planes were parked nose to nose (to save space) on taxiways and a spare runway at Hobby Airport before the field was closed to new arrivals. Hundreds more planes were expected at Ellington Field and Bush Intercontinental. 
Earlier in the week there was celebrity poker and, cocktails in Houston's own Versailles with the city's restaurant czar, Tillman J. Fertitta, and guests like George and Barbara Bush. And there was a rappers summit session with hip-hop stars and Beyonce, who will sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl on Sunday. 
So many rappers called for their preferred drink, Roederer Cristal Champagne, that supplies dried up. But Spec's, which calls itself the world's largest spirits store (22 checkout aisles) offered a six-liter bottle from a special year 2000 production for $20,000. At that tidy sum, there were no immediate takers.
In a town where hosts and hostesses regularly knock themselves out with old-fashioned Texas hospitality, the Super Bowl has brought out, if not always the best, unquestionably the most.
"People come to Texas expecting a lot of hospitality, and hosts try to treat them well," said Jackson Hicks, a leading caterer known as the Prince of Parties whose staff of 300 churned out back-to-back dinners for thousands of National Football League players, owners and friends.
Mr. Hicks's apotheosis came Saturday night at his catering hall, The Corinthian, in Houston's revitalized downtown, where Playboy had booked its fifth annual Super Bowl party, one of the week's hottest tickets. 
Themed parties are popular here, and Playboy went with Heaven and Hell, asking guests to choose angelic or devilish attire. Mr. Hicks selected the food and drink accordingly, white desserts upstairs and dark spicy fare and chocolate below. 
Hugh Hefner was otherwise engaged, publicists said, but 10 Playmates and dozens of celebrities and 1,700 others were invited to help support a silent auction benefiting an N.F.L. charity, Athletes Helping Kids. 
Big is good in Houston. This, after all, is a city that in little more than 30 years built three ballparks, the Astrodome, Minute Maid Park and Reliant Stadium, and partied through dizzying roller-coaster cycles of bust and boom. For the 150th anniversary of Houston and the 25th anniversary of the Johnson Space Center in 1986, a laser show projected on downtown buildings by the French musician Jean Michel Jarre turned the city into a vast artist's canvas that brought traffic screeching to a stop.
And Houstonians extravagantly feted visitors to the World Economic Summit session in 1990 and the Republican National Convention two years later. 
But the Super Bowl, just about everyone agrees, is an occasion apart. 
The crush of superstars brought its own problems. Jerry Vann, a backstage manager and celebrity-handler who has been called "concierge to the world," got a call from the musician Sammy Hagar, who had run out of his favorite tequila, Cabo Wabo. Mr. Vann found a bottle. 
Not everyone was in chic salons. Thousands poured into downtown for free band concerts and pub-crawls. 
"I've been working on 16 or 18 parties," said Richard W. Flowers, chief operating officer of the Events Company and one of the city's leading party impresarios. "Houston is a generous town," he said, "and people compete to stand out." 
As a division of Landry's Restaurants, which operates some 300 restaurants nationwide, Mr. Flowers's company kicked off the week of high entertaining by helping Landry's founder, Mr. Fertitta, stage an elaborate thank-you for 200 local Super Bowl backers and N.F.L. leaders, including Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
Mr. Fertitta's home in River Oaks, a palatial place of 19,000 square feet on 5.4 acres listed on the tax rolls as Houston's second-most expensive residential property at $13.7 million, became a Versailles for the occasion. French wall panels were hurriedly put up around the car park, to house 200 diners when the weather turned unexpectedly chilly. 
How did he get George and Barbara Bush in for cocktails? 
"I asked them," Mr. Fertitta said, calling Houston "a box of 50,000 people" who all know each other, although it did not hurt, he allowed, to have raised money for Mr. Bush, as he did later for President Bill Clinton.
After dinner, guests were invited across the compound to the tennis courts, where Mr. Flowers had created a Wild West saloon, complete with faux steer heads and cow hide seating, to hear the country singer Clay Walker while streamers were shot from the stage into the audience. 
Mr. Fertitta was ebullient. "You should see my Mardi Gras party in Galveston," he said. "It's amazing."

HEADLINE: The Governor Turns to the Cities 

BYLINE:  By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
CALL it his urban initiative. With his poll numbers dropping and his support among moderate Republicans disappearing, Gov. John G. Rowland has turned to the cities for support. And in some places, he is getting it. 
 Mr. Rowland, born and bred in Waterbury, is asking for support in the state's biggest cities, Waterbury, Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport, as he faces inquiries into gifts he took for his vacation cottage. These are cities where Democrats sometimes face stronger competition from the Green Party than from Republicans. Other than Waterbury, the state's biggest cities voted against him overwhelmingly in the last election. 
 Now, he is hoping local leaders in those cities, including ministers at some active black congregations in the state, can help his approval numbers. Dean Pagani, Mr. Rowland's chief of staff, acknowledged that some people might find it "ironic" that the governor has support in the cities. 
Dr. John Orman, professor of politics at Fairfield University, was one of those people.
"It would be really ironic if a Republican governor's last hope of support is the inner-city communities," he said. "It would be like a liberal Democrat going to try to get support from conservative senior citizens in Arizona. Rowland's record isn't something that's going to make people in the inner cities say 'He's really a champion of minorities and he's going to help us."'
In a speech in Bridgeport on Jan. 22 to announce financing for an economic development project, Mr. Rowland stressed his connections to the cities. He said he ran for a third term "because we had unfinished business in Bridgeport, Waterbury, New Haven and Hartford."
"This city has extraordinary faith and hope," he told a crowd of dignitaries, business people and reporters. "It reminds me of my hometown of Waterbury, which is one of the reasons I feel closely committed to this community."
Later, he made comparisons between his own plight and that of the city, which has received more than $650 million in state investments during his tenure as governor.
"We have faced some ups and we have faced some downs, and so have I," he said. "But my command focus will be on bringing this city back along with our capital city of Hartford, Waterbury and New Haven, making sure that everybody has a better quality of life. I have not taken my eye off this ball for one day over the last nine years. And my eye will be on this ball for as long as I am in office."
People realize the governor has invested more in the state's cities than previous governors, Mr. Pagani said. According to the governor's office, the State Bond Commission has sent more than $439 million to Waterbury, $847 million to Hartford, $303 million to Bridgeport and $313 million to New Haven for capital improvement projects during his tenure.
His current strategy, observers say, will attempt to shift the focus to those projects. During the past week, Mr. Rowland has also talked with ministers at primarily black churches in Hartford and New Haven. From their comments after the meetings at the Capitol, it appears he made a good impression.
"It's absolutely vital as a Christian to operate the ministry of reconciliation," said Gary L. Jenkins, a pastor at the Sword of the Spirit Ministries in New Haven. "As a pastor and a man of compassion I felt it was time to extend a hand of forgiveness to the governor."
Mr. Jenkins, who first met the governor while he was a radio reporter covering the Capitol more than 20 years ago, considers himself Mr. Rowland's friend. He doesn't condone what the governor did, but he said he thought it was time to forgive him.
Though he said he was speaking as a friend of the governor, he acknowledged he had a lot of influence over the people who go to his church. He planned to use that influence.
"I asked my parishioners to forgive him," Mr. Jenkins said. "They trust me as their pastor and in return I think that translates into a change of heart for some people. I would say they're overwhelmingly in his favor."
Mr. Jenkins said he planned to bring together other ministers and ask them to forgive the governor and urge their parishioners to do the same. Given what he has heard in the community, he said he did not think that would be particularly difficult.
"I never considered going on a crusade for Governor Rowland," he said. "I found out there are other ministers who felt the same way I did."
Like other black ministers interviewed for this article, Mr. Jenkins said he remembered a moment of crisis in his community when the governor stepped in. In 1997, a black man, Malik Jones, was shot and killed by an East Haven police officer. The governor was at his side in the neighborhood, Mr. Jenkins said, and even called the United States attorney general at the time, Janet Reno, to push for an investigation.
Mr. Rowland hugged the pastor at least twice during their meeting on Monday and they prayed together. While Mr. Rowland has been criticized by newspaper columnists and political observers for his "Come to Jesus" apologies earlier in the scandal, Mr. Jenkins feels he is expressing genuine feelings.
"He's a compassionate man, believe it or not," he said. "That's the thing that the news media doesn't see."
That point was reiterated by Cornell Lewis, a minister at the Northend Church of Christ on Albany Avenue and the leader of the group Men of Color, which has pushed to get drug dealers out of Hartford. Mr. Lewis also met with the governor last Monday. He said the meeting focused on the issues Mr. Lewis is dealing with in Hartford, but they also discussed the governor's predicament.
Mr. Lewis noted how quiet it was in the Capitol and asked the governor why. Mr. Rowland told him about the formation of a committee that will decide whether to impeach the governor. The governor was obviously distressed, said Mr. Lewis, who asked if he could do anything for him. But the governor did not specifically ask for him to rally support, Mr. Lewis said.
"To be honest, there are people in the African-American community who don't share the opinion of many Democrats who are trying to impeach him," Mr. Lewis said. "They don't see grounds for impeachment to begin. They see it as politics.
"This is what I'm hearing in the coffee shops, in the barbershops, in the weight room: 'You want to destroy a man because of a hot tub and some improvements he made at a cottage?"'.
Some people equate the governor's economic woes to their own, despite his making $150,000, Mr. Lewis said. Education and alimony payments eat up a lot of that money, Mr. Lewis added.
The governor's push for support, though, may fall short, especially in black communities, Dr. Orman said. The governor might have been able to count on support in the cities if he was seen as a victim. But, Dr. Orman said, that is not the impression most people have.
"If there was an appearance of a partisan witch hunt then I could see people rallying around Rowland," he said. "He's not set up for a classic underdog 'they're trying to drive me out of office' campaign."
Indeed, others said the governor was not getting much sympathy in the cities, and especially not in the black community.
"Certainly the governor has left his mark on cities in terms of trying to revive them," said Steven M. Harris, a founding member of the Greater Hartford African-American Alliance and a former Hartford city councilman. "But the folks I listen to, working class folks, everyday folks, they're a little surprised that the governor's been hanging on this long. Because if that was us, or if that was me, they'd lock me up and throw away the key."
City dwellers have also reacted angrily to the governor's moves to cut health insurance for poor people. Now that he is in hot water, they aren't necessarily going to turn around and embrace him, said Marilyn E. Rossetti, executive director of Hartford Areas Rally Together, a community development organization. Ms. Rossetti said she had heard mixed things from the people she worked with. Mostly, though, people struggling to make it in Connecticut's cities aren't focused on the governor at all. At most meetings of community members, including a large gathering last week, the subject didn't even come up.
"Not one person in that room talked about the governor," she said. "They talked about their community."
Others disputed the claim that Mr. Rowland has helped the state's cities.
"He's been in office for nine years and despite a national economy that was mostly robust during that time, our cities are in worse shape," said George C. Jepsen, the state Democratic Party chairman.
Democrats control the top office in every major city in the state, but only one of those mayors, John DeStefano of New Haven, has asked the governor to step down. Mr. DeStefano has already indicated his interest in running for governor in 2006. Others, such as Waterbury Mayor Michael J. Jarjura, a Democrat, have supported the governor. Mr. Rowland backed Mr. Jarjura during his last election run.
"I was actually just getting upset with what I believe to be a rush to judgment by some high level political people both on the federal and state level. It appeared to me that there was a frenzy going on to raise the level of vitriol so the governor no longer had any other choice but to step down," Mr. Jarjura said after a news conference on Tuesday during which Mr. Rowland announced that more state money would go to the city for community development.
Mr. Jarjura said he had not been asked to rally support for the governor, but that he was happy to make appearances with him in the city. He acknowledged that the appearances helped Mr. Rowland take the attention off his scandals, but said that was not his primary concern.
"It's not about anyone overtly out to do public relations," he said. "It's my honor and privilege to stand with him. He's been generous to my city and many other cities in the state."
Of course, some mayors may have more to lose by asking him to resign than they have to gain. The state's cities are still competing for money and bonds, which the governor can help steer their way. Some Democrat leaders in the Legislature have specifically asked mayors not to speak out on the issue.
State Senator William A. Finch of Bridgeport urged local politicians not to speak out on the Rowland scandal, for fear that it could hurt the city's chances of getting state grants.
John M. Fabrizi, the mayor of Bridgeport, said he didn't need Mr. Finch's advice to make the decision not to ask the governor to resign. Though he supported the committee of inquiry formed last week to decide on impeachment, Mr. Fabrizi said he would let state legislators worry about what is going on at the Capitol. He is focused on the city.
"I appreciate his opinion," Mr. Fabrizi said of Mr. Finch. "However, I base my reasoning on the governor's relationship to Bridgeport. He's been a tremendous asset to Bridgeport."
Some of the governor's staunchest supporters said they would continue to rally behind him.
"I may not be of his political persuasion but I'm a friend of the governor," said the Rev. King T. Hayes, pastor at Shiloh Baptist Church in Hartford. Mr. Hayes, who gave the benediction at each of the governor's inaugural ceremonies, said he did not condone the governor's actions, but does feel he deserved a second chance. He hasn't preached to his parishioners about the governor, but he intended to stand behind his friend.
"Friends are not 'fair weather,"' he said. When you're good, they're your friends. When you're bad, they're still your friends."

CMP's Symbiosis of Magazines and Trade Shows

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH

 BODY:
ANALOG DEVICES, which engineers specialized integrated chips in Norwood, Mass., gave a party last spring to celebrate the introduction of the Blackfin, a new digital signal processor it had big expectations for. Like many companies, Analog chose to make a splash at a trade show, in this case the Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco, a gathering of high-tech manufacturers of products like telephone handsets and digital audio players.
 The thinking was logical: few people willingly wander through electronic circuitry for four days at a place like the Moscone Center without at least some intention of buying a gewgaw or two. So Analog's marketing department was delighted when 1,500 attendees accepted their invitation. There, beneath signs proclaiming "Like Never Before," the evening's overarching theme that doubled as a kind of sales mantra, guests ate, drank and danced to a local rock band. 
 Analog had help in putting on its reception from CMP Media, the Manhasset publishing giant that organized the expo. Known primarily for its 43 trade magazines, including niche must-reads like EE Times and InformationWeek, CMP also produces 25 major trade shows a year, pulling in global audiences. Under the name XChange, it also produces 200 smaller discussion-oriented events for senior executives.
CMP, a division of United Business Media in London, provided Analog with lists of influential people to invite, helped put up signs and banners, plugged the Blackfin in the pages of the show's floor guide and helped pull attendees into focus groups at the conference, all for the cost of renting space at the show. 
Joe Laskowski, Analog's director of corporate marketing, was pleased with the results. CMP "doesn't just take your money -- they are a true marketing partner," he said. 
But CMP, which specializes in high-tech and health care technology events, is not motivated only by a generosity of spirit. Trade show attendance around most of the world has been in a tailspin for the last three years. The annual Comdex computer show in Las Vegas once rose as a kind of temporary city of 200,000, but this past November, it drew barely a quarter of that figure. 
The downturn makes many executives in the exposition industry flinch. "Trade shows on the whole are a tough business and are not doing well," said Paul Miller, CMP's senior vice president for electronic publishing who oversees the Embedded Systems Conference and other high-tech shows. 
"It's been a kind of perfect storm," he added, citing the impact of Sept. 11, the general economic sluggishness and overcapacity in high-tech industries.
After last year's conference, CMP entered into negotiations with Messe Munchen International, a German trade show producer, and this year it will blend Embedded Systems into Messe Munchen's globetrotting Electronica conference. The new show's San Francisco stop will pull in three times the audience, the companies said. 
Show owners like CMP, which ranks second among international trade show producers behind the International Data Group, are doing everything they can to accommodate exhibitors, short of lowering prices. 
Attendance at trade shows around the world last year dropped nearly 25 percent, according to a survey by Expo magazine, a trade publication, and the International Association for Exhibition Management. Still, show owners managed to raise revenue an average of 5 percent during each of the previous two years.
In large part organizers did this by polishing a lemons-into-lemonade pitch, assuring exhibitors that the dwindling crowds at many shows are, in reality, a good thing. "At shows, attendance might have fallen, but the quality of attendees has gotten stronger," said Doug Ducate, the president and chief executive of the Center for Exhibition Industry Research. "Companies that used to send 40 people are now sending five or six. The tire kickers, the mom-and-pop business owners, they're not coming now. The people who do come, they're the people who have the real buying power."
Richard Mead, the managing director of the Jordan, Edmiston Group, an investment banking firm in New York specializing in the media, said, "CMP has focused very sensibly over the last few years, making themselves very efficient. For that reason, they haven't experienced the sort of drops in attendance that comparable owners have," he added. "They've done a good job of riding out the storm."
Some signs point to a turning tide. "A lot of industries are doing exceedingly well, including construction, home building and heavy equipment manufacturers, which have recently had record turnouts" at industry shows, said Steven Hacker, the president of the International Association of Event Managers. "Health care is robust, home renovations shows are doing well, and industries like pharmaceuticals and biotech" are thriving, he said.
The entry into the flashy world of trade shows, where hard-nosed product marketing gets a show-biz makeover, seems at first blush an unlikely direction for a trade publisher like CMP, whose founders, Gerard and Lilo Leeds, created their first publication, a newsletter called Electronic Buyers' News, on their dining room table in Manhasset in 1971. But the move into trade shows was not only logical but, Mr. Miller's protestations aside, quite lucrative. 
"A magazine establishes a market base, and that's an excellent marketing vehicle for a trade show," said Donald Pazour, the chief executive of PBI Media in Potomac, Md., and a former chief executive of Miller Freeman, the trade show and publishing company that owned CMP for a short time just before it was sold United Business Media in 1999. 
CMP's organizational structure underscores the two-way relationship between publications and shows. Rather than operating its 25 major trade shows from a single division, CMP runs them as extensions of the publications that spawn them. 
Bolstered by this arrangement, trade shows are CMP's most profitable endeavors. Alix Raine, a spokeswoman for CMP, said that she could not release revenue totals for 2003 but that trade shows accounted for 18 percent of the company's revenue and 29 percent of its profits. Publishing, both paper and electronic, constitutes the balance.
Last year, said Mr. Mead of the Jordan, Edmiston Group, CMP's revenue from events totaled about $500 million, second to the International Data Group, which pulled in more than $2 billion.
While CMP's mix is financially sound, making a trade show distinctly the work of a particular company -- what marketing types call the branding process -- is no small task, said Mary Beth Rebedeau, the executive director of the Society of Independent Show Organizers. Last month's electronics show in New York is hard to tell from this month's show in Chicago -- same exhibitors, same sales hype, same drill.
At CMP, "it's the publications that drive the trade show business," not the other way around, Ms. Rebedeau said. "Trade shows are very profitable," she added, "but it is harder to build a brand with a trade show."

HEADLINE: Aim Lower, Study Tells Ailing Hospital 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
SINCE its creation in 1999, the Nassau Health Care Corporation has aspired to a regional role as a top-rung health provider offering advanced medical care at its 631-bed Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow.
 Last week, in the opening round of what will be an intense debate about a thorough restructuring and downsizing of the public-benefit corporation to stop its financial losses -- $91.1 million to date -- a study by a consultant hired by Nassau County splashed cold water on notions of advanced health care. The study said a caseload review revealed that the medical center more nearly fit the description of a community hospital functioning as the county's family doctor, with a special mission as the doctor's office of last resort for the uninsured and indigent. 
 Dropping its costly pretensions to be more, the study suggested, will be one key to averting a financial collapse within 18 months. A collapse would have serious financial consequences for the county, which guarantees repayment of $256 million in debt the corporation assumed at its creation. 
The hospital corporation "has pursued costly, and ultimately unaffordable initiatives based upon a vision of becoming a full-service tertiary-care hospital, when in reality it should have structured its operations and programs based on the goal of being a first-class community hospital," said the study by Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, a Manhattan law firm with a specialty in turning around financially troubled hospitals.
Such turnarounds are complex, but the goals are simple. "What you are trying to do is eliminate costs but keep revenue the same or add more -- that's really the trick," said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Kevin Dahill, the president and chief executive of the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, which represents 24 nonprofit and public hospitals in the two counties, said Nassau University Medical Center was far from alone in facing financial hardships. "More than half our membership is in a very precarious financial situation," he said.
Rick Wade, the senior vice president for communications of the American Hospital Association in Washington, said a third of all hospitals were operating in the red, and a third were barely breaking even. 
In New York, six hospitals closed last year, including the 213-bed Island Medical Center in Hempstead. 
Richard B. Turan, the president of the Nassau Health Care Corporation, said he did not expect Nassau University would be added to the list. "I don't believe anybody is going to suggest that we close," he said. "The question is what do we need to look like to continue to function." 
The study consultants also rejected closing the hospital but recommended regionalizing some services it now offered. This would involve affiliations with one or more of the three health systems that operate in Nassau: Catholic Health Services of Long Island, North Shore-L.I.J. Health System and the Winthrop South Nassau University Health System. 
The study said one objective would be to create a partnership with the private systems. "This integration not only would contribute significantly to improving the clinical and financial performance of N.H.C.C. but would also go a long way toward breaking down historic barriers to access to the best health care available in Nassau County for all patients, including the indigent," the study said. 
The study said that by tailoring itself to its true calling as a community hospital, the Nassau University Medical Center could reduce costs by as much as $20.2 million while increasing revenue by up to $14 million. This would be part of an overall restructuring plan to save the corporation up to $47.7 million while increasing revenue by up to $35.3 million.
Another recommendation that is bound to be controversial calls for closing the 889-bed A. Holly Patterson nursing home or reducing beds to somewhere between 450 to 680 and relocating the home. Part of its operations would be housed in the hospital building and part in a new building on the hospital grounds. 
Closing the home, the study said, might be possible if the current residents moved to private nursing homes with empty beds. It said the private homes had an incentive to fill 95 percent of their beds because that would qualify them for special payments to hold beds open when residents temporarily leave for hospital treatment. 
In either event, the nursing home building in Uniondale would be razed and the 63-acre property sold. The money that would bring in, an estimated $30 million to $70 million, would be used to pay off part of the $256 million corporation debt.
The study said that 225 to 313 jobs, including those for 17 to 19 doctors, would be eliminated at the hospital, where reductions have already occurred. It said 71 to 137 jobs would be eliminated at the nursing home. The corporation has about 3,800 employees, Mr. Turan said.
No immediate layoffs were envisioned at the corporation's seven diagnostic and treatment clinics. But the study, citing higher Medicaid payments for patient care at the clinics, called for doubling their patient caseloads, in part by redirecting patients from the main hospital to the clinics.
The study also called for a revision of agreements between the corporation and the county that would increase the county's control and give county officials the power to appoint members of the corporation's board of directors.

HEADLINE: Backpedaling a Bit in East Hampton 

BYLINE:  By J.D. SAMUELSON

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON 

 BODY:
JOB POTTER, a veteran Democratic councilman in East Hampton, maintained a stiff upper lip as he made his way along an ice-covered sidewalk outside the American Legion Hall in Amagansett. Inside were almost 350 residents, property owners and developers, many of them outraged over proposed building moratoriums, one of which would freeze construction on an estimated 250 of the town's most affordable building lots.
 After six years on the East Hampton Town Board, Mr. Potter knew the next several hours were not so much about the first three weeks since a Democratic majority took over Town Hall and any missteps that had been made along the way, but whether those three weeks and those missteps would linger in the minds of voters when election time comes around again in 2005. 
 The moratoriums are intended to buy the town some time as it completes a much-postponed comprehensive plan, a blueprint for preservation and development over the next 15 years. They would not halt all construction but would, almost exclusively, affect property in lower- and middle-income neighborhoods.
As Mr. Potter described the proposals before the Amagansett meeting, a public hearing held on Jan. 21, "We are really trying to stop big spec houses on little lots that do not fit the neighborhood."
Nobody is sure exactly how many lots would be affected, and that, Mr. Potter said, is exactly the problem. Continued construction, though regulated on a case-by-case basis, might jeopardize the broader goals of the comprehensive plan. Still, he conceded that the moratoriums would have an "inevitable impact" on builders and on working families who live here year round, but he added, "I think it will not be nearly as much as people think."
Inside the American Legion Hall speaker after speaker disagreed, berating the Town Board's new Democratic majority for drafting moratoriums that, they said, would shake the town's service economy.
Philip J. McSweeney, a local builder, assured the board that memories were long in a small town. "There is definitely a failure to communicate here," he said. "The failure is between the Town Board and the people."The proposed nine-month moratoriums would not keep undeveloped lots affordable for local families, as the board had hoped, but would, he said, reduce the supply of available building lots overnight, driving up prices.
Instead of ensuring working families a place in the Town of East Hampton, Mr. McSweeney said, the board was working against them. "Steven Spielberg does not come out from Hollywood, jump on his John Deere and cut the grass," he said. "People have to live here to work here."
One of the board's proposals would revise and extend an existing moratorium against commercial construction in targeted areas, primarily along Montauk Highway. The second would ban subdividing parcels anywhere in town for nine months. The third moratorium, by far the most controversial, would halt construction on so-called urban renewal lots, parcels of less than half an acre that were carved out by developers before the town adopted zoning in 1957 and well before half-acre lots were made mandatory for new homes in 1976. 
Even before these latest moratoriums were proposed, urban renewal lots were difficult to build on. Approvals had been decided on a case-by-case basis and usually depended on meeting county septic and well-water standards. Still, the lots have long been "some of the only affordable plots in town," said Richard Hammer, a former assistant town attorney who went into private practice when the administration shifted to a 4-to-1 Democratic majority on Jan. 1.
Skyrocketing real estate prices have meant that many would-be homeowners -- including would-be second-home owners -- have turned to urban renewal lots, largely in working- and middle-class neighborhoods, as an alternative to larger and more expensive lots, Mr. Hammer said in a telephone interview.
"There are people out there who, after years of saving, planned to build a home in the next year and now do not know what is going to happen," he said. "There are plenty of people who are going to be hurt by this."
And while there were a handful of speakers at the Jan. 21 meeting who supported the moratoriums -- most citing the failure of the previous administration to complete the comprehensive plan, despite several missed deadlines -- most of the speakers opposed them.
Pat Mansir, now the sole Republican on the Town Board, questioned the zeal with which the Democratic majority put forward their land-use proposals, calling them "too final too soon."
"I think they did not make an effort to include the whole Town Board or the public," she said before the meeting, giving the impression the moratoriums were already a done deal, even before the public hearing. Ms. Mansir has since come out against the moratoriums altogether.
For their part, the Democrats have backed off, saying that they received a clear message at the public hearing and will now rework their proposals, this time with public input. "I am loath to criticize our performance so far," Mr. Potter said. "There are so many people out there doing it already, and I am not sure they need my help."
William McGintee, the newly elected town supervisor, said: "Everything is easy to judge in retrospect. We should maybe have taken more time. The upside here is that we have kick-started the comprehensive planning process."
Mr. McGintee defended the board's performance. "We didn't stumble coming out of the gate," he said. "In fact, we hit the ground running as we tried to move ahead with what the last administration couldn't and moved to get the job done."

Saving the Day for Those Brides in Need

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER; E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE stylish $10,000 satin gown with buttons all the way down the back in the window of Claire's Treasures, a swank thrift shop in Cedarhurst, has been worn by six brides. 
 Shayna English, 23, an unemployed teacher, strolled down the aisle in the long, formal dress with collar and cuffs at her wedding on Dec. 1 to Jeremy Horowitz, a 25-year-old accountant. When she found the recycled gown at Claire's Treasures, it was stained, but she loved it anyway. 
 "For me personally, it was a question of affordability," Mrs. Horowitz said. "There are plenty of stunning gowns out there these days, but they are quite expensive." 
Mrs. Horowitz didn't have the $300 to have the dress altered and cleaned. Nor could she have afforded the formal wedding with a sit-down dinner for 315 guests at Congregation Beth Sholom in Lawrence. But she was in luck. Nicole Gleitman, the owner of Claire's Treasures, is a wedding benefactor. 
In the last four and a half years, Mrs. Gleitman, 46, of Woodsburgh, has helped more than 200 couples marry -- from lending the bride a gown to picking up the tab for a modest affair and helping set up their new home with pots, pans and furniture. 
Mrs. Gleitman's shop for needy brides, which opened a few weeks ago, grew out of a fund she started in 1999, shortly before her sister, Claire Kamhi, died of pancreatic cancer. When friends asked to which charity they could donate, Mrs. Gleitman thought of the young couple whose wedding expenses she had just been asked to help defray by her rabbi's wife. 
At the Claire Kamhi Hachnossat Kallah Fund's first breakfast, the response was overwhelming. "The sanctity of marriage was the most important thing in her life," Mrs. Gleitman said of her sister. "Everyone left checks not knowing that there was such a need in the community." 
A year later, Mrs. Gleitman opened a bridal "gemach" in her basement, collecting expensive gowns from brides in her neighborhood who would never take the dresses out of the closet again and recycling them to disadvantaged brides. Based on the Hebrew words gemilat chasadim, meaning the act of helping people, a gemach is a place where the needy can borrow clothing and obtain household goods for little or no cost. 
To generate more money and set an example for her three children, Mrs. Gleitman opened the shop. Claire's Treasures is believed to be the first storefront to emerge from a network of dozens of underground gemachs operating out of Orthodox Jewish homes in the Five Towns, Queens, Brooklyn and recently West Hempstead.
"My goal is so that we can help even more people, and not just Jewish people," Mrs. Gleitman said. 
The storefront location is less embarrassing, Mrs. Horowitz said. "That person feels like they are going to a store and they are going shopping for their stuff and not like they are a charity case who has no other options," Mrs. Horowitz said. "People can come in and look around and be dignified and not feel like they are taking charity."
While Mrs. Gleitman specializes in helping brides, other gemachs offer children's clothing, baby furniture and medical equipment like crutches and wheelchairs. In November, Gigi Bressler opened a special-occasion dress gemach in a spare bedroom of her West Hempstead home, offering barely worn $2,500 outfits to mothers of the bride and groom or the mother of a child celebrating a bar or bat mitzvah for a flat $100 cleaning fee. The proceeds will go to the Young Israel of West Hempstead's community food program. 
Besides wedding gowns, Mrs. Gleitman stocks new Lenox vases and candy dishes, ceremonial silver, toaster ovens, juice makers and picture frames that patrons might otherwise have stuffed into a closet, like the crystal Waterford candlestick that Lorna Jedwab of Lawrence dropped off on a recent afternoon. 
"It was a gift I received," Ms. Jedwab explained. "I have enough of these types of items and instead of recycling it as a gift, I am bringing it into the shop to be sold for the benefit." 
Depending on their needs, Mrs. Gleitman said, brides might get a $100 gift certificate or a free bedroom set. Money generated by other shoppers is funneled back into helping brides. 
"People are sometimes surprised of who is in need," Mrs. Gleitman said. A typical scenario, she said, is the comfortable couple living in a nice home that get divorced, leaving the wife in the sudden position of having to work. Struggling just to make the mortgage payment, she hasn't a clue how to pull off a fancy wedding for her daughter. 
"This kid grew up in a certain lifestyle," Mrs. Gleitman said. "How is the mother supposed to do it by herself when wedding gowns can cost up to $10,000 or more?"
Not to mention the cocktail hour, ceremony and wedding dinner and dance. 
"The norm in our neighborhood would be minimum $75,000," Mrs. Gleitman said, confiding that the true number is embarrassingly higher and a stretch even for the well-to-do.
For $6,000, Mrs. Gleitman said, she can arrange for a basic wedding with a reception for 150 guests. It would not include hors d'oeuvres, she said, and the three-course dinner would be chicken, potato, perhaps a bowl of soup, a smidgen of dessert. 
"It's a one-man band and fake flowers and they can't do more than that," said Mrs. Gleitman, who works out bargain-basement deals with caterers. "The weddings are not in any wedding hall that you read about in the wedding section, that's for sure." 
Starting out is expensive, Mrs. Gleitman said, especially when rents are high and either the bride or groom is still in school. Sometimes a couple can't afford to rent an apartment until they cash in their wedding presents. 
"How can they do it?" said Mrs. Gleitman, who was born in Morocco, grew up poor and is determined to help others because of her own good fortune as a result of her husband, Marc, investing in real estate. "They can't. We help however we can."
Rabbi Simcha Lefkowitz of Congregation Anschei Chesed in Hewlett is on the advisory board that checks whether the couples Mrs. Gleitman wants to help are truly in need. 
"There's tremendous pressure," Rabbi Lefkowitz said. "People think that everybody can afford beautiful weddings of $100,000 or more. There are many families in the community, hardworking families that just can't do this."
Rabbi Lefkowitz said that for some couples what is supposed to be the time of greatest joy becomes the greatest stress because they can't afford to get married. 
"This fund comes to help them at a very important juncture in their lives," Rabbi Lefkowitz said. "They don't have money for the wedding. They have no money for furniture. There is no money to start their life."
When Merrelle Bialestock gets married on Feb. 10 at a catering hall in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in front of 150 guests, she will be wearing a gown that another bride's parents gave to Mrs. Gleitman unworn when the bride found a dress she liked better. 
"It fit me perfectly," said Ms. Bialestock, who came to Mrs. Gleitman's shop in search of a dress because she has eight siblings and said her parents couldn't afford to help with the wedding. "She didn't charge me a drop. All she said I had to do was bring it back so other girls could enjoy it."

HEADLINE: Vintage Crop Of Police Recruits 

BYLINE:  By SHELLY FEUER DOMASH

 BODY:
WITH Nassau County's budget problems and the shrinkage of the county police department, it has been a long wait, but for the firsttime in four years, new recruits -- a class of 48 -- were sworn in last month as members of the Nassau County Police Department. The new recruits took their oaths on Jan. 22 and actually began their six months of training at the police academy a week earlier, ending a hiring drought that stretched back to December 1999. But the fact that they are the first rookies on the force in a while is not the most unusual thing about them. It's this:
 They're old. 
 Older than most rookie police officers, anyway. Their average age is almost 34 and the oldest is 45, an age when officers who were hired fresh out of high school or college are already eligible for retirement on full pension.
A member of the class, one of the two women, has already quit, for what Capt. Wesley van Wallendael, the deputy commander of the police academy, would only describe as "personal reasons." But other members of the class seem gung-ho.
"I have a burning desire," said Ricky Buckshaw, a former deli owner and the 45-year-old graybeard. "I refuse failure. I find too much pain in failure." As for being the oldest in the group, he said: "I have a mother who is 84 years old and thinks she is 20. Age is just a number."
Deputy Inspector John Hunter, the police academy's commander, said the new recruits "will face some challenges in order to meet New York State standards." But he added: "If you look at the fact that these individuals have been on the list for 10 years it shows these individuals have shown strong motivation, and motivation is an extremely important factor in successfully completing the recruit program." 
The remaining 47 are the last to qualify by passing the 1994 police exam. It has already produced 383 officers for Nassau County and 206 for its village police departments, which hire from the same list. 
The 1994 list was valid for 10 years and was due to expire on April 15, so these cadets just got in under the wire. The nail-biting ended in December, when the county notified the 48 that they were about to be invited to the police academy.
Over the last decade they have bided their time; 27 of them joined other law enforcement agencies, including the New York City, Metropolitan Transportation Authority and state courts police departments. The others have been in diverse jobs, including Long Island Rail Road conductor, delivery driver, landscaper, waiter, auto parts manager, interstate mover and account executive. 
The police commissioner, James Lawrence, said he could see no special economic impact on the county from having an unusually old class of police officers.
"I don't think it matters how old they are," he said, discounting the new class's greater susceptibility to illness or injury. "I'm not a physician, but I think if people maintain a certain level of fitness, they naturally would tend to be injured less than someone who didn't."
Because members of this class will be 54, on average, when they reach the minimum 20 years of service required to draw a regular pension, the average pension payout to this class will be lower than if the class were eligible to retire 10 years younger. But Mr. Lawrence said the department would see no savings. 
"I would think that someone who is older probably is not going to live as long as someone younger and probably collect a pension for less time," he said. "But it will have no economic impact on the department. It is the state pension system, not in the department budget."
Mr. Lawrence added that while the recruits may not be as physically fit as they were 10 years ago, they have other strong attributes. "People with this amount of life experience have to be a positive," he said. " "It is all about relationships, dealing with the community, interaction with people, and naturally the older we get the better we get at doing this."
"And," he noted, "they still have to pass the physical test."
Physical fitness standards in the academy follow New York State guidelines. For example, a man between the ages of 20 and 29 must finish a 1.5-mile run in 11 minutes and 58 seconds. For a woman, the qualifying time is 14:15. For cadets in their 30's, the standard is 12:25 for men and 15:14 for women. They are also measured in situps, pushups, pullups, flexibility and trigger-finger strength. Once they pass the physical test, they never have to take it again.
The next batch of county officers -- the county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, has announced plans to hire 405 officers over the next 24 months -- will be drawn from the police exam given in 2002. The list of qualifiers from that exam has not yet been certified by the county civil service commission, which is completing background checks. 
There was no age limit for people hired from the 1994 list, but for the 2002 list, the civil service commission changed the rules so that applicants will have to be under the age of 35 at the time of hire.
Michael Mitchell, one of the new recruits, was single when he first took the police test. Now he is 38 and married with two young children. He said he never lost faith he would get the job, and stayed in shape.
"My mother always said to have patience," he said. "Whatever is good is worth fighting for and is worth waiting on, so I waited and here I am. This is my destiny."

HEADLINE: Fending Off Robin Hood 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
AS they do every year at this time, school superintendents across Long Island have begun crunching numbers to set their annual school budgets. And every year for the last two decades, these calculations have been complicated by the failure of the governor and State Legislature to meet their April 1 deadline to finalize a budget, including the amounts of state aid to each school district.
 But this year, with a court-ordered mandate for a new state aid formula for schools looming on the horizon, the outlook for school districts is especially cloudy. 
 The biggest fear among Long Island school officials is that as the state grapples with school aid reform that state courts have ruled must correct past inequities that denied New York City students a "sound basic education," the wealthy suburbs of Long Island will end up losing their share of the state education pie.
So to make sure the voices of Long Island schools are heard and a Robin Hood approach to the problems of the city's schools is not taken, Nassau and Suffolk school superintendents met on Jan. 21 and put out a joint position paper that urges state officials to hold even the wealthiest school districts harmless as the state aid formula is rewritten. 
The State Court of Appeals has given the state until July to come up with a solution that properly funds the city's schools, but state officials have said that any new state aid formula would have to address the needs of schools throughout the state.
"We have high hopes that a new formula will be good for everybody," said James H. Hunderfund, superintendent of the Commack public schools and president of the Suffolk County School Superintendents Association. "But let's find enough new revenues to cover every district and let's make sure everyone is taxed fairly."
At a meeting of Nassau and Suffolk superintendents last month, just days after Governor Pataki proposed using up to $2 billion in revenue from a new, statewide system of video gambling terminals to pay for additional school aid in future years, superintendents noted that studies have shown that as much as $6 billion would be needed to correct inequities not just in New York City but also in other "high need" districts across the state. The New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, also said last week that he opposed using gambling money to pay for schools because it would be neither stable nor predictable.
"The bottom line is there's got to be another source of revenue and no one wants to be responsible for it," said Charles W. Fowler, superintendent of the Hewlett-Woodmere schools and president of the Nassau County Council of School Superintendents. But state officials must somehow find the money because, he said, school districts on Long Island "are already taxed to the max and communities just can't give more."
While city schoolchildren may have been shortchanged in the past, any new school aid formula must require city taxpayers to finally pay their fair share, Mr. Fowler said. "We need to look at what New York City is doing and to what extent they are taxing themselves," he said.
State aid accounts for roughly 46 percent of New York City's school budget. But the position paper prepared by Nassau and Suffolk school superintendents found that state aid makes up only 26 percent of all school district revenue on Long Island. It also noted that excluding New York City student enrollments, Long Island educates about 26 percent of the state's public school students but receives only 19.9 percent of the state aid to public schools.
In his budget address last month, Mr. Pataki pointedly noted that under his tenure, the city's share of statewide school aid has come to exceed its percent of statewide enrollment.
"It's pretty clear that relative to its capacity to pay, the city doesn't support schools at the same rate as the rest of the state," Mr. Fowler said.
Another main demand in the superintendents' position paper calls for a state aid formula that takes into account regional cost differences. Costs of goods and services on Long Island, the report states, run 50 percent higher than costs in the state's northern tier of counties, its lowest-cost region.
A push to have the state recognize Long Island's higher cost of living when doling out state education dollars has been a focus of the Long Island Association and the Long Island Education Coalition for years.
"It's much more expensive to educate a child downstate than upstate from a cost-of-living standpoint," said Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association. "The same dollar downstate buys you much less than it would upstate."
He said that state officials finally agreed about five years ago to start taking regional cost differences into account when calculating reimbursement formulas for school construction costs. "So Albany already has understood that regional cost factors must be considered, and I think it will translate here as well," Mr. Pally said. "Otherwise, you don't have true equity."
While lobbying for the state to recognize cost and tax differences, the Long Island superintendent's position paper stresses an even-handed approach to school aid reform. "Long Island superintendents are not interested in engaging in regional competition for dollars," the report states. "While others in the state are promoting an atmosphere of divisiveness through flashy public relations campaigns, we believe that the needs of all children in New York State, no matter where they live, should be met through a fair state aid formula."
The divisiveness referred specifically to a glossy poster put out by the Midstate School Finance Consortium, a group of upstate school districts. In bold letters, the poster states, "Unfortunately, Some Kids Just Don't Get it," while each corner of the poster features a picture of a fifth-grade child and the cost of an education in his or her district. The costs and districts selected include: $9,851 in Nyack, on the Hudson; $4,973 in Sherburne-Earlville, a rural district south of Utica; $7,291 in Niagara Falls and $16,668 in Port Jefferson. Gary D. Bixhorn, the superintendent of Eastern Suffolk Boces and the chairman of the committee that drafted the Long Island report, said, "Quite a few people were upset about the implications of that poster." The report states that while the average per-pupil expenditure on Long Island is $13,842, when that figure is adjusted by a cost-of-living index, the figure drops to $9,136, which is below the state median for regionally adjusted pupil expenditures.
But long before serious debate begins over where new education spending will come from and how it will be disbursed among the state's many school districts, state and local officials must first resolve budget questions for the 2004-05 fiscal year.
Long Island school officials said they were hopeful that negotiations on this year's budget and on a new state aid formula would go smoothly. Unlike in past years when Mr. Pataki has proposed major cuts to school aid, forcing state legislators to fight to restore funding, the governor this year has proposed a 1 percent increase -- an additional $147 million -- in education dollars.
Long Island educators said, though, that with salary, pension and insurance payments going up by as much as 8 percent, many school districts will be forced to raise property taxes again unless state legislators can extract more money out of the state budget for schools.
"We're certainly in a better position this year than we were a year ago, when we faced very heavy, drastic cuts," said Mark Schissler, superintendent of the Central Islip schools. "But from our perspective a flat budget from the state is really a negative one because of increases that are out of our control. And if we don't see it from the state, then it gets borne by the individual homeowner."
Superintendents also said that the governor's proposal to use revenue from video lottery terminals, which will start appearing next month at racetracks across the state, to pay for new school aid also provided a promising start to discussions on a new state aid formula. For one thing, they said, it makes clear that the governor intends to find new revenue to increase school spending in high-need districts.
Long Island has nine districts that fall under the state definition of high need, which means that the district's estimated property value and income fall below the level at which it can tax itself enough to pay for a sound basic education. The nine districts are Hempstead, Freeport, Roosevelt and Westbury in Nassau County, and Amityville, Wyandanch, William Floyd, Brentwood and Central Islip in Suffolk County.
But there are many more districts on the Island that consider themselves high need based on their district's property value and income. In fact, 40 districts have joined a consortium of districts known as Refit, an acronym for Reform Educational Financing Inequities Today.
Howard M. Koenig, executive director of Refit, said that even as Mayor Bloomberg and Democratic legislators have already criticized the governor's video gambling proposal as inadequate and regressive because poor people are most likely to use terminals, the projected $2 billion will not be enough. "It's clear to everyone who labors in this vineyard that we can't talk about just a single revenue stream to solve this problem," he said.
So the debate in coming months will likely revolve around the only other broad-based taxes that are available to the state, namely sales, income and corporate taxes.
"It's not going to be easy because nobody wants to raise taxes, but I don't think there's any question that a statewide solution will necessitate finding a significant new revenue source," said Mr. Pally of the Long Island Association.
With state legislators up for re-election this year, a new tax this year is not likely, said Gerald Benjamin, a political scientist who follows state politics closely and is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the State University of New York in New Paltz.
By the time state officials get down to seriously considering some form of new tax revenue some time next year, he said, the economy and the state's fiscal situation will probably be much improved. "Even so, a phasing-in over several years will be necessary because an all-at-once outcome of new revenues is not going to happen," he said.
The debate, he added, will likely revolve around tax bases rather than tax rates. In other words, rather than consider raising the state sales tax, legislators will scour the books looking for what's not currently taxed, like Internet sales, for example. And instead of property tax increases, they may consider taxing properties that are currently not on the tax rolls. 
Since Long Island is one of the state's wealthiest areas and therefore pays some of the highest amounts in annual state income and sales taxes, Long Islanders will likely wind up providing a significant share of any new state tax revenue. But, Dr. Benjamin said, "in general, Long Islanders would probably be hit proportionally."
Whatever state legislators come up with will be better than a property tax increase, said Mr. Schissler, the Central Islip superintendent. "The hope is that they will try to find the broadest-based tax possible, so it affects individuals the least," he said.

Solos and One Threesome
 Passage Theater Company's Solo Flights Festival has a new twist this year. In addition to its usual roster of four solo theatrical events, there will be three solo theater pieces and four musical performances, one of which features a three-person ensemble. 
 The plays, performed by their authors, are "The Man Who Danced With Marlene Dietrich," by Robin Hirsch, a child of Holocaust survivors whose piece is about his family's experience as World War II loomed; "Watermelon -- Git It While It's Hot!!!" by Cecelia Antoinette, a comedy that explores life in a black suburb of Dallas; and "Downloaded and in Denial," by Cynthia Adler, about media spin. Each piece will be performed four times at the festival, which runs from Thursday through Feb. 29. 
The musical performances are by Christine Lavin; Yuri Lane; JoAnne Brackeen; and Vince di Mura, Dan Fabricatore and Kip Rosser in "A Jazz Tribute to the Music of Joni Mitchell and George Harrison." Each runs for one night.
Is there any inconsistency in a solo festival featuring an ensemble? "Part of Passage Theater's mission is to try and bring a variety of artistic events to the Trenton area," said David White, the group's managing director.

From the Bottom Line to Paramus
The Paramus Picture Show, a movie house that seats 300, began presenting live events this past December in addition to its film showings. Next week, on Feb. 13 and 14, it will present three concerts by the David Bromberg Band. The band was originally scheduled to play around that time at the Bottom Line in New York City, but late last month that club announced that it was closing after a rent dispute with its landlord, New York University.
"Paul just lucked out with the timing," said Jennifer Pincus, one of four owners of the Paramus theater, referring to her co-owner and brother-in-law, Paul Casson. She explained that Mr. Casson, a folk and blues aficionado, had no idea about the Bottom Line's closing before he asked Mr. Bromberg to appear.
The Bromberg band concerts are at 8 p.m. Information: (201)845-6112.

Inspired by Challenger
Marlene O'Haire was a freshman at the University of Maryland in College Park when the shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. "We had a shuttle bus on campus, and when I heard the shuttle exploded, I thought it was our bus," she said.
Ms. O'Haire, 36, right, who lives in Jersey City, plays the character of Teacher in Jane Anderson's play "Defying Gravity," which was inspired by the Challenger disaster and the death of Christa McAuliffe, the elementary school teacher on board who perished along with six other astronauts. The play is at the Morris Museum's Bickford Theater in Morristown from Thursday through Feb. 29.
"Defying Gravity" explores the feelings of Teacher's 5-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, as well as those of bystanders, a NASA mechanic, his acrophobic girlfriend and Teacher herself. "The play asks the question, 'Is it worth it to risk your life for progress?"' Ms. O'Haire said.

Jewish History
European Jews seeking economic opportunity began coming to Morris and Sussex Counties in the late 19th century. Many were peddlers, eventually opening storefronts. Beginning in 1903, they also created lively resort communities of hotels and bungalow colonies in Pine Brook and Mount Freedom, a kind of New Jersey borscht belt.
"The Jews of Morris and Sussex: Early Settlers and Synagogues Before World War II," an exhibition at the Jewish Historical Society of MetroWest in West Orange, explores the history of these settlers through photographs and artifacts. The show is at Marantz Art Gallery at the Leon and Toby Cooperman Jewish Community Center in West Orange through Feb. 22. Information: (973)736-3200. Michelle Falkenstein

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
In Defense of Districts Without Schools

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
STEFFI DeCASAS says she does not feel like a school bureaucracy.
 Yes, Ms. DeCasas is the business administrator for the Glen Gardner School District in Hunterdon County. She works with Diane Laudenbach, the district treasurer, who also happens to be the borough's tax collector. 
 For this, she and Ms. Laudenbach -- to name two -- have come into Governor McGreevey's cross hairs. 
"I think it's outrageous that we have 23 school bureaucracies that don't have a single school" the governor said in his State of the State address last month, adding that he planned to eliminate them because they "oversee nothing but their own existence."
True enough, Glen Gardner -- a village of 1,900 residents who live on a 1.6-square-mile slice of suburbia -- has no school of its own and sends more than 200 students to nearby Clinton. On a part-time basis, Ms. DeCasas keeps track of the tuition of her district's 230 students, an average of $8,500 per student a year, and performs other duties.
So although she thinks the governor's intentions are noble, she is convinced that his aim is a little off.
"I do budget development; I handle the transportation, which includes developing routes and dealing with contractors," she said. "I interface with the receiving district regarding discipline problems and parent complaints and just generally work with the receiving district on keeping up to date on our enrollments because we have students who move in and out."
For this, she gets $15,500 a year, which, according to the New Jersey School Boards Association, is about average for officials in districts without schools, known as nonoperating districts. In addition, Ms. Laudenbach, the part-time school treasurer, as required by state law, makes $750 a year. 
"To term them bureaucracies is terribly misleading," said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. "And to consider this property tax relief falls terribly short of the goal of genuine tax reform."
Most administrators like Ms. DeCasas are part-time employees and there are few administrative costs, Mr. Belluscio said. Ms. DeCasas says only 1.5 percent of Glen Gardner's $2.6 million budget goes for administrative costs, which include the salary for her and the treasurer; minimum benefits for her consisting of workers' compensation and unemployment insurance; Board of Education liability insurance; and such operating costs as attorney fees, telephone and postage and the cost of the annual election to approve or disapprove the budget. About 10 percent of the budget goes toward transportation, and the rest to tuition. Her salary also covers her title of secretary to the five-member, unsalaried school board that meets in the borough hall. And she works from an office in her home.
"We don't have overhead," she said.
Nonetheless, Mr. McGreevey, facing a possible $5 billion budget deficit, is including cutting school costs as a way of curbing property taxes, which last year increased an average 6.3 percent statewide. He has directed the state Education Commissioner, William Librera, to eliminate the nonoperating districts as well as devise a plan to require 172 one-school school districts to find ways to consolidate services. 
Even if Ms. DeCasas' job and those of officials in the 22 other districts were to be eliminated tomorrow, state officials acknowledge the savings would be only about $750,000 a year. That's beside the point, said Commissioner Librera.
"In the grand scheme of things, it's not a lot of money, but if you're spending it and don't have to, that's a policy direction that the governor is correct in having me pursue," Mr. Librera said. "The overriding requirement is, should it be spent at all or is there a way it can be better spent?"
As for one-school districts sharing services, James H. Murphy, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, said that most small districts already do, and he noted that median pupil cost in these districts is $10,645 compared with a statewide figure of $10,652 per pupil.
"The small districts are leaders in efficiency," Mr. Murphy said. "They're sharing cafeteria agreements, sharing bus contracts between school districts, sharing financial services in some way. There's a whole litany of agreements that they've very quietly been doing."
Both Mr. Murphy and Mr. Belluscio said the real answer was to reinstate state aid to schools that Mr. McGreevey has cut in the past because of the budget crisis, especially programs that gave schools incentive to find the best ways to consolidate services.
Mr. Librera said his department was aware that some school districts that save money through shared services can serve as models. Rewards and sanctions that the governor called for in his address would prompt districts to keep administrative and noninstructional costs low, he added.
"This is not an issue about bigger is always better," he said. "This is an issue about effectiveness and efficiency." 
Ernest C. Reock Jr., former director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers and an expert in school financing, is applauding the governor's plans. In 1995, Dr. Reock proposed a plan to pare the state's 606 school districts to 287 for a projected savings of $32 million a year in administrative costs and up to $200 million overall. 
"There is no reason why those districts should exist because they do spend money," he said of the nonoperating districts. "They could be accommodated by the other district where the kids are going with practically no additional cost."
He added: "It doesn't matter whether it is a part-time salary, it's a salary. It's a salary that wouldn't have to be paid in the future if you didn't have them."
Mr. Librera said in a telephone interview that it would take about 45 days perhaps to come up with a "sensible alternative" plan that would offer a "clear direction" for nonoperating districts to be eliminated. 
Like many school officials, Frank Chilson, who has been part-time administrator for the Rocky Hill School District in Somerset County for 16 years, questioned whether real savings would result.
Mr. Chilson, who gets a salary of $13,000, recalled that about eight years ago Rocky Hill and the receiving school district, Montgomery, explored the idea of creating a regionalized district. Montgomery is now building a $70 million high school, and Rocky Hill, with its 62 students, is responsible for a small part of the interest payments, he said.
"If we were regionalized, we would be responsible for part of the principal payment of that which would be a sizable amount," he said. 
Mr. Chilson, like some part-time school administrators, has a full-time job in a school district. He is full-time business administrator of the Demarest School District in Bergen County. In addition to his post in Rocky Hill, he has also been part-time business administrator for 26 years of the Millstone School District in Somerset County, which sends 52 students to school in Hillsborough.
"The governor's making it appear as if we're not efficient," Mr. Chilson said. "And in reality, he's going to put a burden on the taxpayers of these two small communities if he forces them to regionalize." 
Dr. Reock agreed that the taxes in the sending district would go up but added that the school region in greneral would benefit. 
"A number of those districts are tax havens where people are paying very little for the schools in general," he said. "It would lower taxes in the entire school region. There would be an equalization of the tax base."
Some officials worry that being absorbed into a larger district will lessen the influence of the sending districts, a consideration that goes to the heart of home rule. Randie Zimmerman, the school board president in Rocky Hill, which has about 600 residents, said, "People in our town like the fact they know who the school board members are. We are very approachable."

HEADLINE: Waterfront Puzzle: Putting the Pieces Together 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: SLEEPY HOLLOW 

 BODY:
EVEN with its buildings gone, the site where General Motors once produced minivans still dominates the landscape here, its concrete foundation stretching to the Hudson River, and a quaint lighthouse that reflects a bygone era.
 This is the town's future, an empty canvas offering nearly 100 acres of prime riverfront real estate in the shadow of the Tappan Zee Bridge. 
 Roseland Property, the New Jersey company selected to develop the site, has devised a plan calling for 1,532 condominiums or apartments, a 150-room hotel, restaurants, a boutique grocery, a fine arts theater and possibly a train station. A "green crescent" of open space curves around the project along the river and connects it with adjacent parkland. The historic lighthouse at the tip of the property sets the tone for the development known as Lighthouse Landing. 
Groups concerned about preservation along the Hudson River say what happens here will have repercussions well beyond the village's borders as old industrial sites along the river in Westchester County and above make way for new opportunities. Along the county's 49 miles of riverfront, towns from Yonkers to Peekskill are looking to develop Hudson River property, not to mention towns across the river in Rockland County and to the north in Putnam County. 
"The General Motors site, in close proximity to some of the most significant cultural and natural resources in Westchester County, is going to be a signature development that will set the tone for what happens both in Westchester and throughout the Hudson Valley," said Ned Sullivan, the president of Scenic Hudson, a river preservation group. "We have an opportunity to make our waterfront a national model of thoughtful development, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the Westchester waterfront for the entire century."
During most of the 20th century, the Hudson's shores were dominated by factories making everything from bricks to cable, carpet to sugar. During those years, as the historian Roger Panetta likes to say, the river was "both a highway and a sewer."
But with the passage of the industrial age and the success of decades of efforts to reclaim the Hudson River, new decisions are necessary. Those decisions, over the next handful of years, will lay down the look of the riverfront for decades to come. 
"We're at a critical juncture," said Alex Matthiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental group formed to protect the Hudson. "Really, good or bad, the decisions that we make today are the ones were going to have to live with for the next century."
But Mr. Matthiessen and others voiced concern that too many towns and villages are going about their development without any kind of overall plan for the waterfront and how it should be utilized. "It's a good news, bad news story," he said. "The good news is there is a concerted effort being made to reclaim the waterfront and use the development to revitalize communities. The problem is that no one has thought about it from a comprehensive standpoint." 
Specifically, he voiced concern over a lack of oversight by both the county and the state and the failure to develop a regional plan showing how much housing will be needed in the future, where such housing should be situated and what are the best locations for green space and recreational opportunities.
"We'd hate to see the equivalent of strip malls along the Hudson River front," he said. "I think a lot of these developers are trying to squeeze as much office, residential and commercial space as possible at the expense of open space." Developers like Roseland say they are working with public officials and environmental groups to integrate their plans with the existing buildings and to avoid overdeveloping areas. Mr. Sullivan of Scenic Hudson estimates that in the next five to eight years the Westchester waterfront will be fully developed, in some cases transforming towns and creating thousands of housing units.
Thirty-seven projects are currently being developed along the Hudson River in Westchester County, 10 of them in Yonkers alone, according to information compiled by the county's Department of Planning. The developments will cover about 300 acres and create nearly 4,400 units of housing. They range from a 16-unit development in Ossining called Birches to the Lighthouse Landing project in Sleepy Hollow with its more than 1,500 units. "Now is the time for us to work with citizens, public officials and developers to ensure that public access to the river is secured at every development," Mr. Sullivan said.
Although the county has no veto power over what localities do with their land, planning officials said they are working with towns and villages with the hope of securing public access within a diverse mix of housing, business and cultural opportunities. Also playing a role is a voluntary group of 13 villages and cities that make up the Historic River Towns of Westchester, an organization formed 10 years ago to promote economic development and regional identity.
Beyond monitoring the development projects, county officials are working on the 46.6-mile RiverWalk, which they say gives the county a good chance to play a role in the process. "The approach is how do we put the pieces together and make sense," said Jerry Mulligan, county planning commissioner noting that the county has tried to provide a road map for growth through documents like "Patterns for Westchester," which looks at land use and growth.
As for the riverfront, there are a multitude of questions to explore: how will traffic be affected, particularly along already gridlock-prone Route 9? Have opportunities for mass transit been explored? How much open space will there be? What will be the mix of homes and businesses? Have the county's numerous historic and natural resources been protected? 
In these and other questions, a number of visions must be considered. Groups like Scenic Hudson and Riverkeeper strive to secure public access as an organization like the Historic Hudson Valley focuses on the county's treasure trove from the past. Municipalities that have been struggling to make up revenues lost as industry died see an opportunity to increase their tax base, and soaringproperty values open the door to every developer's dream.
Mr. Matthiessen put public access at the top of his list for priorities in developments. But another perspective comes from Martin Ginsburg, whose Ginsburg Development Companies, based in Hawthorne, has at least three projects in the works along the river, and wants to bring people back to the river, but with an eye toward tourism and the creation of a vast array of shops, restaurants and inns.
"Almost all the communities recognize that tourism would be beneficial, but they've done very little create a place where tourists want to go," he said. "There are cruise ships that go up the Hudson but they go rarely because there are no places to stop."
He notes that the development he is creating in Haverstraw, across the river from Ossining, will have the first port of call on the Hudson River. 
In Westchester, projects include a waterfront development in Tarrytown that calls for a recreation center and swimming pool, esplanade, shops and housing as well as a new Village Hall. In addition to the G.M. site in neighboring Sleepy Hollow, the Ginsburg Development Company has plans for 44 town houses in what he calls "Ichabod's Landing," on 3.5 acres adjacent to General Motors site. Farther north in Peekskill, Mr. Ginsburg's company is developing what it calls Riverbend, 201 luxury condos on a milelong stretch of the Hudson.
In Irvington, a new commercial development is under construction just north of the Scenic Hudson Park, and Hastings-on-Hudson will most likely find itself weighing proposals once the former site of the Anaconda Wire and Cable Company is cleaned up by the Atlantic Richfield Company, which now owns the property. 
Mayor John A. Perillo of Ossining said the village is finalizing plans on a project by the developer Louis R. Cappelli. The project, Harbor Square, calls for 127 condos and about 10,000 square feet of retail space. 
The project has been controversial, with elections being won and lost over the issue. Mayor Perillo was voted into office in 2002 after promising to have a referendum on the project. Once elected, however, he backed away from the promise and worked with Mr. Cappelli to have the size of the project reduced and a tax abatement rescinded.
"When I came into office it was an apartment building with residence for 180 tenants," Mr. Perillo said. "A very box-type building with really no architectural flair."
Through talks with the developer, he said they have been able to scale the plans to 127 units, six-story buildings instead of nine story ones and no tax abatement (the previous agreement included a 66 percent tax abatement). Mr. Perillo said he had no choice but to negotiate with the developer because the former board had negotiated a deal that left the town legally bound to the developer.
"I'm trying to make lemonade out of lemons," he said. But bitter opposition to the project persists. Tom Langley, a member of the Ossining Waterfront Alliance, a group formed to fight the project, said the plan has been negotiated behind closed doors without the promised waterfront committee established to focus on the community's desires.
The group has pledged to battle the development in court. "The fight is far, far, far from over," he said.
In contrast, the project in Sleepy Hollow has been a much more open process.
"This is not like where, if you remember the old movie with Charlton Heston, Moses comes down with the tablets and lays down the law," said Philip Zegarelli, mayor of Sleepy Hollow. "Lots of developers come in and say their tablets are their plan. We right off the bat said you ain't going to do that. We're going to sit down and tell you what we think ought to go there."
Many environmental and historic groups have been party to the process as has the community and the county.
In Sleepy Hollow, none of the buildings are to be more than four stories high, leaving open views to the river from the bluffs overlooking the site. 
"There will be no fences, no barriers," Mr. Zegarelli said. "That to me is a key ingredient to what I think will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the people of Sleepy Hollow to see what can be done with redeeming the waterfront." 
Jonathan Stein, partner in charge of the development at Roseland, said that the project includes 200 units marked specifically for the elderly, with 100 of those affordable housing, and that the population density is well under town zoning requirements.
Still, there are concerns. River advocates suggest that the number of housing units should be far fewer, 700 to 1,000, and continue to lobby Roseland to leave 30 percent or more of the site open for green space. Currently, a little more than 25 percent is open space.
Mr. Stein noted that a significant amount of building will have to be done to link the existing village with the lighthouse project, including the construction of streets and sidewalks. He said that the village, along with groups like Scenic Hudson and the state, had been part of the process to determine how the old and the new should be linked.
"There has been a lot of effort to coordinate with the community and other developers," Mr. Stein said, adding that the efforts continue. 
Besides questions about how much open space should remain, the density of development and public access, questions also arise about what the developments should look like.
"One of my objections is that the new waterfronts will be a homogenized residential community with no market no connection to the history that preceded it, " Mr. Panetta said. "There are architectural reminders, there are local histories that need to be preserved. This is the moment to do it because that history is disappearing."
River advocates say they are encouraged that public discussions are taking place. Taking the long view, they say these discussions may mean that there is a better chance that what is ultimately built will be better than what happened 100 years ago.
"We're at a moment on the Hudson as we turn the corner into a new century," said Deborah Meyer DeWan, the director of the Riverfront Communities program with Scenic Hudson, "where we're clearly poised to take the best of the history and the lessons we've learned into a new dimension -- one that celebrates and connects people with the river once again in a way that is environmentally sound, economically viable and culturally rich."

A Walk Up the River, Skirting Sing Sing
MANY hurdles stand in the way of Westchester County's plan for a RiverWalk along the Hudson River: the Indian Point nuclear plant, for instance, as well as miles and miles of active railroad hugging the shoreline, big swaths of private land, steep terrain and gritty abandoned industrial sites. But probably the most harrowing challenge to the 46.6-mile RiverWalk plan was the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a state maximum security prison in Ossining. 
Charting the potential route from aerial maps, county planning officials saw a slim tract of land running along the prison on the waterfront side.
Armed with a camera, they went to document what was there. Instead, they encountered an irate prison guard who demanded the film from their digital camera, which they dutifully had to delete, frame by frame. 
"We abruptly said, 'Let's reroute around the prison on the inland side,"' said Paul Gisondo, an associate planner with the county who worked with a field team planning the path. 
County Executive Andrew J. Spano has made a goal of the creation of the trail way, which will run from Cortlandt at the Putnam County border to Yonkers at the border of New York City. He touts the idea as an opportunity to increase access to the river, to promote tourism and to generate business. 
"I think RiverWalk is one of those projects that enables us to work with communities to identify where local, county or state parks can be tied together to create a continuous trail way," said Jerry Mulligan, the county commissioner of planning.
County planners said it could take as long as 10 years for the project to be completed, but sections of it will be opened as they are ready. Eighteen miles of trail way are already in place as part of existing parks, like the Old Croton Aqueduct, and seven miles are in design or under construction. On the Westchester shoreline, the railroad uses or abuts some 21 miles of the riverfront. Eight miles is either active or former industrial property, three miles belong to institutions ranging from the Veterans Administration Hospital to Lyndhurst, a property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the rest is a mix of private lands in commercial, recreational or residential use. 
To put the RiverWalk plan into effect, myriad issues will have to be resolved, including the fate of the Yonkers Paddling and Rowing Club, a 120-year-old group that uses a boathouse in Yonkers that the county would like to remove to make way for the path, which will run through Habirshaw Park, a park the county is creating nearby.
"We can't get through there with that building in place," Mr. Mulligan said.
The county owns the land and sent letters to the club that it needs to clear its belongings out of the Alexander Street boathouse by Feb. 15. Local and county officials have been meeting to resolve the issue and are hopeful that solutions will be found.
Bob Morrow, club commodore, said Yonkers officials had assured him that the club will not have to leave by Feb. 15. Club members say a rowing club is the perfect use for the site and for the boathouse, which they have used for about 70 years.
Mr. Mulligan said the county isn't arguing that the use isn't perfect. The problem, he said, was that the club, which is semiprivate, has had six years to find another location so that the way can be cleared for greater public access to the area.
Mr. Morrow notes that the county plans to put a 12-foot fence around Habirshaw Park so it can be closed to the public at certain times and that actually the boathouse would be one of the last points of public access if that happens.
"Ultimately, the county, city and the club all want people to enjoy more access to the Hudson River," said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a county legislator from Yonkers, who has entered the talks. "With that as the shared vision, it shouldn't be hard to get everyone together and working to achieve the desired goals." BARBARA WHITAKER

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Super Bowl Economics; 
Incremental Analysis, With Two Yards to Go

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
THE academic paper that David Romer began writing two years ago did not look like something that could determine the outcome of a Super Bowl. Sure, it was an analysis of whether professional football teams punt more often than is rational, but it seemed intended mainly for the amusement of sports fans who happen to be professors. 
 Professor Romer, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, used the phrases "Bellman equation" and "dynamic-programming analysis" -- in the paper's title, no less. His footnotes cited work published in Econometrica, Cognitive Science and other publications that are not exactly must-reads in N.F.L. locker rooms. 
 But when his conclusion -- teams punt too much -- began getting attention last summer, a reporter asked Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots, about the paper.
"I read it," he said, according to The Boston Herald. "I don't know much of the math involved, but I think I understand the conclusions and he has some valid points."
Upon hearing that, Professor Romer's jaw dropped, he said. His paper was available only on his Berkeley Internet site, emlab.berkeley.edu/users/dromer, and the site of a group called the National Bureau of Economic Research.
But the most interesting development was yet to come. Two weeks ago, facing a fourth down in the Patriots' own territory on the very first drive of the game -- a sure punting situation in the N.F.L. -- Belichick decided to go for a first down and made it. The Patriots soon scored a touchdown and were on their way to today's Super Bowl, against the Carolina Panthers.
Football analysts immediately called the decision an instance of a coach's instinct triumphing over cold analysis. In fact, Professor Romer said last week, Belichick seemed to be "throwing gut instinct out the window and going on analysis." The information is right there in Figure 5 of the economist's paper: on fourth and 1 on your own 44-yard line, the potential benefit of keeping the drive going outweighs the cost of giving the opponents good field position. 
The coach may not have not been thinking about Professor Romer's paper at that moment, but he has clearly adopted the methods of a social scientist in a way that few other sports coaches have. Belichick, who majored in economics at Wesleyan University, approaches his job much the way a financial analyst pores over a balance sheet. He seems to view every decision as a chance to perform better cost-benefit analysis than his peers do. Richard Miller, a Wesleyan economist with whom the coach remains in touch, calls the approach "incremental analysis." In plain English, it involves looking for subtle differences in one small area that can affect an entire system, whether that system is a company, a stock market or a football game.
Consider the Patriots' behavior when they need just a couple of yards for a first down or a touchdown. No other team ran the ball more often in those situations this season, according to Football Outsiders, an Internet site that analyzes statistics, even though the Patriots are considered to have one of the weaker running games in the league.
The numbers still favor the strategy because running is far more effective in gaining a few yards than passing is. Yet many other teams including the Giants and Jets, which together won four fewer games than New England this year, tried many ineffective pass plays, in an effort to surprise the defense. It's a little like surprising your opponent in chess by letting him capture your queen. 
Belichick also seems to understand an idea that economists call "hyperbolic discounting," which holds that people tend to place too much value on the here and now. Taking advantage of this, the team made two trades during last year's draft that essentially swapped a lower pick in 2003 for a higher one in 2004, noted Aaron Schatz, the editor of Football Outsiders. The Patriots will now enter this spring's draft holding many more high picks than a Super Bowl team typically does. 
And Professor Romer's paper is not the only ivory-tower research that has made its way into the coach's head. After Harold Sackrowitz, a Rutgers statistician, was quoted in The New York Times and elsewhere saying that teams try for a two-point conversion too often after scoring a touchdown, he received a call from Ernie Adams, the Patriots' football research director and a friend of Mr. Belichick's since they attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., together. The research director sent Professor Sackrowitz a copy of the team's chart telling coaches when to go for two points, and the statistician critiqued it. "Nobody had any real interest other than the Patriots," said Professor Sackrowitz, who now roots for them in addition to the Giants and Jets. New England did not try a single two-point conversion this year.
In the end, none of these moves is nearly as important as designing a defensive strategy or drafting good players. But Belichick's hyper-efficient approach almost certainly gives his team a small advantage in a game that can easily be decided by minor differences. 
The approach has also altered the course of Professor Romer's research. When talking about the Berkeley economist's paper this year, Belichick noted that it did not consider the emotional effect that failing on fourth down could have on a team.
Once Professor Romer read that, he ran the analysis again to see whether teams performed worse after being stopped on fourth down. They did not, just as most economists would expect. Come tomorrow, when Belichick will have some time on his hands, he can read the details on the professor's Web site.

HEADLINE: The Nation: State by State; 
Here And There, Recovery Is Uneven

 BODY:
THE economy is a crucial issue this election season as the nation shakes off the effects of a recession. But a look at the seven states holding primaries and caucuses Tuesday shows there is not one economy, but many.
 National and international trends interact with local strengths and weaknesses to create a mosaic of economic health, as a survey by Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa., that follows regional trends, indicates. 
 States dependent on manufacturing are struggling. Those ahead of the game in the high-tech field have strong prospects. The whims of federal spending can have a huge impact. 
Here is the outlook of the seven states.

ARIZONA

Delegates at stake: 55
The economy is expanding, helped by defense-related manufacturing, exports and tourism. A potential surge in biotech activity could be significant. A diverse roster of high-tech industries make the state well-positioned for the information economy. Population growth and low business costs are helping to bring businesses in. The state is an important entry point for immigrants, which, in some ways, drives economic growth, but also weighs on the state's fiscal health because of high poverty rates.

DELAWARE

Delegates at stake: 15
The economy is stabilizing. Manufacturing is a drain, but it is a smaller portion of the overall job base than in the nation as a whole. Consumer finance companies, law firms and other professional services are proving strong. Also helping: low business costs, above-average incomes and an influx of new residents.

MISSOURI

Delegates at stake: 74
It has one of the worst economies in the nation. Still mired in recession, the state is saddled with older industries. Auto manufacturers are losing ground, hurt by the relatively high pension and production costs that are characteristic of the Midwest. It has strong defense spending. Decisions on contracts for Boeing could help make or break a recovery.

NEW MEXICO
Delegates at stake: 26
It has one of the best performing economies in the country, with unusually consistent employment growth. Health care is a principal source of growth. Strong population gains have increased demand for housing, fueling construction activity. Intel, one of the largest contributors to manufacturing output in the state, is leading a high-tech recovery. A limited supply of water continues to be a hurdle. Helping: An influx of retirees, strong growth in the labor force and low business costs.

NORTH DAKOTA

Delegates at stake: 14
The economy is stable. Job creation is proceeding slowly. Prospects for high-tech industries appear promising, partly because of the construction of a manufacturing plant at North Dakota State University's Research and Technology Park. It will produce radio-frequency identification tags for the Defense Department and private industry. Dependence on federal spending, agriculture, as well as poor demographic trends, will limit long-term growth.

OKLAHOMA

Delegates at stake: 40
Conditions are weak but firming. Government job cuts are weighing on the economy, while consumer-related industries suffer from weak household cash flow. There is an absence of higher-skill positions. Expected military base closings in 2005 could create major difficulty. High-tech industries will stabilize, but Texas has become the region's technology epicenter.

SOUTH CAROLINA

Delegates at stake: 45
Tough times. Personal bankruptcies per household are at an all-time high and continue to climb. The jobless rate is above the national average and is rising. The struggles of the textile industry are acting as a drag. Growth will primarily depend on a continued shift away from low value-added manufacturing to durables, as well as technology and services. The Port of Charleston is benefiting from rising U.S.-China trade volumes.

HEADLINE: A Powerful Resume Speaks To an Employer. Grins, Too. 

BYLINE:  By LOUISE KRAMER

 BODY:
WHEN Rob Kittay's twins were born three and a half years ago, he decided to look for a job with a steady paycheck and health benefits.
 Mr. Kittay, a self-employed sales consultant who has sold everything from license plates in Guatemala to credit card services in Israel, had little luck with a traditional resume. He sent 1,000 of them to prospective employers, and landed only six interviews. 
 Then he tried a video resume. Out of 20 he e-mailed in six months, he got 20 responses. One led to a job offer, from ComTech21, a telecommunications management company in Wallingford, Conn.
"It's a very simple and unobtrusive way to stand out," said Mr. Kittay, 37.
Video resumes are starting to emerge as a new weapon for job hunters. The videos range from 20-second presentations of a job applicant candidate directly addressing the camera to four-minute mini-movies replete with graphics and photo montages. Some job seekers spend pennies to make simple home videos; a higher-quality video can cost several thousand dollars. 
In addition to helping certain job seekers stand out, video resumes can help employers faced with a huge pile of applications narrow the field without wasting time on first interviews. Still, the top-quality videos can be out of reach for some unemployed professionals. And some employment service companies have resisted the innovation, saying they are concerned that video resumes could expose employers to charges of discrimination in hiring.
While there are no measures of the precise number of video resumes in circulation, a study conducted for Reel Biography, a New York production company that recently started making video resumes, found that they have so far been used mostly by actors, aspiring news broadcasters and high school athletes applying to colleges, that is, positions that are judged in great measure by appearances.
Still, use of this new job hunting tool is likely to increase over time, said John A. Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the global outplacement firm. "I think it will become widely used, but its wide use is a decade away probably as video technology moves to the mainstream," he said.
A video resume "is still an unconventional tool but it could develop quickly," said Jennifer Schramm, manager of workplace trends and forecasting for the Society for Human Resource Management, a national trade group based in Alexandria, Va. "This might become the same sort of thing as Internet dating."
Job seekers and employers both say that video clips save on time and travel costs, and can be especially helpful for candidates who do not sparkle on paper but shine in real life. 
AC Lion, a Manhattan recruiting firm that specializes in sales positions for financial services, technology and Internet companies, started sending its clients videos of job candidates along with traditional resumes in 2001. The added service has helped candidates stand out, said Daniel Goldsmith, the firm's managing director. 
James Kwiatkowski, executive vice president for sales and marketing for FutureTrade, a provider of technology services to financial institutions, said he engaged AC Lion specifically because of the videos. He said videos helped him weed out candidates before rounds of initial interviews. "In the first five minutes of an interview you know it is not someone you are going to hire," he said. 
Tara Farbent, 26, was working as a temporary sales representative for Binney & Smith, the crayon manufacturer, when she made a video at AC Lion to help with her search for work in her preferred field of finance.
In the video, against a plain backdrop, she peers into the camera and ticks off her experience. "I consider myself well versed in training and I look forward to meeting you," she says.
AC Lion e-mailed the video to the Relegence Corporation, a financial information company; she was then offered a position as an account manager there. "I was lucky," Ms. Farbent said. "This was the first one I used it for and I got the job." Now, she recommends videos to friends.
At the high end of the market, Reel Biography last fall started producing profiles of senior-level professionals who are looking for work. Mr. Kittay was one of the company's test subjects.
His video resembles a professional television newsmagazine segment, complete with studio lighting and camera-friendly makeup for the star. Names and logos of Mr. Kittay's client companies scroll up the screen like movie credits. The tape cuts to an image of the license plates he sold in Guatemala, and zeros in on its picture of a quetzal, the national bird. "I am subtly aggressive," Mr. Kittay says in a gentle voice. "I know that asking for the sale is the most important thing."
Marco Greenberg, founder of Reel Biography, said that so far he had made video resumes free as part of a test,but he plans to charge up to $2,000, depending on the complexity of the production.
Swapjobs.com in Tampa, Fla., represents the other end of the video resume spectrum. The company has shot videotapes of nearly 10,000 job hunters in the last two and a half years at more than 30 employment fairs and then posts the tapes on its Web site along with a candidate's written resume. A six-month posting costs $89.
Michael Patrino, president and co-founder of Swapjobs, said he expected video resumes to represent 40 percent of his business in two years, up from 10 percent now, as video technology on the Internet improves. 
Not everyone is optimistic about video resumes. Dale Winston, chief executive of Battalia Winston, an executive recruiting firm in Manhattan, said nothing replaces a face-to-face meeting for top-level executives. "There's an opportunity for these videos to be too cute," she said. 
Then there are the concerns about discrimination. Marcel Legrand, senior vice president for strategic research and planning at Monster.com, the Internet employment site, said some employers feared video resumes could put them at risk for discrimination charges.
"Let's say I'm an Hispanic-American," Mr. Legrand said. "If I don't get the job, I can theoretically claim that I didn't get it because I have an accent."
Monster.com looked into posting video resumes on its widely used site and decided against it because of such issues, Mr. Legrand said.
But some employers who have seen video resumes say these concerns are unlikely to keep the new job search tools from spreading. Brendan Deakin, the hiring manager at ComTech21 who offered the position to Mr. Kittay, is one. "What is the difference in making a judgment in person or via a video resume?" he said. "This technology helped me get a feel for what type of person the candidate was."

HEADLINE: When Jobs Flee: Cost and Benefit 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Education Is No Protection," by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 26): 
 The subject of outsourcing is more complex, and the real costs are higher, than the numbers alone suggest. 
Any corporate executive weighing offshore outsourcing must consider the political, economic and social environments. 
 Not very long ago, it was feared that India and Pakistan, among the potential providers of labor, would fire nuclear weapons at each other. Russia remains plagued by internal terrorism, political and business corruption, and badly enforced or inadequate laws. China, perhaps more stable but also more repressive, fails to respect intellectual property rights. 
So the executive must ask: If this issue were about capital other than labor, would I want to invest in these countries?
Of course, this discussion assumes that he or she is willing to outsource jobs in the first place -- which means giving up the advantages of an in-house staff of trained, known and accountable information professionals, who, once dispersed, would take years to replace.

HEADLINE: Despite Promise of Easy Money, Indian Casinos Meet Resistance 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Connecticut's two large Indian casinos pump $400 million into state and local treasuries each year, but so many residents dislike the casinos that the state's legislature repealed the law that allowed them to be built.
 In New York, Buffalo has a shot at a new casino to help revive its sagging downtown and bring in new cash. But residents oppose the idea. 
 And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell has promised lower property taxes if slot machines are allowed at racetracks in the state, but the measure to permit the machines is still bottled up in the General Assembly. 
 Throughout the Northeast and across the country, casinos hold out the promise of easy money to balance budgets, cut taxes and increase school spending, yet in an odd inversion of the usual public eagerness for new investment and more jobs, opposition to the casino industry is, if anything, picking up strength, particularly where casinos already exist.
 It is a situation Mayor Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo knows well. He has been working for more than two years to attract an Indian casino already authorized by the State Legislature for his city or for surrounding Erie County, but voters in public opinion polls and those he meets on the street oppose it.
 "What is shocking to me is that if you had any other company that was going to employ 2,500 people and pay them $30,000 a year and up and generate millions of dollars in private investment, people would be falling all over them," Mayor Masiello said in an interview. "I don't know what the big deal is."
 Nowhere is the anti-casino sentiment stronger than in Connecticut, where officials from Gov. John G. Rowland on down are in an uproar over the Bureau of Indian Affairs' decision last week to grant federal recognition to the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation of Kent. The Schaghticokes (pronounced SKAT-a-cokes) have not yet said they want a casino, only "economic development." But few officials doubt that they will want their own casino on the New York border. As a newly sovereign tribe, they are beyond the reach of state and local controls, and under federal law are able to force Connecticut to negotiate a casino compact with them if other forms of gambling are allowed in the state.
 Last year, the Connecticut General Assembly repealed the state's charity gambling law, which had allowed Indian tribes to build casinos and churches and other charitable endeavors to raise money by holding Las Vegas nights. But Governor Rowland has said he will appeal the recognition of the Schaghticokes just the same, a statement that tribal leaders interpret as anti-Indian, not anti-casino or anti-gambling. 
 "It's very unfortunate they took a people who are one of the first families of the state and turned this into a gaming issue," Richard L. Velky, the chief of the Schaghticokes, said of the governor and his staff. "They don't care about our culture, history or survival. It's bordering on racist."
 A major element driving the opposition to Indian casinos, particularly where they already exist, is the question of Indian sovereignty. There is the perception that a huge financial windfall is going to people who many believe are not any different from society at large, or have not suffered disproportionately, said Bennett Liebman, coordinator of the program on racing and wagering at Albany Law School. 
 "You have a number of issues among opponents, but one is a belief that it is unfair because most of the benefits go to a group that has not earned it," Mr. Liebman said. "In spite of what casinos may be paying to the state, it seems very little compared to the benefits they give to a very few tribal members."
 When the tribes are not part of the gambling debate, popular attitudes toward existing casinos are more favorable, as in New Jersey, where the Atlantic City casinos are commercial ventures that are taxed, regulated and audited in a way that tribal casinos could never be.
 A 1999 poll of New Jersey residents by the Quinnipiac Polling Institute found widespread approval of Atlantic City casino gambling, both for the hundreds of millions of dollars it pays to the state, and because the big resorts are perceived as improving the state's national image. 
 But this is not necessarily the case in upstate New York. The Oneida Indian Nation's Turning Stone Casino in Verona is just about the only business generating new jobs and income, but the Oneidas' sovereignty, including their exemption from zoning laws and their tax-free gas and cigarette sales, has produced a strong anti-casino, or anti-Indian, reaction, although hardly a universal one. 
 "Truthfully, we have people on both sides of the line," said Peter F. LaMacchia, a professor of gaming and casino management at Morrisville State College outside Syracuse and a consultant for Turning Stone and other casinos. Despite the more than 3,000 people Turning Stone has hired, and the millions of dollars the Oneidas have paid to friendly local governments in lieu of taxes, Professor LaMacchia said he thought that a referendum to close the casino would have a 50-50 chance of passing.
 "I believe it's because the gaming industry is misunderstood," he said. "We still have this mystique about us."
 The president of the Connecticut Alliance Against Casino Expansion, Jeff Benedict, maintained in an interview that morality has little do to with the gambling debate anymore. "It used to be that politicians would not touch gambling because it was morally stigmatized, but that's not true anymore," Mr. Benedict said. "The stigma now is political: do you want to be associated with an industry that has literally trampled on the rights of voters and the community in which it lives? The answer is no, and voters are taking that message to the politicians more and more."
 According to the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, there were 45 efforts to introduce or expand gambling in 30 states last year, and all but three of them failed. New Jersey's governor, James E. McGreevey, backed away from a proposal to put slot machines in racetracks, and in Maine, while voters in Bangor approved slot machines at a local track, residents of Saco and Westbrook rejected slots at their horse track in December.
 But the biggest gambling initiatives in the New York region are still moving ahead, and apparently with broad public support. Slot machines were recently installed at the Saratoga racetrack, and the Seneca Indians in western New York will soon open their second of the six Indian casinos that Gov. George E. Pataki plans for the state. In Pennsylvania, Governor Rendell has said he is confident that he can break the legislative logjam that is holding up his plans to install slot machines at eight tracks and to allow four new casinos, including two in Philadelphia, which he believes could produce $600 million to $1 billion a year in property and wage tax reductions.
 And in Maryland, Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., worried about losing revenues to the slot machines already installed at Delaware racetracks, hopes to install slots at four tracks and perhaps build casinos with slots along Interstate 95.
 Two polls by Quinnipiac University in 2002 showed broad public support for the new casinos in New York and Pennsylvania when their income was tied to school financing or tax relief, and another poll found support in Maryland for Governor Ehrlich's plans.
 Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, said opinion polls do not predict the outcomes of fights over gambling.
 "You will find when a governor talks about gambling for education or for property tax relief, he gets poll support because he's only talking about the benefit," Mr. Grey said. "But when we start talking about the cost, we win, as we did in Maine and in Alabama. That's why polls don't scare us off the battlefield."

HEADLINE: Two Different Approaches To Illegal Immigrants 

 BODY:
In his Soapbox essay "... and Citizenship for Latinos" Jan. 25 , the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez asks for citizenship for every Latino immigrant. 
I believe every legal immigrant, no matter what nationality, should be encouraged to become a citizen.
 However illegal immigrants, called undocumented workers by Mr. Ramirez, should not be allowed to have amnesty or become citizens. These people have knowingly broken the law by entering and staying in this country. Illegal immigrants take away thousands of entry-level jobs that could otherwise go to unemployed American citizens. Additionally, allowing illegal immigrants to stay makes those who wait years to immigrate legally to this country look like fools. 
 Any country has to be able to control its borders. Allowing illegal immigrants to enter and stay in this country is irrational.

Coming Attraction: A New, Old Drive-In

BYLINE:  By Robert Strauss

 BODY:
The state that spawned the drive-in movie craze during the Great Depression may well be the one bringing it back in the 21st century.
 Developers got zoning and site-plan approval for rehabilitating the old Delsea Drive-In in Vineland. 
Although the Delsea has been closed for 16 years and its concession stand and ticket booth are a tangle of overgrown trees, rusted metal and cracking concrete, the big screen is still intact and ready to roll. 
 "We're looking to possibly have the drive-in open by this summer," said Bob Olivio, co-owner of Venture Realty in Vineland, who said he is helping put together the deal for 4D's, a development partnership there. "It will be a family-oriented facility, and I think we'll do well." 
Mr. Olivio said the 17-acre site would also have a 23,000-square-foot indoor skateboard park and a family-style restaurant. The drive-in, which once had more than 500 spaces, will be cut to 334. And although the developers plan to keep the old speaker stands for nostalgia's sake, the refurbished drive-in will employ new technology and allow patrons to hearmovies on their car radios. The concession stand and ticket booth will have to be rebuilt, but the old 50's-style sign out front along Delsea Drive will be dusted off and cleaned up.
The project will cost about $1.8 million, he said, with the Urban Enterprise Zone guaranteeing a 3 percent loan to cover a third of that.
When it comes to New Jersey and drive-ins, it seems that everything old is new again. Last year, the owners of the Wall Speedway in Wall Township announced plans to open a drive-in next to the speedway track this summer. Of course, the nation's first drive-in was erected in 1933 in Pennsauken. Robert Strauss

No Rocking Chair; Instead, an Adventure

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: EASTCHESTER 

 BODY:
DON and Kathleen Gold covered their furniture with sheets last summer, packed what they could fit into the back of their Honda and drove four days east from Centerville, Utah, to Westchester County, setting off with high hopes on a journey that might surprise other retirees. 
 They began their new job, which Mr. Gold calls "a spiritual high adventure," in August, as volunteers helping maintain 48 apartments rented by the younger "elders," the name used to refer to all acting male missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, serving an area from Chinatown to Kingston, N.Y., and from Monticello, N.Y., to Danbury, Conn. 
 The Golds are also missionaries, but they are not in their late teens or early 20's, like most of the 60,000 elders and sisters -- as they are called -- that the Mormon church sends out annually to encourage others to join their faith. Mr. Gold is 78 and Mrs. Gold is 62, and they have 29 grandchildren. They are elder elders, and the New York North mission, which includes Westchester County, is the host to a dozen such senior elder couples. There are about 4,200 such senior elders at work around the world each year, according to Scott Trotter, a spokesman for the church on the East Coast. 
The Bronx and lower Westchester "stake" -- the equivalent of a diocese -- is growing: it has almost 4,500 members, about 20 percent more than it did just five years ago, which church officials say is about the same rate of growth experienced nationwide. The Mormon chapel in Scarsdale will be celebrating its 50th anniversary this fall, and there is also a storefront church in Yonkers. Groundbreaking is scheduled this month for a chapel to be built in New Rochelle, and a proposal for a larger temple in Harrison has received all the necessary town board approvals, but construction permits cannot be issued until a sewer main to serve the building can be built under the Hutchinson River Parkway. 
The younger elders go door to door or talk to people in the subways and on the streets in search of converts. Charles Carr, 67, a Mormon elder and retired lawyer from Idaho Falls, who is also working here, said: "Seniors generally are not out to do that kind of contacting. They'll get a referral. It's partly a difference in energy."
The Golds and others like them, who pay their own way for the 18 months or so they are in the area, are more likely to teach classes to new members or chaperon missionaries making visits to single people, to avoid any appearance of impropriety. They also share their experiences with prospective converts who are facing difficult situations the younger missionaries may not have encountered. 
"We are visiting a sister who just lost her husband in March," Mrs. Gold said, explaining that both she and her husband had lost their first spouses after long marriages. "Because we'd both already experienced that, we had empathy with that. And as we teach the Gospel I can say, 'This helped us."' The Golds are used to living among lifelong Mormons, and they are moved by the fervor of recent converts; they could name 17 new members in the church's Harlem branch since their arrival. 
"They ask Sister Gold how do I pray, or do tithing or fasting," Mr. Gold said. "It just touches our hearts."
Mrs. Gold said of the converts: "Life is full of a lot of trial for these people, especially here in New York, where there's a very hectic lifestyle. They find inner peace, and come to grips with the fact that they're doing something good with their lives." 
Mr. Carr said the elder couples in the mission work with 175 young missionaries. More typically there would be six older couples in a mission. Some are doing specialized work, working with contractors on the construction of the Manhattan temple being built across from Lincoln Center, arranging employment opportunities for Mormons in the city, and working in public affairs. Another couple are in charge of the 35 cars owned by the church and used in the northern parts of the mission.
Mr. Carr handles the finances and pays the bills for the missionaries, and his wife, Carole, 64, puts missionaries in touch with people who have expressed interest in Mormonism by calling for free advertised materials like a Book of Mormon, videos or recordings of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. 
At the headquarters of the mission in Eastchester, Mr. Carr said he was struck by the diversity he saw in the Scarsdale congregation, which serves Yonkers and Tarrytown, among other communities. The missionaries teach in English, American Sign Language, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and Portuguese.
"You have some economically very well-off people and people who are dirt poor," he said, his hands folded, church-and-steeple fashion. "To see these people from such backgrounds and diversity -- doctors, lawyers, some who have never had a job -- to see them blend together is interesting." 
He said Spanish speakers in the area were particularly receptive to the church's message. In fact, five of the nine units of the Westchester stake are Spanish speaking, said Mark Bench, president of the Bronx and lower Westchester stake. "People who have been in an area a long time and whose roots go down deep are prone to say they don't want to change and they're happy with what they have," Mr. Carr said. "Immigrants who do not have as strong ties are more likely to listen."
Timothy Ricks, a Mormon bishop serving Westchester County, experienced some of the reluctance of the rooted to accept his religion when he moved to Scarsdale 10 years ago. "I was invited across the street to a party our neighbors were throwing," he said, "One of the people there turned to my wife and said, 'I understand some cult purchased the house across the street.' This is a relatively educated person, referring to my religion as a cult." 
In general, the older missionaries say they feel very welcome, even surprised by the warmth of New Yorkers. 
Darryl DiMaggio, 63, of Houma, La., said: "People in New York are very friendly. They don't speak first, but when you do, they're so excited that someone is talking to them." He is a retired pilot who took float planes through alligator-filled swamps. His wife, Krystal, 57, a retired registered nurse, says she is impressed with the diversity of the other older missionaries they know, who include lawyers, doctors, a beekeeper and a celebrity coach from Brigham Young University. 
The DiMaggios, who live in Yonkers, help staff the church's Family History Center in the Bronx, where church members and the public research their genealogies. The couple's other duties include helping run at least four nights a week of activities at the Kingsbridge Road church and driving church members to appointments and church functions.
Sitting in her Eastchester living room, Mrs. Gold said: "The minute I heard 'We could use your help,' I wanted to help the elders. I've had four sons in missions around the world, and I just know someone needs to mother these young people." She said one of the missionaries had fallen recently, hurting his back, another had an infection in his eye and didn't know what to do, and another arrived with a ripped suit. 
"I thought, "This is what I'm here for,"' she said. "Life's not fun if it's just you you're taking care of."

Unilever Consolidating Office Space in Trumbull

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

DATELINE: TRUMBULL 

 BODY:
SINCE 1972, when it leased one building in the Trumbull Industrial Park, Unilever, the giant home- and personal-care products company, has been assembling a minivillage of office buildings. Now, a 72,000-square-foot, $23 million addition to one of its five buildings within the park is under construction. It is the final project in establishing divisional headquarters in this 314-year-old town. 
 Last year, the company decided to move the headquarters from Greenwich to Trumbull, where costs are lower. "The primary reason," said Stacie Nevadomski, director of corporate affairs at Unilever's Trumbull office, "was to bring our East Coast employees to a single site, minimizing investment and disruption. There was no place to expand in Greenwich, and having a reduction in operating costs will help." 
 The addition will accommodate about 1,000 employees working at Unilever sites in Greenwich and in Englewood Cliffs and Edgewater, N.J. When construction of the addition is completed late this year, those workers will join some 600 colleagues who already occupy Unilever buildings in Trumbull. One of their current sites, the 233,757-square-foot headquarters at 33 Benedict Place in Greenwich, is to go on the market in February. 
Unilever operates in 88 countries and employs about 258,000. "We have no need or plans to acquire more real estate," Ms. Nevadomski said. "This will be our personal care, home products and global information office headquarters, while our food headquarters will be based in Englewood." 
Besides the cost reductions accruing from operating under one roof, Unilever will benefit from a tax abatement program initiated by the Town of Trumbull last year. It was established as an incentive for companies to locate and expand here, taking some of the burden off the heavily residential tax base. 
There are only 12,200 households scattered across Trumbull's 23 square miles, but commercial development is confined to four sites at the town's northern and southern borders, as mandated by a 40-year-old master plan designed to keep such development under control and away from residential neighborhoods.
To qualify for a 70 percent tax abatement in the first year and 10 percent a year for the next six years, a commercial construction project must have a minimum cost of $15 million, excluding land. Unilever's current combined tax bill for real estate and personal property (which consists of equipment and furnishings) is $1,074,674.
"Our population of 35,000 has been inching up by a thousand or two a year," said Raymond Baldwin Jr., a lawyer and a Democrat in his second two-year term as first selectman, the equivalent of mayor, "but the increase has been among younger residents with school-age children." 
Consequently, a sixth elementary school opened last September, and home building is brisk. Home prices over all have ballooned from an average of about $200,000 only a couple of years ago to $400,000 and upward; prices exceed $1 million in a new development of 83 homes. "They are sold as fast as they can build them," said Stephen Hodson, a realtor and member of the first selectman's economic development team. 
Unilever's existing total of 332,000 square feet at Trumbull Industrial Park is in three company-owned buildings: Nos. 40 and 50 Merritt Drive, which were first leased, then purchased; and No. 75 Merritt Drive, which the company built and owns. Unilever also leases a combined total of 112,000 square feet at 45 and 50 Commerce Drive. Together with the new addition, which will be joined to 40 Merritt Drive, the company will have a total of 526,000 feet of office space in the park. To create a cohesive campus atmosphere, it has engaged Kling, a Philadelphia architectural firm, to design a master plan for the five buildings.
Among Unilever's neighbors at the park are Nasdaq, New Horizons, Gartner Group, Avery Worldwide, Connecticut Magazine and the 180,000-square-foot, $32 million Sikorsky Building, a development, support and warehouse center, completed three months ago. Robert Scinto built and owns the building, along with a few parcels of open land, which he will not develop without a leasing commitment from a tenant. Mr. Scinto has built and owns 2.8 million square feet of office space in 30 buildings around the region of Shelton, Fairfield, Bridgeport and Trumbull; nine are in his signature Enterprise Corporate Park in Shelton. 
Wearing another hat as head of his economic development team, along with six volunteer members, Mr. Baldwin said, "when people want to build here, their first stop is my office."
Target was a recent visitor. Persuaded by the tax abatement and a regional climate friendly to retailers, the big box store has broken ground on a free-standing 125,000-square-foot building behind the Hawley Lane Shopping Center. The older regional mall off Route 8 is near the Stratford border and south of the Trumbull Industrial Park. A Physicians Health Services office building will be demolished to make way for a surface parking lot, and additional parking will be under the Target store. Based on its commercial area, the store is entitled to 625 parking spaces. 
Target will become part of a condominium that will include the mall and the new parking lot. The 250,000-square-foot enclosed mall was purchased by National Realty in the early 1980's and has a Kohl's, Home Goods, Hallmark and Dress Barn among some 20 stores and restaurants, including McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts.
Jerry Birmingham, managing director of development at National Realty's Westchester office, said: "The town is pro-business. Tenants hang in, and when one does leave, it's replaced quickly."
Commercial condominiums appear to be having a renaissance for the same reason that buying a house when interest rates are low winds up being more cost-effective than renting, and of course ownership builds equity. That reasoning is being applied at Trefoil Industrial Park at the northern border, where a concentration of medical offices is growing. 
The newest arrival is the Trumbull Professional Center, a 93,000-square-foot medical condominium, which broke ground in November at 115 Technology Drive. The first of its three wings is expected to open in the fall, offering doctors and other medical professionals and organizations suites of 1,200 square feet to 10,000 square feet (full floors) for an average purchase price of $200 a square foot at 6.5 percent interest. Each of the 54 suites will have an independent energy-efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, and there will be more than 400 reserved parking spaces. 
The building sits on seven and a half acres out of 17 acres owned by ElDorado Holdings of Westport and Tashua Associates of Trumbull. The remaining acreage is being held for further development. Within the park at 15 Corporate Drive are the Medical Arts Center, Vision Care Center and Bridgeport Oncology. Buildings at 35 and 55 Corporate Drive, which also hold professional offices, are owned by the New Boston Fund. According to local realtors, 80 to 100 acres are available for development in the park.
The last of the four commercial ventures on the outskirts of town is the 1.2-million-square-foot, newly renamed Westfield Shoppingtown, built in the early 60's as the Trumbull Shopping Park. Just off Merritt Parkway Exit 48, it is approached by a long winding entrance drive lined with trees and shrubs. It has 180 small stores and restaurants anchored by Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Filene's and J. C. Penney. 
Shopping for household necessities and services is almost entirely confined to a handsome retail center in a complex that adjoins Town Hall and to the Trumbull Shopping Center on White Plains Road. 
Mr. Baldwin and his economic development team believe that they can help balance the residential-commercial tax disparity not only with the tax abatement but by allowing a maximum of six stories for new and existing commercial buildings, rather than the current three stories. The proposal will need the approval of town boards. 
A state-required revaluation of all town real estate is due in 2005, and values are expected to rise, but taxes, according to the first selectman, probably will not. Trumbull's tax rate, at $27.50 per thousand dollars of assessment is up by about $2 per thousand from last year, but it is still at a midlevel point for Connecticut. 
THE town's regulations for maintaining green space and a small-town residential quality of life have been effective, and nobody seems to be talking about losing that ambience. There is a remarkable absence of even a single store, repair shop or gas station on Main Street, the gateway into town off the Merritt Parkway. Both sides of the street are lined with an array of well-kept older homes because retail development is prohibited on all internal roads except in the designated locations. 
A new master plan currently in the works is not expected to create additional zones or areas where commercial development can take place. Expansion within existing industrial parks and designated retail areas should suffice for the present, said Mr. Baldwin, adding that "sometime in the future we may have to make some revisions."
Controlling residential sprawl is a priority if a balance between residential and commercial real estate is to be achieved. "We spent $20 million in the past 10 years acquiring 1,400 acres of open space," Mr. Baldwin said. "We will buy anything over two acres on a sewer line to prevent developers from accumulating parcels and attempting to get zoning changed for subdivisions. We're not looking for any more residential density."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Reasons For Gloom In Chemical Stocks

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
AFTER a few very tough years, shares of chemical producers have been flourishing. The Standard & Poor's 500 Chemicals index is up by more than 30 percent over the last 52 weeks. 
 But chemical companies have some major problems, including a surge in the price of natural gas, an essential raw material for a wide range of products. Moreover, the industry is awash in overcapacity. And balance sheets at most of the big companies are far from pristine. 
 Graham Copley, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, talked last week about the industry. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Why are you bearish about the chemical industry?

A. There are two schools of investing thought. First, that we are going to have a global economic rebound that will create shortages everywhere, which will lead to a sharp rise in prices, particularly for plastics, and that everything is going to be great.
And then there is my school, which is that none of this is going to happen.
But the stocks are trading today as if I am going to be wrong. They are trading at massive multiples relative to current earnings.

Q. What are the reasons for your pessimism?

A. First, let's start with plastics prices, which are rising at the moment. However, there have been only two big up cycles in plastics prices in the last 30 years. One started in 1987 and lasted for three years. The other was in 1995 and lasted for eight months.
The guys hanging on right now and avoiding consolidation are praying for a 1987-like price peak. Also, a lot of these companies went on a spending binge in 1999 and 2000 on the expectation the economy would remain robust and that natural-gas prices would stay low. Now, balance sheets are in terrible shape, across the industry. They all are very leveraged.

Q. Are natural-gas prices a major problem for the chemicals industry?

A. Historically, this country has been a very, very cheap place to make chemicals.
Now, natural-gas prices are above $6 per million British thermal units. Historically, they were under $2 per million B.T.U.'s, well under the world average. And being under the world average for 20 years allowed the United States to construct a major export advantage. Now, it is suddenly uncompetitive. And the export business represents about 22 percent of the industry's revenues. There is a natural-gas crunch, and the chemical industry is realizing this is not a temporary problem.

Q. Last week, Cargill said it would merge its fertilizer business with that of IMC Global, a fertilizer giant. Is this deal representative of what may be coming in the broader chemical industry?

A. What we have seen in the fertilizer and methanol businesses is a proxy of what will have to happen elsewhere. It is simply a matter of time.
Chemical companies are buying feed stocks from the likes of Exxon Mobil and selling them to big, block retailers. That leaves them squeezed between two very big, consolidated sets of industries. But they are a fragmented industry themselves. 
The risk is that the U.S. chemical industry will shrink by 30 percent to 40 percent. The only thing that could prevent this from happening in the near term is a resurgence in global demand. That will lead to a temporary reprieve.

Q. Would it make much difference if more of the chemical business shifted overseas?

A. Environmentalists would love to see the chemical business go away altogether. From the consumer's perspective, if we end up with cheaper goods from a country like China, do we care? We have seen plenty of other industries go away, like textiles, where we lost our competitive advantage.

Q. Are you positive at all about chemical stocks?

A. The stocks haven't been terribly goodinvestments. It was the technology industry of the 1960's and 1970's, but innovation has lagged badly since then and products were commoditized relatively quickly.
I do like the industrial gas business, because you can't move it very far. That means the business is regionally competitive, not globally competitive, and that pricing is much more stable. 
There are only four big players in the business: Air Products; Praxair; BOC, a British company; and Air Liquide, which is French. 
The market is well structured and not competitive, with all sorts of barriers to entry, lots of organic growth and very nice returns. I have an outperform rating on Praxair, but the other guys have great businesses, too. 
I also have an outperform rating on Rohm & Haas. They have the pre-eminent position in house paints and have a very strong franchise in electronics, which uses a lot of complex chemicals.

HEADLINE: The Chips Are Down 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER GOLDBLATT

DATELINE: PENNS GROVE 

 BODY:
THE streets in this tired industrial town are framed with grand Victorian homes -- some regal under fresh paint and attention, others rotting. These days, the mood of residents is equally mixed with tenuous hope and resignation.
 It is here in this unlikely town of 4,800, on the banks of the Delaware River and in the shadows of a hulking DuPont chemical plant, that two developers envision a $100 million waterfront hub of stores, restaurants and a casino. 
 One developer has proposed a pavilion-style complex that would seem more at home in Cape May. Well-heeled tourists from Philadelphia and Delaware, with luck, would flock there for shopping and seafood dinners with a sunset view. And another has come up with a more far-fetched notion -- a casino and club floating on a barge offshore, drawing visitors and dollars to the area. 
Yet fulfillment of this glittery vision is largely out of the hands of these New Jersey residents, who have been teased before with the false hope of fame and prosperity. Because of a quirk in the state boundary, the fate of this tiny borough in Salem County could be decided across the river. A boundary established in 1682 by the Duke of York in his land grant to William Penn put the New Jersey state line just a few steps from the edge of Penns Grove's waterfront. Consequently, any floating casino would be in Delaware.
If lawmakers in Delaware give the floating casino a green light -- something the governors of Delaware and New Jersey both say they oppose -- the hope here is that 50 years of decay will be reversed. For now, the legislation is bottled up in a House committee. 
"If you live in Penns Grove, you've got to have hope," said John Bibeau, 40, owner of Willis Hardware, one of the few stores near the waterfront site that is actually occupied. "But it comes down to the willingness of the people who were elected to make the decisions. And, in this case, it's funny because we didn't elect those people." 
The fortunes of this slouching South Jersey community have long been intertwined with those across the river.
In 1891, E.I. duPont de Nemours & Company, the giant chemical company across the river, in Wilmington, Del., transformed Penns Grove -- primarily a port and fishing village -- into part of the company's sprawling empire. DuPont built an explosives factory along 150 waterfront acres in Carneys Point, just to the south. Not long afterward, at the height of the First World War, the plant employed 20,000 people and supplied two-thirds of the country's gunpowder. In 1917, on 1,350 acres in Deepwater -- a patch of land just south of Carneys Point -- DuPont built Chambers Works, a chemical factory that provided 9,000 jobs during World War II and now brews ingredients for products like Kevlar and Stainmaster carpets.
As DuPont prospered, so did Penns Grove. The company filled the streets with homes for its workers to rent, expansive executive residences, schools, a country club and a Y.M.C.A. where workers could bowl or dance on a Saturday night.
"DuPont fed the town," said 47-year-old Donna Federanko-Stout, whose grandfather immigrated here from Russia in 1904.
But prosperity was not to last. The ferry service that shuttled people and products between Penns Grove and Wilmington ceased in 1942. And in 1951 the first span of the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened, making the ferry from Pennsville, just south of the bridge, to New Castle, Del., obsolete. Then in the 1960's when Interstate 295 was opened, the area was bypassed altogether. 
"We went from being a town that you had to go through to get other places to a town that didn't even have an exit off of 295," said Ms. Federanko-Stout. 
It was not until 1972 that an exit leading to Penns Grove was built. But by then DuPont had begun to downsize there. Led by changes in business and technology, the company dismantled its explosives plant in the 1970's. Hundreds of jobs at Chambers Works vanished, and the work force was whittled to 1,100.
These days the city is not only remote but underpopulated and poor, perennially showing up on the list of the state's 10 most distressed municipalities. Many of the houses that went up during the prosperous years were sold or left vacant; the Y.M.C.A. fell into disrepair. From 1980 to 2000, the population of Penns Grove fell by 17 percent, even as New Jersey grew by 14 percent. In 20o2, the last year for which figures were available, the unemployment rate was 13.8 percent, more than twice that of the county and the state average, and more than 30 percent of its residents live below the poverty line. 
The few plants remaining in the area provide the best opportunity for employment. Anchor Glass, which was founded in 1863 and has floundered over the years, employs only about 300 people today, down from 1,800 in the 1970's. And the Salem nuclear plant in nearby Hancocks Bridge, which has been in operation since 1977, has about 1,800 workers. 
Still, politicians and developers dream of revival. In 1994, a plan for a marina and waterfront restaurant won government grants and a developer's commitment. But those plans were never pursued because the next year Bruce Willis -- like the action movie hero he is -- returned to his hometown with plans to invest $50 million for redevelopment. 
Mr. Willis bought 11 waterfront acres, the dilapidated Penns Grove National Bank and Trust, a Masonic Lodge and a stately stone home on Main Street. The movie star paid thousands of dollars worth of back taxes owed on the properties, got the grass mowed, and renewed the borough's sense of confidence.
And he drew up his own plans for a marina, hotel, shops and theaters.
"When he bought the property, the town came to life," saidPaul Morris, 51, the borough's former mayor.
On Broad Street, for instance, Michael DiPaolo transformed his family's 30-year-old delicatessen into an upscale Italian restaurant, with $30 entrees that still draw diners from Philadelphia and Wilmington. Across the street, Armondo Verdecchio, a contractor, bought and fixed up four retail buildings.
But by 1997, Mr. Willis lost interest. When word got out, prospective investors evacuated and many of the new businesses were emptied and boarded up again. The properties Mr. Willis had bought sat for another three years, until George Kearns, a Woodbury developer, bought the waterfront site and other ramshackle buildings on Main Street.
"After so many years, somebody keeps saying next spring, next spring, next spring," said Mr. Verdecchio, 57. "Whatever the developer does down on that property, we still have a town to deal with."
Today Mr. Kearns envisions a 200,000-square-foot complex of shops, restaurants, hotel and office space called the Riverwalk. He says that with the right tenants and a water view, the revived waterfront could become a regional shopping destination. A feasibility study by C.B. Richard Ellis, a commercial realtor, showed that potential sales for the Riverwalk could amount to nearly $50 million a year.
Mr. Kearns estimates that it would take about $28 million to build the complex, which he would pay for with bank financing. The borough has already received pledges for $5 million in state and federal grants to build a pedestrian walkway on the property as well as to add landscaping and lights and clean up the surrounding properties.
So far, Mr. Kearns says, he has spent five years and about $4 million buying property and wading through a maze of permits and studies required by government agencies.
He says his project would fit into a wave of economic development that has found its way down to Salem County -- the least densely populated county in New Jersey. The Delaware River and Bay Authority built an office park in Carneys Point in 1999, and that same year Conectiv Power put up a customer service office there that employs 500 people. This spring, McLane Grocery Distribution, based in Temple, Tex., plans to open a 220,000-square-foot warehouse in Carney's Point that will provide another 300 jobs.
But where Mr. Kearns's vision ends, another begins. An investment group in New Castle, Del., Hannalily LLC, wants to build a $70 million casino on a barge attached to the pier that would extend from the riverfront complex. 
The developers estimate that slot machines would generate almost $150 million a year. Of that, Delaware would get a 38 percent share of that money, plus additional proceeds to pay for programs like long-term care and open space preservation. Penns Grove would get 1,200 new jobs at its doorstep and a tourist attraction in its back yard.
The Hannalily developers are trying to sell the project to Delaware politicians as a way to defend the state from competition looming in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Nearly two-thirds of the gamblers at Delaware's three casinos -- Dover Downs, Delaware Park and Harrington Raceway -- live in the state. If Pennsylvania and Maryland legalize slot, the Delaware Department of Finance says, the state stands to lose about $120 million a year.
Slot machines have been a veritable jackpot for Delaware since the state sanctioned them in 1994. The state's share of gambling dollars amounted to $180 million last year, making slots the third-largest source of revenue in its general fund. 
The Hannalily developers hope lawmakers willapprove their project to stem those losses. But they have yet to do that. Legislation allowing the project was introduced in 2001, but it has languished in a House committee since then. 
"The state has to do something to maintain that $180 million," said Mark Kleinschmidt, a consultant for the project who is New Castle County's former economic development director. "Right now there's only the threat of competition. When real competition comes, they'll have to act differently."
But they could be in for a tough political battle. 
Ellen Mellody, a spokeswoman for Governor McGreevey, said recently that he would vigorously oppose anything that threatens New Jersey's gaming economy. And the governor of Delaware, Ruth Ann Minner, says she opposes any expansion of gambling. The Republican majority leader of the House in Delaware, Wayne A. Smith, an opponent of gambling, said that with resistance from Delaware's three existing casinos and the anti-gambling lobby, the chances of the bill passing are "slim to none."
While the bill's leading sponsor, Representative Joe Miro, acknowledged that passage of his measure would not come easily, he remained optimistic. "If it doesn't happen this year it will come back," Mr. Miro said. "They evolve with the economic needs."
For his part, Mr. Kearns insisted that his development does not need the slots to survive and prosper. He said he expected to receive permits for his shops and restaurants by summer, and that he would quickly break ground -- with or without a casino bobbing in the water. 
"It would certainly make it so much better if it's there," Mr. Kearns said of the casino. "But the project was thought through, designed and planned in such a way that it would be fine without it." 
Others too are hopeful that some change - any change - is just around Penns Grove's tattered corners.
"We're hopeful things might turnaround," said Mr. DiPaolo, the restaurateur. "I always thought whatever they did down there would be a plus." 
But as residents have waited for dirt to turn on Penns Grove's waterfront, many have become skeptical of the chances for a revival.
"We'd have meetings at the site and people would drive by and yell out of their car windows, 'It's never going to happen,"' said Ron Rukenstein, a consultant from Titusville.
As Fred Palfrey, a 71-year-old retired DuPont chemist, put it, "We aren't holding our breath on that anymore."

PERSON: Robert J. Harth 

HEADLINE: Robert Harth, 47, Dies; Ran Carnegie Hall 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Robert J. Harth, the artistic and executive director of Carnegie Hall, who in just two years managed the storied institution through the economic downturn that followed the attack on the World Trade Center, as well as the opening of a new underground stage and merger negotiations with the New York Philharmonic, died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 47.
 The cause was apparently a heart attack, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for Carnegie Hall. 
 Mr. Harth was new to New York when he started at Carnegie Hall, having spent 22 years in Aspen, Colo., and Los Angeles. His first day of work was Sept. 16, 2001, just five days after the twin towers fell. In the year that followed, cultural organizations citywide struggled to cope with a steep decline in ticket sales and contributions. 
 Mr. Harth was forced to make some risky decisions, including postponing the opening of Carnegie Hall's new auditorium, Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, to fall 2003 from fall 2002. He also eliminated Carnegie Hall's jazz band. 
 On Sept. 22, 2001, Isaac Stern, the violinist who had been Carnegie Hall's guiding force and had saved it from the wrecking ball, died, leaving Mr. Harth with another void to fill. 
 There were also wounds to heal among the staff members. Mr. Harth inherited an institution hurting from the tenure of his predecessor, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, who was widely described as autocratic and who drove out several senior staff members. 
 In a matter of months, Mr. Harth created a very different work environment, one in which his colleagues felt consulted even as he made it clear that he would have the final say. His mild-mannered, sunny disposition led some classical music veterans to predict that the Philharmonic would roll right over him in the merger discussions last summer.
 Indeed, Mr. Harth's leadership was severely tested by those negotiations, which would have brought the prestigious orchestra back to the stage it left in 1962. Mr. Harth found himself across the table from Zarin Mehta, the executive director of the Philharmonic, who was nearly 20 years older and more experienced. Mr. Harth also had to satisfy a large and prestigious board - in particular its chairman, the financier Sanford I. Weill.
Perhaps as a testament to Mr. Harth's diplomacy, he and Mr. Mehta remained friends even after the merger fell through. "He was with me Wednesday night at the concert," Mr. Mehta said yesterday. "Last Sunday I was with him at Carnegie Hall. It was that kind of relationship."
 In considering a merger, Mr. Harth had the not inconsiderable burden of guarding Carnegie Hall's interests regarding programming and artistic control. And he ultimately determined, together with the board, that a merger would compromise Carnegie Hall's core identity as the home to many musical groups.
 This identity was brought into high relief by the opening of Zankel Hall. The hall, which revived an underground stage that had ended up as a movie theater, was intended as an experimental space to reach out to new audiences. It became a strong symbol of how varied Carnegie Hall had become since the Philharmonic was in residence there 41 years ago. Mr. Harth played a leading role in its programming.
 "He was a true impresario," said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center. "He did more in a shorter time to diversify what audiences experience at Carnegie Hall than anyone I can remember." 
 Reared in Pittsburgh by two professional violinists -- Sidney Harth, also a conductor, and Teresa Testa Harth -- the young Mr. Harth studied violin and flute but also played lead guitar in a basement band. While Bach, Stravinsky and Prokofiev were among his favorite composers, he also liked to listen to the Dave Matthews Band and Coldplay. 
 In high school he spent summers doing odd jobs at the Aspen Music Festival, where his parents were on the faculty. The summer before his senior year at Northwestern University, he worked at the Ravinia Festival near Chicago, and he returned after graduation, quickly becoming associate manager. In 1979 he became executive director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, overseeing the Hollywood Bowl's staff of 600 at just 23 years old. "I was way over my head," he admitted in a recent interview.
 In 1989, Mr. Harth moved to the Aspen Festival and School, where in 12 years as president and chief financial officer he built the Harris Concert Hall and the Benedict Music Tent and increased the endowment to $40 million from $2 million.
 But for Mr. Harth, the Carnegie Hall post was the ultimate payoff. "It's a dream come true for me," he said when his appointment was announced in March 2001. "Carnegie Hall is steeped in the traditions of music that I know and I grew up with. And I think it is the greatest performing hall in the world."
 Although he had a companion, Stacey Buck, and a country house, Mr. Harth was happily married to his job. He would start his days in his office and end them at a concert. 
 In addition to his parents and companion, he is survived by a son, Jeffrey Curtis; a sister, Laura Harth Rodriguez; and his former wife, Melanie Harth. 
 Mr. Harth had hoped to stay at Carnegie Hall for a long time. In the recent interview, he said: "My track record shows that I like to make a long-term commitment. I hope I get the chance to do that here."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Feb. 3 about Carnegie Hall's plans to look for a director to replace Robert J. Harth, who died on Jan. 30, misstated his title when he was at the Los Angeles Philharmonic. (The error also appeared in an obituary on Feb. 1.) Mr. Harth was vice president and general manager, not executive director.
The article also misstated the name of the hall's education arm. It is the Weill Music Institute, not the Carnegie Hall Institute. The article also gave an incorrect surname at two points for the vice chairman and treasurer of Carnegie Hall's board. He is Klaus Jacobs.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-1-04; 
For Worse

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz; Judith Shulevitz contributes regularly to The New York Times and Slate.

 BODY:
Eight years ago, the feminist essayist Germaine Greer called for modern democracies to stop turning their first ladies into quasi royals and adopt the old Communist practice of keeping them out of sight. By the 21st century, she wrote, a woman ought neither expect to achieve a position of power nor "be expected to relinquish her privacy and her own work, to diet and dress up and give interviews every day, simply because she has married a man who has a prospect of success in politics."
 Dream on, Germaine. In the intervening near-decade, Kenneth Starr and Congress have made lying about presidential adultery an impeachable offense, and Hillary Clinton has parlayed her first ladyship into a Senate seat. That is to say, the protocols governing American first coupledom have grown as strict as in any monarchy, and first ladies who figure out how to exploit them can achieve unprecedented levels of power. Oh, yes, and "The Bachelor" and "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" have come into being, along with all the other reality shows. That means that the machinery for publicly humiliating those who stray from approved narrativesof self-presentation has reached the farthest corners of the land. 
 If you want to see these forces working in unison, look at the current electoral season. The regnant first lady, a model of wifely discretion, escapes all but the most deferential notice. Meanwhile, would-be first ladies who deviate from the script (stand silently but steadfastly by your husband's side; advise sagely but discreetly; smile sweetly but not broadly) watch the typeface on their tabloid headlines grow point by point.Indeed, faced with wayward wives, even serious political analysts begin to breathe heavily, in the manner of announcers on makeover shows. Will the millionairess Teresa Heinz Kerry help or hurt her husband with her blowsy sensuality and Botox and prenups? Will Dr. Judith Steinberg Dean's unyielding frumpiness be taken as a sign that Howard Dean is every bit as unlovable and unpolished as he seems?
But what is wrong, you may ask, with gossiping about politicians' wives? We chatter all day long about everyone else's. We are as naturally curious about our colleague's interestingly coifed bride as we are about the elusive Mrs. Dean. Besides, it is our duty as citizens to meet the missus, as Michael Kinsley put it in a recent column. We ought to see the human face behind the carefully managed image and policy papers before we pull the lever.
What's wrong with it is that it's based on a fallacy so obvious we've stopped seeing it. When we make a political marriage part of the story, we do not penetrate the spin. We merely shift our attention to more spin. Some would call it useful spin, in that, if done well, it provides the public with positive marital role models. But it is an illusion nonetheless, and to believe in it enough to vote accordingly is to engage in deliberate self-deception. We're like people who choose their pharmaceuticals because we like the looks of that nice couple on TV who recommend them.
That politicians make up pretty stories about the most intimate parts of their lives is nothing to get upset about. For if it is natural to gossip, how much more so is it to try to protect ourselves from gossip, to utter or act out little untruths about personal information we do not wish to share? We pull out a chair for our wife at dinner parties when we'd never do so at home. We pat our spouses' hands and declare our marriages to be in fine shape when, in fact, we're in therapy and are starting to talk about divorce. These are the sorts of niceties without which civilization could not exist. "The distinction between what an individual exposes to public view and what he conceals or exposes only to intimates is essential to permit creatures as complex as ourselves to interact without constant social breakdown," the philosopher Thomas Nagel has written. It is because we sequester our true selves behind a scrim of conventionality that we have the freedom to think dark thoughts, feel illicit impulses, love our torturers and despise our benefactors -- to be, in a word, human.
This insistence on prying into areas of life better left veiled may seem innocent, but it has malign consequences. Among other things, it has led to the erosion of trust in authority. We require aspiring leaders to pledge allegiance to their socially necessary fictions (Clinton: I have repaired what was wrong in my marriage), then call them hypocrites when they fail to live up to the fibs we forced them into (I did not have sex with that woman).
The tyranny of the gossip state falls with undue harshness on women, since the number of roles acceptable for presidential spouses has not grown at the same rate as the number of roles available to women in society. First ladies may be one of only three things: the spiffy supportive wife, the emasculating shrew wife or the pitiful abandoned or betrayed wife -- the last being particularly useful for the wife who wants to strike out on her own. Wives who won't be wifely, who eschew the traditional armature of femininity, come across as nearly naked, which may be why Diane Sawyer, in that "Primetime Thursday" interview, seemed barely able to contain her condescension toward Mrs. Dean.
So what are candidates' wives to do? It seems to me that they have two courses of action. They can do what they've always done -- smile and wave in public, pop pills in private and wait for their turns to come. Or they can choose not to. But no wife can do that for long unless all the other wives do, too, since no candidate will unilaterally disarm himself of his so-called secret weapon. That is why it is up to government to protect them. I call on Senator Clinton to introduce legislation forbidding the exploitation of spouses for political purposes or, failing that, to put limitations on the length and style of their appearances. This may be the one situation in American life just right for the burka.

And you know, maybe Fox will want to sponsor it as a national contest or something. But in any event, I would definitely want someone who would not just be there by my side but be a working partner, because I think we're in a day and age when partnerships are imperative to making anything happening in the world. And I certainly want a dynamic, outspoken woman who was fearless in her desire for peace in the world and for universal single-payer health care and a full employment economy. If you are out there, call me." Dennis Kucinich, at a forum in New Hampshire last November, as quoted by PoliticsNH.com

Fresh from his duties as co-chairman of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Carlos Ghosn, the chief of Nissan, picked up a director's post at I.B.M. last week.
 But isn't Mr. 
Ghosn based in Tokyo? How can he attend all those board meetings in Armonk, N.Y.? Actually, Mr. Ghosn's board seat is his second at an American corporation. He also serves on the board of Alcoa. 
 Even before taking the new I.B.M. job, Mr. Ghosn was planning to spend more time in North America, which has become a key driver in Nissan's operations. And next year, Mr. Ghosn is planning to move to Paris, where he will serve as chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, the French automaker that took management control of Nissan in 1999.
Mr. Ghosn says he thinks that his absence may do Nissan employees some good. "Maybe they will be even more productive without me there" to look over their shoulders, he joked in an interview last month.

P. Diddy Told Me to Buy This Car

BYLINE:  By HUBERT B. HERRING

 BODY:
Oh dear. First, kids toss around a ball. Then lines are drawn on a field, goal posts are installed and, in a blink, comes a Super Bowl, Super Bowl ads, vast sums spent on Super Bowl ads, articles about the vast sums spent on Super Bowl ads, articles about the articles. 
What next?
 Well, a survey from the ad agency Cliff Freeman & Partners asked participants which celebrities' appearance in a Super Bowl ad would nudge them to buy a given product. (The question was asked of 516 Americans in sports bars.) 
 The most touchdowns? Bill Clinton landed on many lists, though Bill Gates outranked him as best computer pitchman. Oprah Winfrey was picked as most reliable on snack foods, besting, among others, Martha Stewart. And Johnny Depp and Paris Hilton tied on the topic of beer. Go figure. HUBERT B. HERRING

HEADLINE: Budgets Of Mass Destruction 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
It should be clear to all by now that what we have in the Bush team is a faith-based administration. It launched a faith-based war in Iraq, on the basis of faith-based intelligence, with a faith-based plan for Iraqi reconstruction, supported by faith-based tax cuts to generate faith-based revenues. This group believes that what matters in politics and economics are conviction and will -- not facts, social science or history.
 Personally, I don't believe the Bush team will pay a long-term political price for its faith-based intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Too many Americans, including me, believe in their guts that removing Saddam was the right thing to do, even if the W.M.D. intel was wrong. 
 The Bush team's real vulnerability is its B.M.D. -- Budgets of Mass Destruction, which have recklessly imperiled the nation's future, with crazy tax-cutting and out-of-control spending. The latest report from the Congressional Budget Office says the deficit is expected to total some $2.4 trillion over the next decade -- almost $1 trillion more than the prediction of just five months ago. That is a failure of intelligence and common sense that threatens to make us all insecure -- and people also feel that in their guts.
As Peter Peterson, the former Nixon commerce secretary and a longtime courageous advocate of fiscal responsibility, puts it in "Running on Empty," his forthcoming book: "In the 1980 election, Ronald Reagan galvanized the American electorate with that famous riff: 'I want to ask every American: Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' Perhaps some future-oriented presidential candidate should rephrase this line as follows: 'I want to ask every American, young people especially: Is your future better off now than it was four years ago -- now that you are saddled with these large new liabilities and the higher taxes that must eventually accompany them?' "
While in his book Mr. Peterson equally indicts Democrats and Republicans as co-conspirators in the fiscal follies of our times, the Democrats should still follow his lead and make this their campaign mantra: "Is your future better off now than it was four years ago?" That's what's on people's minds. It should be coupled with the bumper sticker: "Read My Lips: No New Services. Bush Gave All the Money Away." And it should be backed up with a responsible Democratic alternative on both taxes and spending.
That is the only way to expose what the shameful coalition of Karl Rove-led cynics, who care only about winning the next election; voodoo economists preaching supply-side economics; and libertarian nuts who think that by cutting tax revenues you'll shrink the government -- when all you do is balloon the deficit -- is doing to our future. And please don't tell me the tax cuts are working. Of course they're working! If you put this much stimulus into our economy -- three tax cuts, loose monetary policy and out-of-control spending -- it will produce a boom. Eat 10 chocolate bars at once and you'll also get a rush. But at what long-term cost?
"Quite simply," argues Mr. Peterson, "those bell-bottomed young boomers of the 1960's have fully matured. The oldest of them, born in 1946, are only six years away from the median age of retirement on Social Security (63). As a result, our large pension and health care benefit programs will soon experience rapidly accelerating benefit outlays. . . . Thus, at a time when the federal government should be building up surpluses to prepare for the aging of the baby boom generation, it is engaged in another reckless experiment with large and permanent tax cuts. America cannot grow its way out of the kinds of long-term deficits we now face. . . . The odds are growing that today's ballooning trade and fiscal deficits, the so-called twin deficits, will someday trigger an explosion that causes the economy to sink -- not rise."
The same Bush folks who assured us Saddam had W.M.D. now assure us these budgets of mass destruction don't matter. Sure. "During the Vietnam War," notes Mr. Peterson, "conservatives relentlessly pilloried Lyndon Johnson for his fiscal irresponsibility. But he only wanted guns and butter. Today, so-called conservatives are out-pandering L.B.J. They must have it all: guns, butter and tax cuts."
This is so irresponsible and it will end in tears. Remember, says Mr. Peterson, long-term tax cuts without long-term spending cuts are not tax cuts. They are "tax deferrals" -- with the burden to be borne by your future or your kid's future.
If this isn't the election issue, I don't know what is.

HEADLINE: Political Points 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY; Randal C. Archibold contributed reporting to this column.

 BODY:
Looking Beyond The Ballroom
WHEN they walk on stage to address their cheering supporters this Tuesday night, the Democratic presidential candidates might want to consider a new mantra: It's the living room, stupid. 
 After Howard Dean's speech the night of the Iowa caucuses, he was widely criticized for violating the first rule of election night speeches. Why, the critics asked, hadn't he remembered that the only audience that matters is in the living room, not the ballroom? 
 Yet in New Hampshire last Tuesday, the candidates were still spending their precious moments on national television thanking aides and volunteers. Just when they could finally stop pandering to voters, they went on rhapsodizing about the locals' hospitality for so long that the networks cut them off in midspeech. 
Even Dr. Dean had not learned the lesson. He started off fine in New Hampshire, speaking about his dreams for a better America. But just as he was hitting his stride, he spotted some campaign workers from San Francisco and hailed their dedication for crossing the country. The mood was broken and the networks cut away.
It may seem cruel to subject a roomful of supporters to a stump speech they already know word for word. John Kerry's volunteers presumably do not want to be rewarded at a victory party with a speech about his tax policies; John Edwards's workers do not need to hear for the millionth time that he is the son of a millworker. 
But only 20 percent of Americans know that Mr. Edwards's father worked in a mill, and two-thirds do not recognize the most rudimentary distinction in the candidates' tax policies, according to the latest National Annenberg Election Survey from the University of Pennsylvania. It's hard for the crowd at an election-night party to imagine so many Americans know so little about the candidates, but those channel-surfers in the living rooms are the ones who will be picking the next president.

Those Boots, Made for Stumping
When L. Paul Bremer III, the civilian administrator of Iraq, went around in last summer's 120-degree weather wearing combat boots with a suit and tie, it didn't seem to be a fashion with much of a future. But now the Suit 'n' Boots combination has become the rage of the campaign. Devotees claim they're just being practical, but fashion is never so simple.
Mr. Kerry and Wesley K. Clark have gone for the L. L. Bean country squire look, wearing the classic leather-and-rubber Maine hunting boots on campaign swings across the country. Mr. Edwards likes to wear expensive navy blue suits -- Zegna is one of his brands -- with a pair of black waterproof hiking boots that his daughter gave him as a Christmas present. They were intended to help him through the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire. But Mr. Edwards grew so fond of them that he took to wearing them all the time, snow or no snow. He kept them on during television debates and during some of his visits back to the South. 
"We tried telling him that he didn't really need these boots on 50-degree sunny days, but we couldn't get him out of the boots," said Mr. Edwards's press secretary, Jennifer Palmieri. "He said he liked the way they were comfortable and made him feel sturdy. I think he got a little superstitious about wearing them."
As a fashion statement, the Suit 'n' Boots look may seem primitive, but as a political statement it may be more sophisticated. It shows the wearer can deal with contradictions comfortably. Mr. Bremer's suit said he was calmly making progress bringing order to Iraq; his boots said he was ready to sprint for cover through shrapnel. The Democrats' suits say they're presidential; their boots say they're men of the people.
It's a tricky dichotomy, but apparently important this year. Voters have been telling pollsters and journalists they're angry at policies that favor the rich, but so far they've given most of their votes to the wealthiest candidates, like Mr. Kerry, Mr. Edwards and Dr. Dean. Voters say they want a candidate who's not a Washington insider, but they also want someone sufficiently worldly and distinguished to be electable. They seem to want the Suit 'n' Boots.

An Endorsement Just for Laughs
IN South Carolina, which has an open primary, the Republican Party is officially urging its members to stay away from the polls on Tuesday. But a conservative radio station in Greenville has been urging its Republican listeners to turn out to vote in the Democratic primary -- for the Rev. Al Sharpton.
The campaign began as a joke after Mr. Sharpton was quoted last year as saying that he was running because "the way to move a donkey is to slap the donkey." Slapping the donkey sounded so good to the conservative talk show hosts at WORD-AM that they endorsed Mr. Sharpton. They even sponsored a fund-raiser, inviting listeners to stop by the station and pay for the privilege of petting (slapping seemed problematic) a real donkey.
"We collected $28 and a driving-range token," said Peter Thiele, the station's program director, who mailed a check for $30 to the Sharpton campaign. He conceded that the station was not motivated by a desire to promote Mr. Sharpton's policies or the Democratic Party.
"There's not much we agree on with the Reverend Al," Mr. Thiele said, "but it would be kind of nice to have him win the South Carolina primary just for the fun of it."

Honor Roll
The Ask Not if It Makes Any Sense Prize: "Together we will build a prosperity in this country where Americans are not just working for the economy, but the economy is working for Americans." (From John F. Kerry's stump speech.)
Most Honest Self-Assessment by a Celebrity: "I'm a little trepidatious about coming to New Hampshire. He was doing great in Iowa until I went out to help him." (Martin Sheen, who used his presidential powers from "The West Wing" to proclaim Howard Dean Day in New Hampshire.)
Bravest Spin of the Week: "Kucinich Campaign Progressing." (Headline on Dennis J. Kucinich's press release after he finished sixth in the New Hampshire primary with 1.4 percent of the vote.)

HEADLINE: BUSH TO BACK OFF SOME INITIATIVES FOR BUDGET PLAN 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
President Bush will propose a $2.3 trillion budget on Monday that backs away from some of the major spending and tax initiatives he supported in prior years, administration officials say.
 Constrained by big budget deficits and political realities, the officials said they would retreat on some of their own ideas and oppose others favored by Republicans in Congress. 
 Mr. Bush will try instead to lock in some of his prior victories, by pressing Congress for a permanent extension of most of the tax cuts adopted in the last three years that were set to expire over the next seven years. He says the tax cuts foster economic growth, which helps create jobs. But many Democrats say the tax cuts are fiscally reckless and widen the gap between rich and poor. 
In getting his budget through Congress, the president will face formidable challenges from Senate Democrats who oppose making his tax cuts permanent, from conservative Republicans who want to cut spending more and from lawmakers in both parties who shudder at the prospect of reducing spending on favored domestic programs in an election year. 
"We had a very hard time passing a budget resolution last year," said a senior Republican Senate aide. "Things are no better this year -- they're worse." 
Administration officials said Mr. Bush would not insist on his earlier proposal to overhaul Medicaid, would not push for a big expansion of retirement savings accounts and would not back tax incentives for energy production that he supported last year. 
In addition, they said, Mr. Bush will oppose extending a temporary tax break that greatly accelerates the rate at which businesses can depreciate new equipment. The tax provision was enacted in 2002 to stimulate the economy and manufacturers want to retain it. At the same time, the White House is gearing up to oppose Republican plans in Congress for highway spending that far exceed what Mr. Bush wants.
Under fire fromRepublicans alarmed at the growth of the federal budget in recent years, Mr. Bush called Saturday for new statutory limits on spending.
"To assure that Congress observes spending discipline, now and in the future, I propose making spending limits the law," Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. "This simple step would mean that every additional dollar the Congress wants to spend in excess of spending limits must be matched by a dollar in spending cuts elsewhere." 
Mr. Bush did not say who would set the limits or how they would be enforced. Unlike similar rules that governed Congress in the 1990's, Mr. Bush's proposal would not impose restrictions on new tax cuts.
While Congress has often exceeded Mr. Bush's spending requests, fiscal conservatives have complained that he has never vetoed a spending bill. 
Mr. Bush boasted that he would virtually freeze many domestic programs, with an increase of less than 1 percent for domestic discretionary spending outside of military and homeland security.
But he is proposing an increase of 7 percent for the military, including 13 percent more for missile defense systems; an increase of nearly 10 percent for heightened security against terrorist attacks; and an increase of 11 percent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Those increases and Mr. Bush's determination to make his tax cuts permanent will limit his maneuvering room in other areas. 
Mr. Bush pushed hard last year for passage of a sweeping energy bill and ultimately said he would accept legislation that included at least $23 billion in tax breaks aimed at increasing energy production.
But the bill is stalled in Congress, and this year White House officials are proposing a more modest energy package that omits many of the expensive tax breaks sought by oil and gas producers.
Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said that support for those tax breaks waned after Congress passed a major expansion of Medicare that was supposed to cost $400 billion over 10 years. The Bush administration said this week that the cost would be at least $530 billion.
After the Medicare bill passed, Mr. Cavaney said, "people started to pay closer attention to everything that might put the economic recovery at risk, including the deficit."
White House officials also plan to oppose an extension of the tax break that allows businesses to take an immediate write-off for half the cost of their investment in many kinds of equipment. 
Mr. Bush pushed the provision as a temporary measure to stimulate investment, and it is scheduled to expire at the end of this year. Manufacturing companies and many Republicans in Congress want to keep the tax break for several more years. But administration officials are resisting, because it is projected to cost $285 billion over five years.
This provision "was always intended to be temporary, to give the economy a boost when it needed it most," a White House official said on Friday. With the economy improving, he said, the need has passed.
Beyond the fiscal constraints, Mr. Bush faces the political constraints of an election year in which it will be difficult for the Republican-controlled Congress to pass major legislation over the objections of Democrats.
In his budget last year, Mr. Bush asked Congress to make sweeping changes in Medicaid, the fast-growing health program for low-income people. Under the plan, if states accepted fixed allotments of federal money, they would have received much more latitude in spending it.
Administration officials viewed such "lump-sum allotments" as a way tostreamline Medicaid and control costs. But Democrats and advocates for the poor assailed the proposal, saying it would give states vast new power to reduce or eliminate benefits for low-income people. 
Rather than fight that battle in an election year, administration officials said, they have decided to pursue the same goal through negotiations with individual states. That approach would be easier than dealing with Congress, but it would be much less ambitious than Mr. Bush's original idea.
As part of a new "financial management review process," federal officials plan to scrutinize state Medicaid spending more closely. The goal, they say, is to cut down on abusive schemes used by some states to finance their share of Medicaid.
In another quiet retreat, Mr. Bush is backing away from his proposal for the expansion of retirement savings accounts, which would eventually allow people to shelter most of their investment income from taxes. The proposal will again be in the budget, but administration officials said they did not expect to push the idea this year.
The proposal faces objections from Democrats, influential Republicans and many segments of the financial services industry.
White House officials predict that the budget deficit will climb to more than $500 billion this year, from $375 billion last year. Some conservative Republicans are so angry about the soaring deficits that they have begun to threaten rebellion if Mr. Bush does not rein in spending. 
For their part, Democrats excoriate Mr. Bush for having already pushed through tax cuts that total more than $1.7 trillion over 10 years. If the cuts are made permanent, the Congressional Budget Office said this week, the cost would be an additional $1.2 trillion over 10 years.
Mr. Bush has vowed to cut the deficit by half in five years, but many Republicans in Congress say that is not enough. They want to see the government run a surplus, as it did from 1998 to 2001.
The president's problem is that political pressures for greater spending are high among Republicans and Democrats alike.
Republicans and Democrats on the House Transportation Committee want to spend $375 billion on highways and mass transit over the next six years. That would be an increase of 72 percent over current levels, and it would exceed the money available from federal gasoline taxes by more than $100 billion.
Mr. Bush will propose spending $251 billion, administration officials said, and he has already threatened to veto any attempt to finance the extra spending with an increase in borrowing.

Playing the Election Market

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES, famously compared investing in the stock market to voting in an unusual sort of beauty contest: your choice wins only if the other voters make the same pick.
 It is an analogy that voters in the Democratic primaries seem to understand. 
 "My heart still belongs to Howard Dean because of his passion, but my head says Kerry is the one who can get elected," Pradipto Bagchi, 30, a financial analyst, told The New York Times in Nashua, N.H., on Monday.
For Democrats determined to win back the White House, the only important thing is to choose a candidate who will appeal to enough people to win the beauty contest in November. Finding a political soulmate doesn't matter. And making that choice is not unlike picking a hot stock. 
"This is a political market," said Lord Robert Skidelsky, author of a multivolume biography of Keynes, "and everyone is not choosing on the merits of the individuals but on whether they think he's a winner or not." 
He added that Keynes also compared the market to a casino.
Of course, if the historical inability of investors to pick winning stocks with regularity is any guide, trying to predict the voting preferences of another person or another 80 million people -- all of whom are trying to predict the same thing about everyone else -- may well be a fool's errand. 
"What Keynes said was, it's a crazy system," said David Colander, a professor of economics at Middlebury College. "When you have markets that are that complicated, essentially there is no way an individual can figure out what's going on unless you have inside information."
Still, given how fiercely many Democrats oppose Republicans and this president in particular, a number of primary voters have said in interviews that "electability" is their primary concern.
"The incredibly deep, partisan rift in this country has changed what voters are looking for in candidates," said Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary to President Clinton and now a partner at Glover Park Group, a communications consulting firm. 
"If you look back to the 2000 election, it was very clear that the Republicans settled on George Bush early, based on electability," Mr. Lockhart added. "It could've been Bozo the Clown, and if he had polled well, that's whom they would've gotten behind. That's what's happened with Democrats now."
But Jano Cabrera, spokesman for the campaign of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, said that voters who think too much about casting their votes for the most electable candidate may find themselves regretting their choice in November. He compared the decision for primary voters to that of high school seniors predicting who will look good at the 10-year reunion. 
"If they pick the wrong guy, they'll find that he's gained a little weight, lost a little hair, and whatever the analogy is for being weak on defense and being able to stand toe to toe with Bush on taxes," Mr. Cabrera said. 
Burton G. Malkiel, the author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," said voters will never be able to accurately make this sort of prediction, and should avoid trying to second-, third- or fourth-guess the tastes of the electorate. 
"My view is, don't even try to do these things," Mr. Malkiel said. "Don't try to think that you're smarter."
Even if Democratic voters make the best possible pick, unforeseen developments can change everything, Lord Skidelsky said. "Your best expectations can be upset by events. That's as true of stocks as of administrations."

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
The economy is confusing, so the politicians are feeling confused.

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
NOBODY doubts that many Americans will vote their pocketbooks in this year's presidential election. The puzzle is figuring out which party those pocketbooks will favor.
 The Democratic candidates, traveling around Arizona, Missouri and other states holding primaries this week, are talking about the millions of layoffs and millions of people who have lost health insurance under President Bush. Senator John Kerry, whose fortunes have risen as the war in Iraq as receded as an issue, has dismissed the recent surge of economic growth as a "Wall Street Bush-league recovery." 
 Mr. Bush, on the other hand, is showing new confidence that the economy will in fact help his chances come November. His State of the Union address offered a laundry list of Reaganesque optimism that he is likely to repeat in coming months: home ownership, exports and employment are up; inflation and interest rates are down. Mr. Bush even dropped a common refrain from last year in which he had vowed not to be satisfied until everyone looking for work could find it. 
"It's difficult to figure out," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, "if the glass is half-empty or half-full."
There have not been crosscurrents like these since at least 1984, politicians and pollsters say, when Ronald Reagan was running for re-election as the economy was coming out of the slump of the early 80's. The fact that the economy was creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs a month in 1983 and 1984 makes today's situation, with job growth still meager, look even murkier.
The Federal Reserve, in its statement last week suggesting that it could raise interest rates sooner than expected, inadvertently captured the moment with this nugget of ambivalence: "Although new hiring remains subdued, other indicators suggest an improvement in the labor market."
Perhaps reflecting the good news Mr. Bush listed in his speech, consumers report being more confident about the economy than they were when Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson or Mr. Reagan won re-election, according to the University of Michigan. 
"The economy is the No.1 issue today," said Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign. "And we are in about the same position Reagan was in '84 and Clinton was in '96."
But the stock market remains 10 percent lower than when Mr. Bush took office, and he is almost certain to become the first president since Herbert Hoover to preside over a loss of jobs, as Democrats are fond of noting. With the surpluses of Mr. Clinton's tenure having turned into a $500 billion deficit, even some Republicans have begun to worry that Mr. Bush is handing a campaign issue to Democrats. Tomorrow, the White House will release a budget proposal for next year.
"The myth of Republicans being the party of fiscal responsibility is being unmasked by this administration," said Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat. "Democrats must hammer on this issue."
It may not resonate with many voters, though, if the coming months resolve the debate over the economy as definitively as aides to Mr. Bush expect. Almost all economists, including some who have been cautious and prescient over the last three years, agree that hiring is finally likely to pick up in the next few months. In that case, Mr. Bush would likely try to drown out the deficit discussion by trumpeting last year's tax cut as the cause of the recovery. 
"You have the Democrats arguing one set of numbers and us arguing another, and that's why God made elections," said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. "By November, it won't be a close call."
Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri Republican, added: "Things are looking up. It has to show up in jobs soon."
Even if growth is only moderate this year, a well-known formula for predicting presidential elections (developed by a Yale professor, Ray Fair, and based largely on the economy) is forecasting an easy win for Mr. Bush.
But in their early primaries, the Democratic candidates have offered glimpses of how they will campaign on the economy if it continues to improve. As Mr. Kerry did when he called the recovery "Bush league," they have begun to paint this recovery as one that exists only in official statistics and well-off households.
In his stump speech, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina describes "two economies," in which a few are comfortable while many struggle paycheck to paycheck. Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, and Mr. Kerry both speak of hard-working families that cannot afford medical care and call the United States the only industrialized country without universal health insurance. 
The strategy includes obvious risks, forcing the party to make a downbeat argument to an electorate that tends to prefer optimism. A similar line of attack -- as well as voters' preference for Republicans on national security issues -- left the Democratic presidential candidate in 1984, Walter F. Mondale, winning only his home state, Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.
But the "two economies" approach also has a basis in reality. In a reversal of what happened in the late 90's, earnings of workers at the middle and on the bottom half of the income ladder fell last year, after being adjusted for inflation. Pay for those in the top 25 percent continued rising, according to the Labor Department.
"There is still a great degree of economic angst among workers," said Mark Sanford, the Republican governor of South Carolina, which will hold a primary Tuesday. "They don't see the way out of the tunnel yet."
The three tax cuts since Mr. Bush took office have added to the income gap, reducing taxes the most for wealthy households. By elevating Mr. Kerry at the expense of Dr. Dean and Representative Richard A. Gephardt, voters in Iowa and New Hampshire increased the chances that the Democratic nominee will focus on the distribution of the tax cut in the general election. Mr. Kerry, like Mr. Edwards and former Gen. Wesley K. Clark, want to roll back only the reductions that go to the highest earners, while Dr. Dean has called for a complete repeal of the tax cuts.
Whatever they think of the various candidates, many Democrats would be relieved to avoid a fight in which Mr. Bush could criticize them for wanting to raise middle class taxes. "We have a slight advantage," said Bill Richardson, the Democratic governor of New Mexico, referring to the economy, "if we focus on the irresponsibility of the Republicans in not balancing the budget, high unemployment and losing jobs overseas, rather than the tax cut debate." 
What makes the 2004 economy so difficult to figure out, however, is that the picture for middle class families is far from uniformly bad. House prices have continued to rise, and interest rates remain low. The recent recession was not severe enough to erase the remarkable strength of the late-1990's economy, and most families at all income levels make more money than they did five or three years ago, even taking inflation into account.
So even Ronald Reagan's famous question -- Are you better off than you were four years ago? -- will not be easy to answer this fall. Right now, Senator Bond said, the economy "is close to a wash."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Rallying Cry; 
Embracing the Common Man in a Time of Recovery

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT is, by many measures, an unlikely time for a populist uprising. The economy is recovering, although job growth is lagging. Democratic voters are more upscale than they used to be. About half of American households own stock, and conservative strategists argue that this new "investor class" sees its fate as closely tied to corporate America, not at odds with it. This is not the America of William Jennings Bryan.
 So why are the Democratic presidential candidates rousing the grass roots with populist appeals, vowing to defend average people from the special interests, the "Benedict Arnold corporations" shipping jobs overseas and a Bush administration in their thrall? And how would it work in a campaign against a president who is no slouch in aligning himself with common folk as a tax-cutting, regular guy who shares their values? 
 Already, the election is becoming a struggle over who wins and who loses in this economy, whose interests the Bush administration has at heart and how the broad middle class sees its future.
Populism is an enduring theme in the Democratic Party, rooted in the rebellion of small Western and Southern farmers facing economic upheaval in the 1890's, adapted over the years to the interests of wage earners, waxing and waning with the economy. It is a slippery concept, and the agenda has shifted with the times. Some Democrats dislike the word because of its past connections with radicalism and demagogy.Still, the language of economic populism is strikingly similar across a century. When he won the Democratic nomination in 1896, Bryan, quoting a contemporary, said the party could fight on the side of the "idle holders of idle capital," or on the side of "the struggling masses." 
Democrats on the campaign trail today still divide the nation into the privileged and everyone else, now usually described not as the masses, but as the middle class. Senator John Edwards caught fire in Iowa last month with his portrait of the "two Americas."
Democratic strategists say this broad message is particularly suited to this campaign. It allows candidates to speak to the economic anxiety of the middle class, which, despite the recovery, is still portrayed as "living from paycheck to paycheck, having to borrow money, going into debt, having trouble paying their bills, and in many cases one medical emergency, one layoff, from going into bankruptcy," as Mr. Edwards argues.
Exit polling showed that in Iowa and New Hampshire the most important concerns among Democratic voters were the rising cost of medical care, the health of the economy and jobs.
The loss of jobs overseas will only loom larger as the Democratic contests move into the Southern and industrial Midwestern states this week.
This new populism also includes a critique of Mr. Bush as someone who is governing in the interests of big corporations, not average Americans. Even now, at the campaign's start, a recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 58 percent of Americans said theylieved Mr. Bush was more interested in protecting large corporations than ordinary people. Kevin Phillips, a writer and critic of President Bush, argues: "If you have the whole corporate, C.E.O. mentality, as Bush has had, on everything from tax policy to immigration, you're in trouble if the Democrats find their voice. And I think they are finding their voice."
They are certainly getting cheers from Democratic primary voters, as they portray a Washington where big drug companies and health maintenance organizations control health policy, big oil companies shape energy policy, multimillionaires frame tax policy and Halliburton and other corporations close to the Bush administration shape the reconstruction of Iraq. Senator John Kerry has taken to warning "the special interests who now call the White House their home: We're coming, you're going and don't let the door hit you on the way out!"
Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues, "We need a leadership that puts the national interest above special interests." And Howard Dean has asserted, again and again, "It's time to take our country back." 
Alluding to the case against special interests, Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who advises the Kerry campaign, said, "There's little doubt in my mind that this will be a part of the critique that any Democrat would make of George Bush."
But there are dangers to this approach, many analysts say, including some analysts in the Democratic Party. Vice President Al Gore sounded similar themes four years ago, painting the choice as "the people versus the powerful." But centrist Democrats -- notably those at the Democratic Leadership Council -- argued that the message was out of sync with the booming New Economy of the late Clinton era.
In general, economic populism can seem too negative in a country where, after all, "most people think they have a chance to become wealthy, if they win the lottery or go on 'American Idol,"' said Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University historian and author of "The Populist Persuasion." "That's part of what it means to be American."
For that reason, many Democrats say any populism must be positive, advancing "the national interest, as embodied in the values and aspirations of the great American middle class, above special interest," as the Democratic Leadership Council put it last week, adding that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards met the test.
Ken Mehlman, head of the Bush re-election campaign, is already asserting that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry are dividing the country, "with yesterday's class warfare rhetoric of two Americas." And Grover Norquist, an influential conservative strategist, says he relishes the idea of a campaign against populist Democrats, looking forward to a simple message: "We want you to get rich and the Democrats don't. They want to tax you as if you were rich already."
Moreover, some Republicans suggest that the Democrats are not immune to the charge of coddling their own special interests -- like trial lawyers and unions.
Finally, Mr. Bush is quite skilled at playing the Republican version of populism. Harry C. Boyte, senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, notes that there is a cultural populism with a strong Republican tradition -- a defense of the average American against "the professional elites that look down their noses at ordinary people," particularly government elites.
Mr. Bush, in the 2000 campaign, argued: "We trust the people" while Mr. Gore "believes in government." He has long defended the tax cuts as simply restoring to the American people "your money."
He stood beside a Fidelity Investments worker at Manchester, N.H., last week and declared: "She saved $1,100 on tax relief last year. Now, that may not sound like a lot to some of the people who are rolling in cash." He added: "That's a lot. It made a difference."
Moreover, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove, has studied the fortunes of President William McKinley, who helped forge an enduring Republican majority -- and who beat William Jennings Bryan.

HEADLINE: Deficits, Fruit Flies and the Beltway 

BYLINE:  By John Kasich; John Kasich, managing director of the Lehman Brothers Investment Banking Group, was a Republican representative from Ohio from 1983 to 2000.

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio 

 BODY:
My, how the times and priorities have changed in Washington! Back in 2001, when I left Congress as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, the budget was balanced, $453 billion of debt had been paid down, and there were future surpluses amounting to $5.6 trillion that could be used to save and reform Social Security.
 These accomplishments were possible because a committed team of public servants made huge political sacrifices for the benefit of their children. It took a government shutdown (showdown) to make it clear to President Bill Clinton that I and others in Congress would stop at nothing less than fiscal responsibility. Less discretionary spending, savings in entitlement programs, lower interest rates and capital gains tax cuts -- which provided incentives for economic growth -- were the drivers of our success. 
 We balanced the first budget since man walked on the moon because we were able to beat back the big-government, business-as-usual politicians. The political sacrifices called for in taming government are enormous. The demands to spend more on programs come from inside and outside Washington, and I learned first-hand that when you fight these interests you become an enemy to many.
Unfortunately, our success was short-lived. Since 2001 government spending has grown almost 20 percent, from $1.96 trillion then to the more than $2.3 trillion contained in the budget that President Bush is expected to release to Congress tomorrow. The Congressional Budget Office predicted last week that the deficit would hit a record $477 billion, and yet the spending spree goes on with no apparent end in sight. The surpluses that could have been used to save Social Security are gone, and Medicare continues its move toward bankruptcy.
Some blame President Bush's tax cuts, some blame the war on terrorism, but it all comes down to one simple reason: a lack of political will to curtail the rise and growth of government spending. An example of this is the bloated budget bill. It provides money for a birthday party for Hawaii and the study of fruit flies in France. Who is to blame? Everyone who has participated in the process, which means both Republicans and Democrats.
So I have a few things I would like to say to both sides. To my Republican friends: please don't argue that deficit spending and big government don't matter. They are a claim on future income either through higher taxes, or inflation and higher interest rates. And to my Democratic friends: deficits are not caused by taxes being too low, but by spending being too high. Your solution of raising taxes will lead only to slower economic growth and even more spending in the future. I also have a few suggestions for my former colleagues on what needs to be done:
* Reduce government bureaucracy, shrink the size of the federal work force by 2 percent to 3 percent, and trim overhead expenses like travel and utilities.
* Eliminate corporate subsidies for ethanol and other programs for well-connected businesses.
* Cut ineffective foreign aid programs that put money into the hands of corrupt and inept governments.
* Close unnecessary military bases. Modernize and privatize Pentagon personnel operations where appropriate.
* Curb the skyrocketing growth of health care spending by putting unrestricted and robust Medical Savings Accounts into effect and reducing the number of frivolous lawsuits.
* Scale back the bloated farm program.
* Cut the pork out of the highway bill. Better yet, return the program to the states and let them manage it.
* Auction surplus federal assets to the highest bidder.
These suggestions are obviously not comprehensive, but this is not about numbers, nor is this about deficits or budgets. This is about leadership. And leadership is about example and sacrifice, not cheers and re-election. It's about a quiet voice deep inside reminding you that working for the good of the country often means putting others before yourself and special interest groups. It's about a legacy that can't be seen until tomorrow. Which leads me to wonder: where are tomorrow's leaders, those few good men and women willing to fight with passion and stand on principle to make a difference for the next generation?

HEADLINE: The Coming Search Wars 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif. 

 BODY:
AT the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week, Microsoft, the software heavyweight, and Google, the scrappy Internet search company, eyed each other like wary prizefighters entering the ring.
 Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, stated his admiration for the "high level of I.Q." of Google's designers. "We took an approach that I now realize was wrong," he said of his company's earlier decision to ignore the search market. But, he added pointedly, "we will catch them." 
 The four top Google executives attending the forum, at the ski resort of Davos, were no less obsessed with Mr. Gates's every move. "We had many opportunities to see Bill and Microsoft here in Davos," Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, wrote in an e-mail message to a colleague that was distributed to employees through an internal company mailing list. 
Microsoft is intently poring over Google's portfolio of patents, hunting for potential vulnerabilities, Mr. Schmidt contended. And because Google is running its business using Linux -- the free open source software that has become the biggest challenger of Windows -- Microsoft is concerned that it may be at a competitive disadvantage. "Based on their visceral reactions to any discussions about 'open source,"' Mr. Schmidt wrote in his e-mail message, "they are obsessed with open source as a business model."
Get ready for Microsoft vs. Silicon Valley, Round 2. 
The last time around, in the mid-1990's, Netscape Communications, another brash, high-tech start-up from the Bay Area, commercialized the Web browser, touching off the dot-com gold rush. The company told anyone who would listen that its newfangled software program would reduce Microsoft's flagship Windows operating system to a "slightly buggy set of device drivers." 
As it turned out, Microsoft -- based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, far from Silicon Valley, the heart of the nation's technology industry -- was listening.
Mr. Gates, belatedly waking up to the threat that the Internet posed to his business, aimed Microsoft's firepower at Netscape and flattened his rival, which was later acquired by America Online and is now a shadow of its former self in an obscure corner of Time Warner. 
As a consequence, however, he brought a federal antitrust lawsuit down upon his company, raising the specter of a Microsoft breakup. In the end, Microsoft escaped with little more than a requirement that it operate under a relatively mild court-ordered consent decree.
Today, nearly everyone in Silicon Valley, from venture capitalists and chip engineers to real estate agents and restaurateurs, has begun to ask: Will Google become the next Netscape? 
Mr. Gates, who for more than a decade has promised -- but not yet delivered -- "information at your fingertips" for his customers, has decided that the Internet search business is both a serious threat and a valuable opportunity. 
The co-founder and now the chief software architect of his company, Mr. Gates readily acknowledges these days that Microsoft "blew it" in the market for Internet search. Despite his early grand vision, he displayed little inclination to deploy software that would improve the ability of computer users to find information -- until he saw the dollars in the business.
THAT opportunity fell to two Stanford computer science graduate students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who disregarded the industry's common wisdom that search technology would become an inexpensive, marginal commodity. 
While the Internet's dominant companies fought one another over Web portals, the promise of e-commerce and access to providers like America Online, Google developed a speedy search engine that soon became almost a universal first step onto the Internet. It displaced earlier search engines because the technology invented by Mr. Brin and Mr. Page did a measurably better job in returning results that satisfied Web surfers' requests.
As a result, Google now has an immense number of users, with 200 million searches on an average day. That gives it a great advantage over its competitors, which are now trying to catch up. 
"The system that has the most users benefits the most," said Nancy Blachman, a computer scientist and author of an independent guide to using Google (www.googleguide.com). "Microsoft faces a tremendous challenge because Google fine-tunes its system by watching how users adjust their queries."
But Google has done more than develop a smart new technology. Unlike many dot-com flameouts of the 1990's, it has also figured out how to turn it into a highly profitable business. The company demonstrated that focused ads based on key words related to Web surfers' search requests are the most effective form of online advertising.
That has ignited a three-way battle among Microsoft and its two Silicon Valley rivals: Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., and Google, whose headquarters are nearby, in Mountain View. Underscoring the importance of search engines to Internet advertising, Yahoo recently said it planned to end its exclusive reliance on Google for search results and had established its own research lab to try to cut its new rival's lead.
Google's financial success is clear. In 2001, the company had virtually no revenue; in the past year, it recorded sales of almost $1 billion and profits of about $350 million, according to several executives familiar with the company's private financial figures. 
As for Microsoft, its executives have already begun boasting about sharp revenue growth from Internet advertising from its MSN partnership with Overture, now a Yahoo division, which also pioneered Web search advertising. In its second fiscal quarter that ended on Dec. 31, Microsoft reported $292 million in online advertising, an increase of 47 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. The company has said that its overall online advertising revenue, which includes sources beyond search ads, reached $1 billion in the past year.
Later this year, Microsoft is expected to unveil its own search technology, which Mr. Gates says will help Microsoft catch up with Google. Last week, Microsoft released a test version of a special set of software buttons for its browser designed to direct users to its MSN search and related services. For Google, though, the greater threat is that Microsoft will decide that Internet search, like the Web browser before it, should be an integral part of future versions of the Windows operating system.
For the moment, though, Google's lead seems formidable. Last year, Rick Rashid, a Microsoft vice president in charge of the company's research division, came to its outpost in Silicon Valley to give a demonstration of an experimental Microsoft Research search engine. Shortly afterward, however, Mike Burrows, one of the original pioneers of Internet search at Digital Equipment who later helped design Microsoft's experimental search engine, quietly defected. He joined Google.
But even if it can protect its technological lead, will Google still succumb to Microsoft's marketing muscle?
Google shares the intense Silicon Valley work ethic that characterized companies like Netscape. Its new headquarters, on a spacious campus once occupied by SGI, a computer maker, are just across the freeway from Netscape's original base.
But many veteran Silicon Valley executives are skeptical about Google's ability to hold its corporate culture together once it goes public later this year. The initial public offering, much anticipated, is expected to create hundreds of instant multimillionaires among its regular employees, but will leave many others hired as contractors without significant gains. As a result, some people fret that Google is fostering a class society in its ranks.
So far, though, the disaffection is limited largely to the company's Adwords business, which is aimed at creating and placing its focused search advertising. That operation has grown rapidly with temporary workers. "The Adwords environment is brutal," one Google executive said.
Clearly, though, keeping its ebullient esprit de corps so robust after the I.P.O. will be difficult, say those who have gone through similar roller-coaster rides in Silicon Valley.
"The challenge Google faces is figuring out how to retain a high rate of innovation" in the face of a disruptive event like the I.P.O., said a former Netscape executive, who also worries that the two young founders, for all their brilliance, may not fit well into the kind of management team needed to run Google as a fast-growing public company.
Although Google has clear vulnerabilities, Microsoft is seen in Silicon Valley as a powerful but not particularly creative competitor. Beyond its core business in Office and Windows, Microsoft has no major recent successes to point to -- but it has a growing list of disappointments. These include its Xbox video game player and Ultimate TV set-top box.
In other words, rivals have fought Microsoft and lived to tell about it. "At TiVo, we managed to stare down that $40 billion barrel," said Stewart Alsop, a venture capitalist who helped finance the creation of TiVo's digital video recorder, which allows TV viewers to easily record hours of video programming for viewing at other times. "We dodged that particular bullet," Mr. Alsop said, when Microsoft "shut down Ultimate TV and got out of the business."
Other executives who compete with Microsoft said Google's position might be more defensible than Microsoft executives believe.
"The good news for Google is that what they do has many branches," said Rob Glaser, the chief executive of RealNetworks, which competes with Microsoft in the software for playing video and digital audio on personal computers. "It's not easily replicable in one step."
OTHERS say that even though the Justice Department consent decree is weak, it may still be enough of a barrier to prohibit Microsoft from making Internet search an integral part of the operating system in the same way it absorbed the Web browser.
"They can't undercut Google on price, and I don't think they can get away with integrating search," said S. Jerrold Kaplan, an industry executive who competed against Microsoft while at Lotus, the spreadsheet maker that is now part of I.B.M. 
As it prepares its public offering, Google is trying to avoid Netscape's fate by remaining focused on its own measures of customer satisfaction. On computers at Google headquarters, the home page constantly displays a graph reflecting how well Google does on searches, compared with its competitors. Even the slightest dip in performance creates alarm, a company executive said.
Google has also brought in a Silicon Valley veteran, William V. Campbell, the chairman of Intuit, to serve as a consultant. His gospel for Googlers, as employees refer to themselves, is this: Ignore Microsoft's impending arrival as a competitor and focus on the customer.
Good luck. Microsoft has already begun a recruitment campaign aimed at demoralizing Google employees, several Google executives said. Microsoft recruiters have been calling Google employees at home, urging them to join Microsoft and suggesting that their stock options will lose value once Microsoft enters the search market in a serious way.
"Our approach has been to seek out the best and brightest talent," said Lisa Gurry, a lead product manager at MSN. "Beyond that, I can't add anything."
Google executives also say they believe that Microsoft is systematically pursuing Web sites downgraded by Google, which punishes companies for trying to manipulate their rankings. The company is striking partnerships with unhappy Google customers.
Microsoft is currently relying on Overture for its paid search listings, Ms. Gurry said.
But Google is hardly standing still. As Mr. Gates himself has acknowledged, it has marshaled a remarkable collection of technologists. They are focused both on keeping the company's lead in search technology and on developing a range of new services.
To help their work, Google has been quietly developing what industry experts consider to be the world's largest computing facility. Last spring, Google had more than 50,000 computers distributed in over a dozen computer centers around the world. The number topped 100,000 by Thanksgiving, according to a person who has detailed knowledge of the Google computing data center. The company is placing a significant bet that Microsoft will be hard pressed to match its response time to the ever increasing torrent of search requests.
Besides the additional computing firepower, Google has a wide-ranging list of new services that it will roll out as competition with Microsoft and Yahoo dictates. For example, it recently introduced Orkut, a social networking service intended to compete with Friendster, LinkedIn and others. Still under wraps is an electronic mail service that will have an advertising component.
The company has also been pushing hard to find new sources of information to index, beyond material that is already stored in a digital form. In December, it began an experiment with book publishers to index parts of books, reviews and other bibliographic information for Web surfers. 
And Google has embarked on an ambitious secret effort known as Project Ocean, according to a person involved with the operation. With the cooperation of Stanford University, the company now plans to digitize the entire collection of the vast Stanford Library published before 1923, which is no longer limited by copyright restrictions. The project could add millions of digitized books that would be available exclusively via Google. 
ON the marketing side, the company is racing to build its strengths overseas. Wayne Rosing, vice president for engineering at Google, has been chosen to travel the world, weaving the company's search engine into local economies and local technologies. It is concentrating initially on 12 countries. 
Mr. Page, the Google co-founder, is even trying to persuade Mr. Schmidt, the veteran Silicon Valley executive recruited from Novell Inc., to run Google, and others in the company to market a phone with a built-in custom personal digital assistant intended to let Web surfers use Google from anywhere.
For all of Google's hyperactivity, there is still a lingering sense among many Silicon Valley veterans that they have seen this movie before. The company may not have Netscape's arrogance, but it is still not clear that all of its clever marketing, technology and brand identification can withstand Microsoft's onslaught when it arrives.
After all, just as Silicon Valley has learned from some of its errors, so has Mr. Gates. In Davos, Mr. Gates ruefully acknowledged that Google "kicked our butts," reminding him of what Microsoft itself was like two decades ago. 
"Our strategy was to do a good job on the 80 percent of common queries and ignore the other stuff," he said. But "it's the remaining 20 percent that counts," he added, "because that's where the quality perception is."
He promised not to make that mistake again.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday described the coming battle between Google and Microsoft over the Internet search business. It quoted Nancy Blachman, a computer scientist, as saying that Google had an advantage in the race because it had the most current users. The article also identified Ms. Blachman as the author of an independent guide to using Google but should have noted that Ms. Blachman, though not affiliated with that company, is married to a Google software engineer.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Eases Stand on Philharmonic 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Lincoln Center has backed away from the hard-line stance it adopted toward the New York Philharmonic when the orchestra announced last year that it was merging with Carnegie Hall.
 The center is no longer arguing that the orchestra violated its contract when it said it intended to leave Avery Fisher Hall for Carnegie, a deal that fell apart in October. Two weeks ago the center withdrew a list of demands it was seeking to impose on the Philharmonic after the orchestra rejected them as a starting point for contract negotiations. 
 Lincoln Center had been widely expected to make the orchestra pay a price for its flirtation with Carnegie Hall. Instead the center appears to be the one trying to make amends, and the Philharmonic, rather than being weakened and chastened, continues to show a strong hand. 
The Philharmonic demonstrated its regained bargaining power Jan. 14 when it abruptly called off a meeting between representatives of each organization because it was unhappy about a list of new contract terms it had just received from Lincoln Center. The center's chairman, Bruce Crawford, said he then promptly called the Philharmonic's chairman, Paul B. Guenther, to head off any further rupture.
"All I attempted to do is say, 'Let's get on with this thing,' " Mr. Crawford said.
The two agreed to set aside the list of terms, which included a proposal that the orchestra cover a bigger share of any deficit for Avery Fisher Hall, where it performs. In addition to being the Philharmonic's landlord, Lincoln Center does its own presentations in Avery Fisher; the Philharmonic covers a third of any deficit there and Lincoln Center the rest. There were also proposals on scheduling and ticket pricing.
Mr. Crawford and Mr. Guenther also decided to join the negotiations personally, hoping to expedite them. "We're getting into it so that we can accelerate," Mr. Crawford said. "I don't think any of us felt that it was moving fast enough."
Mr. Guenther was out of the country last week and unavailable for comment.
In addition, the orchestra has been invited back into the discussions about Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan, talks it had been excluded from since the proposed merger with Carnegie was announced. 
This conciliatory, collaborative approach is striking given that Lincoln Center had begun to pursue legal action on the grounds that the Philharmonic had violated its constituency agreement, the contract that governs each of the 12 groups on the Lincoln Center campus. "The constituency agreement has been breached by virtue of the New York Philharmonic's decision to go to Carnegie Hall," Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, said in August, two months after the Philharmonic's plans to move first came to light.
Even after the merger fell through and the Philharmonic agreed to stay put, Lincoln Center maintained that the constituency agreement had been nullified by the orchestra's announced departure and that a new one must therefore be negotiated. 
In October Mr. Crawford said Lincoln Center would seek to make the terms of the constituency agreement tougher. "The constituency agreement between the Philharmonic and Lincoln Center is a contract that states that in exchange for certain privileges and obligations, the Philharmonic won't perform anywhere else in New York through 2011," he said at the time. "We'll sit down and talk about privileges and obligations and work things out for the future."
The Philharmonic, however, has insisted that because it never left, its contract with Lincoln Center was never breached.
Last week Mr. Levy confirmed that Lincoln Center had abandoned its legal action. "These discussions are aimed toward creating a more up-to-date, more constructive, more forward-looking document," he said. "It's being worked on in a spirit in which interpretations of past events are simply not relevant."
Because the agreement was drawn up about 40 years ago and has never been revised more than slightly, it does not reflect the changes that have taken place since then, among them that Lincoln Center has stepped up its role as a presenter, through the Lincoln Center Festival and the Great Performers series, for example.
It is unclear what the current attempt at a more amicable approach will mean for the agreement. Mr. Crawford said talks would ultimately result in "mutually agreed-upon revisions that will lead to a new constituency agreement." But Zarin Mehta, executive director of the Philharmonic, said he expected the agreement to remain intact. "As far as we're concerned, it stands," he said. "You can make some amendments as circumstances change."
The rapprochment between Mr. Crawford and Mr. Guenther is noteworthy given that Mr. Crawford had been blindsided by the Philharmonic's decision to go to Carnegie Hall and was not expected to have further dealings with Mr. Guenther, a stance that necessitated the appointment of the two representatives for each side. Many Lincoln Center officials predicted after the merger fell through that Mr. Guenther would be forced to step down.
Yet Mr. Guenther is still standing. And Mr. Crawford essentially has said, let bygones be bygones. "Paul and I thought we've got to set a positive tone," he said.
That is not to say all matters have been resolved. The two sides are bound to clash over various issues regarding the management and renovation of Avery Fisher Hall. After conducting a study on the economics of producing classical music, Lincoln Center is interested in exploring variable pricing so that tickets cost less on certain nights of the week or people get discounts for buying tickets to several different events at the hall. Lincoln Center is also seeking more advance notice from the Philharmonic on scheduling so that it can better plan its own programming. 
Mr. Levy said he was open to leaving certain provisions as is, like the percentage of financial responsibility. "If we switch positions, it could be seen as an opportunity or a burden," Mr. Levy said. "Either one is fine with me. If the Philharmonic prefers we stay with two-thirds, that's fine."

HEADLINE: Redefining the Boundaries Of Florida's Space Coast 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: TITUSVILLE, Fla. 

 BODY:
A sign welcoming visitors to this faded town proclaims it "Space City, U.S.A.," but even before the shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas last February, the description fit less and less.
 True, the town could still count on tourists by the tens of thousands coming to watch shuttle launchings from its restaurants, parks and hotels. But the golden years of the Apollo program, when Titusville was a thriving bedroom community for the still-young Kennedy Space Center, were long gone. 
 The economic havoc that followed the demise of NASA's lunar landing program in 1972 and the Challenger shuttle explosion in 1986 taught Titusville and the rest of the Space Coast, as this strip of Florida breathlessly christened itself in the 1960's, that the space industry was no bedrock. And so the Space Coast has worked to become much more than its name suggests. 
"We've grown up around the space center and there are still a lot of ties," said Walt Johnson, executive director of the Space Coast Economic Development Commission, whose aim is to attract new industry though its logo remains a shuttle circling Florida. "But we've worked diligently to get other businesses into the area that aren't space-related."
The aerospace industry now employs only 18 percent of the work force here in Brevard County, according to the Brevard Workforce Development Board, compared with 28 percent at the time of the Challenger explosion 18 years ago and 56 percent at the end of the Apollo program in the early 1970's.
The space industry has diversified, too, with launchings of commercial and military satellites now far more common than those of exploratory spacecraft like the shuttles, which made 113 missions over 22 years before being grounded after the Columbia disintegrated re-entering the atmosphere last Feb. 1. The space center has also been busy, even hiring several hundred workers to help overhaul the aging shuttle fleet and meet other recommendations made by an independent board that investigated the Columbia accident.
Layoffs, which plagued many NASA contractors after the Challenger disaster, were minimal after the Columbia's breakup, Mr. Johnson and others who monitor the region's economy said. 
Still, people here are longing for the day a soaring shuttle again stirs awe from places like Paul's Smokehouse, a restaurant in Titusville, just across the Intracoastal Waterway from the space center. This is, after all, a region whose residents lobbied successfully in the 1990's to get the nation's first vanity area code, 321, as in countdown.
"When it was going, this place was packed," said Rusty Williams, the host at Paul's, describing how customers would line up at the door up to five hours before a final countdown, eager to see, hear and feel the liftoff. "We'd charge just to get in."
Business is not bad now, Mr. Williams said, but nothingcomes close to a day with a shuttle launching.
With President Bush's proposal in January to send astronauts back to the Moon by 2020, and eventually to Mars, and the two Mars rovers' current mission, there is new optimism. Daniel LeBlanc, chief operating officer of the space center's visitor complex, said it had twice its usual 2,000 to 3,000 visitors on each day of the rovers' launchings last summer. And even if the next shuttle is not launched on Sept. 12, as NASA's tentative plan goes, there are unmanned missions to Saturn and Mercury to follow this year.
"Cool things are happening right now," Mr. LeBlanc said. "It's definitely energizing."
Still, some small companies that provide services to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are hurting. Russell L. Gray, president of Precision Fabricating and Cleaning of Cocoa Beach, which performs maintenance on shuttle launching pads, said he had laid off 30 of his 75 employees in the past year. 
"It has been very tough for all the companies in my position," Mr. Gray said. "We need work."
Businesses like Paul's sorely miss the tourists -- up to 150,000 pour into the region for each launching, tourism officials estimate. But most people interviewed said the Columbia disaster's impact on the economy was not nearly as bad as they had feared, because there were some positive things to offset it and the region is less reliant on the space program than it once was. 
The frenetic growth of the Orlando area is reverberating here, as development spreads toward the coast. In fact, for the first time since the Apollo era, Mr. Johnson said, Titusville is experiencing a small housing boom. Last year 373 homes were built here, compared with just 60 in 1998.
Melbourne, in southern Brevard County, has capitalized on the region's reputation for a highly educated and scientifically inclined work force to attract technology and military-related companies. And Cocoa Beach, a few miles south of the space center, has aggressively promoted itself as the surfing capital of the East Coast and the closest beach to Disney World.
Tourism at the Kennedy Space Center remains far below the 2.8 million people who the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau said visited in 1998. In 2002 and 2003, about 1.5 million people visited, according to Mr. LeBlanc, who said the dropoff was more a factor of the terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq than of the grounding of the shuttle fleet.
To combat the downturn, Kennedy's tourism operation has done its own diversifying, adding attractions like daily question-and-answer sessions with astronauts and a daylong astronaut training camp for teenagers and adults. The effort may be paying off: this Christmas season was the Kennedy visitor complex's best in years, Mr. LeBlanc said. 
Brenda Mulberry, who owns Space Shirts, a T-shirt store outside the space center, said the recent fascination with Mars was a rare bright spot in a few years of decline. Paradoxically, the Columbia disaster gave her business a lift two months last year, she said, as people hungered for commemorative items.
But the store suffered last Easter, usually the area's busiest season for tourism, because of the war, Ms. Mulberry said, adding that business had not boomed since 1998, when John Glenn returned to space. One of her shirt designs is of a rocket taking off against the backdrop of an American flag, with the words, "Return to Flight" and "Keep the Dream Alive!"
Like many others who live and work near the space center, Ms. Mulberry said she was skeptical that there really would be a September shuttle launching. 
"I don't see things happening now that would be happening if it were really getting ready to go," she said.
Yet while the center's empty viewing stands and darkened countdown clock had the look of relics one recent day, a construction site for a new operations building was bustling, as was work on one of the launching pads. In one hangar, technicians buzzed around the Atlantis, the next shuttle to go up. A sign overhead read "83 Days to Roll Out," referring to the time for the Atlantis to move to a more final stage of preparation.
Despite Ms. Mulberry's doubts about a launching date, she and others expressed confidence that the shuttles would return to space in the not-too-distant future, and that when it came time to build the new manned space vehicle proposed by Mr. Bush, Kennedy would thrive again. 
"The president's announcement put a time frame on it," said Mr. Johnson, of the economic development commission. "Everything we hear and know from every source is it's a when, not an if."
When someone delivered the latest issue of a Space Coast tourism guide to Ms. Mulberry's shop recently, she brightened to see the cover photo: a shuttle blasting off. The previous issue's cover was of a beach scene, which she said could have been anywhere in the Sunshine State.
"It's one thing we have that no one else has," said Mr. Johnson, whose office building sits next to a rusting mock-up rocket from the Apollo era. "We can look out our windows and see launches, and it can be so inspiring."
Though NASA has a much larger presence in Houston, where Mission Control takes over supervision of shuttles as soon as they clear the launching pad, people here think of their region's role as equally important, and more poetic. Mr. LeBlanc, from the Kennedy visitor's complex, grew dreamy when he spoke of it, saying: "It's the only place on Earth that man ever left this planet to set foot on another celestial body."

New Yorker Writer Accumulates Points In Corporate Circles

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
The career of Malcolm Gladwell, a writer for The New Yorker and an author whose book, "The Tipping Point" (Little, Brown, 2000), popularized the term to the point of ubiquity, may be reaching an inflection point of its own.
 Mr. Gladwell's theories of how change is often accelerated by "social epidemics" has been followed rabidly by many companies, many of whom have paid him to speak at their conferences. Now one firm has developed a "Tipping Points index," and has formed what it calls "a research advisory alliance" with Mr. Gladwell. 
 Last month, Simmons Market Research Bureau in New York sponsored the "Future of Information Summit," and Mr. Gladwell was the keynote speaker, talking about how 12.5 percent of the population "possesses social power in the marketplace." 
These "connectors," he said, are the people who influence others, whether to buy a new product or embrace a new idea. Now, Simmons announced, with Mr. Gladwell's help, it can find ways for companies to better reach that eighth of the population. 
"I wrote a sort of manifesto," Mr. Gladwell said, referring to his article in The New Yorker and later in his book, which described how crime, smoking and even best-sellers grow or retreat based on the accumulation of small events until a tipping point is reached.
"And you would feel sort of dumb if nobody picked up on the challenge. I'm happy that people are continuing to talk about it and I think that in the end, it all sort of redounds to The New Yorker."
At many publications, however, writers are prohibited from doing business with companies that they could potentially write about. Mr. Gladwell said that Simmons Market Research paid him for the use of his ideas and for speaking fees, but that he has no continuing business or consulting arrangement with the firm. He said he saw no conflict in speaking for and collaborating with various companies, even though he occasionally writes about business. 
David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, declined to comment on Mr. Gladwell's burgeoning sideline.
For the time being, Mr. Gladwell's dual career as both a marketer and a writer will continue. DAVID CARR

HEADLINE: A Lure to Leap Time Zones; 
As foreign phone carriers eye U.S., questions about potential for profit

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
As Vodafone of Britain and NTT DoCoMo of Japan mull bids for AT&T Wireless with an eye toward creating globe-girdling cellular networks, they may want to ask one simple question: Are people like Andrew Cole worth all the trouble?
 Mr. Cole, a telecommunications consultant in Boston, is part of a lucrative but relatively rare breed: the fewer than two million frequent international business travelers. He recently received a $550 monthly wireless phone bill because he ran up hefty per-minute fees while he was in Spain and Britain. 
 If a company like Vodafone added a North American cellphone company to its sizable operations in Europe and Asia, it could become the wireless carrier of choice for the global road warriors of the 21st century. 
But even Mr. Cole sometimes wonders whether there will be enough big-spending, cellphone-toting world travelers like him to justify a foreign carrier spending $30 billion or more to buy AT&T Wireless.
Mr. Cole, along with some other experts, recognizes that cost savings could be squeezed from phone makers and network suppliers. And the corporate bragging rights that come with controlling a major cellular operator in the United States are a powerful draw. 
Nonetheless, the idea that a worldwide seamless wireless network should be seen as a holy grail strikes some as being driven more by executive ego and the siren song of bankers promising overblown "synergies" than by sound economics.
"Whenever an investment banker says a deal is justified on the basis of synergies, I grab my wallet," said Raul Katz, director for the telecommunications practice at Booz Allen Hamilton. "In this case, it's not a big enough justification" to warrant the development of a global company, he said. 
The jockeying for control of AT&T Wireless, the nation's third-largest wireless company, is just beginning. Prospective bidders have until Feb. 13 to put forth formal offers. The company believed to have the most aggressive interest is a decidedly domestic one: Cingular Wireless, the join venture of BellSouth and SBC Communications. 
But with the help of an army of high-priced investment bankers, Vodafone, DoCoMo and Nextel are seriously mulling offers themselves, according to executives close to the auction. 
Just last week, Arun Sarin, Vodafone's chief executive, hinted during a conference call with analysts that he was considering going after AT&T Wireless. Executives close to the auction said that Deutsche Telekom, which owns T-Mobile, had considered making a bid, but decided against it. 
Two major factors are propelling the prospect that an overseas company could bid for AT&T Wireless. One is the falling dollar, which makes it less expensive for a foreign buyer to acquire an American operation. The other is that European and Asian wireless companies face saturated markets on their home turfs, making the faster-growing and less mature United States market look more alluring.
At the same time, some experts look forward to big growth in the United States in the use of phones to transmit data, which is more lucrative than voice. Since data transmission is higher per person in Japan and Europe, overseas companies could conceivably bring home-grown expertise to the United States.
Overseas companies "would like to be in the U.S.," said Nitin Shah, director for the wireless group at RHK, a research and consulting firm in San Francisco, "because it's profitable and, with potential consolidation, they'll be able to get a much larger share of the market in the future."
Those who advocate the idea of building one or more global wireless companies say that the virtues are clear. They point to the success of Vodafone, which has 130 million subscribers through investments in companies in Britain, China, France, Germany, Italy and other places. Vodafone also owns 45 percent of Verizon Wireless in the United States, but the interest is financial and does not give it any control over the company's operations.
On the other side of the equation, Cingular may have an even greater incentive than the two foreign carriers to acquire AT&T Wireless. Doing so would enable it to remove a competitor from the overcrowded domestic industry. Vodafone and DoCoMo could not expect to achieve similar cost savings because they do not have much in the way of overlapping operations with AT&T Wireless.
While the advantage of owning networks that span across state lines in the United States or European countries is clear, it is less certain whether such benefits will translate across the Atlantic or Pacific. 
Only one major wireless operator has ever taken the trans-Atlantic plunge: Deutsche Telecom, which in 2000 acquired VoiceStream Wireless for $50 billion. It was later renamed T-Mobile USA.
That investment has been an important source of growth for Deutsche Telecom, especially as its own business in Germany has struggled. But T-Mobile has remained essentially a separate operation and has never provided much advantage to global travelers. Indeed, roaming through Europe as a T-Mobile customer is not much cheaper than doing so as a customer of AT&T Wireless, which owns no networks abroad. 
T-Mobile charges 99 cents a minute for calls placed or received in most countries in Europe, while AT&T charges the same 99 cents but adds a monthly fee of $5.99. And in some countries, like Greece, AT&T's rates can actually be cheaper than T-Mobile's, depending on how many minutes a customer uses.
Apart from the question of courting international travelers, any company trying operate a network spanning multiple continents faces significant technological challenges. These obstacles, analysts say, limit the advantages of economies of scale. 
For instance, Mr. Katz of Booz Allen said, it is one thing to create shared customer service and network centers when two countries are neighbors, but quite another when they are separated by an ocean. Individual nations still need local accounting, regulatory, legal and sales operations.
Even in Europe, where nations are in close proximity and all of them use the same basic technology, the lure of growing across borders has sometimes led to costly mistakes.
Kevin Calabrese, an analyst for Argus Research in New York, said that several companies in Europe had been forced to return to government regulators expensive licenses to operate high-speed mobile data networks. Mr. Calabrese noted, for example, that a joint venture that included France Telecom returned a $10.4 billion license to the German government last year because it could not afford the operation.
Another major justification for Vodafone's interest in buying AT&T Wireless is that both companies base their networks on a technology called GSM, one of the two major software approaches to transmitting mobile calls. But even as some experts see reasons why Vodafone might be able to use even greater scale to drive down the price of GSM equipment, others warn that it might not achieve much additional savings because calls in the United States and Europe are transmitted on different radio frequencies.
In the end, of course, none of these complex calculations may really matter. If either the chief of executive of Vodafone or DoCoMo wants to make a big splash in America, he is probably not going to let a pesky debate over potential cost savings stand in the way.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Researchers seem confident that technology has made American workers more efficient. Now some think they even know why.

BYLINE:  By Steve Lohr

 BODY:
HOW much does information technology really contribute to economic productivity and corporate competitiveness? It has been a matter of debate for years. Efforts to measure technology's contribution tend to follow Sherlock Holmes's maxim on deductive sleuthing: When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
 That kind of reasoning has given technology a large share of the credit for the American economy's strong -- and sometimes puzzling -- productivity gains for the last several years. The gains cannot be explained any other way, it is said, so they must be the result of companies getting an increase in productivity from all that computer hardware and software they bought. 
 Yet this technology-by-default explanation is not very intellectually satisfying. Nor does it provide much of a guide to government officials or corporate executives as they make decisions on economic policy or business investments. There is something to the business adage that you can't manage what you can't measure.
Economists, business school professors and Federal Reserve researchers have been puzzling over the technology conundrum for some time. And today, the Information Work Productivity Council, an industry group, is sponsoring a gathering in New York of business executives, consultants and academics to discuss current research, case studies and future trends. The council says it is independent, but it is hardly disinterested since its supporters are major technology companies including Accenture, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, SAP and Xerox.
What is intriguing about much of the research marked for citation and discussion at the forum is how modest a role technology itself plays in the productivity gains studied. The wise use of technology, researchers say, is one ingredient in the recipe for improving the productivity of information workers, who now represent up to 70 percent of the American labor force, or 100 million workers, from customer service people in call centers to scientists in research labs. 
The main focus of recent study has been on what researchers call "organization capital." This asset includes a company's work practices and routines, its storehouse of corporate knowledge in computer databases and in people's heads, and even culture and values as they guide how a company operates.
In a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, Baruch Lev, a professor at New York University, and Suresh Radhakrishnan, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas, studied 250 companies and assessed the contribution from organization capital. In the paper, "The Measurement of Firm-Specific Organization Capital," published last year, the professors found that investments in organizational capital accounted, on average, for 71 percent of sales growth.
"How information gets communicated and coordinated in a company can drive organization capital," Mr. Radhakrishnan said, "so it is enhanced by information technology."
Much of organization capital is expressed in terms of work practices -- how things are done in a company. When blended with technology investments, certain work practices yield the biggest gains, said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The companies that perform best, he said, use teams more often than their rivals. They decentralize work that requires local knowledge and interpersonal skills like product design, sales and on-the-fly adjustments on the factory floor, and they centralize and computerize work that is easily quantified, like accounts payable systems and obtaining the lowest airline fares for routine travel. 
Investments in technology alone, Mr. Brynjolfsson said, bring little or no benefit. But he says that technology and organization capital are complements, reinforcing each other when used wisely together. "When you put organization capital into the model, it goes a long way to explaining the productivity surge we've seen," Mr. Brynjolfsson said. "It's not so much of a mystery."
The observation that it is learning how to use a technology -- more than the technology itself -- that brings economic gains is not surprising. That is the historical pattern, economists note. The electric motor, for example, was introduced in the 1880's but did not generate discernible productivity gains until the 1920's, when businesses reorganized work around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough of its day.
What is striking, however, is how large the investments in organization capital -- "computer-enabled assets" to Mr. Brynjolfsson -- are compared with technology investments. For example, one popular kind of technology-related investment in recent years at major companies has been installing an enterprise resource planning system to streamline and automate operations. Mr. Brynjolfsson estimates that in a $20 million enterprise resource planning project, the new computer hardware required costs $1 million and the software $3 million. The remaining $16 million is in organization capital -- redesigning work practices, retraining workers and other such investments.
John Seely Brown, former director of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, says he believes that recent changes in software technology could allow big gains in productivity and innovation. The opportunity, he says, is to move beyond the limitations of centralized systems for automating business operations, like enterprise resource systems. "Those systems are prisons," said Mr. Brown, who is scheduled to speak at today's conference.
The software plumbing of computing, Mr. Brown explains, is evolving, and so is Internet-based software for individual workers. Software systems built on Web standards, he said, can be used as pick-and-place building blocks, instead of the more formal hierarchical systems of the past.
Mr. Brown also points to the rapid development of what he calls "social software" like instant messaging, Weblogs, wikis (multi-user Weblogs) and peer-to-peer tools -- all of which make it easier for workers to communicate and collaborate online, almost instantaneously.
The combined result, Mr. Brown said, is information technology that can amplify social interaction and enhance workers' understanding of what is happening around them. The benefit, he added, could be to increase their ability to "collectively improvise and innovate."
That is a key to productivity and peak performance, according to Mr. Brown. Business, he said, is a lot like soccer. In soccer, there are some set plays, but the best teams also display a wealth of effective improvisation based on the players' deep knowledge of one another. "It's the same in the best corporations or start-ups," he said.
Mr. Brown insists that the relentless pressure of global competition and the migration of skilled jobs abroad adds urgency to the pursuit of technology-enhanced productivity gains. "We can get a lot more out of people here if we really tap into them as new sources of innovation and productivity," he said. "And we're getting the right kinds of technology tools to move this along.
"It's the only way we can compete."

Speech by GatesLends Visibility To E-Mail Stamp In War on Spam

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Should people have to buy electronic stamps to send e-mail?
 Some Internet experts have long suggested that the rising tide of junk e-mail, or spam, would turn into a trickle if senders had to pay even as little as a penny for each message they sent. Such an amount might be minor for legitimate commerce and communications, but it could destroy businesses that send a million offers in hopes that 10 people will respond. The idea has been dismissed both as impractical and against the free spirit of the Internet. 
 Now, though, the idea of e-mail postage is getting a second look from the owners of the two largest e-mail systems in the world, Microsoft and Yahoo. 
Ten days ago, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that spam would not be a problem in two years, in part because of systems that would require people to pay money to send e-mail. Yahoo, meanwhile, is quietly evaluating an e-mail postage plan being developed by Goodmail, a Silicon Valley start-up company.
"The fundamental problem with spam is there is not enough friction in sending e-mail," said Brad Garlinghouse, Yahoo's manager for communications products. 
The company is intrigued by the idea of postage, Mr. Garlinghouse said, because it would force mailers to send only those offers a significant number of people might accept. "All of a sudden, spammers can't behave without regard for the Internet providers' or end users' interests, " he said.
Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft have made any commitment to charging postage, in part because the idea still faces substantial opposition among Internet users. 
"Damn if I will pay postage for my nice list," said David Farber, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, who runs a mailing list on technology and policy with 30,000 recipients. He said electronic postage systems are likely to be too complex and would charge noncommercial users who should be able to send e-mail free. 
"I suspect the cost of postage will start out small and it will rapidly escalate," he added.
In the meantime, the big Internet providers, including Microsoft and Yahoo, in recent weeks have renewed talks that stalled last year about creating technological standards to help identify the senders of legitimate e-mail. That way, spammers would either have to identify themselves or risk that users would discard all anonymous mail.
But for the big Internet access providers, or I.S.P.'s, the prospect of e-mail postage creating a new revenue stream that could help offset the cost of their e-mail systems is undeniably attractive.
"Sending large volumes of e-mail involve costs that are paid for by the I.S.P.'s and eventually by consumers," said Linda Beck, executive vice president for operations at EarthLink. "Should there be some sort of financial responsibility borne by the originators of these large volume programs? I think there should." E-mail between private individuals, she added, ought to remain free. 
Differentiating among classes of e-mail is one of the substantial technical difficulties that e-mail postage proposals face. In wrestling with this matter, academic researchers have proposed complex stamp systems in which each e-mail recipient sets the price for a message to enter his or her in-box. Mr. Gates talked at Davos about a system that would allow users to waive charges for friends and relatives. 
Goodmail, founded by Daniel T. Dreymann, an Israeli entrepreneur, is developing a system that it hopes will be easier to adopt. It proposes that only high-volume mailers pay postage at first, at a rate of a penny a message, with the money going to the e-mail recipient's Internet access provider. (The company suggests, but does not require, that the Internet providers share the payments with their users, either through rebates or by lowering monthly fees.)
The Goodmail system is designed to work even if not all senders and not all Internet providers participate. A mass e-mailer would sign up with Goodmail, buying a block of stamps -- actually an encrypted code number -- that it would insert in the header of each e-mail message. If the Internet provider of the recipient participates in the system, it decrypts the stamp and submits it to Goodmail. Only then is the sender's account charged a penny and the receiving I.S.P. paid the penny, minus a service fee by Goodmail for acting as a clearinghouse.
Senders do not pay for stamps that are not used, but they do pay whether an e-mail recipient reads the message or not. 
Under this plan, Internet providers would still accept incoming e-mail without stamps. But that mail would be subject to the same sort of spam filters in use now, which can at times divert legitimate mail. The Internet providers would deliver all stamped mail without any filter. Goodmail does not require that stamped mail be requested by the recipient, the so-called opt-in requirement of most other anti-spam systems. 
"The very notion that I have to get permission to send you a marketing message doesn't make sense and is not good public policy," said Richard Gingras, Goodmail's chief executive. Even so, he said that Goodmail would require mailers to verify their identities and to take people off their mailing lists if such a request was made.
This kind of approach would require major policy changes by Internet providers, which all ban unsolicited e-mail even if they have little ability to block it. 
In fact, some experts worry that big spammers will indeed pay the postage. Charles Stiles, manager of the postmaster department at America Online, said he was concerned that such a system might restrict the wrong mail, adding, "It is the spammers who are the ones with the big pockets."
AOL is taking a different approach and is testing a system under development by the Internet Research Task Force. The system, called the Sender Permitted From, or S.P.F., creates a way for the owner of an Internet domain, like aol.com, to specify which computers are authorized to send e-mail with aol.com return addresses. That allows a recipient's e-mail system to determine whether a message being represented as coming from someone at aol.com really is from that address. Most spam being sent now uses forged return addresses. 
Microsoft has been floating a similar proposal, labeled "caller ID," that could be expanded in the future to accommodate more sophisticated anti-spam approaches including Internet postage systems. Discussions are under way among the backers of S.P.F., Microsoft and others involved in e-mail to reach a compromise sender notification system.
All these proposals can run into problems because there are legitimate cases when mail sent by one domain claims to be from another. For example, online greeting-card services will send messages with the return address of the person sending the card, even though the message does not go through the sender's e-mail account.
People taking part in the discussion say that companies like greeting-card services may need to change their e-mail software to comply with the new standards.
"Every proposed scheme will break parts of the way e-mail works today," said Hans Peter Brondmo, a senior vice president of Digital Impact who has represented big e-mailers in the spam technology negotiations. The challenge, he said, is to find a system that will require as little retrofitting as possible to e-mail systems.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about electronic stamps and other proposed deterrents to e-mail spam misstated the affiliation ofDavid Farber, a computer scientist who said electronic postage systems were likely to be too complex and would impose costs on noncommercial users who should be able to send e-mail free. He is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, not the University of Pennsylvania.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Diagram: "An Internet Post Office (of Sorts)"Several companies have proposed email postage plans aimed at reducing the growing amount of junk e-mail, or spam, being sent by mass e-mailers. Here is one example. Buying stampsThe e-mail stamp, an encrypted code number that identifies the sender, is attached to the header of an e-mail. The stamps are sold in bulk by a stamp clearinghouse for about a penny a stamp. Sending mailWith stamps from the clearing house attached to its emails, the sender sends its mail to be delivered. Participating I.S.P.'s agree to deliver all stamped e-mails, unfiltered, to their recipients. Unstamped e-mails are run through existing spam filters where they may or may not be filtered out before being delivered. Getting paidThe I.S.P. decrypts the stamps, identifying the senders and counts the number of stamped e-mails being delivered. The I.S.P. submits this information to the clearinghouse who then bills the sender for the appropriate number of stamps. The I.S.P. is paid, minus a service fee by the clearinghouse.

HEADLINE: Vote, and The Pols Will Listen 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
Henry Fernandez, who had come down from Connecticut to join other activists from around the country, was giving instructions to the busload of volunteers.
 He said: "The first thing you ask is, 'Are you registered to vote?' If they answer yes, don't believe them." 
 The volunteers laughed. Mr. Fernandez smiled, but he hammered the point home: "Even if they think they're registered, they may have been purged. You can say, 'We suggest you register again to make sure your registration is up to date.' " 
One of the biggest reasons politicians continue to trample on issues of crucial importance to low-income Americans -- issues like jobs, education and access to health care -- is the traditionally poor voting habits of that segment of the population. The percentage of people who vote (and the level of attention they get from politicians) rises steadily as you scale the income ladder.
South Carolina is a state with plenty of poor people. The Bush recovery went right by the Palmetto State without even stopping to wave. "It's like a depression down here," said Wilbur Collins, an unemployed factory worker. "The plants are closing so fast, the workers don't have no place to go."
Parts of South Carolina are economic wastelands. The jobless rate in some counties is approaching 20 percent. The median income for blacks, statewide, is less than $15,000, and for whites, less than $30,000.
The anxiety over the absence of work is pervasive, and in some cases heartbreaking. At a forum attended by all of the Democratic presidential candidates except Joseph Lieberman, a woman named Elaine Johnson told Senator John Edwards about her son, Darius. She said she gave Darius three choices: go to college, get a job or join the military. He tried college, but that didn't work out. "He wasn't ready for college," his mother said. He couldn't find a job. So he joined the Army and was killed in Iraq.
Ms. Johnson told Senator Edwards that young people should go into the military because they really want to, not because they've been unable to find a civilian job.
The candidates forum was sponsored by the Center for Community Change, an organization that was started more than three decades ago by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Fund and that is now coordinating the activities of local groups from around the country in an effort to sharply increase the political clout of low-income people. The cornerstone of that effort is an ambitious national campaign to register and mobilize two million new voters.
The idea is to make low-income voters a force too strong to be ignored. A recent study commissioned by the center showed that small increases in voting by low-income people could be decisive in several strategically important states.
Most Americans are unaware of the extent of the suffering that has fallen on the bottom 20 percent or so of the population. Many low-income Americans are leading lives of grim and sometimes painful determination, struggling to survive from one day to the next. The contrast between the real lives of families sinking beneath the weight of economic distress and the headlines that continue to insist that the economy is doing famously is extraordinary.
"There are no jobs that can sustain you," said Fran Ruff, a Columbia resident who has three children and is trying to work her way to a college degree that she hopes will lead to a better life. "We're not living lavishly, but I'd like to be able to buy some snacks and go to a movie once in a while. All you can really get around here is a retail job, or maybe a job in an office. And just as a temp, with no benefits. It's awful."
The realization is growing rapidly among low-income Americans that their interests are not just being neglected but are under assault.
Deepak Bhargava, the center's director, said: "We want to convert the anger that people feel, and the pain, which is really extraordinary in this community, into a sustained campaign of political involvement. And that means registering people to vote and getting them to the polls."
I tagged along as the volunteers filed off the bus behind Mr. Fernandez. Filled with enthusiasm and good cheer, they began knocking on doors in a public housing project, doing their part in a difficult effort to coax enough people out of the shadows to bring change to a government that barely acknowledges their existence.

HEADLINE: Liberia Needs $500 Million, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Liberia will need nearly $500 million in stabilization aid after 14 years of nearly relentless war, the United Nations and the World Bank reported last week in preparation for a donors conference in New York this week.
 Advocacy groups have urged that particular attention be paid to disarming and reintegrating an estimated 50,000 former soldiers, a great many of them children, with a warning that a failure to invest heavily in peacemaking in Liberia would bring further bloodshed to West Africa. 
 The International Reconstruction Conference on Liberia, to be held at United Nations headquarters in New York on Thursday and Friday, is to bring together officials from international lending institutions and donor countries to discuss aid efforts. 
Liberia, the West African country founded by Americans in the mid-19th century, is facing its first chance of genuine peace since 1989, when Charles G. Taylor, an American-educated rebel leader, plunged his country into war. 
Mr. Taylor, who later became its elected president, was himself confronted by two separate rebel insurrections. Last August, Mr. Taylor left his country for exile in Nigeria. The country is now run by a transitional government composed of Mr. Taylor's former loyalists and former enemies. That fragile government is plagued by rivalries.
A United Nations peacekeeping mission is responsible for restoring order; it is still 6,000 troops short of its mandate of 15,000 soldiers.
Among the mission's most crucial tasks are ridding the country of armed factions, reintegrating former combatants into their communities and cobbling together a national army and a police force. That effort, which began last December, was delayed when disgruntled fighters rioted in Monrovia, Liberia's capital. 
The assessment of Liberia's needs by the United Nations and World Bank, released last Thursday, found that Liberia would need $487 million in stabilization aid during the next two years. 
In a report to be released Monday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch called for United Nations officials and donor countries to focus on rehabilitating child soldiers, including girls, who have been raped, conscripted as sexual slaves and enrolled as fighters.
The report urges donors, particularly the United States, to devote "sufficient funding" to rebuilding schools, paying teachers salary arrears and restoring the country's battered educational system. 
Human Rights Watch is also pressing the United Nations Mission in Liberia to investigate the recruitment and use of child soldiers by all three of Liberia's armed factions, in an effort to seek accountability in the future, including through a war crimes tribunal. 
In a separate report published Friday, the International Crisis Group, a research and advocacy organization, similarly urged donor countries and international financial institutions to provide enough funding to finance education and vocational training for the former combatants.
It also urged donor countries to commission an audit of Liberian government funds said to have been diverted by Mr. Taylor. That proposition is likely to cause political waves in a country with a fragile transition government. 
The United States government has promised roughly $200 million to rebuild Liberia. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, is expected to attend the meeting this week, as is his French counterpart, Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin.

HEADLINE: How to Win My State; 
In Missouri, Hard Soil and Straight Talk

BYLINE:  By David Doak; David Doak is a Democratic media consultant.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A Missouri congressman once declared: "I come from a state that raises corn and cotton and cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I am from Missouri. You have got to show me." More than a century later, understanding Missouri -- the state where I grew up -- begins with understanding the show-me mentality. 
 Missouri's soil is thin and rocky. Successful farming has always required grit and ingenuity. Although the state is now largely urban and suburban, the difficulty of making a living off the land planted the seeds of the state's populist character. Missourians are skeptical, practical, frugal, cunning and proud. Harry Truman was an exceptional Missourian, but not an unusual one. There is a little Truman in all Missourians: plain-spoken, blunt, intolerant of fakes. 
 Though I'm not affiliated with a presidential campaign, it seems clear that momentum is carrying John Kerry, and the compressed calendar makes him the favorite. But as he nears ultimate victory, he faces the dangers of high expectations. Presidential primaries are the twilight zones of politics, where a win can be a loss and a loss can be a win. 
To challenge Mr. Kerry, the other candidates must use the remaining hours before the primary to flood the state's media markets. Their goal must be to create a Kerry loss; who wins is less important.
Missouri is actually more culturally attuned to Howard Dean's bluntness, John Edwards's small-town populism, and Wesley Clark's resume. Mr. Kerry's strategy is to overcome this cultural gulf by turning his momentum into endorsements and news coverage. Establishment support matters in St. Louis and Kansas City, cities where the remnants of the Democratic machine can still deliver votes. 
But today, a candidate must also win the vote-rich suburbs surrounding these cities, and the quality of a campaign's advertising is often the decisive factor. There, Mr. Kerry's success depends on his ability to run advertisements that add texture to his profile as a winner by giving voters a sense of who he is. If he gets his message across, the money spent in Missouri will have been a smart investment, saving him from having to engage in costlier contests in New York and California.
The other campaigns should take the fight directly to the front-runner, just as the field did to Howard Dean before Iowa. Unlike voters in other states, Missourians often look for candidates who embody that famous Truman phrase: "I never give them hell. I just tell the truth and they think it's hell."
Missourians take pleasure in seeing someone get their comeuppance, and they can spot a fake a mile away. That's why the plain-spoken Richard A. Gephardt is so popular in the state -- he gave voice to Missouri's populist roots. And now that each of the candidates has embraced populism to some degree, the voters will scrutinize news coverage and TV ads to determine whose brand of populism is genuine. Like many states in the industrial Midwest, Missouri has suffered from the decline of the family farm and the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs. And, just as in communities across America, suburban families are being squeezed out of the middle class. After talking about foreign policy for months, the campaigns would be well advised to focus on the economy.
Tomorrow, Missouri is the place where John Kerry has the most to lose. A strong showing by another candidate would mean more there than it would in a state like South Carolina, where Mr. Edwards is a virtual favorite son. While a Kerry loss in South Carolina or Oklahoma would not upset the current dynamic of the campaign, a loss in Missouri could change everything.
Still, to make that happen the rest of the field must hope for a break -- and in politics, you never know. Mr. Kerry could make a colossal blunder like trying to claim that Ted Williams was a better hitter than Stan Musial. And any Missourian knows someone that dumb about baseball is too dumb to be president.

HEADLINE: How to Win My State; 
For Independent Arizonans, It's About the Details

BYLINE:  By Janet Napolitano; Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, was elected governor of Arizona in 2002. She has not endorsed any candidate in tomorrow's primary.

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential primary in Arizona tomorrow is a wide-open contest for the votes of a serious-minded electorate that is imbued with the West's trademark pragmatism, optimism and independence. What other state can boast of giving the nation leaders as diverse as Barry Goldwater and Mo Udall?
 Although Arizona's demographics are changing quickly, our voters remain proudly independent. A win in Arizona, a state without a favorite son in the race, would truly be a victory based on issues and substance. 
 Arizona is a fast-growing state with a rapidly increasing Hispanic population. With independents accounting for 22 percent of the electorate, no party claims a majority of registered voters. George W. Bush won Arizona in 2000, but Bill Clinton won in 1996. And while Republicans hold a six-point registration advantage over Democrats, Arizona elected a Democratic governor and attorney general two years ago.
What will it take to win tomorrow? To earn votes here, candidates should stick to the issues over which voters have expressed concern. Instead of Bush-bashing, tell us what you would do as president. Talk with us about your vision for an America that is changing almost as rapidly as Arizona is. 
Some issues are as important to the nation as they are to Arizona, but there are a few Arizonans are particularly interested in. Arizonans care about health care. Too many of them cannot afford any health insurance, and many who are insured have concerns about quality. Elderly Arizonans are demanding serious solutions to the crisis of escalating prescription drug prices.
Arizonans also care about our economy. While our unemployment rate hovers around the national average, too may people are out of work, and far too many people are forced to take dead-end, low-wage jobs with few if any benefits. Give us your vision to create a more stable and prosperous job base that will offer job opportunities to people of all skill levels.
Arizonans care about immigration reform. None of us wants to see hundreds of undocumented people die in the Arizona desert each summer, or hundreds of thousands more arrested each year for crossing into the United States illegally. Nor do we want to see a continuation of the federal government's incoherent border policy that allows this state of affairs to continue.
Give us your vision for an immigration policy that is fair and enforceable so the federal government can finally begin taking responsibility for the mess it has made of the international border with Mexico.
Unlike many of the other primaries, Arizona's contest does not have acandidate with a home advantage. That makes Arizona one of this year's first serious tests of presidential timber. A strong showing here tomorrow will be a powerful demonstration of electability in November.

HEADLINE: Budget Director Girds for Angry Congress 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Joshua B. Bolten, the new overseer of the nation's $2.3 trillion annual budget, spent two long hours last Wednesday in front of what he called the "murder board," a role-playing session with his senior staff to prepare him for the antagonistic questioning he is certain to get from Congress this week. At the same time, the staff prepped him for his grilling at a Republican Congressional retreat, where he faced objections from conservatives seething over what they view as a White House on a manic spending spree.
 "I don't mind being interrupted, as long as it's not too hostile," Mr. Bolten told his staff with a faint tone of hope. 
 Hostility is certain to be the order of the day on Monday, when Mr. Bolten, who has been director of the Office of Management and Budget for only six months, presents President Bush's proposed 2005 budget.
Republicans will attack it for running up a record deficit of more than $500 billion. Democrats will attack it for enormous cuts in domestic programs, including some that were once pet projects of the president.
Many of Mr. Bolten's old colleagues at Goldman Sachs describe him as a moderate, not an ideologue, and they question whether he is a true believer in a White House policy that asserts it is possible to increase spending on national security, make the president's trillion-dollar tax cuts permanent and still cut the deficit in half in five years.
"Yes, absolutely, I am," Mr. Bolten, 49, said in an interview last week in his office. "And this is not radical stuff, I want to emphasize. This is not some fringe perspective. This is serious budgeting, supported by sound numbers."
Mr. Bolten is the most powerful person in the Bush administration that most people have never heard of. As Mr. Bush's policy director in the 2000 presidential campaign, he helped create the economic program he is now carrying out. As the White House deputy chief of staff, his job until June, he effectively took economic policy away from Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's former chief economic adviser, who was fired, along with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, in late 2002. At the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Bolten replaced Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who resigned to run for governor of Indiana.
Mr. Bolten has attributes that have served him well in the Bush White House: discretion, organizational ability, political sophistication and, above all, allegiance to the president.
"I mean, I've done probably literally hundreds of presentations to the president in five years, and two or three minutes into a presentation I'll be interrupted with a question," Mr. Bolten said. "It's not personal, but it's awfully combative. He asks very probing questions, and he has a great knack for even in complicated subject matter getting right to the nub question that really goes to the presidential decision."
Mr. Bolten said he met with Mr. Bush throughout the fall to shape a 2,500-page budget that increases spending less than 4 percent. Mr. Bolten said the major players on White House policy were included in those meetings: Vice President Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser.
But the president, Mr. Bolten said, made the tough calls. 
"He gave the directions and said, 'O.K., I want a budget that funds these priorities and is tight otherwise,' " Mr. Bolten said. The result was a budget that increases spending on defense by 7 percent, domestic security by nearly 10 percent and everything else by 1 percent, which after inflation represents huge, across-the-board cuts.
The president, Mr. Bolten added, "usually decides on the policy first, and then the tactical decisions are made based on the politics. Now on the budget, I guess if I had said, 'It's just politically unrealistic to do options one and eight,' then he might say, 'Well, let's not mess with it.' "
Mr. Bolten is well liked by the president for what friends say is his wry wit and a devotion that often keeps him at work until midnight.
"It's kind of an odd bond," said R. Glenn Hubbard, former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a professor of economics at Columbia University. "The president is outgoing, athletic and gregarious, and Josh is not. But he is an effective organizer who delivers."
In the Texan-dominated White House, Mr. Bolten has become an insider with an outsider's resume: he was brought upinside the Beltway, in northwest Washington, the son of a Central Intelligence Agency officer who worked in the directorate of operations, the agency's covert espionage arm.
Mr. Bolten graduated from St. Albans, the exclusive private boys' school in Washington, and then Princeton and Stanford Law School. He has assets of as much as $4 million from his days at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for nearly six years in the 1990's.
As Mr. Bolten prepared for budget hearings before Congress this week, he said he would never describe his new job as pleasurable. "I'm not sure many budget directors say they have fun in the job," he said. "But it is a labor of love, because O.M.B. is in many respects at the fulcrum of government. So this is a terrific spot to be. It's not an easy spot to be."

HEADLINE: White House Says Congressional Estimate of New Medicare Costs Was Too Low 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Bush administration officials said Sunday that Congress had grossly underestimated the cost not only for prescription drug benefits, but also for private health insurance plans that would be offered to elderly people under the new Medicare law.
 When President Bush signed the legislation on Dec. 8, the Congressional Budget Office said it would cost $395 billion in the decade from 2004 to 2013. On Thursday, the White House put the cost at $534 billion. 
 Mr. Bush will try to explain the difference when he submits his budget to Congress on Monday. 
The budget is expected to show a record deficit of more than a half-trillion dollars in 2004, up from $375 billion last year. But the president says his policies will reduce the deficit to $364 billion in 2005 and to $237 billion by 2009, fulfilling his vow to cut the deficit in half in five years.
Administration officials said that Mr. Bush's budget would not include the costs of the Iraq war. Nor, they said, would it include the costs of restructuring the alternative minimum tax, estimated at more than $162 billion over five years. 
The minimum tax is intended to prevent wealthy people from making excessive use of sophisticated tax breaks, but it will snare millions of people with moderate incomes in the next few years.
Budget analysts say the administration's five-year goal glosses over the much bigger fiscal gap that looms over the next 10 years. The huge upward recalculation of costs for the new Medicare law has little effect in the first five years, because the new drug benefits do not become available until 2006. 
The same is true of Mr. Bush's proposal to make his tax cuts permanent. The cost would be more than $1.2 trillion over 10 years, but most of that would come at the end of this decade.
Mr. Bush is expected on Monday to outline a list of programs that would be cut back or halted. The administration plans to limit the rise in discretionary spending outside of defense and domestic security to less than 1 percent, which is less than the amount needed to keep pace with inflation.
Administration officials and Congressional budget analysts said that nearly three-fourths of the discrepancy in the Medicare cost estimates -- $100 billion of the $139 billion difference -- was attributable to the fact that the White House believed the new drug benefit would be more expensive than Congress had assumed.
About a fourth of the discrepancy, or $32 billion, results from the fact that the administration expects Medicare to spend much more on private health plans than Congress assumed.
The new cost estimate has touched off a political furor.
Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said he was "shocked and appalled" at the new figure. "We should reopen the bill and examine what is driving this cost estimate," Mr. Graham said.
Democrats said Congress should investigate the discrepancy to find out when the administration first realized that the bill might cost far more than the $400 billion sum proposed by Mr. Bush early last year.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said itwould be inexcusable if the administration had "concealed or withheld" such information from Congress.
The House and the Senate passed separate versions of the Medicare bill in June. Lawmakers haggled with one another and with administration officials last fall. Medicare actuaries continually developed and revised cost estimates.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said Friday: "Congressional staff knew our actuarial numbers. Our actuaries communicated with the Congressional Budget Office throughout the negotiations. There was no attempt to keep our number camouflaged."
Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said, "We repeatedly asked the actuaries for cost estimates and other analysis of the Medicare bill, but the administration refused to release the information."
The administration now says the actuaries' cost estimates have been over $500 billion since last summer.
A Medicare official said, "If the administration had owned up to its cost estimates a long time ago, there would be a lot less drama now."
Christin Tinsworth, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said Democrats were hypocritical to complain about the cost of the new law, written mainly by Republicans. Prescription drug bills proposed by House Democrats would have cost $1 trillion over 10 years, she said.
Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona, said: "If we had failed to pass the Republican version of the Medicare legislation, some Democratic alternative would have passed. It would have been an unmitigated disaster, with an even higher cost estimate."
Administration officials and Congressional budget experts gave several reasons for the discrepancy. Republicans in Congress wanted to promote the growth of private health plans, especially preferred provider organizations. The new law authorizes extra payments and subsidies for such plans, which Congress assumed would cost $14 billion over 10 years.
But the Bush administration says the cost will be $46 billion, or more than three times as much -- partly because the administration assumes that many more people will enroll.
The administration offers several reasons to explain why the drug benefit will cost $100 billion more than Congress expected. The White House says that per capita costs will be 4 percent higher than Congress assumed, accounting for $16 billion of the discrepancy. Another $16 billion of the difference results from the Bush administration's assumption that more people will sign up for the drug benefit: 94 percent of those eligible, compared with the 88 percent assumed by Congress.
The administration also predicts that Medicare will spend more than Congress assumed on subsidies for low-income people, to help them with drug costs not covered by Medicare. 
The Congressional Budget Office said the subsidies would cost $192 billion over 10 years. The administration says the cost will be higher by $47 billion, or 24 percent.
Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a lobby for insurers, said the new estimates boded well for beneficiaries.
"If it's true that more people take advantage of low-income subsidies and more people enroll in private plans, they'll get more benefits," Ms. Ignagni said. "That's very good for beneficiaries. We can help them stretch the dollars they spend on prescription drugs."
One big uncertainty for White House budget planners is the outlook for tax revenues, which declined in each of the past three years as a result of the economic slowdown and the collapse of the stock market bubble.
As recently as November, administration officials had been counting on a big increase in tax collections as the economy rebounded. But tax receipts have climbed less than expected. The Congressional Budget Office noted last week that corporate tax collections in recent months had been "weaker than analysts had expected, given the strong surge in profits."
Over all, the budget office said, it has reduced its estimate of tax collections by $15 billion a year for 2004 and 2005.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE HISPANIC VOTE; 
A Vital Bloc, Realizing Its Power, Measures Its Suitors

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW; Janet Perez contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The Arizona primary was less than 48 hours away, and John Ramos, a 38-year-old Mexican-American Democrat who voted for the first time in 2000, had still not made up his mind.
 "As a Democrat, I really am not thrilled," said Mr. Ramos, who runs a small construction company in South Phoenix with his wife. "I think a lot of us are the same way. I just don't see a real front-runner that I'm totally happy with." 
 With time running out, the Democratic presidential candidates are heavily courting the surging number of Hispanics in Arizona and New Mexico who are about to go to the polls in what some have labeled Latino Super Tuesday. 
The potential power of the Hispanic vote is clear: In Arizona, 25 percent of residents are now Hispanic; in New Mexico, 42 percent are Hispanic. 
And, like Mr. Ramos, many are tempted by Senator John Kerry's momentum and standing in the polls -- he is ahead in both states -- as well as his endorsement by some of the most influential Hispanic politicians here. But a lot of Mr. Ramos's Hispanic friends were leaning toward Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who has made a big push here over the last few days and who, like Mr. Kerry, holds appeal for the large number of Hispanic veterans in Arizona. 
Other Hispanics favored Howard Dean, who campaigned hard here early but then seemed to drop off the radar. Then again, a lot of other Hispanics Mr. Ramos has met as he registers them to vote were favoring Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who had even gone down to Nogales, on the Mexican border, and who seemed to be the most aggressive in courting Hispanics here, Mr. Ramos said. 
How Hispanics will vote remains unclear. Polls inArizona and New Mexico show a large number of undecided voters.
Mr. Ramos said he hoped he would be swayed by one of the candidates on Monday night, when all except Senator John Edwards and the Rev. Al Sharpton are scheduled to appear at a "meet and greet" forum in Phoenix organized by a prominent Hispanic civic group.
Mr. Ramos and many other Hispanic voters and political observers said the appearance of the candidates at the event on the eve of Arizona's moved-up Democratic primary would be hugely significant. 
"I totally appreciate the fact that they are courting Latino voters," he said. "Because it's about time."
The primary fervor here is new: this is the first time these two Southwestern states have had the chance to weigh in so early on the choice for a Democratic presidential nominee.
Some say the contests have thrust the concerns of Hispanic voters to the forefront of the national political dialogue. But several Hispanic voters interviewed in Arizona and New Mexico over the last few days were critical of the candidates, saying they had not reached out enough to Hispanics, the nation's largest and fastest-growing minority group, numbering roughly 34.7 million people, according to the latest census figures.
"The old days of candidates just showing up and doing a Spanish duet are over," said Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the nation's only Hispanic governor. "It's a new generation of Hispanic voters that need appealing to."
Voters, state and Democratic Party officials and political observers say the New Mexico and Arizona contests could set the stage for battle in several potential swing states in November, including Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida. 
In those states, Hispanic voters, who have historically supported Democrats, are now considered up for grabs by both parties. Voter turnout, historically fairly low among Hispanics, will be crucial.
And both Republicans and Democrats have made clear that they plan to court those voters aggressively, said Joe Velasquez, a deputy political director in the Clinton White House who is now a political consultant. 
"The Southwest clearly is going to be the place to be looking at," Mr. Velasquez said.
Sam Esquivel, who works at a hospital in Phoenix, has voted for Democrats and Republicans. Retired from the Air Force after 24 years, he voted for Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and, in 2000, George W. Bush, but this year he is supporting Mr. Kerry. 
Still, it was not an obvious choice. Like Mr. Ramos, Mr. Esquivel, the Arizona director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the group holding the Monday night candidates' forum in Phoenix, said he was wary of the candidates' promises on the issues most important to him: health care, rescuing failing schools, creating jobs and adopting an immigration policy that rewards the contribution of Hispanic workers to the economy with citizenship.
"We're skeptical," he said. "We're hearing every candidate, to the point that many of them learned to speak Spanish to attract the Latino vote. But many of us see it as a smoke screen. We appreciate that your efforts are there, but are you really being upfront with us? And are you really going to deliver what you say you are going to deliver?"
In Arizona and New Mexico, the number of registered Hispanic voters and voter turnout increased sharply between the 1996 and 2000 presidential elections, according to the Southwest Voter Education project, a Hispanic voter rights group based in San Antonio. In Arizona, the 304,000 registered Hispanic voters in 2000 represented an increase from 1996 of almost 30 percent, while voter turnout among Hispanics rose by 37 percent, according to the group.
President Bush won Arizona in 2000 by about 100,000 votes; Al Gore took New Mexico by only 365 votes. 
Hispanic voters are increasingly aware of their growing importance, but several interviewed say politicians often mistakenly lump together all of the nation's Hispanics, who they say have varying views on a host of issues. 
Several Hispanic voters also said they found the candidates' attempts to speak Spanish at campaign events annoying, especially when Hispanics eligible to vote were likely to have been born in the United States or to have lived here long enough to speak fluent English.
Mr. Ramos, who is a third-generation Mexican-American and is bilingual, said he had heard various politicians speaking what he called "burrito and taquito" Spanish and had found it insulting.
"I've seen them put on a sombrero and try to speak Spanish," Mr. Ramos said. "I don't care who it is -- Democrat or Republican -- they put on a sombrero, they say, 'Mi casa es tu casa,' and it just doesn't sell."
There is also a deep divide among Hispanics over immigration.
Some support President Bush's recently proposed plan to grant temporary legal status to illegal immigrant workers. Others criticize it as inadequate or say it goes too far.
Alfredo Gutierrez, a prominent Phoenix businessman, is a Democrat who is supporting Dr. Dean and is the host of a popular daily radio show here, "Aqui Estamos" ("Here We Are"). He said the talk on his show and among his friends had focused much more on immigration than on the primary. 
"From the moment Bush made that speech, the community was electrified," Mr. Gutierrez said. "It's all we could talk about, what did it mean?"
"By two days later," he added, "this terrific expectation turned into anger, when people realized that it did not provide an avenue to becoming a citizen."
But several Hispanic voters said the president's plan was too generous and that they were frustrated by what they perceived as special treatment for newer immigrants. 
Others, like Al Quihuis, a Phoenix financial planner who is a registered independent, took a more neutral position. 
"I think this is a way for Bush to try to attract the Hispanic community," Mr. Quihuis said. "But I felt that it was a step in the right direction, recognizing the undocumented worker."
Mr. Quihuis said he would vote on Tuesday but was still undecided. 
"More than any other time, the Hispanic vote is really being looked at," he said. "I really hope we come out showing some strength in the community so people in the future will realize, 'Hey, yes, we need to recognize this community and make it part of this society.' "

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE NORTH CAROLINA SENATOR; 
On Campaign Trail, Edwards Combines Personal and Political

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; James C. Mckinley Jr. contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, S.C., Feb. 1 

 BODY:
John Edwards had finished describing his mill worker father and growing up in North Carolina when he brought up, as he almost always does these days, "Real Solutions for America," his 61-page booklet detailing what he would do as president. Mr. Edwards spotted someone in his audience with a copy the other day, and asked him to hold it up for the crowd and the cameras.
 "This is not pie-in-the-sky rhetoric," Mr. Edwards said. "I have laid out a very specific set of ideas for how we bring about these changes together." 
 In truth, though, Mr. Edwards, a former trial lawyer and first-term senator from North Carolina, is much more likely to show that booklet than to slog through the details in its pages. As he campaigns across the nation, drawing a portrait of an Edwards presidency, his has become a candidacy of broad brush strokes and biography, drawing attention more for his distinctive style than for substance . 
As Mr. Edwards described it in campaign appearances and in an interview on his campaign bus on Sunday afternoon, that presidency would change the nation's tax system to move the burden away from the earned income of the middle and lower middle class and to the unearned income of the wealthy. He would expand the nation's health care system to guarantee coverage for all children. He would create a new Homeland Intelligence Agency to guard against intelligence shortcomings that he argued have left Americans at risk.
But to spend time with Mr. Edwards as he moves through South Carolina, toward a primary on Tuesday that his aides say will determine whether he remains in the presidential race this year, is to hear a candidate whom many Democrats describe as the most compelling politician in the field. He is able to use vivid language and big themes to move his audiences in a way that none of his opponents, except perhaps for Howard Dean, have been able to do.
It is one reason, many Democrats say, that should Mr. Edwards survive the primary here on Tuesday and show some strength elsewhere, he may emerge as the only Democrat with a shot at stopping Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts after his wins in Iowa and New Hampshire.
"I'm talking about 35 million Americans who live in poverty every day," Mr. Edwards said Sunday, after attending services at a Baptist church, his voice cracking as he battled bronchitis. "I know why the politicians don't talk about it: because for the most part, these folks don't vote. I'll tell you why we should do something about it: it is wrong. You and I have a moral responsibility to lift these families out of poverty."
Later, here in this town in the woods of southeastern South Carolina, he presented the case for his candidacy in the personal, biographical framework that has come to obscure the details of the proposals in the booklet he put out.
"Listen to me: you are looking at someone who has lived this," he said to one of the relatively small crowds he has addressed in recent days. "This is not for me some talking point on a piece of paper. This is something I have lived with."
 His audiences have responded with receptions ranging from warm to enthusiastic. 
"I like the fact he is from a small town, that he wasn't raised in wealth, and he worked hard," said Linda Anaya, a firefighter from Santa Fe who heard him speak in Albuquerque on Saturday. "I think he has the passion, and hearing him speak he has a lot of compassion."
Mr. Edwards said Sunday that he had improved markedly as a candidate this year, a tribute, he added, to the nation's presidential nominating system, and an assessment that is widely shared in the camps of his opponents. He moved from behind in the polls to coming in second in Iowa, though third in New Hampshire.
If he wins here on Tuesday, and polls say that seems likely though hardly certain, he might soon be the only Democrat standing beside Mr. Kerry. "I think we're very close to a two-person race, depending what happens Tuesday," Mr. Edwards said.
Still, for those looking to gauge from his campaign what kind of president Mr. Edwards might be, the candidate remains something of an enigma. 
Asked on Sunday for his priorities in the White House, he responded quickly and succinctly. "Strengthen and expand the middle class, lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, and becoming personally engaged in rehabilitating our relationships around the world," he said.
Mr. Edwards said that he would seek to run a White House as free as possible of the encumbrances of the presidency, saying, for example, that he would institute regular town hall meetings, like the ones that have become a central part of his candidacy. "No ticketing," he said, meaning they would be open to all.
But after a series of major speeches on tax reform, health care and job creation, Mr. Edwards is more likely to talk about having specific ideas about what he would do as president than to say what they are. That has proved to be particularly true here in South Carolina, where he has returned with even more force to the details of his personal life, and where voters,unaccustomed to having such an important, early primary, do not push their candidates with the kind of detailed questions that Mr. Edwards and his competitors heard often in Iowa and New Hampshire.
He displays flashes of irritation at suggestions that he might be too young or insubstantial to be the leader of the nation. Yet there are times when he clearly seems more comfortable with the sweeping arc of his speeches than with the gritty details of the presidency.
Asked the other day on a bus in New Hampshire to describe his most significant legislative accomplishment during his five years in the Senate -- a not unusual query for candidates -- Mr. Edwards rubbed his eyes and searched for an answer.
"Well, there are lots of things that I helped lead the way with," he said. "Especially in the Senate, one person doesn't do anything. They always do it in groups. The investigation of September 11th, there are a number of provisions."
"I myself wrote some of the provisions into the laws that were a response to September the 11th," he paused, then added, sighing, "Hate getting asked these questions."
His wife, Elizabeth, seated across from him, chimed in, "Campaign finance reform."
"There are a bunch of things," Mr. Edwards said. "My Senate office will have all the stuff I debated on the floor and passed."
In the Senate, Mr. Edwards used the skills he learned in the courtroom after he was quickly chosen to depose witnesses and make arguments for the Democrats in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. "He's very genuine," said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, who used to jog with Mr. Edwards. "I don't think there is much artifice about John, and that's refreshing."
Mr. Edwards's record at actually passing legislation, though, was less striking, and he rarely talks about his work in the Senate on the campaign trail, with the exception of a bill on patients' rights. In that case, members of the Senate said, he proved adept at putting together a compromise, but final passage was blocked in the House by Republicans. It was the closest Senator Edwards came to getting a major piece of legislation passed with his name on it.
Similar luck met many of Senator Edwards's other legislative efforts. In 2002, he crafted a bill with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, aimed at pushing down the cost of prescription drugs by allowing more competition from makers of generic drugs. It passed the Senate but died in a joint conference committee.
Early in his term, he wrote several bills on domestic security and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a new agency to take the responsibility of stopping terrorism away from the F.B.I. None of his bills passed.
Mr. Edwards has also put himself in the somewhat tricky position of being a wealthy lawyer from Georgetown -- that would be the neighborhood in Washington, not where he spoke today -- who portrays a nation divided along economic lines.
At a forum in Columbia the other day, a questioner pressed him sharply on the disparity, asking how a lawyer "who made millions" could possibly understand the troubles of the poor and middle class of this state. The audience burst into cheers that appeared to stun Mr. Edwards, but only for a moment. He quietly returned to his biography, speaking of being born in a small mill town in this state, of becoming a trial lawyer bringing cases against big corporations, of being elected to the Senate before he turned 50.
"The answer is, the life I have lived is the dream that is being shut off for so many Americans every day," he said earnestly, the former trial lawyer talking to a hall filled with thousands of people, most of them African-American. "I grew up the way you grew up. I come from the same place. I spent 20 years in courts fighting for you against big corporate America, against big insurance companies. I will never forget where I came from -- and you can take that to the bank."
With that, the audience was on his side, cheering even louder at his answer than at the question, as Mr. Edwards exited the stage in triumph.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: MISSOURI; 
Left at the Altar, Missouri Seeks New Groom at the Last Minute

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts seems poised to win the bulk of Missouri's 74 delegates, the richest prize in the seven Democratic presidential caucuses and primaries scheduled for Tuesday.
 A victory for Mr. Kerry here, foreshadowed by all polls and expected by most local politicians, would bring the senator benefits well beyond the mere continuation of the winning streak he began two weeks ago in Iowa and continued last week in New Hampshire. Even if Senator John Edwards of North Carolina wins in South Carolina, where the race is close, that might be written off by many Democrats as a consequence of his having been born in the state. 
 Missouri is far from Mr. Kerry's base in Massachusetts. It is also one of the first states on the electoral calendar with large metropolitan areas -- St. Louis and Kansas City and their suburbs will account for nearly three-quarters of the vote -- and populous rural areas, too. It has a sizable African-American minority (11.2 percent) and a growing Hispanic population. 
In brief, it has most of the pieces of the American puzzle.
So whoever wins here can claim to have demonstrated the sort of broad appeal that any presidential candidate needs, and done so in a state that is certain to be a battleground this fall. Missouri has been hard-fought for decades, going with the winner in every presidential race in 100 years except 1956. President Bush carried the state over Al Gore by fewer than 80,000 votes in 2000 and has visited it a dozen times since.
Speaking Saturday at the Muehlebach Hotel in Kansas City, where Harry S. Truman rented a suite, Mr. Kerry seemed to be looking past Tuesday to the fall campaign. 
"I think they can hear you all the way to Karl Rove's office," he told a raucous crowd of 500, referring to Mr. Bush's top political strategist. "All those lobbyists. All those powerful interests that meet in secret at the White House. They hear us coming."
But for the state's voters, this is a phantom campaign. 
Jay Curtis, 29, a St. Louis bartender, soon to enter law school, said he had "not the faintest idea of what these guys stand for, and no clue about this election."
Missouri is an extreme example of the consequences of this year's hyper-condensed primary schedule. The candidates had only a week for campaigning between the voting in New Hampshire and the voting here, and many of them had already committed much of that time to South Carolina when Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri pulled out of the race on Jan. 20. Until then, they had all but ceded the state to Mr. Gephardt as a favorite son. 
An effort to organize a debate for Monday night collapsed because of scheduling problems. 
Television advertising is relatively inefficient in state elections here, because the coverage area of Kansas City stations extends well into Kansas, and the coverage area of St. Louis stations extends well into Illinois. 
Late in the game, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards bought relatively small amounts of television time, with Mr. Edwards allocating $120,000 to the state and Mr. Kerry $80,000, according to preliminary figures supplied by the campaigns. The two other major candidates, Howard Dean and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, elected not to follow suit, and Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards, who made fresh buys Friday in several other states, apparently did not do so here in Missouri.
As a result, none of the candidates is very well known or very well organized here, and momentum counts for more than any other factor, including candidates' policy positions.
"In my judgment," said John Petrocik, a political scientist at the University of Missouri, "most people will do what the information flow tells them to do. They've been forming their views when television and the newspapers have been dominated by stories about Kerry winning, Dean stumbling and running into money and managerial problems, and the rest not doing much."
So far, the polls suggest that Professor Petrocik is right. 
A poll by The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the state's largest newspaper, completed Friday night and published Sunday morning, made it 44 percent for Mr. Kerry to 14 percent for Mr. Edwards, with 19 percent undecided. Other candidates were in single digits. The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points. Two other surveys showed similar results.
Here as elsewhere, Democratic voters express intense interest in finding a candidate -- almost any candidate -- who could defeat Mr. Bush. Typically, Marian Brickner, a University City photographer, told The Post-Dispatch, "I want to vote for the winner."
In a state still deeply mired in recession, the economyis a major concern, especially in St. Louis, where the Ford Motor Company announced the layoff of 1,000 assembly-line workers in suburban Hazelwood last week. Cutbacks in aircraft manufacturing have hurt, and the severe slump in air travel has made one entire concourse at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport redundant.
On Wednesday, Mr. Edwards made flying visits to St. Louis and to Springfield, in the southern part of the state, where conservative Democratic allegiances go back to the Civil War. On Saturday evening, he spoke in Kansas City.
Mr. Kerry, also here Wednesday, made a point of reminding his partisan crowd that if he were elected, former Gov. John Ashcroft, an even more polarizing figure in Missouri than in the nation as a whole, would promptly cease to be attorney general. His brief stop in Kansas City Saturday was his last scheduled visit of the campaign in Missouri.
General Clark, who comes from neighboring Arkansas, has not confirmed a Missouri stop, although his local supporters have been talking about an appearance on Monday.
Dr. Dean's strategy perplexes Missouri politicians. He drew an exuberant crowd at the Missouri History Museum here Friday morning, with 400 people packing an auditorium and 250 more watching a television relay. One man in the crowd, echoing the 1948 campaign, yelled, "Give 'em hell, Howard."
But his campaign manager here, Richard King, said he would be happy to come in second or third, and the candidate's national strategists have conceded that he may win none of Tuesday's seven contests or even Saturday's two caucuses. 
Dr. Dean told supporters here that his goal was to win 15 percent of the vote, a very modest target for someone considered the front-runner until last month. If he does not reach 15 percent, he will be entitled to none of Missouri's 74 elected delegates, although he might get some of its 14 "superdelegates," drawn from the ranks of party leaders.
"He had an energetic group of volunteers here last year and early this year," said Jo Mannies, The Post-Dispatch's political correspondent, "but after Iowa there was no follow-up at all. Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
With the candidates largely absent, campaigning has consisted mostly of mailings, telephone calls, e-mail and commercials.
Endorsements by local politicians have provided further grist for the political mill, even if they have not changed the basic situation much. Mr. Kerry has won support from former Senators Jean Carnahan and Thomas F. Eagleton (who called him "the most electable" candidate), the mayors of Kansas City and St. Louis and two former governors. Mr. Edwards is backed by Lt. Gov. Joe Maxwell and Representative Ike Skelton, among others. 
Perhaps more important, Mr. Kerry was able to hire Roy Temple, an experienced Missouri political operative with close ties to Mrs. Carnahan, as state campaign director.
But Mr. Gephardt plans to issue no endorsement at least until after the primary, his aides say. Gov. Bob Holden, a close Gephardt ally, also remains uncommitted. Local television and newspaper coverage has been limited, even in the big cities, and yard signs and bumper stickers are few and far between.
"It's all very low-key," said Professor Petrocik. "You'd think political science students would be following the campaign avidly, but when I tried it on my class this week, a couple of them were unaware of the primary."

HEADLINE: The Farewell Dossier 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia -- all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss -- helped us win the cold war.
 Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president -- detente notwithstanding -- to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R. 
 Seven years later, we learned how the K.G.B. responded. I was writing a series of hard-line columns denouncing the financial backing being given Moscow by Germany and Britain for a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate $8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research.
President Francois Mitterrand of France also opposed the gas pipeline. He took President Reagan aside at a conference in Ottawa on July 19, 1981, to reveal that France had recruited a key K.G.B. officer in Moscow Center. 
Col. Vladimir Vetrov provided what French intelligence called the Farewell dossier. It contained documents from the K.G.B. Technology Directorate showing how the Soviets were systematically stealing -- or secretly buying through third parties -- the radar, machine tools and semiconductors to keep the Russians nearly competitive with U.S. military-industrial strength through the 70's. In effect, the U.S. was in an arms race with itself.
Reagan passed this on to William J. Casey, his director of central intelligence, now remembered only for the Iran-contra fiasco. Casey called in Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the U.S. and Japan, Weiss counseled against deportation. 
Instead, according to Reed -- a former Air Force secretary whose fascinating cold war book, "At the Abyss," will be published by Random House next month -- Weiss said: "Why not help the Soviets with their shopping? Now that we know what they want, we can help them get it." The catch: computer chips would be designed to pass Soviet quality tests and then to fail in operation. 
In our complex disinformation scheme, deliberately flawed designs for stealth technology and space defense sent Russian scientists down paths that wasted time and money. 
The technology topping the Soviets' wish list was for computer control systems to automate the operation of the new trans-Siberian gas pipeline. When we turned down their overt purchase order, the K.G.B. sent a covert agent into a Canadian company to steal the software; tipped off by Farewell, we added what geeks call a "Trojan Horse" to the pirated product. 
"The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire," writes Reed, "to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space." 
Our Norad monitors feared a nuclear detonation, but satellites that would have picked up its electromagnetic pulse were silent. That mystified many in the White House, but "Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell his fellow NSC staffers not to worry. It took him another twenty years to tell me why." 
Farewell stayed secret because the blast in June 1982, estimated at three kilotons, took place in the Siberian wilderness, with no casualties known. Nor was the red-faced K.G.B. about to complain publicly about being tricked by bogus technology. But all the software it had stolen for years was suddenly suspect, which stopped or delayed the work of thousands of worried Russian technicians and scientists. 
Vetrov was caught and executed in 1983. A year later, Bill Casey ordered the K.G.B. collection network rolled up, closing the Farewell dossier. Gus Weiss died from a fall a few months ago. Now is a time to remember that sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way.

HEADLINE: Whose Class Warfare? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman ("Red Ink Realities," column, Jan. 27) continues to document how the Bush administration's economic policies are skewed to favor higher income strata at the expense of the middle and lower economic groups. 
 The previous day, William Safire inveighed that when this is pointed out by Democratic candidates, it represents their engaging in "class warfare" ("The Kennedy Comeback," column, Jan. 26). 
So, let's see. Bush policies favoring one economic class over others is not class warfare, but pointing out that such policies are inequitable is class warfare. 
George Orwell would have loved this.

HEADLINE: Report Calls Recycling Costlier Than Dumping 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
Recycling metal, plastic, paper and glass in New York is more expensive than simply sending all the refuse to landfills and incinerators, even if city residents resume the habit of separating a sizable share of those kinds of waste, according to an analysis by the New York City Independent Budget Office that is set to be released today.
 The assertion by the budget office, a nonpartisan agency, is based on a detailed review of spending by the Department of Sanitation that evaluated both how much it costs per ton to get rid of trash versus recycling it, and, perhaps even more importantly, how much the overall trash disposal price tag would go up if the city eliminated its recycling program. 
 No one at the Independent Budget Office is advocating that the city discontinue recycling. But after a year in which the city at first scaled back its program and now, this spring, is scheduled to return to a full menu of recycling, the goal was to step beyond the politics of the debate and simply lay out the economics. 
 "We are just trying to look at the numbers, so people know what we are dealing with," said Douglas M. Turetsky, a spokesman for the Independent Budget Office. "We want to let people make informed choices."
 Yet the Independent Budget Office's conclusion--that recycling cost the city about $35 million more in 2002 than conventional disposal would have--is so controversial that even before the new report was set to be released today, advocates of the recycling program condemned the analysis.
 "We believe this report is deeply flawed and have discussed these problems with the I.B.O.," said Mark A. Izeman, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which is preparing its own report. "Unfortunately, it appears that they have not changed their analysis."
 Recycling in New York City has long been a topic that has attracted passionate debate, as environmentalists have argued that separating paper and plastic, for example, not only saves trees and other natural resources, but is also cost-effective. 
 That argument was used last year to convince the City Council and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to restart glass recycling as of this April, and to return to weekly recycling citywide, reversing what in 2002 the Bloomberg administration had argued was a budget-cutting initiative. The environmentalists had countered that curtailing the collection of recyclable goods cost the city money, a position that was backed up by a report last year issued by the New York City comptroller.
 It turns out that even the author of that report admits it had serious flaws, including inaccurate assumptions about how much the city spends on recycling. The new report by the Independent Budget Office, a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times, found that in 2002, when city residents were recycling 20 percent of their waste, an all-time high, it cost anywhere from $34 to $48 a ton more to recycle material, than to send it off to landfills or incinerators--depending on the accounting method used.
 The higher cost for recycling results in large part because collection trucks must travel farther, -- and therefore for more hours--to gather the same amount of material that a standard garbage truck would. Even though tipping fees at landfills are higher than the costs of recycling certain items--the city actually gets paid for its recycled paper--the collection costs are so high it overwhelms any windfall.
 "Simply put, the cost of paying two uniformed sanitation workers to drive an eight-hour shift collecting recyclables," the draft of the report says, "is the same as the cost of paying them for an eight-hour shift collecting trash, but yields fewer tons of recyclables than the same shift would yield tons of refuse. The result is a higher average cost of collection per ton."
 Some costs associated with recycling are fixed and would not simply disappear even if the city threw out all its trash. It is not fair to assume that all of the extra costs that recycling imposed on the city in 2002 would be saved if all city waste was simply dumped. But even taking those fixed costs into account, the Independent Budget Office budget office found that if all recycling were dropped, the overall cost to the city of getting rid of its waste would still be lower. 
 These conclusions, according to the draft report, would still be valid, although to a lesser extent, after the city starts a new, more attractive 20-year contract to dispose of its recyclable items than it had in 2002. In that year, the city had 3.1 million tons of trash and 796,000 tons of recycling material, including 407.000 tons of paper. 
 A spokesman for Mayor Bloomberg, Jordan Barowitz, said he was not surprised by the report's conclusions. "The I.B.O. report recognizes that evaluating recycling has to be based upon an analysis of the overall cost of the program," he said.
 Mr. Izeman said he could not refute the report's conclusions, but he questioned how the budget office arrived at its cost figures for recycling, saying that it unfairly included certain debt costs and did not fully reflect the more favorable terms the city hopes to get under the new contract.
 There are ways the city could change the balance of the equation. Because there is almost no market for recycled glass, the cost of recycling it is particularly expensive. So if the city did not resume glass recycling, the overall recycling program would be more cost-effective, the report shows. Also, if city residents were to recycle a significantly larger share of their trash, the so-called "diversion rate" could go so high that the program would start to make economic sense. The city might also find a way to more efficiently collect recyclable goods, or find contractors that either charge the city less to get rid of them or pay the city more for certain items, like recycled paper.
 But as it now stands, the program is a money loser, the report concludes.

HEADLINE: Stress of Harlem's Rebirth Shows in School's Move to a New Building 

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
To get a sense of the mixed emotions swirling around the building boom in Harlem, consider the Thurgood Marshall Academy, which is to move this morning to its new home at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 135th Street.
 The public school -- the first to be built in Harlem in 50 years -- has been praised by local residents who marvel at its spacious greenhouse, its wireless classrooms, its library stocked with 20,000 books. 
 But creating a new home for the school, which is moving from 135th Street and Edgecombe Avenue, has also drawn the criticism of local preservationists who complain that it and a pancake house would be taking over the spot long occupied by a famous Harlem nightclub. In addition, a neighbor's lawsuit maintains that poor construction put a six-foot sinkhole in her basement and destroyed her pipes. 
The second renaissance of Harlem has arrived, but it has arrived in a vortex of money, opportunity, new hopes and old resentments. Even as developers have brought in Starbucks, Disney and the Body Shop, not to mention scores of beautifully refurbished brownstones, many residents have cried foul play.
Perhaps no group has felt this shifting tide of anger and excitement more keenly than the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which built the school in partnership with New York City. As the development arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, which has served the poor in Harlem for 195 years, the corporation has been forced to walk a fine line between bringing economic growth to the community and remaining true to its community roots.
It has not always been easy. Abyssinian has struggled to create a balance between working successfully with big developers like Forest City Ratner while keeping an ear open to local residents who complain of changes in the quality of their life, like rats invading their block. 
"People recognize that because we span both worlds, it's exactly why you want to deal with us," said the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor at Abyssinian. "People in the community are intelligent. They want you to deal with people who have the large dollars. They just don't want you to sell them out." 
Harlem, particularly central Harlem, has changed almost as fast as Clark Kent changed into Superman. It is virtually impossible to spend five minutes in the area generally bounded by 110th and 155th Streets and Fifth and St. Nicholas Avenues without seeing a for-sale sign or construction van. While the boom has made it possible to sip your mocha latte on 125th Street, it has also chased an untold number of the poor and the not-so-poor from the area. Average rents in central Harlem have increased 45 percent in the last two years, some experts say, and the vacancy rate of 3 percent is the lowest in recent history.
The Thurgood Marshall Academy is just the latest project for the development corporation, which has grown as quickly as the neighborhood's real-estate market. Founded in 1989, the development corporation started with a $50,000 grant and a staff of one. It now has a $6.6 million budget and employs more than 60 full-time workers.
Its projects have ranged from the corporate to the communal. It has worked with Forest City Ratner to build the Harlem Center, an $85 million shopping mall on 125th Street with tenants including H&M, Marshalls, CVS and Staples. It has helped to bring a 53,000-square-foot Pathmark to the neighborhood. It has also built millions of dollars worth of housing for the homeless, the elderly and low- to middle-income families.
As Abyssinian has grown, however, so too has the volume of complaints against it. Jeanne Littlejohn, an artist and church parishioner who lives next door to the academy, has sued the corporation in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, saying that construction of the school has ruined her apartment.
"I'm at odds with my own church," said Ms. Littlejohn, who added that Dr. Butts had baptized her. "The church has been a salvation in our community with civil rights and everything, but this is politics and business."
The corporation has also taken heat from Harlem preservationists like Michael Henry Adams who have lambasted it for building the school in tandem with an International House of Pancakes in the building that Smalls' Paradise, the famous nightclub, once occupied. "Cultural genocide," Mr. Adams has called the loss of any trace of the club.
Beyond these complaints, there are broader concerns among local tenant groups who say they worry that as community developers like Abyssinian get larger, they will forget the people they were originally meant to serve. As a testament to Abyssinian's reputation, no group mentioned the church by name. Still, the message was clear. 
"Some community groups have lost their focus," said James Lewis, chairman of Harlem Operation Take Back, an advocacy group for Harlem tenants. "If you want to branch out into business and moderate-income housing, that's cool. But don't forget about the people."
Sheena Wright, the president and chief executive officer of the development corporation, says she could not possibly forget about the people. She spends a good portion of every day working on community projects like the corporation's Head Start program -- named one of the best in New York State in 2002 -- and its homeless shelter, which houses up to 25 families at any given time. 
Her development corporation was also asked in recent weeks to join a citywide campaign to pressure government officials into building more affordable housing. Representatives from the corporation, she said, regularly attend meetings of their local community board, which has asked the group to help create a neighborhood plan for early-childhood education.
If Ms. Wright is somewhat shocked when she hears complaints about Abyssinian, she understands what causes them. Harlem is changing. Abyssinian is taking part in that change. There is great fear in the neighborhood. People are worried that they might be left behind.
"There's a sense that the people who fought the fight for 50 years in Harlem, that their contributions aren't being recognized," Ms. Wright said. "There are people who stayed the course in this neighborhood, who made the contributions, who bled, and some of them are falling through the cracks."
"That's a tragedy," she said.
Abyssinian has powerful political friends -- among them C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and Randy A. Daniels, New York's secretary of state, both of whom are members of the church -- and that fact has added to the sense that the development corporation has swung too far toward politics and business.
Even local politicians who have spoken out against gentrification in the neighborhood have rallied to the corporation's side. "It may look like they are selling out, but I maintain they have not at all," State Senator David A. Paterson said. "Sometimes they act like a church, sometimes like a corporation. For the most part, I have been pleased with the way they have tried to structure decent and affordable housing. Actually, if we had more of them, there'd be greater opportunities to create moderate-income-level housing."
In the face of criticism, Ms. Wright remains an unabashed booster of development in Harlem. If Abyssinian refurbishes brownstones to sell to people in the neighborhoods, that's good, she says. If it renovates the old Renaissance Ballroom for the Classical Theater of Harlem or the Harlem School of the Arts and then builds apartments atop the structure, well, that's good too.
"It's all about wealth creation in the community," Ms. Wright said. "It's all about access to capital."
She said, for instance, that only 6 percent of the residents of central Harlem own their own homes. "If you own your home, then you can send your kids to school, you can open a business. The wealth in this community does not exist nearly to the level that it could -- and should."
Her vision of development reflects a broader vision of black neighborhoods like Harlem throughout New York. The central struggle was once the fight for civil rights, she said. Now it is the fight for economic parity. From activism to equity, that is the progression. 
Ms. Wright embodies this progression in her own biography. She is the daughter of Debra Fraser-Howe, the founder of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, and was steeped at birth in the civil rights movement. She grew up in the housing projects of the South Bronx, went to Columbia University at age 16, then on to Columbia Law School. She worked at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, then for a smaller firm specializing in private equity investment. 
She took over the Abyssinian Development Corporation in July 2002. Now her face graces the cover of the Winter 2003 edition of Harlem World magazine. "The Right Person at the Right Time," the headline says.
"When you talk about preservation and gentrification in Harlem, you're not just talking about bricks and mortars," she said. "You're talking about character, people, culture.
"Still," she added, "there's sometimes a balancing act -- and it's hard -- between doing what's best and doing what's right."

A Troubadour Travels in Circles, With Lives Tangled in His Own

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES

 BODY:
"What I do ain't exactly comedy, so if you laugh, you're as twisted as me," Stew rhymed to introduce "Stew's Travelogue of Demonically Energized Souls," his performance at the Thalia at Symphony Space on Friday night. 
 Stew appeared as part of the theater's American Comic Vision series, but he is a songwriter, not a comedian. His travelogue reshuffled his songs into an itinerary, starting in his hometown, Los Angeles, and heading to Aspen, Kansas City, New York and Berlin before circling back to California. Along the way he sang about heroin addicts, artists, poseurs and polymorphous lovers, tracing a bohemian picaresque with a clear but forgiving eye. His final destination was "L.A. Arteest Cafe," a place he described as an "unemployment line with espresso." 
 Stew, who is African-American, leads a rock band called the Negro Problem, but on his own he's closer to cabaret. Backed by Charlie Zyleskie on piano, Marty Beller on drums and Heidi Rodewald on bass and backup vocals, and sometimes fingerpicking an acoustic guitar, Stew set his tales to ballads, bossa novas and hints of Tin Pan Alley and Kurt Weill. Most of the time he sang straightforward stories about twisted lives: a couple trying kinky sex in a parent's home, a slumming heiress with "the scar and the switchblade mind," or "The Naked Dutch Painter" who has an ambivalent fling with the narrator. The character in "Re-Hab" goes back to drug rehabilitation two dozen times and never kicks her habit, as the song moves from gentle mockery of therapeutic cliches to desperate moments and an unexpected resolution. 
Stew is not a detached observer. His characters' lives get tangled with his, making for uneasy laughs and shifting sympathies. He understands the attraction of drugs and alcohol: "These magic liquids change the way you think," he sang in "Kingdom of Drink." He also touches on the odd behavior induced by racism: evasions, reflexive stereotyping, overcompensation. 
Onstage Stew was as much an actor as a singer. His voice is genial and adequate, but he had the rubber-faced presence to make each song vivid. He set up songs with droll introductions and turned himself into a secular preacher, a befuddled tripping teenager and a frustrated gay Ken doll who would prefer G.I. Joe to Barbie. Without cynicism or naive optimism, he understands human weaknesses and all the fascinating trouble they can cause.

HEADLINE: COMPANIES LIMIT HEALTH COVERAGE OF MANY RETIREES 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Employers have unleashed a new wave of cutbacks in company-paid health benefits for retirees, with a growing number of companies saying that retirees can retain coverage only if they are willing to bear the full cost themselves.
 Scores of companies in the last two years, including the telecommunications equipment giants Lucent Technologies and Alcatel and a big electric utility, TXU, have ended medical benefits for some or all of their retirees and instead offered to let them buy coverage through a group plan. This coverage is often more expensive than many retirees can afford. 
 Experts expect that the trend, driven by the fast-rising cost of health care, will continue, despite the billions of dollars that the government will distribute to companies that maintain retiree health coverage when the new Medicare drug benefit begins in two years. In contrast to pension financing, companies are not obligated to set aside funds to pay for retirees' health benefits, and the health plans can usually be changed or terminated at the company's choosing, with no appeal available to the retirees. 
The costs can be a shock. According to surveys by benefits consultants, companies that offer health benefits to retirees typically have subsidized about 60 percent of the premium. Losing that support all at once can mean hundreds of dollars a month in unexpected costs.
Moreover, in dropping their subsidies, many companies push retirees into insurance pools that are separate from those of younger, healthier workers, executives said. That lowers the company's costs for insuring its current workers, while raising the premiums charged to retirees even further.
James Norby, president of the National Retiree Legislative Network, an advocacy group that is urging Congress to strengthen legal protections for retired workers, said companies that charged for formerly covered benefits had found "a clever way of getting out of the contract they made to people who had been retired for 15 or 20 years."
Employers that are shifting costs to their retirees often present the change as a benefit: although the company is no longer subsidizing coverage, premiums are usually lower than for individual policies, and the retirees do not have to worry about being rejected by insurers because of their age or prior health problems. 
 The emergence of these plans "is a very significant trend," said Frank McArdle, a health policy expert with the Hewitt Associates benefits consulting firm in Washington. "Even though it's not subsidized health coverage, retirees, particularly early retirees under age 65, still have access to a group product that they could not readily duplicate on their own." Those with medical problems are often rejected by commercial insurers, he noted.
 But those considerations are little comfort to some early retirees. Eloise Bolt, 56, who took early retirement in October 2002 from her job as an information technology project manager at TXU in Dallas, said that she was "really hurt and really angry" when her monthly insurance premium -- which also covers her self-employed husband -- soared from the $100 she had paid when she was working. 
 According to Ms. Bolt, TXU said that the $100 represented 20 percent of the total premium, and that on retirement after 24 years with the company, she would be paying 60 percent. But instead of rising to $300 or so, as she had expected, her monthly premium jumped to $659, and rose to $725 this month, with a higher deductible.
 "The math does not work out," said Ms. Bolt, who abandoned her retirement plans and took a $9-an-hour job as a secretary to pay for the insurance. 
 Debbie Dennis, a TXU vice president, said that retirees' premiums were figured separately from those of active employees and then "segmented" within the retiree group according to age, length of service, medical history and actuaries' estimates of a person's future use of health services.
 When TXU trimmed its retiree benefits at the start of 2002, the company announced that all employees hired since Jan. 1 of that year would have to pay the full cost of health benefits when they retired. Like other companies, TXU -- which has 12,000 employees and 8,000 retirees -- is encouraging younger workers to save for their future health costs. TXU is promoting participation in the company's 401(k) retirement plan. It matches employee contributions up to 6 percent of their salary.
 "New employees can plan for these costs with money in their savings plan," Ms. Dennis said. "They will still have access to the lower cost of the company's buying power." 
 Last year, only 36 percent of companies with 500 or more workers still offered a retiree medical plan to at least some retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, down from 50 percent in 1993, according to a recent survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
 Last month, a study for the Kaiser Family Foundation by Hewitt Associates found that among employers that have maintained retiree coverage, about 15 percent have required at least some retirees to assume the full cost of their insurance in the last two years. Another 31 percent said they would probably adopt these so-called access-only health plans within the next three years.
 "Twenty years from now, no company will offer retiree health care," Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said. 
 Mr. McArdle of Hewitt said that the roster of companies offering retiree health benefits had dwindled as medical costs soared and employers encountered new competitors, both overseas and at home, that rarely covered retirees. 
 According to the Kaiser-Hewitt survey, the average monthly health insurance premium for an employee who took early retirement last year was $845, including coverage for the spouse. So early retirees who lost the typical 60 percent subsidy would face added costs of more than $500 a month. 
 The impact would be less severe for people 65 or older who are covered by Medicare; retiree benefits for them, when they are offered, are usually the equivalent of so-called Medigap supplements to Medicare. In the Kaiser-Hewitt survey, the average premium for employees who retired at 65 last year was $419, including coverage for a spouse.
 Lucent Technologies, whose business went into a free fall with the popping of the telecommunications bubble, adopted an access-only health plan this year, but only for the spouses of 9,000 management retirees who had retired since March 1990 with annual pay of $87,000 or more.
 William Price, a company spokesman, said the cutbacks were necessary to keep Lucent -- which has 22,000 United States employees but provides health benefits to 240,000 retirees and their spouses -- "viable and competitive."
 Many retirees are bitter about such changes. "I took the offer to retire in 2001 mainly because they were protecting health care benefits," said Edward Beltram, 58, a former Lucent human resources manager who lives in Woodland Park, Colo., and must now pay $375 more a month to maintain coverage for himself and his wife. 
 Mr. Beltram, who worked for Lucent and for units of a predecessor company for 31 years, added, "I feel they have reneged on their promises."
 Jerry Martin, who retired in 2002 after 17 years with TXU, planned to pay the full cost of the company's retiree health benefit for himself and his wife. But he dropped the coverage after TXU's actuaries revised their estimates, and his premium jumped from $1,224 a month last year to $2,066 on Jan. 1, 2004, dwarfing his $1,276 monthly pension and leaving him angry. 
"They say, 'We won't worry about these people that are going to get old,"' said Mr. Martin, a 56-year-old computer technician. 
 With retiree health costs continuing to spiral, more and more companies are planning to reduce or eliminate retiree health benefits -- especially prescription drug coverage -- without waiting for the new Medicare drug benefit to become available in 2006, said Marianne Fazen, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth Business Group on Health, an employers' group.
 One employer in her area, Alcatel, a French-owned telecommunications company whose North American operations are based in Plano, Tex., recently announced that it would reduce subsidies for all retirees immediately, and end them in 2006. 
 Many companies, especially retailers with high turnover and low-paid work forces, and technology companies with relatively young workers, do not provide retirees any health benefits. 
 Intel, an exception among technology companies, provides an access-only plan for retirees and helps out by providing $1,500 for each year of eligible service, to be used only for premiums in the Intel retiree health plan, said Gail Dundas, an Intel spokeswoman.
 People who retire and start their own business or join a small firm may welcome the chance to pay a group rate, said Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a research organization supported by large employers.
 "It's an important interim step," said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare policy expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which sponsors health care research. "This is better than tossing people out into the individual insurance market, and it is a richer benefit than is available under Medigap," the supplementary coverage that Medicare beneficiaries can buy.
 Encouraging workers to save for these costs, employers like Deere & Company, the tractor manufacturer, and financial service firms like Fidelity Investments are calling on Congress to establish new retirement medical benefit accounts that would resemble 401(k)'s for health care.
 "We're looking for a tax-advantageous way for folks to start saving," said Mert Hornbuckle, vice president for human resources at Deere.

HEADLINE: Murder Trial Revives Intrigue Of the 70's Indian Movement 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY and CHARLIE LeDUFF

DATELINE: RAPID CITY, S.D. 

 BODY:
Anna Mae Pictou Aquash, a young mother and American Indian activist, was shot in the head and left to die on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the winter of 1975. The trial of one of two men accused of killing her begins here on Tuesday. Between those moments, decades apart, lies a mystery, and a bitter struggle.
 Law enforcement authorities and Indians across the country are watching closely, not just for what the trial will reveal about Ms. Pictou Aquash's death, but for what it threatens to expose about suspicion and violence inside the American Indian Movement, or AIM, the militant group whose clashes with federal authorities drew the eyes of the world to the Pine Ridge Reservation in the 1970's. 
 Ms. Pictou Aquash was a member of AIM, one of scores who seized the Sioux village of Wounded Knee in 1973, demanding civil rights for Indians while holding federal officials at bay for 71 days. The men indicted in her murder, Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham, were in AIM, too. 
Did the movement kill one of its own? Or was Ms. Pictou Aquash a victim of corrupt, even murderous, federal law enforcement? On the eve of the trial, Indians are clashing over these questions -- in newspaper and magazine articles, in television interviews, on the Web and in court.
AIM leaders insist, as they always have, that federal agents engineered the killing as part of their conflict with AIM. Other Indians point the finger at the movement itself, saying they believe that AIM leaders ordered her killed because they suspected she was a federal informer.
The editor of a national Indian newspaper has made an even more explosive accusation: that the trial will lead back to one of the American Indian Movement's best-known members, Leonard Peltier, whose life imprisonment in the killings of two federal agents at Pine Ridge has made him an international human-rights celebrity among those who believe he was framed by vengeful federal authorities.
The editor, Paul DeMain, has written in News From Indian Country that he believes that Ms. Pictou Aquash knew too much about Mr. Peltier's case and may have been killed by AIM members to protect Mr. Peltier. Mr. Peltier has sued Mr. DeMain for libel, denying any connection to the killing of the agents or of Ms. Pictou Aquash.
Being at the heart of such fire is familiar territory for AIM, a polarizing force in Indian country since its birth in Minneapolis in 1968. AIM's founders demanded civil rights, treaty recognition and a return to traditional ways. Warlike in attitude and dress, they won admirers and enemies on reservations. For many, AIM meant pride and cultural rebirth, but others criticized its tactics -- like the siege at Wounded Knee -- as too radical and violent. 
Wounded Knee ended in a truce, but the armed conflict at Pine Ridge dragged on for years. Among the bloody incidents, one stirred an intense manhunt. On June 26, 1975, two F.B.I. agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, were trying to arrest a robbery suspect on a farm. In a gun battle, an AIM member and both agents died. The agents, lying wounded by their car, were finished off by bullets in the head at close range. Several Indians were later arrested, but only Mr. Peltier was convicted.
Another Pine Ridge killing drew less notice. On Feb. 24, 1976, a rancher found the body of Anna Mae Pictou Aquash curled in a gully. Ms. Pictou Aquash was 30, with a broad smile and a sharp, determined attitude. She believed in AIM, family members said, and was close to AIM leaders.
Indians here and on other reservations immediately suspected federal agents or the Guardians of the Oglala Nation, a security force allied with the tribal government and federal authorities.
Peculiar circumstances fueled those suspicions: at first the authorities said they could not identify the body, though they had questioned Ms. Pictou Aquash in the past. A coroner said she had died of exposure, overlooking the bullet wound, which was found only when her body was exhumed for a second autopsy.
Vernon Bellecourt, a longtime AIM leader and its spokesman, said recently that he still believed federal authorities were responsible for her death. "How they did it? I don't know," Mr. Bellecourt said. "How they set it up? I don't know."
Among Indians, there was another theory. Ms. Pictou Aquash's daughter said she heard it: that AIM itself might have killed Ms. Pictou Aquash, thinking she was a spy. At the height of the Pine Ridge conflict, federal authorities wanted inside information, and AIM members often suspected their own of talking.
Robert D. Ecoffey, now deputy director of law enforcement services at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, heard the whispers many times, too, in decades of pursuing the Pictou Aquash case. But they went nowhere, Mr. Ecoffey and other law enforcement officials said, because most people on the reservation would not talk, perhaps fearing retribution, perhaps to keep a united front for AIM.
"The case would be dead for a long time, then it would come back to life and you would hear something," said James E. McMahon, the United States attorney in South Dakota. "But then that would not pan out."
Finally, not long ago, Mr. McMahon said, people once inside AIM spoke up.
"Feelings changed," said Mr. Ecoffey, a Lakota who grew up in Pine Ridge. "There had been a distrust between those who had the knowledge and the F.B.I. People realized now that justice had to be done for Anna Mae."
Last year, the authorities indicted Mr. Looking Cloud and Mr. Graham. Mr. Graham, arrested in Canada, will fight extradition in a hearing in March, said his lawyer, Terry La Liberte. "There's no evidence in this case," Mr. La Liberte said. "What we have is a bunch of hearsay, innuendo and politics."
Mr. Looking Cloud, who goes to trial on Tuesday, has a straightforward defense, said his lawyer, Tim Rensch: "He didn't do it."
Law enforcement authorities declined to discuss their theory of the motive in the case before the trial. But they said they did not believe that Mr. Looking Cloud, a low-level AIM member who became a drifter after leaving Pine Ridge, plotted the killing on his own. And even a former AIM leader, Russell Means, has publicly said he believes that AIM leaders ordered the killing.
Mr. Bellecourt, the spokesman, in turn accused Mr. Means of being a "C.I.A. snoop." He said his group had posted an "urgent appeal" on the Web for money for Mr. Looking Cloud's defense after Mr. Looking Cloud's family sought help to prove his innocence.
Mr. DeMain, the editor, said he once undertook a similar mission for Mr. Peltier. Mr. DeMain, an Oneida-Ojibwe, said he began researching the case a dozen years ago, hoping to prove -- as Robert Redford, the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others have insisted over the decades -- that Mr. Peltier was unjustly imprisoned.
Mr. DeMain said he believed that ballistic evidence against Mr. Peltier was flawed, and that a witness had lied. But after years of interviews, he said, he became convinced that Mr. Peltier, now serving consecutive life terms in the federal prison in Leavenworth, Kan., was a murderer.
"What I found was not a case where the government may have framed an innocent man, but where the government may have framed a guilty man," he said in an interview at his home in Hayward, Wis.
Mr. DeMain said he had determined from interviews that Ms. Pictou Aquash had at one point heard Mr. Peltier brag about shooting both F.B.I. agents, and even re-enacted the crime. That knowledge made her a target of AIM, Mr. DeMain said.
Last year, Mr. DeMain published as much in his newspaper, writing that the "primary motive" behind the killing was Ms. Pictou Aquash's knowledge of what Mr. Peltier claimed to have done.
Another person who was once close to AIM leaders and who declined to be named in this article, saying she feared for her safety, said that she, too, had seen Mr. Peltier brag in front of Ms. Pictou Aquash and others about shooting the agents. That person has been summoned as a witness at the trial.
Mr. Peltier has sued Mr. DeMain for libel in federal court in Minneapolis. Mr. Peltier's lawyer, Barry A. Bachrach, said that after years of court appeals, even the government had said it could not prove that Mr. Peltier executed the agents. The government, Mr. Bachrach said, has argued merely that he "aided and abetted" in their deaths. The 1975 shootout, Mr. Bachrach said, was chaotic and confusing, with many people firing guns, some in self-defense. "It was a war zone," he said.
Eric F. Melgren, the United States attorney in Kansas, argued the government's side in a hearing last fall. He said that to persuade appeals courts to uphold the murder convictions, some prosecutors had asserted that the government needed only to show that Mr. Peltier at least aided and abetted in the killings. The government still believes that Mr. Peltier fired the fatal shots, he said.
Mr. Bachrach said his client rejected the government's allegations and any ties to Ms. Pictou Aquash's death. "He denies shooting the agents and thus denies that a motive for the murder of Anna Mae was because he supposedly admitted to her that he killed the agents," Mr. Bachrach said. "You can get people to say anything. But it's a falsehood that Anna Mae was murdered as a result of something Leonard supposedly admitted to her."
Besides, Mr. Bachrach said, Mr. Peltier considered Ms. Pictou Aquash a friend.
The 28th anniversary of Mr. Peltier's imprisonment is next week, with events planned in Boston, Toronto and Tacoma, Wash. His legal battle, meanwhile, goes on.
Among Indians, especially here in southwest South Dakota, the coming trial has stirred painful memories.
"It's awesome to know hundreds of people knew intimate details," said Richard Two Elk, who grew up with Mr. Looking Cloud. "How the community knew all this time. And how a massive orchestra was conducted to hide it."
AIM, meanwhile, splintered. Some leaders went off to Hollywood or the lecture circuit. Nevertheless, Mr. Bellecourt, 72, said AIM was alive and well. He said its legacy was vast -- culturally, economically and philosophically. "We've changed things forever," he said.
Denise Maloney Pictou was 11 when her mother died. Her mother believed firmly in AIM values, she said: human rights, treaty recognition, tradition. Ms. Maloney Pictou said she was struggling to mesh those values with the thought that AIM could have killed her mother.
"I really do believe in their purpose in what they started out to be," Ms. Maloney Pictou, now 39, said. "I cannot believe that everything they did back there is in vain." 
Still, she said, she suspects there may be more revelations ahead. 
"I truly believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg," she said. "If Anna Mae opens up the door to the rest of the injustices, I'll be there to push forward."

A21) Chart: "Back to Pine Ridge"The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwestern South Dakota, home of the Oglala Sioux, became the focus of international attention in the 1970's, when members of the American Indian Movement, a militant civil rights organization, engaged in violent clashes with federal agents. The group descended on Pine Ridge in part because of the symbolic significance of Wounded Knee, a village on the reservation and the site of a massacre of Indians by United States cavalry troops in 1890. FEB. 27, 1973About 200 members of the American Indian Movement, calling for Indian self-governance and a return to traditional ways, seize Wounded Knee. They keep local and federal agents at bay for 71 days. JUNE 26, 1975Two F.B.I. agents, Jack Coler and Ronald Williams, are killed in a shootout with Indians at a ranch called Jumping Bull. An AIM member also dies. Of several suspects who are arrested, only one, Leonard Peltier, is eventually convicted. FEB. 24, 1976Anna Mae Pictou Aquash is found dead at Pine Ridge, a gunshot wound in her head. Weeks earlier, Mr. Peltier was arrested in Canada in the F.B.I. agents' deaths. APRIL 1977Mr. Peltier is convicted and sentenced to two life terms in prison. 1992"Incident at Oglala," a documentary film, revisits the Peltier case and suggests that his murder conviction was unjust. 1994Robert D. Ecoffey is appointed U.S. marshal for South Dakota. He and F.B.I. agents continue quizzing people in the Pictou Aquash case, but are mostly stonewalled. 2000-2001Witnesses begin talking with authorities about the Pictou Aquash case. MARCH 20, 2003Two former AIM members, Arlo Looking Cloud and John Graham, are indicted in the killing of Ms. Pictou Aquash. Mr. Looking Cloud pleads not guilty.

HEADLINE: Another Bogus Budget 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Well, whaddya know. Even as the Republican leadership strong-armed the Medicare drug bill through Congress, the administration was sitting on estimates showing that the plan would cost at least $134 billion more than it let on. But let's not make too much of the incident. After all, it's not as if our leaders make a habit of faking their budget projections. Oh, wait. 
 The budget released yesterday, which projects a $521 billion deficit for fiscal 2004, is no more credible than its predecessors. When the administration promises much lower deficits in future years, remember this: two years ago it projected a fiscal 2004 deficit of only $14 billion. What's new this time is that the administration has decided to pay lip service to conservative complaints about runaway spending. 
 Over the past few months, many pundits have obediently placed the onus for rising deficits on "a vast increase in discretionary domestic spending," or words to that effect. By the way, the Heritage Foundation, which has orchestrated this campaign, is cagier than those pundits; it covers itself by relying on innuendo, never saying outright that domestic discretionary spending is the source of the deficit. 
To mollify these critics, the new budget purports to shrink real domestic discretionary spending. This won't happen; even if it did, it would have a negligible impact on the deficit. But it isn't just a fake solution -- it's a response to a fake problem.
The prime cause of giant budget deficits is a plunge in the federal government's tax take, which fell from 20.9 percent of G.D.P. in fiscal 2000 to a projected 15.7 percent this year, the lowest share since 1950. About 45 percent of this plunge can be attributed to the Bush tax cuts. The rest reflects the end of the stock market bubble, the still-depressed economy and -- probably -- growing tax sheltering and evasion.
It's true that increased spending also contributes to the deficit, and that there has been a substantial increase in discretionary spending -- spending that, unlike such items as Social Security payments, isn't automatically determined by formulas. But the bulk of this increase has been related to national security.
Traditional budget measures distinguish between defense and nondefense discretionary spending. Even by these measures, defense accounts for most of the increase in recent years. But a better measure would group homeland security and other costs associated with 9/11 with defense, not domestic programs. The Center for American Progress -- confirming related work by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- estimates that from 2000 to 2004 security-related discretionary spending rose to 4.7 percent of G.D.P. from 3.4 percent, while nonsecurity spending rose to only 3.4 percent from 3.1 percent.
In other words, the role of nonsecurity spending in the plunge into deficit is trivial, compared with tax cuts and security spending. (Credit where credit is due: the administration's budget numbers show the same thing.) And even severe austerity on nonsecurity spending won't make a significant dent in the deficit.
So what will it take to get the budget deficit under control? Unless Social Security and Medicare are drastically cut -- which is, of course, what the right wants -- any solution has toinclude a major increase in revenue.
Many Democrats have called for a partial rollback of the Bush tax cuts, preserving the "middle class" cuts -- those that convey at least some benefit to the 77 percent of taxpayers in the 15 percent tax bracket or below. Such a partial rollback would have reduced this year's budget deficit by about $180 billion; that would help, but one hopes politicians realize that it's not enough.
Another major source of revenue could be a crackdown on tax loopholes and tax evasion, which has reached epidemic proportions. In particular, what's going on with the tax on corporate profits? That source of revenue is down, as a percent of G.D.P., to 1930's levels. No, that's not a misprint. And receipts are not growing nearly as fast as one would expect, given an economic recovery that has bypassed workers but given big gains to their employers. An administration that actually tried to make corporations pay their taxes might be able to find $100 billion or more each year.
An eventual budget solution will involve all this, and more. But the first step is to stop looking for villains in all the wrong places.

HEADLINE: Big Holder Seeks Rest Of Bancomer Of Mexico 

BYLINE:  By DALE FUCHS and ELISABETH MALKIN; Dale Fuchs reported from Madrid for this article, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.

DATELINE: MADRID, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Spain's second-largest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, is offering to pay $4.1 billion to gain total control of Bancomer, Mexico's leading bank. 
 Banco Bilbao already owns nearly 60 percent of the company, which controls a quarter of Mexico's banking. Bilbao will pay 12 Mexican pesos in cash for every Bancomer share, nearly 14 percent more than Bancomer's closing price on Friday. 
 The deal announced on Monday highlights the attraction Mexico has had for foreign banks in recent years. Second in size only to Brazil among Latin American economies, Mexico offers stability and potential for growth -- 60 percent of workers do not have a bank account. Since 2000, foreign banks have spent $18.6 billion to acquire Mexican banks. 
Banco Bilbao and its larger Spanish rival, Banco Santander Central Hispano, have been among the most aggressive financial investors throughout Latin America, encouraged by a common language and culture. The Spanish banks have also sought to expand in the region because growth at home has been limited -- savings banks now control about 50 percent of the market. 
Consolidating its stake in Bancomer will immediately add to Banco Bilbao's earnings. And Banco Bilbao, or BBVA, decided to take advantage of the recent surge in the euro in making its offer at this time.
"Bancomer is a great bank, the moment is perfect because of the strength of the euro and Mexico is the best place in Latin America to invest," Banco Bilbao's chairman, Francisco Gonzalez, said. Although Banco is paying a premium of nearly 14 percent, some analysts said the deal was a bargain. "My first reaction is that this seems very cheap," said Edgar Amador, a Mexico City-based economist for Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a consulting group. Shares of Banco Bilbao fell 1.1 percent, to 10.59 euros, in Madrid.
Bancomer has a national network of 1,653 branches. Earnings last year rose 10.6 percent, to $695 million.
Bancomer also benefits from a steady flow of deposits from Mexicans working in the United States. Banco Bilbao estimates that 25 million Mexicans sent roughly $14 billion into Mexico in 2003, and Bancomer controls 40 percent of that money.
Still, Banco Bilbao and Bancomer face stiff competition in Mexico from much larger global banks like Citigroup and HSBC. Citigroup spent $12.5 billion to buy the No.2 bank in Mexico, Banamex, in 2001. 
While the foreign influx has restored the country's banking system to health after near collapse in the mid-1990's following the peso collapse, Mexican consumers are still waiting to see the effects. The banks have concentrated on consumer loans, mostly through credit cards, and have been slow to restart mortgage and small-business lending. 
Instead, Mexico's banks have raised their profits by increasing commissions. Mr. Amador of Stone & McCarthy estimates that bank lending contributes to only a third of bank profits, while commissions and payments on government bonds held by the banks account for the rest. "Banking in Mexico is great business," he noted.
Other analysts were more cautious about Banco Bilbao's expansion. 
"I'm skeptical about the growth potential in the region," said Carlos Garcia, chief analyst for European banking at ING. "Except for Chile, it has generally underperformed. But if I had to bet on one country, it would be Mexico because it has the legal and financial framework in place."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Speeding Flight Check-In At Self-Service Kiosks

BYLINE:  By DAVID JONES

 BODY:
Do-it-yourself check-in kiosks have sprouted up in airports, and lots more are coming.
 Since the fall of 2001, when new security rules slowed passenger check-in to a crawl, airlines have doubled the number of self-service kiosks, to 3,000. Make that 3,001: Today, JetBlue Airways plans to introduce the first of 150 self-service kiosks it will install around the country at its hub terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. JetBlue, whose passengers book about 75 percent of their tickets online, worked with I.B.M. to develop a kiosk with extra large interactive screens. 
 Self-service kiosks have been a boon to rushed travelers, cutting check-in times, and have saved the industry millions of dollars in labor costs. The machines have proved so successful at airports that two major hotel chains are testing automated check-in systems at some locations.
 Analysts estimate more than 25 percent of all travelers in the United States have used a self-service machine. At Continental Airlines, about 60 percent of all passengers are using the kiosks. Those with e-tickets are eligible, but not those with paper tickets. And at this stage, the system is in use on domestic flights and those to American territories, but not on international routes. 
 For the passengers able to use them, such an expansion has changed the logistics of business travel. Without it, analysts say, more fliers would be spending time at check-in counter lines. Instead, by swiping a credit, debit or frequent-flier card through an electronic reader and punching in information to confirm their identity, they can get boarding passes, upgrade to first class, or rebook canceled flights.
 The airlines are reaping benefits. A study in November by Forrester Research showed that self-service check-in costs the airlines 16 cents a passenger, compared with $3.68 using ticket-counter agents. The study's co-author, Henry H. Harteveldt, vice president for travel research at Forrester, said check-in machines would become standard in the near future for most carriers. "Ideally, a self-service kiosk should be able to help an airline serve 95 percent of its passengers with 95 percent of their needs," he said.
 In 1995, Continental became the first United States carrier to install a self-service machine -- at Newark airport, one of its hubs. Continental now has 779 kiosks in 130 airports around the country. 
 The machines caught on as airport gridlock worsened. "The airlines realized this was a technology that was part of their core business," said Robert R. Ranieri, who oversees I.B.M.'s travel kiosk unit in Toronto, "sort of the way the Internet is a mainstream tool."
 Plans by Northwest and other carriers to accelerate electronic check-in were put on hold by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Before security procedures measures were tightened as a result of the attacks, passengers had been able to go through airport security with a printed confirmation of their flight and obtain boarding passes at the gate. Now, they must get the boarding pass first -- on the Internet, at a ticket counter or at a self-service kiosk.
 The kiosk can be fastest. Walter Jones, vice president for business development at Carrington Laboratories in Irving, Tex., recalled arriving for a flight at Salt Lake City International Airport and finding a long line. "It would have taken me at least 40 minutes," he said, "but there was nobody at the kiosk. I got processed in less than two minutes." Mr. Jones says he never goes to the check-in counter any more and flies on Delta Air Lines and American Airlines to take advantage of their kiosks.
 A frequent passenger on Alaska Airlines, Tony Zawaideh, senior vice president for sales at Zapp Packaging, near Los Angeles, is able to check in electronically and to get priority security screening at some airports. On a December flight, Mr. Zawaideh helped his mother, who travels infrequently, obtain a boarding pass at the check-in counter. "I got through the kiosk in about five or six minutes," he recalled. "I had to wait in line with my mother for an hour and 15 minutes."
 After Sept. 11, as stories about delays and missed flights abounded and more passengers avoided short flights, several major carriers expanded their kiosk services and others increased incentives to use them, like awarding bonus frequent-flier points. Increasingly, airlines have been promoting the kiosks in an effort to attract new customers.
 Last fall, for example, in an attempt to take business travelers from American Airlines, America West installed 10 check-in kiosks at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and said it planned to extend use of the machines to all its markets in the next year. America West's kiosks allow passengers to check in, change seats, upgrade to first class and print receipts. The kiosks at US Airways can be used in Spanish as well as English, and allow the reissuing of tickets if a flight is canceled.
 Some airports are having trouble finding space for all the new kiosks. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas is testing a common-use check-in system called SpeedCheck, developed jointly by I.B.M. and Arinc of Annapolis, Md. 
 In the first phase, 38 SpeedCheck kiosks in McCarran's ticketing area are being shared by 12 airlines. Six more kiosks are at the Las Vegas Convention Center, where those attending meetings can check in and, if they have only carry-on luggage, go straight to airport security points. 
 The second phase, intended to start in the second quarter of this year, calls for the installation of kiosks at airport counters for use by passengers with check-in baggage. For international flights, the kiosks are to be equipped with passport readers. Suitcases would be given to an airline employee behind the kiosk. 
 In the last phase, with no starting date yet established, according to Arinc, SpeedCheck will be extended to charter flights.
 The SpeedCheck system has drawn the interest of airport officials nationwide. If it succeeds, it is likely to encourage other big airports to introduce common-use kiosk systems. 
 Before SpeedCheck, several major Las Vegas hotels offered airline check-in to their guests. Now, some hotel chains are testing the self-service concept for their own use. In October, Starwood began testing self-service kiosks at the W Times Square in New York and the Sheraton Boston Hotel.
 A guest swipes a credit card at the kiosk to confirm a room reservation and receives an electronic room key -- a process that can take less than a minute. Guests can also check out using the machine, which will either print a receipt or e-mail it.
 Starwood is planning to expand its use of kiosks to other downtown, airport and convention hotels, and to add a feature that allows guests to change room assignments.
 Hilton Hotels has scheduled tests of self-service kiosks at the Hilton New York and Hilton Chicago. On the basis of the results, it will decide whether to introduce kiosks throughout the chain. Hilton is talking with several airlines to see if the self-service machines can be enhanced with airline check-in systems, according to Thomas Spitler, a Hilton vice president.
 "The airlines," Mr. Spitler said, "have really trained customers to look for alternatives to human agents."

HEADLINE: Two Energy Plans for North Korea 

BYLINE:  ByJAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: NIIGATA, Japan, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
On North Korea's desolate eastern coast, 600 miles directly across the Sea of Japan from here, soldiers guard an abandoned construction site where two light-water nuclear reactors were to be built. 
 North Korea is desperately short of energy, and agreed in 1994 to halt its nuclear weapons program in exchange for help from its capitalist neighbors and the United States in building nuclear power plants. But work at the site was halted on Dec. 1 because the United States said North Korea had violated the 1994 agreement by pursuing nuclear weapons anyway. On Friday, the State Department said the civilian nuclear power program had "no future." In retaliation, North Korea is holding hostage the construction equipment at the site belonging to contractors from South Korea, which has sunk almost $1 billion into the project. 
 With the civilian nuclear power program off the table, North Korea needs another plan for expanding its energy supply, and its neighbors need a way to break the diplomatic stalemate. On Monday, at a regional energy forum here, energy executives from Russia and the United States outlined two proposals. Both ideas -- a 235-mile electric power line from Vladivostok and a 1,500-mile natural gas pipeline from Sakhalin -- highlight Russia's future as an energy exporter to Northeast Asia. Just as Canadian power fuels much of the United States, so the hydroelectric resources of the Russian Far East seem destined to flow south to China, Japan and the Koreas.
 "Everyone wants a nonnuclear solution" to North Korea's energy proablem, said John B. Fetter, an American consultant who traveled here from Philadelphia to present the $3 billion natural gas pipeline project proposed by the KoRus Gas Company, a consortium of American, Russian and South Korean owners.
 The project calls for a pipe to be laid from the vast gas deposits off Sakhalin Island, southwest through Russian territory to North Korea and, probably, on to Seoul, South Korea's capital, as well. Mr. Fetter said gas could flow through it as soon as 2008. 
 By then, it is hoped, at least one reliable customer for the gas will have emerged in North Korea, a nation notorious for rewriting rules after the fact and for failing to pay its bills. If the pipeline is built all the way through to South Korea, it would reach a nation of 47 million whose appetite for energy is growing rapidly. Oil consumption has quadrupled since 1980, and South Korea is now the world's fourth- largest oil importer, after the United States, Japan and China. Analysts expect demand for gas to increase by 50 percent in the next 10 years. 
 For North Korea, though, an electric transmission line promises faster, cheaper relief. 
 For just $180 million or so, a 500-kilovolt line could be built in four years, according to Victor N. Minakov, general director of Vostokenergo, a subsidiary of Russia's state electric utility, United Energy Systems.
 The timetables for both projects are ambitious, and financing them could pose problems, industry experts said. But both projects reflect the future importance of the Russian Far East as an energy supplier to Asia, according to Alexei M. Mastepanov, deputy director of Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly. 
 North Korea's energy needs are critical. It depended for decades on tankers full of oil delivered at subsidized "friendship prices" by China and Russia, but both its patrons began charging market prices in the early 1990's, and North Korea has yet to recover from the blow. 
 Shortages of energy crippled North Korea's industry, and much of the country regressed to a 19th-century existence of candlelight and wood stoves. In rural areas, many trucks are run with gas generators fueled by wood or charcoal, as in Europe during World War II when gasoline was scarce.
 North Korean officials support both the gas-pipeline proposal and the power line proposal, but have no money to pay for them, according to people attending the conference who had recently been to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
 If either project is built, then, it would probably come as foreign aid, probably in exchange for once again putting North Korea's nuclear weapons program back under international inspection and control. After a six-month break in talks over the weapons program, American diplomats were touring Northeast Asia over the weekend trying to restart the negotiations. 
 Yevgeny Afanasiev, a senior Russian diplomat, said at the forum that his country "will do our utmost" to promote the two projects. "They do not have to be part of a package, they could be separate," Mr. Afanasiev said. "But think of private investors, think of the high political risk -- would you invest?"
 Financing could come as part of a wider package that would gain North Korea entry into the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Or the money might be put up by South Korea, which would stand to benefit both directly and indirectly. 
 "The Russians basically believe that South Koreans will pay for it," said Yonghun Jung, a Korean executive at the Asia Pacific Energy Research Center in Tokyo. 
 But many South Korean businesspeople see North Korea as an unreliable money pit.
 Korea Gas, favors bringing Russian gas to South Korea through China and an underwater pipeline, bypassing North Korea and denying it any control over the supply.

In Theory, the Bears (Huh?) Won Super Bowl XXXVIII*

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Adam Vinatieri's field goal with seconds left in the Super Bowl did more than end the Carolina Panthers' hopes of the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history. It also sounded a death knell for the bull market.
 At least it did for anyone who believes in what only a few years ago was among the most widely watched, if least respected, stock market forecasts: the Super Bowl theory. 
 That theory holds that the market is in trouble in years when a team from the old American Football League, like the New England Patriots, wins the game. But rising prices are to be expected when a team from the old National Football League wins the title. What matters is not which conference a team represents, but which league it was in before the 1966 merger of the two leagues that enabled the Super Bowl to begin being played. 
 That theory was developed in the days before expansion, and so it had no obvious message about last year's game, in which the Tampa Bay Buccaneers overwhelmed the Oakland Raiders. But now that we know the stock market was poised to rally sharply, it is clear that expansion teams should be viewed based on the conference they represent. So chalk up the bull market of the past year, in which the Dow Jones industrial average rose 29 percent from Super Bowl to Super Bowl, as a vindication of the theory.
 The Super Bowl forecast also did well in 2002, when Mr. Vinatieri kicked his other last-minute winner and led the Patriots over the St. Louis Rams. Sure enough, the Dow was 17.9 percent lower when the next Super Bowl rolled around.
 Over all, the Super Bowl indicator's record in forecasting the direction of the stock market over the following year now stands as 29 right and 8 wrong, a 78 percent success rate that probably compares well with any human forecaster you know.
 Of course, it is true that the Super Bowl theory has been tweaked over the years to keep its record good, with the discovery about expansion teams being merely the latest example. 
 And it is also true that the Super Bowl theory quite recently was wrong for four years in a row. In 1998 and 1999, the Denver Broncos, an old American Football League franchise, won the bowl and wrongly forecast a bear market. Then in 2000 and 2001, franchises from the old National Football League prevailed, but share prices still fell.
 The Patriots, however, have never been wrong. They first reached the Super Bowl in 1986, only to suffer one of the worst losses in Super Bowl history, falling 46-10 to the Chicago Bears. That forecast a good year for the stock market, and, sure enough, the Dow rose 37.4 percent from then until the next Super Bowl.
 Measured from Super Bowl to Super Bowl, that was the second-best year ever for the Dow, behind the 41.1 percent rise after the 1975 Super Bowl. That rebound, after the worst bear market since the Depression, was foreshadowed by a Super Bowl pitting two former National Football League franchises, Pittsburgh and Minnesota. The two previous bad years for stocks had followed victories by the Miami Dolphins of the old American Football League.
 With their next loss, in 1997, the Patriots backed the bull market. The Patriots' third visit to the big game was two years ago. Their victory forecast that the bear market, which most Wall Street seers felt was almost over, would continue for another year. And it did, with that year being one of the worst in memory for stocks. Now the Patriots have won again, providing a bearish warning.
 Of course, no one who takes such an indicator seriously should be allowed to manage money. But that won't stop Wall Streeters from citing the game's result if the next year should be a bad one for the market.

From First to Worst, Rodriguez Joins Tigers

BYLINE:  By RAFAEL HERMOSO

 BODY:
Baseball players will start their annual migration to spring training in two weeks, and Ivan Rodriguez finally completed plans for his destination yesterday. He signed a four-year contract worth $40 million, with some strings attached, to play for the Detroit Tigers, last year's worst team and one of the worst in major league history. 
 "I'm very happy to be here, really," Rodriguez said at a news conference at Comerica Park in Detroit. "I know they had a bad season last year, but I think this year is going to be a completely different season." 
 He added later, "You're going to see this organization, this Detroit Tigers team, in the playoffs soon."
Rodriguez made a similar boast a year ago, when he signed with the Florida Marlins, another team that was down on its luck. The Marlins sneaked into the playoffs as a wild card and went on to win the World Series. Rodriguez was named the most valuable player of the NationalLeague Championship Series. He recorded the final out of Florida's division-series victory over the San Francisco Giants by holding onto the ball in a home-plate collision with J. T. Snow.
Rodriguez had good reason to hedge his playoff prediction. He is going from baseball's best team to one that set the American League record for losses and spent most of last summer trying to avoid the post-1900 record for defeats (120), owned by the 1962 Mets. The Tigers succeeded, barely, winding up 43-119.
Rodriguez had stated his preference to re-sign with Florida, where he lives, but talks broke down when the Marlins refused to match his 2003 salary of $10 million.
Tigers General Manager Dave Dombrowski said the sides had been negotiating for months. He said the deal included an escape clause. The Associated Press reported that Detroit could buy out the contract after two or three seasons if Rodriguez spent 35 or more days in a season on the disabled list with a lower spine injury.
Rodriguez said he had been in negotiations with three or four other teams.
Scott Boras, Rodriguez's agent, said at the news conference that Rodriguez was drawn to the Tigers because of the team's owner, Mike Ilitch; because of Dombrowski's previous work in building the Marlins; and because of the confidence that winning in Florida gave Rodriguez.
"He said to me, 'I know that division and that division could be mine,' " Boras said of Rodriguez, who spent the first 12 seasons of his career with the Texas Rangers and is a 10-time All-Star and a 10-time Gold Glove winner.
Rodriguez has not spent his long wait alone. Greg Maddux, another Boras client, remains unsigned.
"Certainly, you want a player signed by spring training," Boras said recently. He said baseball's changing economics had caused teams to delay defining their needs until after the Dec. 20 deadline to offer their unsigned players arbitration, effectively forcing marquee free agents like Maddux and Rodriguez to wait.
Rodriguez's decision to sign with a cellar-dwelling team bears some similarities to the choice another Boras client, Alex Rodriguez, made three years ago to sign with the Texas Rangers.
Alex Rodriguez was 25 at the time and the best player in baseball. Ivan Rodriguez is 32 and hit .297 with 16 home runs and 85 runs batted in last season. 
After Alex Rodriguez tired of losing last season, Boras was unsuccessful in engineering a trade to the Boston Red Sox.

CARRIER TO CLOSE FACTORY IN CENTRAL TENNESSEE

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The Carrier Corporation said yesterday that it would close its factory in McMinnville, Tenn., by the end of 2005, eliminating 1,300 jobs. The plant opened in 1969 and makes commercial air-conditioning and ventilation products. 
Production will be moved to factories in Tyler, Tex., Charlotte, N.C., and Monterrey, Mexico. The move will begin by the fall and be completed in 18 months, said Nancy Lintner, a spokeswoman for Carrier, which is based in Farmington, Conn. The decision is part of a broad review of Carrier's global production base, which has resulted in closing 22 factories over the last two years, with more than half of those outside the United States. Carrier is a subsidiary of the United Technologies Corporation of Hartford, Conn.

INCYTE TO CLOSE CENTER AND CUT WORK FORCE BY 57%

BYLINE:  Reuters

 BODY:
 The Incyte Corporation, a drug discovery company, said yesterday that it would close its Palo Alto, Calif., center and drop 257 employees, or 57 percent of its work force. 
John A. Keller, Incyte's chief business officer, said in a statement that the amount of publicly available genetic information had hurt the sales of its genomic data product lines. "As a result, we can no longer justify the extensive investment and infrastructure associated with the Palo Alto site," Mr. Keller said. Incyte posted a $40.7 million loss, or 56 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 2003. Three analysts surveyed by Reuters Research had expected the company to post a loss of 43 cents a share.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE AGENDA; 
Putting 2nd Term on Line, Bush Bets America Agrees With His Fiscal Priorities

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Presidents like to keep their budgets tight in their first years in office, then loosen up with an array of splashy new domestic programs during re-election campaigns. 
 But President Bush turned that tactic upside down, and on Monday unveiled a budget with cuts in domestic programs but big increases for the military, showing himself a gambler willing to bet his re-election that he made the correct fiscal choices. 
 Mr. Bush's calculation is that voters will care far more about protecting the nation from another terrorist attack than about cuts to popular programs, or, for that matter, the record-high deficit. 
To that end, Mr. Bush's $2.4 trillion budget provides the back-up material to the re-election theme that the president first set forth in his State of the Union address: He is the national security candidate to take care of America's fears. 
The strategy, Republicans said, is also designed to give Mr. Bush some political cover from a projected deficit of more than $500 billion. 
"It's clear that defense and homeland security are two areas where he can spend a lot more money and be insulated from criticism," said Walter Russell Mead, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of the forthcoming "Power, Terror, Peace and War: America's Grand Strategy in a World at Risk." "I don't think you're going to hear a lot from the Democrats that he's increasing defense spending too much. People are not going to turn around and say you did too much on national defense. The big danger is that you didn't do enough."
A former Bush administration official involved in economic policy put it this way: "Five, 10, 15, 20 years from now, when people look back at the Bush administration, there's only one thing they're going to care about -- it's the war. Did you prosecute the war, did you make America safer? Everything else is irrelevant. If you have to blow a gasket in the budget, then they're going to do it. Ronald Reagan had big deficits and they eventually went away. It's the end of the cold war that people remember."
But even Republicans said there were huge downsides to Mr. Bush's strategy, which they acknowledge effectively prohibits the president from announcing major new initiatives in an election year. Like his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush's budget calls for no big new domestic programs and in fact forces him to cut so deeply that even his Republican allies in Congress called it politically impractical and said restorations were inevitable.
"It's going to be a heavy lift," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
At the same time, Mr. Bush was faced with an embarrassing deficit that for the first time in 50 years a Republican president could not blame on Congress, since members of Mr. Bush's party control both the House and the Senate. Although voters do not seem to have seized on the issue yet, Democrats are increasingly using the deficit as a symbol of what they say are Mr. Bush's disastrous economic policies.
"We're on a course that takes us toward the fiscal cliff," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. "This course cannot be sustained."
A focus of Mr. Bush's budget -- and his re-election campaign -- is his promise to halve the deficit in five years, a pledge intended to show he has not lost touch with fiscal reality. But members of both parties expressed deep skepticism that Mr. Bush would be able to make good on that pledge because, they said, he had spent so freely in the past, and had so often underestimated fiscal bad news.
"If you show no inclination to walk the walk as well as talk the talk, then people are just not going to believe you," said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist who worked in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush. "I don't think you'll find anybody in any party who takes seriously the administration's promise to hold down spending. The president has never made small government a major element of his philosophy."
Senator Jon Corzine, a New Jersey Democrat and former chairman of the Goldman Sachs investment banking firm, was even more pointed.
"Asserting that we're going to cut this in half by 2008 is right in there with Richard Nixon saying 'I've got a secret plan to end the war,' " Mr. Corzine said.
Mr. Bush's budget also offers up what the White House is deliberately framing as an election-year battle: the president's call to make his trillion-dollar tax cuts permanent. Democrats have denounced the president for what they say is a fiscally reckless plan, which Republicans say is just what Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, wanted. Mr. Bush can then run, they say, as the candidate who will not raise taxes.
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said that although voters were clearly concerned about the economy "actual voting behavior shows, guess what, people don't want their taxes raised.
"It's a battle that unites our party," Mr. McInturff said, "and separates us from the Democrats."
Mr. Bush is not expected to face a major battle with Congress over the military budget, which he proposed to increase to $401 billion, an amount that brings him close to the height of the Reagan-era military buildup. But budget analysts noted that many of the big-ticket items driving the increase -- like new fighter planes, helicopters and a destroyer for the Navy -- were not directed specifically at fighting terrorism.
"Most of the stuff they're buying is really for conventional kinds of foes," said Steve Kosiak of the Center for Strategy and Budgetary Assessments. "It's not geared to classic antiterrorist activities."

HEADLINE: THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: VISIT TO KIRKUK; 
Wolfowitz Gets an Earful on Ethnic Tensions

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: KIRKUK, Iraq, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, on a mission to highlight successes in Iraq, heard firsthand of the ethnic and religious tensions that are vastly complicating American efforts for an orderly turnover of sovereignty to a new government by July 1.
 At a session with Kirkuk's town council, Mr. Wolfowitz sat through heartfelt complaints and long lectures from people who contend that Arabs here are mistreated by Kurds; that Shiite Muslims, the long disenfranchised majority group, will settle for nothing less than direct elections; and that local militias with no allegiance to the central government are frightening people. 
 Undeterred, Mr. Wolfowitz, the intellectual architect of the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, said that "all Iraq was the victim" of Saddam Hussein and that all Iraqis had an equal stake in cooperating to build a new and democratic country.
Maj. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, commander of the Fourth Infantry Division, which is responsible for northern Iraq, addressed the objections of some groups, especially the Shiites, to a caucus system planned by the United States to select the initial new Iraqi government. He pointed out that those very town council members were selected by a caucus managed by his troops, rather than by direct election.
"As an interim government, it has worked extremely well," General Odierno said.
A member of the town council who identified himself as an Arab and a Sunni Muslim, Ghassan al-Assi, said Kurdish political groups that predominate in parts of northern Iraq are "enforcing their ideas" and had "voided" Arab news organizations and economic opportunity in the region.
Ismail Oboutti, Kirkuk's director of employment, who identified himself as an Arab and Shiite Muslim, said, "Everyone on the street wants direct elections."
On the delicate topic of scheduling elections, Mr. Wolfowitz vowed "maximum participation" but said elections themselves would not settle the concerns expressed here.
Earlier on Monday, he went on patrol in Mosul with troops driving the Army's newest fighting vehicle, called Stryker, a lightly armored, wheeled infantry transport. One Stryker received the ultimate test even as Mr. Wolfowitz was touring Mosul, when it was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade on the other side of the city in an ambush that senior officers said appeared to have nothing to do with his visit. Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, the new commander of occupation forces in northern Iraq, said armor on the vehicle had forced the grenade to detonate 18 inches away from the Stryker's skin, diffusing the blast. None of the troops inside the vehicle were hurt, he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR; 
A Winning Kerry Loosens Up, and Crowds React

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry had just taken the stage on Saturday at a packed rally at the Oklahoma State Firefighters Memorial in Oklahoma City, and he was fired up. "George Bush thought he could play dress-up on an aircraft carrier and you wouldn't notice," he thundered. "Ask yourself, whose mission is accomplished?"
 As if on cue, the audience roared back, "His mission!" Mr. Kerry just smiled and deadpanned, "Nobody briefed me that I was going to have a real interactive crowd here." 
 For so long, of course, Mr. Kerry did not, and to see him on the stump these days is to conduct an unscientific but revealing study in candidate development and crowd psychology. Mr. Kerry says most of the same things he has been saying for weeks or even months, but he says them better and now that he is the Democratic front-runner the crowds respond in kind. 
"How about those New England Patriots?" he asked a cheering rally at the University of New Mexico here on Monday, celebrating his home team's Super Bowl victory. "It's great to see New Englanders go to Texas and win! It sets a great precedent."
Then he added, "I predict today that, like father, like son: one term!"
When Mr. Kerry was a boy his favorite movie was "Scaramouche," the story of the French Revolution swashbuckler who was "born with a gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad." As a lonely 11-year-old in a Swiss boarding school, or a Navy lieutenant in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam, or a senator from Massachusetts and a presidential contender, Mr. Kerry has seldom lacked a sense that the world is mad. The gift of laughter has come harder.
He will still never be cuddly. He is too tall, too gaunt, too lantern-jawed, too serious for that. His Iowa caucuses victory speech was solemn and windy, and he sat watching the Super Bowl on Sunday night with a band of firefighters from Fargo, N.D., whose union has endorsed him, tapping his right thumb and forefinger nervously against his teeth without making much effort to converse or connect.
Two years ago, Mr. Kerry's advisers tried to get him to loosen up by showing him tapes of Senator John Edwards's easygoing style. Even now, he lacks Bill Clinton's innate, empathetic artistry with individuals and crowds. But as his campaign moves onto a national stage, where television advertisements and sound bites are more important than one-on-one encounters, Mr. Kerry seems comfortable with a kind of paint-by-numbers Clintonism that is effective in its own way. He asks people their names, and their stories. After his brush with political near-death, he is smiling, even laughing, more -- and the results are infectious.
"There is nothing I like better than a good, bipartisan audience like this," he told a crowd that was the polar opposite on Saturday morning in Kansas City, Mo.
In tones conjuring up memories of the famous talking horse, he went on to mock "Mr. Ed Gillespie," the Republican national chairman, who has taken to painting Mr. Kerry as "out of sync" with most Americans. 
At every stop, it seems, Mr. Kerry announces a new endorsement. Here it was Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York. On Saturday in Oklahoma, as Mr. Kerry ran through the litany of his latest supporters, an interrupting voice rang out from the hall, "Senator, I am the mayor of Watonga, Okla., and I endorse you!"
Without hesitating, Mr. Kerry did something that would have been all but unthinkable in his awkward months of campaigning in New Hampshire last fall: He scrambled down into the crowd, wrapped an arm around Mayor Richard Hightower, chief magistrate of the nearby town of 3,200, and swept him back onto the stage, holding his hand aloft and declaring, "Ladies and gentlemen, my latest endorsement."
He is not all fun and games. In North Dakota on Sunday, as Mr. Kerry addressed a rally of 600 people in the stuffy Fargo Air Museum, relaxed in a tattersall shirt and brown corduroys, an older man near the front fell to the floor.
"I think we have somebody who's fainted there," Mr. Kerry said, hopping off the stage to check on the man as the murmuring crowd made way for him. Moments later, he reclaimed the stage and said calmly: "Ladies and gentleman, he's all right. He's all right. He's a World War II vet, and he's been standing for a while on his legs and he needs a little air and a little water."
"You should be president!" a woman in the crowd called out.
Jan Blinsky, a social worker in Fargo who had been an undecided voter until she saw Mr. Kerry on Sunday, said: "I think he's fantastic. Every time I hear of someone getting killed in Iraq, I just think, he's a vet, he's been there; he knows what war is. We've got to get back to working with the U.N. and other people. We can't do it ourselves."
At a rally on Friday at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall in New Castle, Del., Mr. Kerry was more formal, in a navy suit and tie. But he stayed for 45 minutes after his speech, signing campaign hats, photographs, American flags, and by the time he left, his fingers were ink-stained.
"I've never come to a political event before, never seen one in the flesh," said Jamie Freeman, a retired marketing consultant from Wilmington, Del. "And my impression was that he comes off as stiff, kind of like Bob Dole. But he was very impressive. He came across as sincere, not like a politician just espousing. I think that if people just come out and see him in person, his sincerity will come across."
Ms. Freeman's husband, Mark, added: "I've been on the fence. Mostly just focused on finding someone who can beat Bush. But I'm really sold on Kerry after seeing him. His charisma is the quality that has been lacking among the Democratic candidates."
In fact, it is all but impossible to tell how much of Mr. Kerry's improved standing and greater ease is attributable to his own performance, and how much is owed to the sudden conviction among so many Democrats that he is now the most electable option. Over and over, his listeners cite that quality as helping to drive their support. What is indisputable is that he now comes off better with his crowds.
For months, Mr. Kerry has told audiences how he recovered from prostate cancer last year, with first-rate medical treatment, because he could afford it, and because he had generous health insurance benefits as a member of Congress. He always ends the story with some version of the assertion that "every family's health care in America is as important as any politician's." In New Hampshire last fall, he would pause expectantly for applause that seldom came. Now the line wins cheers.
Mr. Kerry is still capable of old-fashioned oratorical prefaces like, "May I say?" or "I say to you" He is still fond of Kennedyesque oratorical inversions like, "Americans should not just be working for the economy; the economy should be working for Americans." He has some verbal tics, saying "literally" when he means "figuratively," adding the diffident qualifier "sort of" in ways that drain punch from his sentences.
But he speaks with unshakable assurance, and he is winning converts.
"I have been a Dean supporter up until today," said Charles Brittain, a retired industrial engineer for the Air Force who came to see Mr. Kerry in Oklahoma City. "I liked what he was saying, but what I saw was a vulnerability at the slightest sign of pressure. I believe I see in Kerry a man who can withstand the hurricane that I'm positive the Republicans are planning."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE DEFICIT; 
Nearsighted Deficit Plan Ignores Problems Down the Road, Skeptics Say

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
In offering a plan to cut the federal deficit in half by 2009, President Bush ignored more than $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and spending commitments that come due shortly afterward.
 Mr. Bush is projecting that the deficit will hit a record $521 billion this year, then decline to about $237 billion over the next five years. 
 But that estimate excludes most of the cost of making his tax cuts permanent, most of the costs of the Medicare prescription bill and all of the costs of keeping American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan beyond this year. 
Budget analysts said Monday that the five-year goal would itself be difficult to achieve. The cost of maintaining American military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $50 billion in 2005 alone, even if the number of troops there declines by one-third.
But by laying out a 5-year plan rather than a 10-year one, as Mr. Bush did until deficits began to soar, the administration has pushed many of the biggest fiscal challenges outside its budgetary "window."
All told, Mr. Bush has proposed more than $1.1 trillion in additional tax cuts over the next decade. The biggest proposal is a permanent extension of most of the tax cuts he has pushed through Congress in the last three years. Of that $1.1 trillion, only about $175 billion would occur between now and 2009. The rest, nearly $900 billion, would not take effect until the end of this decade -- after the end of a second Bush term.
The five-year deficit-reduction goal also excludes soaring costs of paying for prescription drugs under the new Medicare law. The administration now estimates those costs will total more than $530 billion over 10 years, but two-thirds would come due in the second 5 years.
"If you look at fiscal policy, it looks like an exploding cigar," said Robert Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that lobbies for greater budgetary discipline. "Focusing on just the next five years ignores all the exploding costs in the out years. It is much too narrow a focus."
Mr. Bush also refrained from addressing the looming issue of the alternative minimum tax. The minimum tax was designed to prevent wealthy taxpayers from taking excessive advantage of sophisticated tax shelters, but the tax is not adjusted for inflation and is expected to cause big tax increases for millions of moderate-income families if it is not changed.
On Monday, Mr. Bush ordered the Treasury Department to come up with ideas for reforming the minimum tax. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of avoiding unwanted tax increases would be more than $400 billion over the next 10 years. Instead of dealing with that issue up front, the administration proposed a temporary fix that would last two more years and would cost only $23 billion. 
Mr. Bush's short-term goal will not be easy to achieve in itself. The new budget assumes that discretionary spending outside of defense and domestic security will be almost frozen at current levels for the next five years. But conservative and liberal budget analysts said Monday that such assumptions were unrealistic. Mr. Bush has allowed discretionary spending to rise much faster than that in the last three years, and Congress will be pushing to do so again.
"They have a reasonable number in the first year, but then there are really low or no increases after that," said Chris Edwards, director of fiscal policy at the Cato Institute, a research group in Washington that favors reduced federal spending. "The problem is that Bush doesn't really have a plan for that happening. It's phony."
Conservative Republicans in Congress have become much more incensed about rising government spending in recent months, particularly after reluctantly supporting the expansion of Medicare. But fiscal conservatives complain that Mr. Bush has yet to veto a spending bill, while liberal critics complain that he continues to push for tax cuts.
William Gale, a budget analyst at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Bush had implicitly made his deficit-reduction goal easier by projecting a surprisingly high budget deficit of $521 billion this year. Under the current budget plan, Mr. Bush can fulfill his deficit pledge even if the government has a shortfall of $237 billion in 2009. By contrast, the administration's budget plan last year proposed reducing the deficit to $190 billion by 2008.
Mr. Gale, of the Brookings Institution, said the administration could reduce the budget deficit by almost half over five years by doing nothing -- no new spending increases and no additional tax cuts.
Even if Mr. Bush persuades Congress to freeze nondefense discretionary spending for the next five years, budget analysts say, that would have little impact on the line of deficits that lie ahead. Mandatory spending in the nation's three big entitlement programs -- Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security -- is expected to climb by $366 billion over the next five years. 
Administration officials agree that the most difficult fiscal challenges by far have to do with long-term entitlement programs. Mr. Bush recently called for a partial privatization of Social Security that would allow people to divert some of their contributions to private investment accounts. But he did not propose any changes to rein in entitlement programs, and he supported expanding Medicare to pay some prescription drug costs for the elderly
"You have to ask yourself, where can they make changes that are sufficient to afford a reduction in deficits?" said Nigel Gault, the United States research director at DRI/Global Insight, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. "I don't see how you get the deficit down without raising somebody's taxes. I don't know whose taxes, but it's got to be somebody's."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH, IN BUDGET, SEEKS INCREASES TIED TO SECURITY

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush submitted a $2.4 trillion budget on Monday that would substantially increase spending next year for national security and give the administration a claim to reducing the deficit but would also cut or strictly limit money for most domestic programs.
 The release of Mr. Bush's budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 amounted to a statement of his election-year priorities, and it underscored the degree to which the administration's policy and political focus are on fighting terrorism and building up the military. 
 The budget immediately drew fire from Democrats, who said that its deficit reduction claims were illusory and that it would shortchange a broad range of national priorities to pay for the tax cuts Mr. Bush has pushed through Congress over the past three years. 
The plan called for an increase in military spending of 7 percent, or $26.5 billion, to $401.7 billion. But that figure did not include money, which the administration said could be as much as $50 billion, for continued military operations next year in Iraq and Afghanistan. The administration said it would specify and seek financing for the expense only after the presidential election. Page A15. 
For domestic security programs, the White House said it wanted a budget increase of 9.7 percent, or $2.7 billion, to $30.5 billion. 
By contrast, the budget proposed that the overall growth in spending on other government operations outside of Social Security and Medicare -- a category that encompasses everything from the national parks to the National Institutes of Health -- be held to one-half of 1 percent, or $2 billion, to $386 billion. Seven of the 16 cabinet-level departments would see their budgets reduced.
Mr. Bush's stringent spending plan would make exceptions for some politically important issues like education, but it would generally require his own party, as the majority in Congress, to cut, freeze or kill many programs in the months leading up to Election Day. It asked Congress to hold spending on new and improved highways to $256 billion over the next six years, $119 billion less than authorized by legislation proposed by Republicans in the House. It called for the elimination of 65 government programs, including grants to companies pursuing new technologies and an initiative to tear down dilapidated public housing, and outright cuts in 63 more.
The budget showed Mr. Bush making good on his pledge to cut the deficit in half within five years from its projected level this year of $521 billion to $364 billion next year and $237 billion in 2009. 
But the White House did not provide figures on what would happen to the deficit in the years beyond the next half-decade, when the president's call to make permanent the 10-year tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2001 and 2003 would show up in the budget. And to show he could meet the deficit reduction target in the next five years, the president left out of his calculations any money for some needs both parties say will have to be met.
Democrats pointed in particular to Mr. Bush's decision to delay requesting additional money to pay for the occupation of Iraq and continued military operations in Afghanistan, saying that was one example of fiscal gimmickry in the budget. 
The current well of money being used for military needs in Iraq and Afghanistan -- $62 billion out of the $87 billion supplemental spending bill passed by Congress last fall -- is likely to run dry at some point in the 2005 fiscal year. 
Joshua B. Bolten, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, said the United States was currently spending at a rate of less than $50 billion a year on its military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. He suggested that $50 billion was the upper limit of what the administration would ultimately seek from Congress and said the White House would not make the request until next year, when it would have a clearer idea of the military's needs.
For an election-year budget, Mr. Bush's plan was a bit of an oddity. It included almost no new programs beyond his call for manned exploration of Mars. Other than calling for making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, it offered his conservative base no substantial new tax reductions beyond a previously proposed set of tax breaks for a new form of savings and investment accounts. And while his call for additional restraint in some spending categories was welcomed by fiscal conservatives, it was largely offset by new administration figures showing that the Medicare prescription drug benefit will cost far more than Congress had projected.
Speaking to reporters at the White House after meeting with his cabinet Monday morning, Mr. Bush said the budget reflected the progress the country was making in dealing with terrorism, war and recession.
The budget "sets clear priorities: winning the war on terror, protecting our homeland, making sure our children get educated, making sure the seniors get a modern Medicare system," Mr. Bush said. "And at the same time we're calling upon Congress to be wise with the taxpayers' money."
Congressional Democrats sharply criticized the plan as a continuation of fiscally irresponsible policies that have led to a swing from huge projected surpluses to big and persistent deficits during Mr. Bush's presidency. They said blame for the deficits rested far more with the tax cuts than on the spending programs he now wants to rein in or cut. And, they said, the Bush tax cuts have failed to live up to their billing of creating millions of new jobs.
The Democratic presidential candidates also attacked the budget, emphasizing a theme that Mr. Bush had rewarded the affluent while shortchanging the programs most needed by the middle class. 
"The new Bush budget is more of the same: record deficits, tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests, and cuts in areas that matter to families -- such as health care and education," Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said in a statement. "This is the same failed Republican prescription that has caused Bush to lose 2.5 million jobs in the last three years."
Republicans on Capitol Hill said they supported the president's goals, but many of them made it clear that the proposals would be changed, probably substantially, as Congress goes through the process of developing a budget resolution and passing the annual spending bills.
Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, called the president's budget "a great starting point from which to begin our work." 
The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, suggested that it would be possible to meet Mr. Bush's overall spending targets, but not without allocating the money differently from the way the White House would want it allocated, and not without trimming back some of the administration's few spending increases.
"We will be carefully scrutinizing the administration's new initiatives and proposed funding increases to see if we can afford them in a lean budget year," Mr. Young said in a statement. "They will have to be reconciled with proven programs and traditional Congressional priorities."
Mr. Bolten was asked about the political pressures on the budget this year and the lack of provision in the proposal for other bipartisan goals like dealing with the aspect in the tax code that will subject many more middle-income people to a tax increase because of the alternative minimum tax. "The numbers are highly realistic," he replied. 
When Mr. Bush took office, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting $5.6 trillion in budget surpluses over the next decade.
The $521 billion deficit Mr. Bush is forecasting for the current fiscal year would be a record in dollar terms, though not in comparison to the size of the economy. Mr. Bush regularly blames the terrorist attacks, war and recession for the swing in the nation's fiscal fortunes. Democrats have made a case that the tax cuts are the main culprit.
Mr. Bush's budget projects deficits only up through 2009, with most of the improvement coming between this year and 2006, when the deficit would drop to $268 billion. But if Mr. Bush's tax cuts were made permanent, the budget would come under new stresses early in the next decade. 
The Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee said making the Bush tax cuts permanent would reduce federal revenues by more than $200 billion in 2011 and by more than $300 billion in 2012, with the price tag rising each year thereafter.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about domestic spending in President Bush's 2005 budget referred incorrectly to the status of 38 programs administered by the Department of Education. The administration has recommended eliminating them, not shrinking their budgets.

HEADLINE: COMMENTARY; 
Multiple Missions Put Teaching Hospitals at Risk

BYLINE:  By HOWARD MARKEL, M.D.

 BODY:
For more than a century, Americans have expressed confidence that an ever-increasing, well-trained cadre of physicians and medical scientists will protect and enhance their health. So for much of this period, the steady expansion of medical schools, research laboratories and teaching hospitals has been justified as an agent of public good.
 More recently, however, with the fiscal crisis in health care, experts are beginning to question whether the nation's academic medical centers are financially sustainable in these times when Americans tend to worship the free market. 
 It has become increasingly difficult in recent years simultaneously to educate and train young doctors, treat patients, advance medical research, and hew to the bottom line. All these endeavors require more and more costly technology. Salaries and health care delivery expenses continue to rise. And the competition among all medical centers, whether affiliated with universities or independent, is ferocious. 
In the book "Governance of Teaching Hospitals" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004), Dr. John A. Kastor, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland, explores how academic medical centers grappled with their problems in the 1990's. He focused on the University of Pennsylvania Health System and the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Fiscal crises all but exploded at Penn in the late 1990's, Dr. Kastor explains, because of a combination of shrinking clinical revenues, a federal audit for Medicare resulting in costly fines, the adversity surrounding the death of a teenager with a treatable form of a serious metabolic disorder, and a lenient and medically inexperienced board that approved an ambitious program of buying local hospitals and medical practices.
Overexpansion was less of an issue at Johns Hopkins, where the board of trustees was linked exclusively to the hospital, was far more involved in planning decisions and was more conservative in its acquisitions. Conflict arose instead over decreasing clinical revenues and unwieldy structures of governance among those charged with running the university, the medical school and the hospital.
Yet as Dr. Kastor's study amply demonstrates in the two cases and at many other academic medical centers in the late 90's, success or turmoil was far more a function of managerial styles than of the specific structure of corporate authority or any fiscal dynamic.
More pointedly, Dr. Guy McKhann, a professor of neurology and a former member of the Johns Hopkins Hospital's medical board observed: "In many academic medical centers, there is a real split between those who run the hospitals and those who run the medical school. They'd rather undercut each other than survive."
Historians of American medicine are quick to point out that academic medicine has always been caught between serving the public's needs and competing in the marketplace.
Early in the 20th century, explains Dr. Guenter Risse, an emeritus professor of medical history at the University of California at San Francisco and the author of "Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals" (Oxford University Press, 1999), medical schools and their hospitals began to be firmly lodged within the American university.
This partnership emerged largely as a result of Abraham Flexner's 1910 muckraking survey, sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, on the poor state of medical education. Almost half of the medical schools described in Mr. Flexner's survey closed within two decades after his report was published. Most of those were run independently by doctors, as adjuncts to their private practices, on a for-profit basis at the expense of their students.
What has changed most over the past century is that today's academic medical centers are almost or completely financially independent from their parent universities. To make matters more precarious, when economic times are good, many university presidents look to their hospitals' profits to support other growth plans in the less lucrative schools or colleges. But when these revenues are threatened or reduced, they often seek ways to minimize the university's financial responsibility to its academic medical center.
"This places an enormous premium on the entrepreneurial skills of administrators and faculty and seriously threatens the older notions of humanitarianism and scholarship that guided these institutions," Dr. Risse said.
Dr. Ruth Macklin, a bioethicist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, observed, "Academic medical centers are caught in a squeeze to bring in more and more dollars, leading to the common doctors' complaint: 'I just don't have time to talk to patients because I am not reimbursed for it.' "
Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at Penn, believes this tension may be largely generational in nature. "Older physicians and medical scientists who came of age before the end of the 1980's tend to be more concerned about the public service mission of academic medical centers than their students, who are very much the product of the concept of medicine as a business," Dr. Caplan said.
In the mid-1990's, one popular approach for academic medical centers to cut costs, protect assets and pool resources was the merger. In a few cases, like the marriage of the Peter Bent Brigham and Massachusetts General Hospitals in Boston, and the New York and Presbyterian Hospitals in Manhattan, the strategy appears to have worked. At others, like the failed merger of Stanford University and the University of California at San Francisco hospitals and the troubled relationship between New York University Hospitals Center and the Mount Sinai Hospital, the results have been far from successful.
Dr. William T. Mallon, director of organization and management studies at the Association of American Medical Colleges, compared the merger movement to medical alchemy. "The movers behind many academic hospital mergers during the 1990's tried to make gold from two separate structures," he said, "without a complete view or understanding of each substance and with too much focus on outcome rather than process." 
Looking to the future, Ralph W. Muller, the chief executive of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, said, "The real challenge of running an academic medical center will be tempering the business ethos of acting instantly with the professional tendency to make measured judgments." He also worries that hospitals that mainly serve the poor and uninsured are more vulnerable than those that mainly serve patients who are insured or can pay for their own medical care. "If you do good, you get penalized and that has to change," Mr. Muller added.
Dr. Robert P. Kelch, chief executive of the University of Michigan Health System, predicts that research-oriented medical centers will need to be run and financed differently from the centers that focus mainly on patient care and the training of doctors and nurses.
"The free market never gets things right," Dr. Kelch said. "In this case, it has led to a more stratified health care system that may lead to a real crisis as the baby boomers age. My hope is that academic medical centers will help Americans come to a national consensus that will not only ensure the highest quality of health care and medical science but also universal access."
As Dr. Kastor insists, these institutions are hardly endangered. "If you read the newspapers, you can't imagine how they are going to survive," he said, "and probably some of the weaker ones may close. But these institutions perform extremely important functions for society. You need to look at the functions they fulfill, not just the problems they have."

HEADLINE: PERSONAL HEALTH; 
Benefit of Bed Rest Is Largely a Wives' Tale

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Kris Kim, my daughter-in-law, was working hard and seven months pregnant with twins when a routine checkup showed that her cervix was stretched nearly to its maximum and that her uterus was contracting at frequent intervals.
 The diagnosis was premature labor. 
 The treatment was complete bed rest in the hospital, plus a host of drugs to try to halt the contractions and, at the same time, stimulate maturation of the babies' lungs in case they arrived 10 weeks early.
Complete bed rest meant just that. No bathroom privileges, no sitting, standing or even raising her head for a week. Week 2, she was allowed to sit inclined for part of the day and work on her laptop computer. The third week she could use a commode instead of a bedpan, and finally, the fourth week she was granted five minutes a day to shower. 
At 34 weeks of gestation, the critical point for fetal lung development, Kris was sent home for more bed rest. Then, as fate would have it, after all that, Kris's labor had to be induced at 38 weeks. Her reward was two healthy 7-pound boys. 
At least one pregnant woman in five is assigned to a week of bed rest or more in an effort to avoid complications and preterm births. The cost -- which may include lost wages, hospitalization, home health aides, child care and transportation -- can be extraordinary. The emotional and social costs are inestimable.
Yet, for all the trauma it can cause, bed rest has never been shown in good clinical studies to achieve its desired goals.
"Some benefits may be there, but they haven't been documented," said Dr. Judith A. Maloni of the Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University, who just completed a $1.7 million study of bed rest supported by the National Institutes of Health. In fact, as Dr. Maloni's study showed, there is good evidence that bed rest in pregnancy can cause harm, resulting in more than a dozen consequences, including babies who are smaller than normal and mothers who are too weak and tired to care for them.
Dr. Robert L. Goldenberg, an expert in maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said in an interview: "Most obstetricians believe bed rest will reduce the risk of preterm births and other pregnancy complications like preeclampsia, incompetent cervix and intrauterine growth retardation. But the data are mostly nonexistent. Medicine has a lot of folk myths. This is just one of them."
Dr. Goldenberg noted, for example, that in two of four clinical trials of preventive bed rest in twin pregnancies, the women randomly assigned to hospital bed rest experienced a greater rate of preterm births than those who weren't. The other two studies showed no difference.
So why do doctors persist in prescribing bed rest, not only when prematurity threatens but often preventively, especially in pregnancies involving two or more babies? In Dr. Goldenberg's view, "physicians don't have any real tools to prevent preterm birth, but they want to do something so they choose one they think is innocuous."

A List of Hazards
Dr. Maloni said aerospace scientists had demonstrated adverse effects of bed rest, like muscle atrophy, bone loss and blood clots. She said the women in her study averaged 17 physical problems directly related to bed rest, including aches in backs, hips and muscles; headaches; nasal congestion; dry skin and lips; high levels of depression; muscle atrophy; increased fatigue; weight loss or failure to gain normally; abnormal carbohydrate metabolism; reduced blood volume; and lower red blood cell count.
Their babies also tended to weigh less than normal, perhaps because there were fewer blood cells to carry oxygen and nutrients to the womb.
After giving birth, many of the women found themselves so out of shape that they had trouble getting out of a car or using their legs to stand up, and they were so fatigued that their ability to care for their newborns was compromised.
Dr. Maloni suggested that after childbirth, women who have been on bed rest should undergo cardiovascular and physical assessments and receive a rehabilitation program.
Physical problems aside, women who have endured enforced bed rest describe themselves as bored, frustrated, depressed, irritable, guilty and scared. Many mention increased family and spousal tensions and angry young children at home. Fathers, meanwhile, have to take over all the household responsibilities while continuing to work and wait on their wives or visit them.
The economic burdens can be great, as well, especially if the women have jobs that they can't perform in bed and young children who need care. One study estimated the cost of bed rest per woman at $1,400.
"The Future of Children," from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, assessed the research on "preventive" bed rest in twin pregnancies and said, "In the absence of proof of the effectiveness of bed rest, its use should be curtailed sharply, and randomized trials should be conducted to see whether bed rest at home or in the hospital actually does prevent the wide array of conditions for which it is currently used."
So why do so many women follow prescriptions of bed rest? Mostly because they are afraid not to. As Kris explained: "I was told that there were no concrete studies. But fear plays a big part. You've got to play it conservatively. After all, it's not just about you. It's about one or more other beings. You have to rely a lot on the experience of your providers who believe that if a woman is put on bed rest, the pregnancy will last a little longer."
Heidi Zarou of Brooklyn said she believed that her five weeks on home bed rest -- she started having contractions at 32 weeks -- enabled her to carry her twins for 37 weeks, resulting in two healthy babies, a 5-pound boy and a 6-pound girl, who were able to go home with her a few days later.

Weathering It
Advice abounds on weathering bed rest: Shift positions often, moving from side to side. But avoid lying on the back, because that can decrease blood flow to the placenta. Use pillows to support the abdomen, upper leg, shoulders and back. Do simple exercises to enhance circulation and minimize loss of muscle tone. Point and flex toes, rotate hands and feet, roll the head, and tense and relax the arm and leg muscles.
Find ways to pass the time. Read, knit or crochet. Do needlework, draw, write letters, watch educational videos, volunteer to make phone calls or address envelopes for a local charity. You may, like Kris , be able to continue working using a laptop, telephone or dictation machine. 
Have the room arranged to maximize comfort and convenience. Hobby or work items, tissues, water pitcher, telephone and address book, radio, remote control and, if necessary, a cooler stocked with lunch and snacks should be at bedside. Be sure to eat regular healthy meals and drink lots of fluids. Foster well-being by arranging for an at-home massage, manicure or haircut.
If friends and relatives offer help, accept it graciously -- and if they do not offer, ask them. Give practical assignments like vacuuming; going to the post office, dry cleaner or supermarket; or taking a youngster for a play date or sleepover. If you have children, invite them to join you in bed to cuddle, read or watch television, and find tasks they can do to help, however simple.

HEADLINE: New Cancer Test Stirs Hope and Concern 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Jill Doimer's mother died in 2002 from ovarian cancer, detected too late to be effectively treated. 
 So Ms. Doimer is eagerly awaiting the introduction of a new test that holds the promise of detecting early-stage ovarian cancer far more accurately than any test available now, using only blood from a finger prick. 
 Not only does she plan to be tested, but an advocacy group she helped found, Ovarian Awareness of Kentucky, also intends to spread the word to women and doctors. 
"If it's going to happen to me or anyone I know, I want it to be caught at an early stage," said Ms. Doimer, who lives in Louisville. 
The new test, expected to be available in the next few months, could have a big effect on public health if it works as advertised. That is because when ovarian cancer is caught early, when it is treatable by surgery, more than 90 percent of women live five years or longer. But right now, about three-quarters of cases are detected after the cancerhas advanced, and then only 35 percent of women survive five years. 
The test is also the first to use a new technology that some believers say could revolutionize diagnostics. It looks not for a single telltale protein -- like the prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., used to diagnose prostate cancer -- but rather for a complex fingerprint formed by all the proteins in the blood. Similar tests are being developed for prostate, pancreatic, breast and other cancers. The technique may work for other diseases as well. 
"I've been in cancer research for 40 years and I think it's the most important breakthrough in those years," said Dr. John S. Kovach, director of the Long Island Cancer Center at Stony Brook University. "I think in 10 years ladies will have blood tests instead of a mammogram for breast cancer." 
Some experts, however, say that the technique, while promising, is still unproved. They say the ovarian test in particular has not been adequately validated and is being put on the market prematurely through a route that does not require approval by the Food and Drug Administration. If the test is not accurate, they say, it could result in unnecessary surgery for biopsies or ovary removal for many women. 
"Certainly there's no published work that would make me tell a woman she should get this test," said Dr. Nicole Urban, head of gynecologic cancer research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. 
Three statisticians from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston analyzed data put on the Internet by the test developers and say they found various inconsistencies. 
"We're saying that on the basis of the data they posted, no, we don't believe this works," said one of the statisticians, Dr. Keith A. Baggerly, assistant professor in the department of biostatistics and applied mathematics. 
The test, called OvaCheck, was developed by Correlogic Systems Inc., of Bethesda, Md., with scientists from the National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration.
Correlogic Systems has licensed the test to Quest Diagnostics of Teterboro, N.J., and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, known as LabCorp, of Burlington, N.C., the nation's two biggest clinical laboratory companies. Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, which will compete, say they expect to begin offering the test in the next few months. The price is expected to be $100 to $200. 
Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp will analyze blood samples sent by doctors, rather than sell test kits to doctors and hospitals. Tests performed at a central location do not require F.D.A. approval. 
Diagnostic companies say such "home-brew" tests are a common way to make them available quickly and that for some tests it would not be economically practical to conduct the clinical trials needed for F.D.A. approval. At times, though, the agency has had concerns that such tests have not been adequately validated. The agency recently ordered Roche to take a complex genetic test off the market until it could be approved by the agency. 
Dr. Emmanuel F. Petricoin III, an agency scientist who helped develop OvaCheck, said the criticisms of it were based "in some instances on not understanding the entirety of the science." And executives at Correlogic Systems, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp say it is not fair to cite lack of validation because they are validating the test now. 
Gary Samuels, a spokesman for Quest Diagnostics, said his company and LabCorp were each testing the same 1,000 samples to see if they got the same results, a validation process he called "lengthy and meticulous." He said Quest Diagnostics expected to decide by the end of the month whether the test was reliable enough to market.
Brad Smith, executive vice president for public affairs at LabCorp, agreed, saying, "If we're not comfortable with it, it won't launch." 
Many companies and academic labs have joined the race to find so-called biomarkers, blood components like proteins or lipids that can signal disease. 
"There are very few diseases, when you really go through it, that we can diagnose with a simple blood or urine test," said Dr. Gordon Ringold, chairman and chief executive of SurroMed, a Menlo Park, Calif., company looking for such markers. 
Until now, said Dr. Howard Schulman, vice president of research and development at SurroMed, "biomarker discovery has relied on knowing everything possible about the disease," searching for proteins involved in the cause of the disease. 
But results have been sparse. In the last decade only about 10 proteins have been the basis for diagnostic tests approved by the F.D.A. For instance, Matritech Inc., a company in Newton, Mass., sells a bladder cancer screening test that looks for a protein called NMP22. 
A single biomarker may not work because a disease is heterogeneous or because more than one condition can cause a protein's level to rise, resulting in false positives. That is the case with the P.S.A. for prostate cancer. 
So, now, the search for biomarkers is shifting. Instead of trying to understand disease mechanisms, some companies are using new technology called proteomics to screen cells or blood rapidly, looking for proteins present in diseased people but not in healthy ones. Similar efforts are being used for genes and metabolites, substances like fatty acids made by cells.
Moreover, in many cases, scientists are trying to find not a single marker but several that could be used together to get a more accurate reading. 
OvaCheck goes a step beyond that. It analyzes patterns made by all the proteins in the blood without even knowing what the proteins are. 
In the tests, proteins in the blood sample are analyzed by a mass spectrometer, a complex machine that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The proteins are vaporized, given an electric charge and propelled down a tube. How fast they make the trip depends on their mass. The machine produces a squiggly graph that essentially shows the distribution of masses in the blood sample. There are thousands of data points, with spikes corresponding to particularly abundant proteins. 
Correlogic Systems developed a computer program that analyzes these complex patterns and learns to distinguish between blood from patients with cancer and blood from those without. 
When the technique was first tried on 116 blood samples from women whose disease status was already known, it correctly detected all cases of ovarian cancer, including 18 in the earliest stage. It classified only 5 percent of the noncancerous samples as cancerous. When the results were published in the medical journal Lancet in 2002, it suggested a powerful testing method was at hand. 
"We think now that there is an entire ocean of biomarkers that never before was known to exist," said Dr. Petricoin. He is co-director of the clinical proteomics program run by the F.D.A. and the National Cancer Institute with Dr. Lance A. Liotta, who helped develop the ovarian test. 
Ovarian cancer, which causes about 14,000 deaths a year in the United States, is now diagnosed with a test for a single protein called Cancer Antigen 125. But CA-125 is best at detecting a recurrence of cancer or a late-stage cancer, not a disease in the early stages. Vaginal ultrasound, another often-used technique, is also not so good for early-stage disease, experts say. 
But experts say OvaCheck must give virtually no false positives to make it useful for general screening. Fifteen women out of 100,000 get ovarian cancer each year, said Dr. Beth Y. Karlan, director of gynecologic oncology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
So if OvaCheck were used for yearly checks on the whole population, even a 1 percent rate of false positives would mean 1,000 false diagnoses for every 15 cases detected. 
Peter J. Levine, president of Correlogic Systems, said for that reason, the test would be recommended only for women at high risk for ovarian cancer, a population of about 10 million in the United States. This includes women with relatives who have had ovarian cancer, women who have had breast cancer, and women with mutations in genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 that indicate a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Other experts said that women who tested positive would be given the CA-125 test and vaginal ultrasound to try to confirm the diagnoses, rather than being sent for surgery immediately. 
Yet another problem, some experts said, is that the samples taken to test the technique so far have come mainly from women who were scheduled for surgery, meaning their cancer had produced noticeable symptoms. Dr. Petricoin conceded that it was unclear if the test would work equally well for early-stage ovarian cancer that does not produce symptoms, as is often the case. 
Some experts say they would not trust a test in which the proteins being measured and their biological relationship to cancer are unknown.
"If you don't know what you're measuring, it's a dangerous black-box technology," said Dr. Eleftherios P. Diamandis, head of clinical biochemistry at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. He said the rare proteins that might indicate cancer were likely to be drowned out by abundant proteins in the blood. "They are rushing into something and it could be a disaster," Dr. Diamandis added. 
Dr. Petricoin countered that recent studies had shown that the rare proteins adhere to more abundant blood proteins, so their concentration is increased to detectable levels. And he said the failure to develop many biomarkers so far showed how hard it was to identify specific proteins. "We don't understand many of the basic mechanisms of cancer yet, and we think we have knowledge of what markers to use?" Dr. Petricoin said. "It's false." 
Some critics say that for the test to be accepted, the Lancet data must be reproduced by others and the technique tested in larger trials.
For instance, Dr. Karlan of Cedars-Sinai said, a few years ago scientists were excited by early results of an ovarian cancer test using a marker called LPA, but results of a larger test were disappointing. LPL Technologies, a Cleveland company, is still working to validate that test. 
The Lancet data could not be reproduced exactly even by the test developers. They found that the mass spectrometer they used, which was made for research, not high-volume work, produced different patterns even when the same samples were tested on different days. So they switched to a new machine. 
William E. Rich, president and chief executive of Ciphergen Biosystems Inc., which made the equipment used in the Lancet study, said that the machines were reliable and that his company had stopped working with Correlogic Systems because "we don't have confidence in that approach." Ciphergen Biosystems,which is based in Fremont, Calif., hopes to introduce its own ovarian cancer test, based on three known proteins, by the end of this year, Dr. Rich said. 
Developers of OvaCheck said that though different machines and sample preparation techniques resulted in different patterns, the computer could figure out how to discriminate cancer from noncancer. They retested the Lancet samples with different equipment and got the same good results, they said. With a larger sample, they had 100 percent accuracy, with no false positives. So as long as Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp are consistent in how they process samples, they should get good results, they said.
And others have shown the approach works. Dr. O. John Semmes, an associate professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School, is using protein patterns to develop a prostate cancer diagnostic. He said his group had found that multiple labs got the same results when they ran the same set of samples. Still, he said, more extensive validation is needed and is under way.
OvaCheck's developers plan to conduct a clinical trial to win F.D.A approval for diagnosing recurrences of ovarian cancer. A trial for approval as an early-stage diagnostic tool would take too long, they said.
Dr. Petricoin says that even if the test is not perfect, it is "blowing away what's being used now," like the CA-125 test.
"You have women right now that are getting prophylactic oophorectomies based on CA-125," he said, referring to the surgical removal of ovaries to prevent cancer. 
For that reason, some doctors think the test will be in great demand from anxious women who view ovarian cancer as a death sentence. 
"Before you mass-market to the uninformed, fearful population, it should be peer-reviewed," said Dr. Karlan of Cedars-Sinai. But when asked whether she would recommend her patients not get tested, she said: "It doesn't matter what I recommend. They are going to do it anyway."

To the Editor:
Re "Has the Shuttle Become NASA's '76 Dart?": Space travel will advance only when we develop real propulsion systems. 
NASA is being held back by its use of chemical rockets, which are merely a trivial extension of the gunpowder rockets developed in China centuries ago. 
 To create more sophisticated technology like nuclear propulsion, we need another Manhattan Project that will provide long-term employment and economic rewards. 
 Sadly, President Bush's latest proposal has failure built into it and will become such an expensive fiasco that it may ultimately kill America's support for space travel.

HEADLINE: Rooms to Succeed; 
For the Children of Indian-American Hoteliers, All Is Possible

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Vinu Patel realized his immigrant dreams by working 100 hours a week to turn a profit on a struggling motel. He wanted something better for his children.
 Morning and night, Mr. Patel, an immigrant from the Indian state of Gujarat, manned the front desk and did repairs on a 60-room Econo Lodge in Bordentown, N.J., while his wife, Indu, and two children hauled suitcases, made up beds and vacuumed rooms. And the work paid off. At age 57, Mr. Patel owns not only the Econo Lodge but, with relatives, four other hotels. 
 As with thousands of other Indian hotel owners, Mr. Patel hoped his children would choose to stay in the hotel business, but he wanted them to work with bankers and brokers rather than as bellhops. So, with an immigrant's classic trust in education but a novel Indian twist, he helped put his son, Montu, and daughter, Payal, through hotel school, in their case the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University. 
Immigrants from India -- mostly from the state of Gujarat and many bearing the name Patel, which is common in the region -- have, during the last three decades, quietly acquired more than one-third of the 53,000 hotels in the United States, most of them budget and mid-priced franchises, hotel industry officials say. But this strike-it-rich story has more recently taken a compelling though not entirely surprising turn. 
At hotel schools like those at Cornell University, New York University and San Diego State University, as well as more general business schools, the children are studying how to manage chains of hotels, work in corporate offices of name-brand franchisers and acquire more upscale properties like Marriott and Hilton. Call them the Cornell hotel Patels.
"What we did we did the practical way," said Vinu Patel, reflecting on the generational change. "With their educational background, the children can work for corporate America. They understand what corporations are looking for in the hotel industry -- how to market and acquire the product better than we do." Montu, who received his master's degree in May, is advising his father on acquiring new hotels while working full time as director of sales and account development for American Express's travel agency network. Payal, who attended N.Y.U.'s undergraduate hospitality program, evaluates hotels and other real estate for Standard & Poor's.
The children are not only pursuing bigger and better hotels but also, apparently, hipper hotels. 
Jay and Neil Shah's parents started with a run-down hotel in downtown Harrisburg, Pa., in 1984, but the sons, armed with degrees from Cornell and Harvard, took the business public in 1999 as Hersha Hospitality Trust. Their $275-million-plus company, named for their mother, operates 27 hotels, and among them is the recently built 24-story Hampton Inn in Chelsea, which Neil Shah describes with the kind of business argot that reflects a newly minted generation. 
"Our strategy is to try to bring mid-priced hotels into the Manhattan urban market, but to do so with a bit of flair," he said. "We work with top designers and fit our hotels out with a contemporary fresh look that people identify with New York, with cutting-edge design, but for which they don't have to pay $300 a night." (Rooms at his Hampton Inn start at $149.) 
Sociologists call businesses dominated by a single ethnic group, like the diners owned by Greeks, fruit stores owned by Koreans and a nursing profession with an abundance of West Indians and Filipinos, "ethnic niche businesses." They say the children of the Gujarati immigrants illustrate what sometimes happens with the second generation 
Sometimes, as with Korean grocers, the parents want the children to become doctors and scientists, far outside their own line of work. At other times, as happened among many Jews in the garment industry and Italians in construction, the children raise their parents' livelihood to new levels, working as designers and dress manufacturers rather than cutters and sewing-machine operators, becoming the construction contractors on skyscrapers rather than toiling as stonemasons.
Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, said that certain immigrant groups often concentrated in certain businesses because of a particular characteristic of the American labor market at the time they arrived.
When Indians came here in large numbers after the loosening of immigration laws in the 1960's, the hotel business was at a watershed. With the growth of interstate highways, American travelers were shunning tumbledown roadside motels and welcoming sleek new franchises like Holiday Inn. The gas crisis of the 1970's and the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's meant that a lot of these hotels could be picked up cheaply enough for immigrants to afford, said Dr. Chekitan Dev, a professor of marketing at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. 
But running a hotel is a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year business, often operated with the loneliness and dislocation pictured in the movie "Mississippi Masala." "That's the sacrifice they're prepared to make," said Hitesh Bhakta, chairman of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association. "If you want to improve your lot in life, educate your children, then maybe you have to go to Minnesota where no one else will go."
The Indians' knowledge of English and a commercial savvy prized by their culture gave them a distinct leg up on other immigrants, and they had a network of relatives and close friends to help out. Like much of India, Gujarat, on the west coast just north of Bombay, has a deeply rooted ethic of hospitality. 
"There's actually a phrase in Hindi: 'A guest is like God,"' Professor Dev said.
Mr. Bhakta (formerly Patel -- he changed his name to make it distinct) said that his 8,400 members own 20,000 hotels worth $37 billion, including half the nation's Days Inns, half its Ramadas, 40 percent of its Holiday Inns. The group has become such a presence that it is negotiating with insurance carriers to lower steeply rising rates for its members. Not surprisingly, the negotiations are being led by Tarun Vig, a 27-year-old Indian-American and Harvard M.B.A. from a hotel-owning clan.
At Cornell's hotel school, 13 percent of the graduate students are of Indian origin.
"I don't want to stay as a mom-and-pop operation," said Vikas Patel, a second-year student. "I want to make it on a bigger scale."
Students are studying finance, property development and labor negotiations, learning such things as how to evaluate the profitability of a hotel and how to cut costs by pooling laundry services and airport transportation for different hotel brands. Most hotel chains allow owners to manage competing brands as long as chain standards are maintained.
This semester, the "executive-in-residence" at Cornell will be H.P. Rama, who as a young immigrant worked as a waiter at a Howard Johnson's restaurant in Manhattan and is now chief executive of JHM Hotels, a family business that owns 33 hotels with 5,000 rooms in the Southeast. In 1999, he became the first Indian chairman of the American Hotel and Lodging Association. His nephew, Vinay M. Rama, is a senior at Cornell hotel school's undergraduate division. 
Vikas Patel's father, Ramesh Patel, the son of Gujarati sugar cane farmers, came here in 1970 to complete his studies in civil engineering. While working as an engineer, he also invested in a 30-room hotel in Tempe, Ariz. Now, with three brothers-in-law and a friend, he owns three Days Inns and a Best Western in Arizona and New Mexico., and he is delighted that his son is being formally educated in the hotel business.
"He will learn more marketing skills, the business skills that I didn't learn directly," the elder Mr. Patel said. "He will do a lot of networking and come into contact with lots of people in the hotel business." 
Vikas Patel actually started medical school, but the siren song of the hotel business proved too seductive.
"I want to expand our family business, maybe increase the level of the brands we own, like Hampton Inn or Hilton Garden Inn or Courtyard by Marriott, possibly even some full-service properties like a Marriott or Holiday Inn," he said.
There are more than a few cultural twists to Indian hotel ownership. Some Hindus have spurned the larger hotels because the restaurants they include require them to serve alcohol and cook meat. Professor Dev says that sometimes there is tension between the generations, as parents resent their children's foisting new commercial ideas on them. "They're questioning the business model that enabled the parents to send their kids to Cornell in the first place," Dr. Dev said.
But even those parents do not begrudge their children's education. 
"We don't want it to be a crapshoot like it was for us," is the way Dr. Dev phrased the parents' attitude. "We were lucky; you may not be so lucky."

HEADLINE: In Connecticut, a City Familiar With Scandal 

BYLINE:  By MIKE McINTIRE

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn. 

 BODY:
First as a congressman and then as governor, John G. Rowland has elicited the occasional chuckle by referring to his hometown, only half-jokingly, as the "center of the universe."
 For residents proud of Mr. Rowland and loyal to this faded mill city in the Naugatuck Valley of Connecticut, his quip carries a delicious conceit: while Waterbury's halcyon age as a leading manufacturer of brass may be long dead, it retains its outsize reputation for producing politicians infused with the same alloy. 
 But if the city occupies the center of Mr. Rowland's universe, it has also long been regarded as a sort of quasar of corruption, spewing it forth into the political galaxy of this small state. This reputation is so solidified that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman once felt comfortable joking that upon his death, he hoped to be buried in Waterbury so he could remain politically active. 
Now, even some of the governor's closest allies are asking whether his unabashed attachment to Waterbury, once viewed as endearing, could be partly to blame for his current ethical troubles.
"The names that keep coming up, most of them are buddies from Waterbury," said an aide to Mr. Rowland in Hartford, 30 miles away, referring to people involved in financial dealings with the governor that are under scrutiny. "He's never gotten away from the whole Waterbury thing, his friends from down there."
It is an impression reinforced by Mr. Rowland himself. Asked in December about disclosures that he had joined an investment partnership with a state paving contractor, a lawyer and a developer all from the Waterbury area, he shrugged off any possibility of a conflict, replying: "When I look at these three individuals, I look at them as friends."
No evidence has surfaced that the governor or his friends have done anything illegal. But enough questions have been raised about his financial affairs, including improvements made to his weekend cottage, that both a federal grand jury and a legislative impeachment committee are investigating.
As they do, the observation has been made more than once that this is hardly the first time F.B.I. agents, journalists or other investigators have found themselves making a pilgrimage to the Brass City in search of answers to some sort of scandal.
Before Mr. Rowland, the highest-ranking state official to be subjected to a criminal inquiry was Lt. Gov. T. Frank Hayes, a Democrat who doubled as the mayor of Waterbury and who was convicted of looting the city's coffers in 1939. It was Mr. Rowland's grandfather Sherwood L. Rowland, the Republican city comptroller, who blew the whistle on Mayor Hayes.
The city's reputation for political shenanigans was reinforced in 1986, when the statewide Democratic primary for governor was thrown into turmoil because of an absentee ballot scandal in Waterbury. Among other problems, dead people were found to have voted.
Then there is the uncomfortable fact that for more than 20 years, including the entire decades of the 1980's and 1990's, Waterbury was governed by three mayors who faced criminal charges at one time or another.
Edward D. Bergin Jr., a Democrat whose father had been mayor, was charged in 1988 with accepting a bribe from a towing contractor. He was acquitted three years later, and promptly announced his intention to retake the mayor's office from the Republican who had succeeded him, Joseph J. Santopietro.
By then, Mr. Santopietro had been indicted in a sweeping corruption investigation of his administration, and was seeking re-election. One of his supporters drove around the city in a truck festooned with balloons and huge placards that read, "Santopietro: Innocent Until Proven Guilty!"
Prosecutors portrayed a greedy clique of Republicans, led by Mayor Santopietro, plotting within months of his election to take what they viewed as rightfully theirs after years of Democratic rule. In his defense, Mr. Santopietro insisted that his money-making deals were harmless transactions among friends and family.
The trial provided a rare window into what some observers believe is at the root of much of Waterbury's troubles: a "spoils of victory" mentality that seems to permeate the political culture, abetted by an inability to separate bare-knuckle campaigning from the more nuanced requirements of office.
"Politics in Waterbury is the No. 1 contact sport, and some of that did carry over into the administration of government," said Gary Reardon, the chairman of the city Democratic Party, who lost a bruising primary battle with Mr. Bergin in 1991.
"For a long time," said Mr. Reardon, "it was in the fabric of Waterbury politics, this problem of a lack of separation between the campaign and the office."
Mr. Bergin won handily against Mr. Santopietro, who was convicted and sentenced to a federal prison in 1992.
After serving a few terms, Mr. Bergin was defeated by Philip A. Giordano, a Republican lawyer and former marine who charmed voters with promises of a Waterbury renaissance. But in 2001, Mr. Giordano took City Hall's shaky reputation to new depths with his arrest on child sex charges.
Mr. Giordano, whose tenure as mayor also remains the subject of a political corruption investigation, was convicted last year in the sex case and sent to prison.
The unexpected convergence of sex and corruption is not without precedent in Waterbury's colorful, if checkered, history. A 1954 cover story in Stag, a popular men's magazine of the day, was devoted to tales of graft, underage sex and other debauchery in what it called "the brassiest, blowsiest, bawdiest town this side of Butte, Montana."
"Let's face it," the writer concluded after a lengthy romp on the city's dark side, "Waterbury is a triple-plated, grade-A sin pit."
The seemingly endless cycle of corruption investigations, each sparking a renewed round of what's-wrong-with-Waterbury introspection, has grown tiresome for many in this fiercely proud blue-collar city, which dominates the state's western valley communities.
"I don't even want to talk about, it's too depressing," said Joe Alvarez, walking past vacant Main Street storefronts on a recent weekday. "Look around this place -- we've got enough problems without politicians giving us a bad name."
Once known as the brass capital of the world, home to the Chase, Scovill and Anaconda companies, Waterbury began a long, painful descent into economic decline after World War II. The old factories, engines of growth and jobs for thousands of immigrants for more than a century, gradually closed up or left town.
The influence of the long-dead brass barons is still felt in the faded grandeur of Waterbury's municipal offices, which occupy two granite and marble buildings designed about 85 years ago by Cass Gilbert. The larger of the two buildings, which face each other across Grand Street, was originally the headquarters of Chase Brass, and it loomed above what was then City Hall -- a testament to where political power resided in that industrial era.
Since becoming governor in 1995, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, has steered more than $100 million in economic aid to his hometown, giving a lift to an otherwise struggling local economy. He moved some state offices there, and his administration has helped finance numerous projects, including renovation of the Palace Theater, a popular landmark.
Until his recent ethical troubles, Mr. Rowland was viewed in Connecticut political circles as something of an anomaly, loyal to Waterbury and his friends there, yet free of the taint that has clung to some other politicians who came up through the city's wards. He proudly invoked his family's reputation as defenders of clean government -- his father also was Waterbury's comptroller -- and he hung a photo of his grandfather in his Capitol office.
The reputation served him well. During Mr. Rowland's first, unsuccessful run for governor in 1990, the first President Bush did not hesitate to come campaign for him, telling cheering supporters that Mr. Rowland was following in his grandfather's footsteps "of fighting and battling and rooting out corruption."
Last week, Mr. Rowland was noticeably absent when the younger President Bush came to the state for a fund-raiser attended by virtually every other Connecticut Republican of prominence. Mr. Bush left without mentioning Mr. Rowland's name.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN MEMO; 
When the Long Haul Is No Longer an Option

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards of North Carolina says he will drop out of the presidential race if he does not win the primary in South Carolina tonight. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri withdrew two weeks ago after losing the caucuses in next-door Iowa.
 Howard Dean's new campaign manager, Roy Neel, says Dr. Dean, the former Vermont governor, will continue to fight and is hoping for a turnaround beginning with the Wisconsin primary on Feb. 17, two weeks and more than a dozen contests down the road. Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut say that they, too, have no intention of dropping out. 
 Still, there is a moment when candidates must ask themselves whether dwindling resources and repeated defeats leave any hope alive. Often, this is accompanied by behind-the-scenes pressure to clear the field for the putative front-runner in the name of party unity.
"It's a very hard decision, as personal as a decision can be," said Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska senator who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1992 and is now president of the New School University in New York. "In life and in politics, getting off the dance floor is about as important as getting on. In fact, I think it's more important how you get off, because at some point you begin to draw attention to the fact that you're dancing all by yourself."
This year, the pressure to get out may be magnified by what polls say is a tendency among Democrats to rally quickly behind the candidate they believe has the best chance of unseating President Bush.
"The voters do not want a sideshow," Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, said. "They want the real thing. They want a candidate to emerge soon. So these guys need to get some gas, and the way to get gas is to get votes. And if they don't get the votes, they need to get out of there."
As long as the money lasts, however, the urge is to persist, said Robert H. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell. "So they end up like Bruce Willis in 'The Sixth Sense,' " Professor Frank said. "They're dead, but they don't know it yet."
And with presidential campaigns becoming more front-loaded in recent decades, when early primary victories can all but assure the nomination, this moment of truth is arriving earlier and earlier. 
In 1996, the Republicans Lamar Alexander and Richard G. Lugar did not drop out until after Super Tuesday, in early March, and Steve Forbes resisted public pressure from Republican leaders until mid-March. Even then, Patrick J. Buchanan and Alan Keyes stayed in the race until just before the Republican National Convention in August. 
In 2000, the main challengers, Bill Bradley on the Democratic side and John McCain, a Republican, stayed in the race until mid-March.
But this year, just barely into February, with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts sitting on back-to-back victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, the talk is already about which of the seven remaining Democratic candidates will withdraw next.
"I can point to instance after instance over the years where a candidate will say, 'Oh, I'm in this all the way to the convention,' and then drop out a couple of days later," said William G. Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern University and author of "The Front-Loading Problem in Presidential Nominations." 
Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has said he expects a nominee by the second week of March, but he advises voters in the meantime to let the process unfold. "It's still early," Mr. McAuliffe said. "We've only had two days of voting. Let the system work. The system will do it." Still, Mr. McAuliffe is quietly orchestrating efforts to narrow the field after today, some Democrats said.
To win the Democratic nomination, a candidate needs the votes of 2,161 delegates at this summer's national convention in Boston.
Mr. Neel has said that Dr. Dean expects one or more of the other candidates to drop out after Tuesday's voting, and more in the next two weeks, until by the Wisconsin primary Dr. Dean will be head to head with Mr. Kerry. Because so many major states are voting in the first two weeks of March, enough time remains to win the race or to at least deny Mr. Kerry a majority going into the convention.
Whatever the case, Dr. Dean has said that should Mr. Kerry or any other candidate lock up the nomination, he will drop out of the race. 
The rush to nudge candidates out of the race is relatively new. Until 1968, candidates usually made it to the convention, Professor Mayer said. Even in the early 1980's, many stayed in until late June. 
Only in more recent elections, as campaigning has become more expensive and the calendars increasingly compressed, have so many candidates dropped out within weeks of the first contests, long before anyone has a lock on the nomination.
In this climate, only a handful of maverick candidates -- among them Mr. Buchanan, the conservative broadcaster, in 1996, and the Rev. Al Sharpton this year -- have remained in the race long beyond any hope of victory, because they were running not simply to win but to spread a message or to raise their profiles.
"I think public calls on candidates to drop out are unfair," Mr. Kerrey said. "They have the exclusive right to decide when to get out. Everyone gets real anxious about this, but these things have a way of working themselves out."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: TRANSPORTATION; 
Senate Presses Confrontation On Costly Transportation Bill

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Despite warnings from the White House and conservatives about the cost of a new transportation measure, the Senate agreed on Monday to move ahead with the legislation, which significantly exceeds what President Bush wants to spend on roads, bridges and mass transit.
 Senators voted 75 to 11 to take up the proposal, which would provide $311 billion for thousands of federal, state and local transportation projects over six years. Leaders of both parties called the bill essential to bolster the economy and relieve congestion on the nation's roads. 
 "It's a jobs issue," said Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, estimating that every $1 billion invested in transportation led to $2 billion in related economic activity and 47,000 jobs. "This bill is a quality-of-life issue. And it's a serious safety issue as well."
The Senate vote came just hours after the Bush administration issued its budget for 2005, which called for $256 billion in highway and transit spending. The differing price tags illustrate the difficulty the White House is going to have in meeting its spending targets and sets up a showdown between Mr. Bush and lawmakers interested in securing all the election-year highway money they can get.
The White House budget director, Joshua B. Bolten, was not yet ready to threaten a presidential veto against the transportation measure. But he said spending at the levels envisioned by the Senate -- or an even larger number sought by some House members -- would endanger the administration's goal of cutting the deficit in half over five years. 
"I expect the administration will be taking a firm line to keep that cost down," Mr. Bolten said, adding that the administration figure represented a 21 percent increase over the previous six-year program.
Senate critics called the highway measure just the latest in a line of deficit-digging legislative plans pushed by lawmakers incapable of spending restraint.
"This highway bill takes the American taxpayer for a ride, moving us down the road toward higher deficits and budgetary gimmicks that conceal its enormous cost," said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, who promised to fight the bill.
Other lawmakers from both parties said the measure was justified.
"I strongly support the president on virtually everything he is doing, but in this case I don't agree," said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. "We have a crisis in the country in terms of our infrastructure and we must meet this crisis."
Despite the vote to cut off debate and allow the Senate to begin consideration of the bill, its fate is uncertain. Dr. Frist said the Senate would devote most of the next two weeks to trying to fashion a measure that could attract the 60 votes necessary to defeat any filibuster. And even if the Senate passes a bill, the highway money is tied up in the House in a dispute over the spending level, with some members there pushing for an amount up to $375 billion, to be paid for with an increase in federal gasoline taxes, a plan the House leadership opposes.
As has been the case in the past, lawmakers will also fight over the formula that allocates highway money to each state, with senators from states like Texas contending that their residents unfairly pay more in gasoline tax revenues than they get back in federal aid.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OUTLAYS -- Transportation; 
Promoting a Budget As a Job Creator

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD, By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
The Bush administration's budget for transportation is $58.7 billion, up $4.4 billion from its request for the current fiscal year. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta called the proposal an employment bill, with each $1 billion spent on highways generating 47,500 jobs. Mr. Minetta also said the request would enhance safety, although the administration has shied from a federal law on failing to use seat belts, which Mr. Mineta identified as the single largest transportation problem. 
 The bill provides $14 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration. That includes a $393 million reduction in the budget for facilities and equipment. The aviation agency said it would defer several programs, including one to improve the accuracy of the Global Positioning System so it can be used to land planes in low visibility and another to let controllers and pilots communicate via e-mail instead of voice, which was supposed to improve the capacity of the air traffic system. 
 Mr. Mineta said last week that the F.A.A. should triple the capacity of the nation's air traffic system in the next few years, and he said yesterday that that should still happen, despite the cuts. 
The administrator of the agency, Marion C. Blakey, said the F.A.A. was studying whether to change the rule that requires air traffic controllers to retire at 56 and how much money would be saved through such a change. Many controllers were hired in 1981 as replacements for strikers and are now nearing the mandatory-retirement age. 
The budget request for Amtrak is for $900 million. For the current year, the administration also sought $900 million, but Congress approved $1.2 billion.
Mr. Mineta said the administration would be willing to support $1.4 billion for Amtrak but only if some of it went to new entities, partly financed by the states, that took over some Amtrak functions. MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: DOMESTIC SPENDING; 
Education Gets Large Increase, Especially for New U.S. Law

BYLINE:  By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO and LYNETTE CLEMETSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget for 2005 proposes its biggest increase for domestic spending not related to national security at the Education Department, which is charged with carrying out one of Mr. Bush's showcase issues, the No Child Left Behind law. 
 The budget leaves spending flat or decreased for other programs like child care, other education activities, housing, promoting clean air, clean water and land preservation. 
 Many longstanding programs like low-income housing assistance maintain current levels or are cut. The plan increases other signature items like so-called religious and community-based social services. The new requests, combined with a stated intent to make permanent many recent tax cuts, drew wide criticism from liberal groups and other advocacy organizations. 
"It amounts to class warfare in reverse," Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said. "It proposes to continue every tax cut for the most affluent people, even adding very large new tax cuts, while starting to cut significantly into basic programs like child care and housing assistance." 
On the other side, some conservative groups said the budget did not go far enough. Alison Fraser, director of economic policy for the Heritage Foundation, said her group believed that spending on "entitlement programs" like Medicare continued to exceed acceptable levels. "These are first steps," Ms. Fraser said." 
For the fourth year in a row, Mr. Bush proposed adding $1 billion to the money for the poorest schools, which are at the center of the new education law's goal to close achievement gaps between black and Hispanic and white students. The increase brings to $13.3 billion the sum for the neediest schools, 52 percent more than in 2001. 
Education Secretary Rod Paige said the 36 percent increase in his department's budget since 2001, the largest of any agency, reflected Mr. Bush's emphasis on his program. 
"The No Child Left Behind law," Dr. Paige said, "is more than sufficiently funded."
Education advocates said the budget achieved those gains largely by shortchanging other programs. The president of the American Federation of Teachers, Sandra Feldman, said that the increases in education spending had steadily shrunk, from 18 percent in 2002 to 3 percent.
The new budget recommends cuts to 38 programs, including those focused on dropout prevention, gifted and talented children, guidance counselors in elementary schools and increased parental involvement in poor communities. In addition to the extra Title I money for poor schools, the budget would provide $1.1 billion for Reading First, a program that seeks to have all children reading by the third grade, and $132 million for a similar preschoolers' program.
The $57.3 billion budget would also increase by $1 billion the money for disabled students and add $823 million for Pell grants to low-income college students. The plan disappointed representatives for college students by leaving the maximum Pell grant unchanged at $4,050 
Among the domestic items drawing criticism from liberals are Child Care and Development Block Grants, which give money to states to help low- and moderate-income working families with child care. Mandatory spending for the program for 2005 will remain at $2.7 billion. Although the budget calls for a slight increase in discretionary spending, to $2.1 billion from $2.09 billion, that amount dips consistently in the next four years, to $2.06 billion. A result, the administration acknowledges, is a gradual decline in child care and development services, lowering the number of children in such programs to 2.2 million in 2009 from 2.5 million.
The government plans major changes in Section 8 Housing Vouchers, rent subsidies for low-income families. According to the Housing and Urban Development Office, financing will dip slightly, to $14.3 billion from $14.5 billion. The main revision is changing how vouchers are issued, from a system based on housing units to one based on rents. Under the old system, the government guaranteed a set number of rental units and mandated that a poor family could not be forced to spend more than 30 percent of its income on rent.
Projects related to Faith-Based and Community Initiatives receive major attention. In addition to a $200 million request for drug treatments operated by religious and community groups, the budget includes $100 million for the Compassion Capital Fund, which helps religious and neighborhood groups receive federal money.
"The president continues to show his belief in America's armies of compassion," Jim Towey, director of the White House Office on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, said. "He is continuing what he said he would do when he was inaugurated."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: VETERANS; 
Veterans Move to Kerry, Even From Afar

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 2 

 BODY:
David Mitchell, a disabled Persian Gulf war veteran from Boston, came here to volunteer for John Kerry's South Carolina primary campaign, as he had done in Iowa and New Hampshire. He is a registered independent who voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and had never been politically active.
 Norman White, 81, who fought in World War II and lives in Virginia, arrived here on Friday, a new recruit in the Kerry campaign. Wayne Smith, a combat medic in Vietnam, felt so strongly about the Kerry bid that he took a week of vacation from his job in Rhode Island to take part in a phone bank directed towards veterans here. 
 "I've never done anything like this before but I'm so proud of his message, his personal courage and integrity," said Mr. Smith, finishing one of hundreds of calls for the day. "And believe me, as an African-American I hate being here and seeing these Confederate flags flying. But I think veterans can make a difference this year and it's so important."
Veterans are emerging as a new and potentially powerful constituency in this year's presidential race, having helped propel Mr. Kerry to victories in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
The Kerry campaign is hoping that the huge military population in South Carolina will produce a victory here as well for their candidate, a decorated soldier who has championed veterans' rights in the Senate.
In dozens of interviews over the past two days, many veterans here said they had recently become Kerry supporters. Strikingly, most of those interviewed said they had never before been involved in politics and some had not voted in years. Others were registered independents or even Republicans who had supported Mr. Bush in the last election.
"In Iowa, this band of brothers was out in the snow chasing down one vote at a time," said former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, a disabled veteran, who was playing host to a raucous Super Bowl party on Sunday for nearly 100 local and visiting "Veterans for Kerry" at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post here.
"The real story of New Hampshire and Iowa was this silent draw of new voters," Mr. Cleland said. "And it crosses party lines -- both Democrats and Republicans who are teed off with the current administration."
In New Hampshire, 36 percent of veterans and 39 percent of voters from military households voted for Mr. Kerry, according to exit polls from last week's primary -- about the same level of support for Kerry shown by most every other group.
Howard Dean placed second with both groups, with just over 20 percent of their vote. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, another veteran, was third with about 15 percent.
At the Veterans for Kerry phone bank in a nondescript strip mall, volunteers said that 30 percent to 50 percent of the more than 10,000 veterans they had contacted said they would vote for Mr. Kerry.
The military is omnipresent in this state. Twenty percent of registered voters in 2000 were veterans, and an estimated 4,000 Vietnam War veterans move to the state each year.
In addition, South Carolina is home to numerous military bases. The Navy is the largest employer in Charleston, and there is an "Armed Services Reception Desk" by the car rental desks at the Columbia airport.
One wild card in the elections this year is the size of the contingent of "independent" veterans and military personnel who have switched their allegiance since the 2000 campaign. 
"I don't think I could vote for George Bush again when I think of the 500 people killed in Iraq and what's happened to the economy in this country," said George Meagher, an independent, who runs the American Military Museum in Charleston and said he now favors Mr. Kerry.
This is a small state peppered with military families who are feeling the toll of the extended U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf. "If you're losing family, it's hard to support an administration when the reasons for the involvement are coming into question," said Crystal Broadnax, a recently retired reservist whose husband served in Iraq.
Ms. Broadnax said she would not vote for President Bush a second time, though among Democrats she is favoring John Edwards because she is more familiar with the senator from North Carolina.
Veterans have various reasons for supporting Mr. Kerry, including his support for military health and retirement benefits as well as his evolving opposition to the war in Iraq over the past year, which many said mirrored their own ambivalence. 
"I'm leaning towards John Kerry since he's been there and knows what people like me have been through," said Dwight Drakeford, 54. 
For many the bond is deeply emotional. Michael Steven Myers, a decorated Vietnam veteran from Virginia Beach, called Mr. Kerry's office two weeks ago to volunteer. "In the start I backed the president on Iraq because that is what a soldier does," Mr. Myers said. "But after awhile the reasons they were giving fell away, and now it started to bring back my feelings about Vietnam. Again, a lot of us are ending up asking where is the endpoint and why U.S. soldiers are dying there."
Mr. Myers, a writer who said he did not vote in the last election, said: "He's a proven leader and a brother and I would follow him anywhere."
It is still unclear, of course, if the Kerry drive here among veterans will yield votes. Senator John McCain tried, and failed, to mobilize enough veterans in the 2000 Republican primary. But local veterans leaders point out that his opponent, Mr. Bush, had a strong local following. He comfortably beat Al Gore here.
"I think John Kerry will do much better than John McCain did in 2000," said Augustus Singleton, commander of V.F.W. Post 4262 here. "The appeal is much bigger. The whole atmosphere is different. And I think the veterans vote is going to have a big impact in South Carolina this year."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about people who supported George Bush in the 2000 election and are considering a vote for the Democratic candidate this year referred incorrectly to George Meagher, who voiced dissatisfaction with the administration. As noted on Feb. 3 in an earlier account of his comments in the same interview, for an article about veterans leaning toward Senator John Kerry, Mr. Meagher is an independent, not a Republican.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OUTLAYS -- State Department; 
Fighting Terrorism And Global AIDS

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS, By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
 In international affairs, President Bush's $31.5 billion budget gives a strong push to counterterrorism spending, international AIDS programs, foreign military assistance and embassy staffing and construction. 
 It cuts aid in some traditional areas, especially bilateral or regional support administered by the Agency for International Development, by 13 percent. For example, child survival programs in Africa as well as development aid to Latin America and Eastern Europe would decline, though overall foreign assistance would rise by 9 percent. 
The budget gives a considerable increase to the Millennium Challenge Account, a new development program that offers financial incentives to countries that adopt political, economic and social policies considered to be sound. The program was devised to appeal to results-oriented critics of foreign aid.
The president asked for $2.5 billion for the millennium account, up from $1 billion in the current year. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was host of the board's first meeting yesterday. Among those nations mentioned as likely beneficiaries are Uganda, Mongolia and Bangladesh.
On Capitol Hill, some officials expressed concern that the administration was financing the millennium account faster than the money could be absorbed. 
"The organization is not going to be in a position to spend money for several months, and it's already got another billion in the bank," said Timothy S. Rieser, a top aide to Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who sits on the Appropriations Committee.
Mr. Rieser called the overall budget for foreign aid inadequate.
Christopher B. Burnham, the State Department's chief financial officer, said fighting terrorism topped the list of presidential priorities in the budget, with more than $5.7 billion in programs to nations aiding the United States in that fight. The budget seeks $1.2 billion for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan and foresees beginning construction on 13 diplomatic facilities next year.
In addition, Mr. Bush asked for $2.8 billion in global AIDS financing, which includes $1.45 billion for the office of the new AIDS coordinator, Randall L. Tobias. He sought $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, including $463 million for Colombia, and nearly $5 billion in military aid to foreign governments, both modest increases over last year.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OUTLAYS -- Health; 
Focusing on Insurance And Food Safety

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER, By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The budget submitted on Monday by President Bush was good news for some departments and agencies and not-so-good news for others.
 The Bush administration is again proposing new tax credits to help the uninsured buy health coverage, with a $70 billion plan over 10 years that would cover an estimated 4.5 million Americans. 
 The budget would also give a significant increase to the Food and Drug Administration to secure the safety of the food supply, part of what Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, described as an effort to strengthen the public health system. 
"These investments not only will better prepare our nation for and protect us from a bioterror attack, they will also better prepare us for any public health emergency," Mr. Thompson said.
He said the budget presented an "aggressive agenda" while "remaining fiscally responsible to the American taxpayer." 
Not counting the entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Thompson said, the spending authority for his department would rise by 1.2 percent. Budget analysts say that is not enough to take into account inflation and the increase in population.
In general, President Bush's budget underscored his administration's reliance on tax breaks to encourage the private sector to expand health insurance coverage to the 43 million uninsured Americans. Mr. Bush would also provide more incentives for people to use tax-free health savings accounts, in conjunction with high-deductible insurance plans, and make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy coverage.
The cost of health insurance is a hot issue in this election year, and Mr. Bush's plan was quickly denounced by Democrats and liberal advocates. 
At the budget briefing yesterday, Mr. Thompson also addressed the dispute over the cost of the new Medicare law: the Congressional Budget Office put it at $395 billion over 10 years, the administration at $534 billion.
"It's an impossibility to say at this point in time which one is correct," Mr. Thompson said.
Much of the discrepancy, he added, stemmed from different assumptions on how many of the elderly would sign up for the new voluntary prescription drug benefit. ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Japan said last week that it was reviewing how it wants to explore space and added, somewhat vaguely, that it might for the first time consider putting a man up there.
 No matter how vague, the mere mention of a manned flight touched upon something profound going on here: After a century and a half of singlemindedly catching up and competing with the West, Japan is asking itself what kind of country it wants to be. Does Japan, in short, want to compete with the world's great powers? 
 The review resulted from recent failures of Japan's space program, but perhaps Japan was also reacting viscerally to actions taken by the two nations that have most shaped its history. The United States has said it will send astronauts to the Moon and to Mars, reiterating its intention of staying No. 1. And China launched a man into space three months ago, becoming only the third nation to do so, after the former Soviet Union and the United States, and announcing its resolve to become a global power. 
How to deal with the rise -- or re-emergence -- of China as a great power will very likely be the biggest foreign policy issue facing Japan over the next generation. For East Asia, it is often pointed out, has never had both a strong China and a strong Japan at the same time.
China, long the center of Asia, fell under foreign domination in the last century and a half. Japan, long content in its relative isolation or as a tributary nation to China, went out into the world, competing against the West and dominating Asia.
But China never lost its sense of being a great power and appears comfortable now in reassuming its traditional role in Asia.
What of Japan then? Let Americans land on Mars or even Venus. Having lost militarily and economically to the Americans, the Japanese have no problem accepting that. But even as Japanese have become less focused on competition and more on their quality of life, there is deep fear and ambivalence about becoming second class to the rising power next door. It is, after all, a country that the Japanese had colonized a mere half a century ago.
Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, pointed out in an interview that Japan thought of itself as a great power only once in its history, in the decades leading up to World War II, when Japan ruled swaths of Asia and eventually attacked Pearl Harbor. "Japan wanted to compete, and did it fully," Mr. Miyazawa said. "Only we failed and gave up."
Not completely, of course, In the 1980's, during the height of the so-called bubble economy and talk of "Japan as No. 1," some businessmen and politicians spoke of teaching lessons to the world. But that talk died down long ago, as Japan's economy ground through a decade-long recession in the 90's.
Many Americans -- reared in a nation whose identity is inseparable from its No. 1 status -- find it hard to grasp why there is not greater unhappiness in Japan, which fell from such heights and has yet to pull itself decisively out of the slump. But Japan has now grown into a mature society that is trying to forge forward with its own standards.
Hidehiko Sekizawa, executive director of the Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living, conducts a comprehensive survey on attitudes toward life every two years. His findings show that people are focusing on enjoying life and are happy despite the long slump.
There is strong nostalgia nowadays for the Edo Period, the feudal era preceding the last century and a half of rapid change. While the Edo Period had many social problems, people are now remembering it as a time of stability and great cultural vitality.
"People want to return to an era where life was perceived to be more enjoyable," Mr. Sekizawa said.
The feeling is noticeably strong among the young. If the icon of the 1980's was the "salaryman" who sacrificed his private life for his company, today's icon is the "freeter" -- the young Japanese who take odd jobs to make just enough money to enjoy their personal interests or choose their way of life. The stress of competing inside Japan, let alone as part of a country competing against a visibly, and to some, frighteningly, hungry China, is furthest from their minds.
Indeed, "soothing" is a key word nowadays. This year's popular car color is a soothing beige. A popular boyfriend is the soothing type, one who will relieve a woman's anxieties. Even Japan's decision to send ground troops to Iraq seems rooted not in an aggressive foreign policy but in a move to dispel worries over a nuclear North Korea and a rising China by cementing ties with the United States.
"Japan has the economic and technological power to put a man into space if it tried, but it doesn't do so," said He Zhi, 26, a Chinese graduate student at Kyushu University in Japan. "Japan gives No. 1 priority to economic advancement, not political advancement."
Against this backdrop, the prestige game of manned space flights "is not worthwhile for Japan as a nation," Mr. Miyazawa said.
Putting a man into space would require a big increase in Japan's current $1.7 billion space program. But even engineers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are looking inward.
"I'd like an increase in our budget," said Hiroshi Sasaki, 40, an engineer. "But many companies have gone bankrupt around me. It would be difficult to request a doubling or tripling of our budget when there are people being laid off around us."
The council reviewing Japan's space program is expected to present a new plan this summer. The decision should yield a clear indication of what Japan wants to be -- and what Asia might become -- in the decades ahead.
The annual New Year's Eve "Red and White Song Contest" television show provided a clue, though. SMAP, perhaps Japan's most famous pop group, closed the show with last year's best-selling song, "Only One Flower in the World." The song was popular among antiwar demonstrators, but more than anything else it struck a chord here by asking, "Why do we want to be No. 1 when each of us is different?"
Small flowers, big flowers, none of them are alike
So it's O.K. not to be No. 1
Every one of them is the only one.

HEADLINE: The Debt No One Wants to Talk About 

BYLINE:  By David M. Walker; David M. Walker is comptroller general of the United States.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"We might hope to see the finances of the Union as clear and intelligible as a merchant's books," President Thomas Jefferson wrote to his secretary of the Treasury in 1802, "so that every member of Congress, and every man of any mind in the Union, should be able to comprehend them, to investigate abuses, and consequently to control them." Unfortunately, straightforward government financial information seems as elusive in 2004 as it did in Jefferson's day.
 The truth is that the United States faces a long-term deficit that will only increase as the baby boomers retire. The resulting fiscal imbalance will test the nation's spending and tax policies. Washington's recent difficulty in maintaining fiscal restraint has not helped matters. 
 The fiscal 2005 budget President Bush released on Monday includes a deficit of $364 billion. Although the administration and the Congressional Budget Office show declining deficits in the years ahead, and an improving economy will reduce deficits further, the long-term projected gap is now so large that we will not be able simply to grow our way out of the problem. Difficult choices are inevitable.
But the current system of federal financial reporting provides an unrealistic and even misleading picture of the government's overall performance and financial condition. Few agencies adequately show the results they are getting with the taxpayer dollars they spend, and too many significant government commitments and obligations are not fully disclosed.
Particularly troubling are the many big-ticket items that taxpayers will eventually have to reckon with, including Social Security, Medicare, civilian and military retirement and health care benefits, and veterans' medical care. Despite their serious implications for future budgets, tax burdens and spending flexibility, these future obligations get short shrift in the government's financial statements and in budgetary deliberations.
The federal government's gross debt -- the accumulation of its annual deficits -- was about $7 trillion last September, which works out to about $24,000 for every man, woman and child in this country. But that number excludes items like the gap between the government's Social Security and Medicare commitments and the money put aside to pay for them. If these items are factored in, the burden for every American rises to well over $100,000.
The new Medicare prescription drug benefit will add thousands more to that tab. This benefit is unquestionably popular and will make it easier for some older Americans to afford expensive prescription drugs. But it also comes with a steep price tag that few want to talk about. The truth is that the drug benefit as signed into law is one of the largest commitments ever undertaken by the federal government. Preliminary estimates of its long-term cost in current dollars range up to $8 trillion.
To put that number into perspective: it is about four times the entire federal budget. Long-term simulations from the legislative agency I head, the General Accounting Office, paint a chilling picture. Even before the new drug benefit was enacted, these simulations showed that by 2040 current policy could require a 50 percent reduction in federal spending or a doubling of taxes to balance the budget.
Either would be devastating. And keep in mind, it is likely that efforts will be made to expand the drug benefit in the future.
A key lesson from Enron, Worldcom and other business failures is that our free-market system depends on public confidence in the accuracy of corporate financial information. Recent G.A.O. reports have highlighted the increasing frequency of corporate earnings restatements. Who would knowingly buy stock in, lend to, or do business with a company that conceals its true financial condition?
As Jefferson pointed out, truth and transparency are even more essential in the public sector. Government services -- mail delivery, food inspection, Social Security and defense, to name a few -- directly affect the well-being of every American. But sound decisions on federal programs and policies are nearly impossible without timely, accurate and useful information.
Fortunately, we are starting to see efforts to address the shortcomings in federal financial reporting. The latest annual report of the federal government focuses more on the nation's long-range fiscal imbalance. The president's Management Agenda, which closely reflects G.A.O.'s list of high-risk government programs, is bringing additional attention to troubled areas and is trying to better assess the results that programs are getting with the resources they are given. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board is also making progress.
The General Accounting Office and other budget experts continue to encourage reforms in the federal budget process to better reflect the government's commitments and to signal emerging problems. Among other things, the G.A.O. has recommended the government issue an annual report on major fiscal exposures -- explicit and implicit promises for future government spending.
Much more must be done, however. A top-to-bottom review of government activities to ensure their relevance for the 21st century is long overdue.
From a practical standpoint, our elected representatives are not likely to get too far out in front of the American people when addressing complex and controversial issues. These fiscal risks, however, are a long-term problem whose impact will not be felt for some time. The understanding and support of the American people will be critical in providing a foundation for action.
A national education campaign to help the public understand the nature and magnitude of the long-term financial challenge facing this nation is essential. After all, an informed electorate is indispensable for a sound democracy. Young Americans especially need to become active in this discussion -- because they and their children will bear the heaviest burden if today's leaders fail to act.
Public officials will have more incentive to make difficult but necessary choices if the public has the facts and comes to support serious and sustained action to address our fiscal challenges. Without meaningful public debate, however, real and lasting change is unlikely. The sooner we act, the easier it will be to turn things around.

HEADLINE: North Korea Agrees to Resume Talks With U.S. Over Arms 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS and NORIMITSU ONISHI; Christopher Marquis reported from Washington for this article and Norimitsu Onishi from Seoul.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea have agreed to resume six-party talks later this month over the North's nuclear weapons program, the State Department said Tuesday.
 The negotiations, scheduled to start in Beijing on Feb. 25, are likely to focus on North Korea's offer to suspend its nuclear programs in return for a security guarantee and other concessions. 
 A first round of talks in August ended without an agreement, and a follow-up session in December was postponed. Both the United States and North Korea have insisted that the other side must make the first concession before talks can resume. 
It was not clear whether any concessions had been granted to get the talks restarted. State Department officials said Chinese diplomats had worked exhaustively to help them narrow their differences with North Korea. China, South Korea, Japan and Russia were enlisted as parties in the talks, primarily at the insistence of the United States, which seeks regional guarantees for any deal that is reached.
Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, discussed North Korea in meetings in China and Japan this week, and James Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, met with his counterparts in South Korea and Japan as well. Mr. Kelly is expected to lead the American delegation later this month.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the United States had not backed off its central demand, the elimination of North Korea's weapons program and safeguards to ensure that the program is never reconstituted. North Korea moved slightly closer to the American demand last month when it offered to freeze its program as part of a deal.
"We're looking for a round that can move toward the goals of verifiable elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs and, in return, a provision of whatever security assurances might be helpful in helping North Korea go down that path," Mr. Boucher said.
He said the administration had not offered any financial compensation to lure the North back to the bargaining table and had not discussed having other parties provide such aid. "We're not talking with anybody about compensating the North Koreans," he said. He observed, however, that South Korea was exploring new investment opportunities in North Korea, anticipating a day of normalized commerce.
Lee Soo Hyuck, South Korea's deputy foreign minister, tried to lower expectations for the meeting. "We cannot resolve the North Korean nuclear issue with one sweep through the next round of talks," Mr. Lee said. "But if we are able to launch working groups of experts, we will be able to have more substantive and specific talks and negotiations."
Kim Ryong Song, head of a North Korean delegation that arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday for bilateral talks, said the success of the negotiations would depend on the United States.
"Judging from the current situation, no matter how long the winter may be, spring will eventually arrive," Mr. Kim said. "It all depends on what attitude the U.S. brings to the talks. We have maintained our stance all along.
"The fact that the U.S. is coming to the talks at all seems to indicate that it has reached a certain understanding on our basic demands." 
The North has made conciliatory gestures toward Japan, whose financial contribution would be crucial to any eventual deal. North Korea said it was ready to release the children of five Japanese kidnapped years ago if the parents came to get them in North Korea.
The still unresolved cases of kidnapping of Japanese nationals have hardened sentiments in Japan and remain an obstacle to any agreement. Last week, Japan's lower house of Parliament passed legislation that would allow Tokyo to impose economic sanctions on North Korea by restricting the flow of money and goods that are vital to the North.

HEADLINE: Incentives and New S.U.V. Help Chrysler Bolster Sales 

BYLINE:  By FARA WARNER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
By offering incentives worth more than $1,000 and a range of new sport utility models, the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler and several Japanese automakers racked up sales gains in January even as General Motors and the Ford Motor Company posted declines.
 Chrysler said its sales increased 9 percent last month compared with the corresponding month in 2003 after adjusting for one extra selling day this January. Including Mercedes, sales for DaimlerChrysler over all rose 7.7 percent, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data tracking service in Southfield, Mich. 
 Chrysler's redesigned Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle led the surge. Sales of the new Durango rose 38 percent, with 50 percent of buyers paying more for the option of a V-8 Hemi engine, the company said. 
Nissan's sales rose 25 percent, while Toyota sold 143,729 vehicles, its best January ever, it said, and an increase of 15.8 percent over the comparable month a year ago.
By contrast, G.M.'s overall sales slipped 2 percent, as a 17 percent decline in car sales overshadowed a 13 percent increase in truck sales. G.M.'s market share slipped to 26 percent, well below the 28 percent it had for all of 2003.
"It was a disappointing month in terms of market share, and, yes, we will have to pick up the pace," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief sales analyst, adding repeatedly throughout the company's sales conference call that no one should overreact to one month's sales. Mr. Ballew did say that G.M. will have to make some adjustments to incentives, but declined to be more specific.
Ford's overall sales were also hurt by a sharp decline in car sales, slipping 9 percent, according to Ward's. Ford sold 14 percent fewer cars last month than in January 2003, including a 26 percent decline for the once best-selling Taurus as it continues to pull back on putting the family car into rental fleets. Ford's truck sales declined by 4.8 percent, Ward's said, despite a 10 percent increase for the redesigned F-150 truck.
Chrysler's sales surge was helped by an incentives program dubbed Zero Plus, which gave buyers interest-free financing and $2,000 cash back on almost all of Chrysler's products. The incentive helped drive double-digit sales increases for both the Jeep and the Chrysler brands.
"It worked, and we're going to promote it even louder this month," said Gary Dilts, Chrysler's vice president for sales. "We went out with a clear message and it created good showroom traffic." Chrysler plans to maintain the incentive through February.
Nissan's sales were helped by sizable incentives on two of its models. The 2003 Sentra compact came with a $2,500 cash rebate or low-interest financing in January, and its sales were up 17 percent. Buyers of the 2004 Altima midsize sedan received $1,500 cash back or a low interest rate, and its sales jumped 26 percent. Both of those incentives will remain through February, the company said. 
Nissan also benefited from brisk sales of two new models, neither of which came with incentives. It said it sold 2,330 Pathfinder Armada S.U.V.'s in January and 4,035 Titans, its first full-size pickup truck. Neither vehicle was on sale last January. 
At the end of last year, many auto executives said that their companies would reduce the size and availability of incentives on 2004 models, especially as the economy and consumer confidence improved. But as January's sales figures show, rebates, low-interest loans and other incentives remain a common tool to bolster sales with almost every major car company offering some kind of incentive on a variety of vehicles. 
"Some of the best New Year's resolutions don't last too long," said Bob Brisco, chief executive of CarsDirect.com, an online car-buying site that tracks incentives and pricing through the more than 3,000 dealers who take sales leads from the site. "A continual flow of large incentives over the past few years have trained consumers to always look for a deal."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Markets End Up a Bit but Are Jumpy Over Ricin Case

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly higher yesterday as more companies reported strong quarterly profits, but investors were unsettled by the discovery of the poison ricin in a Senate office late Monday evening.
 General Motors kept a lid on the Dow's gains. Shares of G.M. and Ford Motor both fell for a sixth consecutive trading session on weak January sales and concerns that higher interest rates would dampen sales by making financing deals less attractive. 
 "There's a little bit of nervousness over the ricin holding people back," said Frederic Dickson, market strategist at the fund firm D.A. Davidson & Company. 
 "The essentially good earnings news," Mr. Dickson said, "has been offset by a reminder that there's still a war on terrorism going on and that bad things can happen."
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 6 points, or 0.06 percent, at 10,505.18. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.77 of a point, or 0.07 percent, at 1,136.03. 
 The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index gained 3.06 points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 2,066.21.
 After the closing bell, Cisco Systems reported that its quarterly profit fell from a year ago because of an accounting change. But Cisco said sales rose as corporations spent more on technology.
 In after-hours trading, Cisco shares fell to $25.28 on the Instinet electronic brokerage system from their Nasdaq close at $26.41. In regular trading, Cisco gained 21 cents.
 Trading during the regular session was moderate, with 1.5 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, just above the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 1.8 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq, in line with the daily average last year.
 Advancers outnumbered decliners by about 17 to 16 on the Big Board, while decliners outpaced gainers by about 17 to 15 on the Nasdaq.
 Senate leaders confirmed that a powder found in the office mailroom of the Senate Republican leader, Bill Frist, was ricin. The powder, analyzed in a series of field and laboratory tests, was discovered on Monday. No one has been injured in the incident, Senator Frist told a news conference.
 G.M. weighed on the Dow, dropping 84 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $47.86 after it said its United States vehicle sales were unexpectedly weak in January. G.M.'s January sales fell 2 percent from a year ago. 
 Ford shares fell 23 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $13.72 after it also said sales fell.
 The latest batch of earnings from Tyco International and other companies was positive.
 Tyco said quarterly net income surged 23 percent, beating the company's own forecasts, on higher sales of pharmaceuticals, electronic connectors and cable gear.
 Tyco rose 70 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $27.80.
Colgate-Palmolive reported higher fourth-quarter profit as the weak dollar and a gain from the sale of European laundry detergent brands offset declines in the United States.
 Colgate rose $1.51, or 3 percent, to $51.85.
 The recreational vehicle maker Monaco Coach reported lower quarterly earnings that were better than analysts had expected and forecast stronger 2004 sales, saying it was stepping up production to meet demand. Shares of Monaco Coach climbed $2.96, or about 13.1 percent, to end at $25.60. 
 Treasury prices rose as the discovery of ricin in the Senate kick-started a bid for government debt. In addition, a pullback in United States car and truck sales in January suggested a primary source of economic growth might be petering out, lending further support to bonds. 
 Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, also helped the market along when he said that concern about rising inflation was premature and that disappointing job growth remained a critical area of weakness for the economy.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 101 7/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.10 percent from 4.15 percent on Monday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Price: 99.930
High Rate: 0.895
Coupon Yield: 0.916
Low Rate: 0.870

HEADLINE: US Airways Wins Appeal of Labor Ruling 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The US Airways Group won a federal appeals court ruling yesterday that lets it resume contracting out some maintenance work to a company that uses nonunion labor. 
 The 2-to-1 decision by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia overturned a judge's decision in October that blocked the work at the request of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
 The airline said that hiring other companies to do maintenance lets it lower costs and try to stem losses less than a year after emerging from bankruptcy protection. The airline also said it lacked the space and equipment needed to perform heavy maintenance on Airbus SAS planes. 
 The union argued that the work should be done by its members under terms of its contract. 
 On another issue, US Airways' pilots union agreed to negotiate contract changes that involve flying smaller jets to help cut costs. The leadership council of the union, the Air Line Pilots Association, agreed to open for talks only the parts of the contract dealing with the number of regional jets, where they are based, whether they would be flown by US Airways pilots, and pay and work rules for pilots.

BOEING ANNOUNCES 300 JOB CUTS IN SAN ANTONIO

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The Boeing Company said yesterday that it was cutting 300 jobs at an aircraft maintenance facility in San Antonio. Affected workers at the Boeing Aerospace Support Center received 60-day notices at a staff meeting at the sprawling plant on the former Kelly Air Force Base, now a city-run industrial park known as KellyUSA. 
Boeing executives said the layoffs were largely a result of cutbacks in the aircraft maintenance work it performed for the Air Force at KellyUSA. The cuts include managers, administrative workers, mechanics and shop laborers, Boeing said. The company does maintenance and systems-upgrade work in San Antonio on the Air Force's C-17 cargo transports and the KC-10 and KC-135 aerial-refueling planes. After the layoffs, the local work force will be 1,600 employees, Boeing said.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
The Supersizing of Warehouses

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: MESQUITE, Tex., Jan. 28 

 BODY:
When executives of Unilever's home and personal care products division of North America decided in 2000 to seek cost savings by streamlining the distribution system, the company had 15 warehouses across the country, the result of mergers since the late 1980's with two other manufacturers, Chesebrough-Ponds and Helene Curtis.
 Some warehouses stored cartons of soaps and detergents, fast-moving items that can be stacked on top of each other. Other warehouses contained hairsprays and other products that are ordered in smaller quantities and have to be handled more carefully because they come in aerosol containers. Truck drivers had to make multiple stops to fill their trailers, raising delivery costs. 
 To make its distribution system speedier and less costly, Unilever turned in 2001 to ProLogis, a real estate investment trust based in the Denver suburb of Aurora that helps companies solve their logistic problems -- not only by developing the warehouses but also by advising on new locations and local labor issues, overseeing negotiations for government incentives, securing financing and even contributing to the design of the racks inside the buildings. 
 Two and a half years later, Unilever had whittled its distribution network to five warehouses while losing only 500,000 square feet of office space. Each warehouse has 32-foot ceilings, occupies a million square feet and is one mile in circumference, except for the $15.5 million, 442,000-square-foot, cream-colored building in this Dallas suburb, which serves Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Each distribution center accommodates all the Unilever lines. The manufacturer says it has lowered its distribution costs by 7 percent.
 Unilever's consolidation reflected, in part, the urgency that manufacturers feel to reduce distribution costs in response to pressures from Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers. These pressures are having a "profound effect on the warehouse business," said James P. Sullivan, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, an independent company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in real estate investment trusts. 
"In an economy in which it's hard to raise prices," Mr. Sullivan said, "companies have increasingly looked at the cost side and tried to figure out how to improve the bottom line. More and more warehouse users are employing this strategy."
 Fred M. Berkheimer, vice president for logistics at the Unilever division, acknowledged that demands from larger retailers drove the company to rethink its warehouses. "You have to find ways to suck waste out of the system," he said. "Some of the larger retailers push pretty hard."
 As a result, the siting of a warehouse has become something of a science. Once Unilever decided that it wanted to be in the Dallas area, ProLogis identified possible locations and then narrowed the choices to two. The site on Samuell Boulevard that was ultimately selected is not only close to several Interstate highways but is also a mile from Union Pacific Railroad's intermodal center, which can handle 225,000 transfers a year between railcars and trailers or containers. The location also passed other tests. "If a truck has to make a left-hand turn with no light every time," said Rick Roth, a ProLogis first vice president, "that's something to consider."
 Working with one real estate company allowed Unilever to achieve many economies of scale, including a uniform design and a standard lease for all five warehouses. The four larger distribution centers are in Pontoon Beach, Ill., outside St. Louis; Carlisle, Pa., near Harrisburg; Rialto, Calif., in Southern California; and Palmetto, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. All are new, except the Palmetto warehouse, which was acquired by ProLogis in a 1999 merger with Meridian Industrial Trust and was expanded by 444,000 square feet.
 Cost (including land, but not equipment) of the distribution centers ranged from $40 a square foot in Rialto to the "high $20's" in Mesquite, said John W. Seiple Jr., the president and chief operating officer at ProLogis North America. Rents are generally from 9.5 percent to 10 percent of the building's cost, he said. With the exception of the Palmetto warehouse, all the buildings are owned by Macquarie ProLogis Trust, a company listed on the Australian stock exchange that is a joint venture of ProLogis and Macquarie Bank, the international investment bank based in Sydney. ProLogis has retained a 15 percent interest in the properties, Mr. Seiple said.
 Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said it made sense for manufacturers to deal with a single real estate company rather than a different one in each market. "There isn't a lot of uniqueness to the kinds of facilities they want," she said, "and it's far more consistent for them to deal with one developer who has expertise in a number of different markets."
 The new system has saved Unilever $20 million a year, Mr. Berkheimer said. The biggest savings have come in trucking and freight costs because each warehouse is equipped to handle all Unilever products, eliminating the extra stops. 
 In five years, he said, Unilever's product line has grown from about 1,200 items to about 2,000, reflecting the huge array of choices in household items. Just buying a bar of Dove soap today, for example, means deciding among "new gentle exfoliation," "all-day moisturizing," "sensitive skin," "nutrium nourishing" or "nutrium age-defying." And each version might be sold singly, in a double pack or in a shrink-wrapped package containing six or more bars.
 As new products are introduced, others are discontinued, but generally at a slower rate. Mr. Seiple said ProLogis's research showed that in manufacturing, "for every three products introduced, only one product gets taken away."
 Unilever is now able to make deliveries in one day to its customers at least 86 percent of the time, an improvement of about 14 percent, company executives said. 
 Michael W. Peters, a first vice president of ProLogis, said initially, many companies hope to do even better than that. "When you show them how much it's going to cost," he said, "they say, 'Well, maybe we can afford 85 percent."' In what Mr. Berkheimer described as one of the company's toughest decisions, Unilever refrained from building a distribution center in Northern California or the Pacific Northwest, leaving a large section of the country uncovered. "We'll wait and see if more people move up there," he said.
 Other developers are also building larger warehouses in response to the proliferation of product variations. Five years ago, said Ted Antenucci, the president of Catellus Commercial Group, a division of Catellus Development Corporation of San Francisco, warehouses were usually 350,000 to 500,000 square feet. "Now," he said, "there is a lot of demand for warehouses over 600,000 square feet." 
 Catellus has drawn repeat business from many clients, including Ford Motor, Gillette and Kellogg's, Mr. Antenucci said. But he said it was unusual for one developer to build an entire network of warehouses for one manufacturer, as ProLogis did.
 Mr. Sullivan of Green Street Advisors said the centralized approach worked well for warehouses but was not practical for the office market. A chief executive looking for office space is likely to choose a location based on more personal considerations, he said. "Office decisions tend to be made locally," Mr. Sullivan said. "In the end, the guy in the office market is going to say, 'I like this location because it's close to where I live,' or 'I like this location because it's across the street from my favorite restaurant."'

THE PRICE OF LOYALTY
George W. Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill
By Ron Suskind
348 pages. Simon & Schuster. $26.
 When President Bush first announced the choice of Paul O'Neill to be his secretary of the treasury, some veteran political observers thought they discerned in him a more liberal-minded worldview. Even so, they tempered their optimism, suggesting that he was more likely chosen because, as one pundit put it, the Bush-Cheney circle regarded him as "a familiar old friend to all of them, experienced and capable, above all loyal." 
 These observers may be forgiven for making the same error in judgment that Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney made. Mr. O'Neill's Boswell, the respected journalist Ron Suskind, drew on 19,000 documents -- almost everything that passed across the secretary's desk -- to write a disturbing book proving just how wrong they were.
 In "The Price of Loyalty" Mr. O'Neill demonstrates that while he believed in loyalty to his old friends, he was guided by two higher loyalties: first to the truth, as Mr. O'Neill understood it; second to himself.
Because of that first loyalty, Mr. Suskind's book, which Mr. O'Neill read and approved before publication, provides an invaluable contribution both to the historical record and to the fierce public debate over the nature of the Bush administration's true views and motivations on issues of war and peace.
But Mr. O'Neill's loyalty to himself can make the book a decidedly trying read. Rarely does our hero flinch from his brave calling. He is always demonstrating his "independence," his "maverick streak," his genius for "intellectual pragmatism." Mr. O'Neill, in the Suskind/O'Neill version, is portrayed as kind of C.E.O. version of Jimmy Stewart in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
"So while one marvels at the revelations in "The Price of Loyalty" -- and Mr. O'Neill is nothing if not credible, given both his access as well as his immunity to retaliation from those he calls nasty people who "have a very long memory" -- a few admitted flaws in our hero would have gone a long way.
Still it would be a mistake to allow the book's few shortcomings to diminish its historical and potential political significance. Mr. O'Neill is describing the takeover of the Republican Party -- and consequently of the executive branch -- by what is portrayed as a group of single-minded right-wing ideologues with loyalty only to their narrow and rapacious political self-interest.
Mr. O'Neill was one of the last of the Mohicans. An old-fashioned Establishment Republican and self-styled "small-c conservative," he saw himself as a sometime corporate executive and as a sometime public servant (he worked in the Nixon, Ford and Bush 41 administrations) who believed in making decisions on the basis of rational inquiry and long-term public interest. Boy, was he in the wrong White House.
Parts of the book have made headlines, most notably Mr. O'Neill's likening President Bush to a "a blind man in a roomful of deaf people" and the disclosure that planning for the invasion of Iraq began as early as January 2001. But what is most devastating is the textured insider portrait of the top Bush players bringing their ideological and partisan agenda to every issue of public policy.
Mr. Suskind himself gave us a hint of this kind of thinking, when, in a January 2003 Esquire article, he quoted the departing Bush adviser John DiIulio's marveling: "What you've got is everything -- and I mean everything -- being run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis."
But the O'Neill version picks up the same story, fleshes it out and documents it. The pressure to decide every issue on strictly ideological or political grounds is such that Mr. O'Neill -- a man referred to in a profile in The New York Times as a "prototypical Republican" -- is deemed an untrustworthy heretic.
Mr. O'Neill is appalled by what he sees as a betrayal of real conservatism; he even at one point draws a parallel between the absolutists fighting to take over Pakistan for Muslim fundamentalism and the absolutism at work in the Bush White House.
"The Price of Loyalty" is filled with convincingly demonstrative anecdotes, in which the outcome is ruthlessly predetermined and the facts, such as they are, are marshaled deductively. There is the time that President Bush used phony figuresto defend his tax cut in his first State of the Union address because the political team -- in particular Karl Rove -- had made an end run around Treasury economists, refusing to vet their calculations with experts.
Although Mr. O'Neill does not make the comparison, one is reminded of the same political mind-set that led to the famous "16 words" about an attempt by Iraq to buy yellow cake uranium in Africa that were included in the following year's State of Union, despite wide knowledge in both the C.I.A. and the State Department that the claim was based on false information.
In another meeting, this one on tax policy, Vice President Cheney -- depicted as the power behind the throne of a disengaged and clueless president -- proposed a 50 percent cut in the individual tax on dividends. Mr. O'Neill says he "jumped in, arguing sharply that the government 'is moving toward a fiscal crisis,' " pointing out "what rising deficits will mean to our economic and fiscal soundness."
But Mr. Cheney was uninterested in such goo-goo concerns, Mr. O'Neill recounts, quoting him: "Reagan proved deficits don't matter. We won the midterms. This is our due." Mr. O'Neill professes he left Mr. Cheney's office "in a state of mild shock." He knew Mr. Rove and others believed this ideology, but "to hear it from the vice president seemed to stop the world turning. The inscrutable Dick had finally shown himself." (It is Mr. Bush himself who points to the elephant in the room and asks, "Didn't we already give them a break at the top?")
His abrogated tenure in the Bush administration was clearly a disillusioning experience for Mr. O'Neill. He discovered that his friends were not the men (and women) he thought they were, and the Republican Party to which he had proudly belonged had been taken over by political extremists. There was no comfortable place anymore in George W. Bush's Washington for the old fashioned moderate Republican who sought to temper a love of capitalist competition with a dose of compassion for those it left behind.

HEADLINE: Sex, Lies and Bush Tapes 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Using this week's White House budget methodology, I can project that if you just keep reading this column, your assets will increase by $28,581 and you will lose 12.42 pounds. And this column is projected to end after just one paragraph.
 Well, so much for White House projections. 
 If we're serious about confronting threats to our way of life, we don't have to hunt them in the caves of eastern Afghanistan. We can find a serious threat in the West Wing of the White House as the Bush administration charts its fiscal policy. 
President Bush's budget policies have mortgaged America, yet instead of repairing the damage, he is intensifying the harm by trying to make his tax cuts permanent. And this week he presented a budget that is so dazzlingly deceitful it does not even attempt to include the bills for our presence in Iraq.
Conservatives have traditionally been the conscience of America's checkbook (and, to their credit, many now are screaming). If Mr. Bush were a genuine conservative, he might cut taxes, but he would cut spending to match. If he were an honest liberal, he might increase spending, and taxes as well. Instead, the president is inviting us out for a wild night on the town and leaving us -- and our children -- with the bill.
I'm sorry if I sound screechy. But my first beat at this newspaper, in 1984, was covering the Latin American debt crisis. Later I lived in Japan as its economy went from a global juggernaut to a global laughingstock. After you've seen how quickly national leaders can bungle national economies, and how difficult it is to put Humpty Dumpty together again, you have less patience for high-risk intellectual dishonesty like Mr. Bush's fiscal policy.
Dishonesty is a strong word. But the new book about former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill discloses that Mr. Bush's 2001 speech to a joint session of Congress about his budget contained a falsehood -- about paying off all possible American debt -- even after Mr. O'Neill pointed it out.
"That night, Bush stood before the nation . . .," recounts the book, "The Price of Loyalty," "and said something that knowledgeable people in the U.S. government knew to be false." I've excerpted that speech at www.nytimes.com/kristofresponds (look for Posting No. 266), and it makes painful reading.
In the 2000 campaign, I covered Mr. Bush a bit, so this week I dug out tapes of his speeches. On those tapes, he claims that he will leave the great bulk of the surplus intact: "My plan is to take a portion of the projected surplus, a little over $1 trillion of the $4 trillion surplus, and give it to the people who pay the bills."
The reality is that under Mr. Bush, surpluses have completely vanished. Granted, he had help from a bad economy. But spending has increased more rapidly than under any president since Lyndon Johnson, and Mr. Bush refuses to pay for it. I've seen that story before -- in Argentina.
Now the I.M.F. has warned that the U.S. budget and trade deficits are a threat to the global economy.
A new study from the Brookings Institution, "Restoring Fiscal Sanity," estimates that by 2014 the average family's income will be $1,800 lower because of slower economic growth caused by these budget deficits. A family with a 30-year $250,000 mortgage will be paying $2,000 more per year in interest costs alone. 
All in all, as I look at the economy, I miss President Bill Clinton. 
Mr. Clinton had egregious personal failings, and I deplored what I felt was his dishonesty. But as a steward of the economy, he combined fiscal conservatism with a willingness to stand against protectionism. No leader today, Democrat or Republican, is so forthright about the economy, and it's sad to see Democrats retreating from free trade.
Compared with Mr. Bush, John Kerry and most other Democratic presidential candidates are paragons of responsibility -- but only compared with Mr. Bush. The reality is that promises by Democrats like Mr. Kerry to start new health care programs, keep some of the tax cuts and restore black ink are nonsense. But it's less nonsense to say 2 + 2 = 5 (Mr. Kerry) than to say 2 + 2 = 22 (Mr. Bush).
Mr. Clinton lied about sex, and he was sleazy in other respects as well, but he was willing to tell America the unpleasant truth about trade and about budgets. I wish Mr. Bush and his Democratic challengers would be half as honest with the American public as Mr. Clinton was.

HEADLINE: Bush Presses U.N. to Mediate Iraqi Clash on Rule 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush pressed Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, on Tuesday to have his aides mediate among quarreling factions in Iraq and forge a consensus behind a plan that would allow the transfer of sovereignty to a government in Baghdad by June 30, administration officials said. 
 They said that without rapid progress on the political issues, the White House might agree to postpone Iraqi self-rule, but several officials said such a step would be a "last resort." 
 Mr. Annan has been given a dozen options for the transfer of sovereignty, the officials said, ranging from holding direct elections before June 30 to overhauling radically the unwieldy caucus system that is supposed to choose a new national assembly by that date. 
The Bush administration had previously frozen the United Nations out of the transition process in Iraq.
After the meeting, Mr. Annan said the United Nations team heading soon to Iraq to assess the possibility of direct elections would expand its agenda. 
"We are going to go there to help the Iraqis, to help them establish a government that is Iraqi, a government that will work with them to assure their future, in terms of political and economic destiny," he said. He said he thought that the United Nations had "a chance to help break the impasse which exists at the moment, and move forward."
The administration's plans for Iraq have been stymied by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's rejection of the proposed caucuses and by divisions within the Iraqi Governing Council. 
"We are trying to put this issue in Kofi Annan's lap and let him run with it," one official said. "There's still very much the intention to stick with the date of June 30. But there's a lot of pressure on Kofi Annan to come up with the right solution."
Mr. Annan, for his part, has not wanted to become involved without wielding substantial authority. 
The administration seems willing to allow that. Officials said Mr. Annan would have wide latitude to present Washington with a plan for Iraq's future governance -- including a schedule for elections later this year -- and that if he can demonstrate that it has broad backing in Iraq, the administration would have little choice but to go along. Some administration officials are now even saying it is possible for the United Nations to take the lead role in guiding the Iraqi political process after the return of self-rule.
But other officials warned that Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld were still likely to oppose giving the United Nations virtual supervisory control over the political future of Iraq, out of fear that such a step might result in constraints on American forces.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Annan met with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other top officials to discuss a range of possibilities for the future of Iraq.
Aides to Mr. Annan and top American officials say the situation pulls the secretary general in several directions. Mr. Annan, they say, does not want to be seen as an American proxy, but he is determined to do what is necessary to help Iraq create a viable government. Still, they say, he is extremely reluctant to return the United Nations to a highly visible role in the country that could make it the target of attacks. A suicide bombing at the United Nations' Baghdad base in August killed the mission chief, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 other people.
"This is not an issue of anyone wanting the U.N. to take over Iraq," a United Nations official said. "But the secretary general is very keen on this whole process succeeding. They have to get the mechanics right, because if Iraqis can agree on the mechanics, there's a better chance of all Iraqis accepting the results."
Ayatollah Sistani has refused to meet with any American mediator, including L. Paul Bremer III, Iraq's civilian administrator. Some administration officials said Mr. Bremer was relieved at the prospect that the United Nations might be able to improve communications with the ayatollah and his fellow Shiites, who respect him above all other clerics.
"The American attitude is much more open to the United Nations than it used to be," said a European diplomat familiar with the negotiations over Iraq. "It's not just a 'vital' role any more."
But many experts on Iraq say Mr. Annan may have as much difficulty in forging consensus as Mr. Bremer has had.
The Iraqi Governing Council has had trouble reaching agreement within itself, and also in dealing with the ayatollah, who wants direct elections before June 30 to choose the transitional government that will write a permanent Iraqi constitution.
The Bush administration insists that elections on that time frame are impractical. But some officials say there is also fear at the Defense Department that a sweeping victory by Shiites will deepen the problems American forces have had in suppressing the insurgency in Sunni areas.
"There is a building inclination in the administration to give this problem to the United Nations, if the U.N. will take it," said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former C.I.A. specialist on the Middle East and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "But I don't think it's going to work. I don't think Sistani is going to play ball."
The administration official said the hope was for the United Nations to play a role that Lakhdar Brahimi, the special United Nations envoy for Afghanistan, played in that country with Zalmay Khalilzad, a former White House official who is now ambassador in Kabul. Together, they called for a grand council, or loya jirga, to choose an interim authority to preside over the writing of a constitution, which has been adopted, and also to plan for elections, which are due in June. 
Two United Nations specialists have already gone to Iraq to assess the security situation. The election advisers are to leave for Iraq this week and could report back in a week or two, officials said.
The current plan for choosing a government to take office after June 30 calls for a series of caucuses in Iraq's 18 provinces. The caucus participants are to be carefully chosen by provincial councils and other bodies supervised by the United States and its handpicked Iraqi leadership.
Because of the American control, the process is regarded by many Shiites as potentially limiting their ability to gain control of Iraq's government.
The alternatives discussed with Mr. Annan included simplifying the caucuses, opening them up to many more participants, and making participants cast ballots so the process looks more like direct elections.
"There are more than a dozen different possibilities that have been floated at one time or another," an administration official said. "The United Nations is as aware of them as we are. They have to go out to Iraq and say: What's going to work on the ground? What do they think can achieve the goal of an Iraqi government that is respected by the Iraqi people?"

HEADLINE: Chief of Macy's East Division, Part of Federated, Plans to Retire 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Hal Kahn, the chief executive of the biggest division of Federated Department Stores for the last decade, is retiring on Feb. 15, the company said yesterday. Mr. Kahn, 58, is being succeeded as the head of the Macy's East division by Ronald Klein, 55, who has been running a smaller division for nearly three years.
 Analysts said that the performance of the Macy's East division along with other units had been improving as the economy had recovered and that they regarded the change of leadership as routine. 
 "He's been chairman for 10 years of a $5-billion-a-year division and he's decided to do something else," a spokeswoman for Federated, Carol Sanger, said.
 Federated reported better-than-expected earnings yesterday for the last quarter of 2003. But the company said that its earnings for 2004 might not meet analysts' expectations and, as a result, its share price fell 4.4 percent in late trading, to $46.50, after rising to $48.66 earlier in the day.
 Federated reported net income of $2.47 a share, including 20 cents attributed to a tax benefit. Without the tax benefit, net income was $2.27 a share. Analysts had expected $2.19.
 Analysts said they expected 2004 earnings of $3.80, but Federated said earnings would probably be $3.70 to $3.80 a share.
 Mr. Kahn, who grew up in Brooklyn, began his career in retailing in 1970 at Abraham & Straus, a department store chain with headquarters in the same borough. It was owned by Federated. Mr. Kahn joined R.H. Macy & Company in 1975 and rose through the ranks there until 1992, when he moved to Montgomery Ward to become its president. After two years, he returned to Macy's in 1994 as chief executive of Macy's East, one of three divisions. 
 In late 1994, Federated bought Macy's and expanded the Macy's East division with the addition of the Abraham & Straus and Jordan Marsh stores. Eventually, the Abraham & Straus and Jordan Marsh brands were dropped. 
 Mr. Kahn graduated from City College in New York and received a master's in business administration from the University of Maryland.
 Mr. Klein began his career in 1974 as a buyer for Bloomingdale's, one of the Federated stores. Federated is now the largest department store group in the country with more than 450 stores in 34 states.

HEADLINE: Bush Budget Cuts or Cancels School Programs, Drug Centers and Air Traffic Changes 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The White House on Tuesday released a list of 128 government programs that it plans to cut back or eliminate, including money for drug treatment centers and secondary school counselors and modernization of the air traffic system.
 The list highlights the effect of President Bush's budget on a variety of popular programs in education, health, housing and even law enforcement. 
 But the list also demonstrated how even seemingly tough surgery on federal spending programs would produce only a tiny reduction in the budget deficit.
The Bush plan would eliminate 65 programs and cut back 63 others, but the total savings for next year would add up to only $4.9 billion. By comparison, the White House is predicting that the federal deficit will hit $521 billion this year and $364 billion in 2005. 
Administration officials defended the budget on Tuesday in hearings before the House Budget Committee and House Ways and Means Committee, arguing that the key to deficit reduction is faster economic growth and cuts in government spending.
Mr. Bush would increase military spending by 7 percent and domestic security by 10 percent but would limit growth in discretionary domestic programs to just one-half of 1 percent.
At the same time, he is pushing Congress to make permanent most of his tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, which with other proposed tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by an additional $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years.
"The president is committed to spending what is necessary to provide for our security and restraining spending elsewhere," Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, told the budget committee.
But Democrats accused the administration of condoning huge deficits and glossing over the cost of Mr. Bush's plan to make his tax cuts permanent and extend scores of other expiring tax breaks at the cost of an additional $50 billion over the next 10 years.
"Every year of this administration, the bottom line of the budget has gotten worse and worse and worse," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Spratt attacked the administration as once again refusing to include in its initial budget plan the potential costs of keeping American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as counting on revenues from proposals that have been repeatedly defeated in Congress, like oil leasing fees from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
In addition, Mr. Bush faces opposition to the spending restraints from lawmakers in his own party. On Tuesday, barely 24 hours after Mr. Bush unveiled his $2.4 trillion budget for next year, the administration threatened to veto a $311 billion transportation bill that the Republican-controlled Senate passed on Monday. The Senate bill would authorize $55 billion more for highways and mass transit over the next six years than Mr. Bush has proposed, and a bill in the Republican-controlled House would authorize nearly $100 billion more.
"There is one thing we can control, if we want to control it, and that is spending," said the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, who has criticized the huge transportation bill.
Though Mr. Bush has proposed big increases in spending on education for the No Child Left Behind initiative, the administration's list calls for eliminating or cutting back more than a dozen other education programs. Among other actions, it would eliminate $34 million spent to help pay for secondary school counselors; $30 million for a program in schools to combat alcohol abuse; $38 million for projects to provide employment services to people with disabilities; and $18 million for a national writing project.
The administration also called for reducing the Federal Aviation Administration's budget for modernization of the air traffic system by $393 million. The Internal Revenue Service, which is struggling to crack down on abusive tax shelters and outright cheating, would see its budget for modernization reduced from $388 million to $285 million. 
Despite proposing a big increase in spending on domestic security, the administration is also proposing cuts in federal grants to local police, fire and emergency rescue departments. Money for so-called first responders would be cut from $4.4 billion this year to $3.5 billion next year.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MINISTER; 
Sharpton Fails to Achieve 2 Chief Goals in South Carolina

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Rev. Al Sharpton failed to achieve the two main goals he had set for himself in this state's primary. He did not win a single delegate and, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls, he did not garner strong support among black voters. 
 With nearly 85 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Sharpton placed a distant third, with just under 10 percent of the vote, compared with about 45 percent for Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and 30 percent for Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. 
 Though Mr. Sharpton was quick to boast that he had bested Howard Dean, Gen. Wesley K. Clark and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his anemic showing leaves him hard pressed to present himself as the candidate best able to speak for minority voters within the Democratic Party. It also undermines his strategy of using delegates to leverage influence at the Democratic National Convention this summer.
"He is not catching fire with the black vote," said David Bositis, an analyst with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington. "The black vote is looking for a winner and they are not looking to make a statement about race. John Kerry is one of the whitest guys, you know what I mean. The fact that he is getting almost twice as much as Sharpton is getting, that sends a message."
Mr. Sharpton's showing in the other state primaries was even worse, but he had staked his credibility on South Carolina, spending more time here than in any other state, hoping the large number of black voters would accept him as the defender of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy.
Yet polls of voters who had cast ballots showed that he had received 19 percent of the black vote as against 32 percent for Mr. Kerry and 36 percent for Mr. Edwards.
Perhaps more telling of Mr. Sharpton's failure to sell his message was his inability to earn any delegates in the Sixth Congressional District, which has a higher concentration of black voters than any other district in the state. With nearly 70 percent of the precincts counted in that district, Mr. Sharpton had just 12.5 percent of the vote.
Mr. Sharpton insisted that he was satisfied with his showing, though he had been saying for months that his strategy was to win delegates.
"I think that this is a tremendous boost to our campaign," he said, "because for me to be able to come to South Carolina with no money, no TV ads and do double digits, come in third, ahead of Wesley Clark, double Howard Dean and triple Joe Lieberman, no one would have ever believed that would happen."
He said he was heading next to Michigan, which will hold its caucuses on Saturday, and believed he could do better in Northern states when it was just a three-way race between himself, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards. But as Mr. Sharpton tries to press on, his campaign is nearly half a million dollars in debt. 
Yet, many people say that Mr. Sharpton has benefited from his primary run, even though he may not have achieved the level of success he had hoped for. But Mr. Bositis said it was a fragile victory, one he could lose if he was not careful.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR; 
Buoyed by Triumphs, Kerry Looks Past Rivals to Bush

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
As he notched a string of victories across the country, Senator John Kerry looked past Senator John Edwards and the other Democrats still in his path and trained his sights on the president.
 "George Bush, who speaks of strength, has made America weaker," Mr. Kerry said here Tuesday night. "Weaker economically, weaker in education, weaker in health care. And the truth is that George Bush has made America weaker by overextending the armed forces of the United States, overstraining our reserves, driving away our allies, and running the most arrogant, reckless, inept and ideological foreign policy in the modern history of our country." 
 Brandishing victories in Arizona, Delaware, Missouri, New Mexico and North Dakota, Mr. Kerry went on the attack as if the fall campaign were just around the corner.
 "We will take nothing for granted," he said. "We will compete everywhere. And in November, with your help, we will beat George W. Bush."
Mr. Edwards's victory in South Carolina, of course, and Gen. Wesley K. Clark's in Oklahoma, made clear that the Democratic nomination remained very much in contention. And Mr. Kerry showed no sign of being distracted from the job at hand: he chose to celebrate his victories in Seattle with an eye to Saturday's Washington state caucuses, while minimizing the gains of those who dug in and poured money into just one or two states.
"I think coming in second, given where I've been, is enormous," Mr. Kerry said after learning of Mr. Edwards's victory in South Carolina.
 But as Mr. Kerry's momentum picked up after his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire and as his standing in some national polls has risen above the president's, the outlines of a general-election have come into view.
 Gone is Mr. Kerry's call for "answers, not anger" and "solutions, not slogans" -- his implicit rebuke to Howard Dean. Seldom does Mr. Kerry remind audiences he has been "a Democrat my whole life," his thinly veiled smack at General Clark.
 Instead, Mr. Kerry promises to don political armor and take on the "powerful special interests" that he says dominate Washington. "I know there are powerful interests arrayed on the other side of this struggle, and the obstacles sometimes seem overwhelming to Americans," he said. "But I am ready for this mission."
 Mr. Kerry's martial rhetoric has a clear purpose.
Already, Republicans have tried to depict Mr. Kerry as a kind of Dukakis redux, a weak-on-defense Massachusetts liberal, and the senator's Democratic allies have painted President Bush, whose handling of the war on terrorism may be his greatest electoral asset, as a chicken hawk who ducked out on his National Guard service while Mr. Kerry was braving enemy fire in Vietnam.
 While the volleys and countervolleys give a taste of just how bitter and personal a campaign could be in store this fall, the exchanges also are a reminder that, in the post-Sept. 11 age, national security has become a paramount issue in the eyes of Republicans and Democrats alike.
 Yet other kinds of security are important to Americans as well, Mr. Kerry's advisers say -- job security, retirement security, the security of having health insurance, to name a few -- and he has long believed that these, too, will play an enormous role in the 2004 election.
"The undergirding theme is the enormous anxiety out there," an aide said. "If you haven't lost your job you know someone who has, or your 401(k) is down, or you've got aging parents, or you're worried about how to stay in your home, or you know someone in the National Guard whose service is becoming deployment after deployment."
 In his speech, Mr. Kerry touched lightly on that theme. "At the heart of this campaign is a commitment to an America where the future is built on fairness for all, not on a privilege for few," he said. "So we will repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and invest in health care and the education of our children."
 As much as Mr. Kerry has adapted to his front-runner's role by refraining from engaging his rivals, what is striking about his emerging strategy against Mr. Bush is how little it will have to change, Kerry aides and Democratic strategists say.
 "The candidates that have had a pretty good general-election message -- Kerry and Edwards -- have actually emerged as the ones that at this point are doing best," said Gene Sperling, who was President Clinton's economic adviser.
 The classic Democratic path -- running to the left in a primary and tacking back to the center in a general election -- appears not to apply much in Mr. Kerry's case, his aides say: after all, he ran well to the right of Howard Dean tax cuts for the middle class, trade, the war in Iraq and gay marriage.
 "You could argue that the best thing that ever happened to John Kerry was Howard Dean," said an aide, who also acknowledged that such words would have been unthinkable just a month ago.
 What has received precious little attention as the primary calendar intensified is Mr. Kerry's platform. 
 "Showing you're in touch and you have a powerful critique opens the door to people listening to you," Mr. Sperling said. "Then, when they're listening, you have to show them that you have your own action plan as well. He's got a good manufacturing jobs tax credit, a good tax credit for college education."
 Mr. Kerry gave only a hint of those ideas in his speech Tuesday night. But in lofty terms, he was clearly seeking to reach a wider audience than just primary voters.
 "Now I ask all Democrats all Americans to join now in the journey of our time," Mr. Kerry said, "to define our character and recapture our own spirit. With faith in our ideals and in each other, we can return America to a road of greatness and justice."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; 
KERRY ROLLING ON; EDWARDS A WINNER IN SOUTH CAROLINA

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry rolled to substantial victories in the Democratic presidential contests in Missouri, Delaware, Arizona, New Mexico and North Dakota last night, but Senator John Edwards won handily in South Carolina, allowing him to portray the contest as a battle with Mr. Kerry and keep the race alive at least through February.
 Gen. Wesley K. Clark declared himself the winner late last night in Oklahoma, after unofficial returns showed him with nearly a 1,300-vote edge over Mr. Edwards in a state where General Clark had been looking for a victory to keep his candidacy afloat. 
 But General Clark, an Arkansas native, came in fourth in South Carolina, a state where he had once been confident of victory, behind Mr. Kerry and the Rev. Al Sharpton. 
Mr. Kerry, a senator from Masschusetts, said his victory in five of the seven states where there were votes last night demonstrated his national appeal, as he sought to rally the party around his candidacy.
"I am ready for this mission," Mr. Kerry said at a victory rally in Seattle. "From standing up to Richard M. Nixon to stopping George Bush and the big oil companies from drilling in the Alaska wildlife refuge, I know how to take on those powerful interests. I've done it all my life." 
"I pledge to you tonight," he added. "I have just begun to fight."
Looking exuberant if a bit weary, Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, celebrated his victory in South Carolina at 8 p.m. sharp, at a rally in Columbia, in the heart of the state where he was born and where he had said he must win to proceed with his first bid for the White House. Mr. Edwards, who spent six of the past seven days campaigning in the state, won about 45 percent of the vote, defeating Mr. Kerry by about 15 percent.
"Tonight you said that the politics of lifting people up beats the politics of tearing people down," he said.
General Clark said, "As an old soldier from Arkansas, I could not be any prouder of your support in this first election that I have ever won." 
The results prompted Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 2000, to abandon his bid for the presidency. Mr. Lieberman rode into this campaign last year as the best-known candidate in the field, placed fifth in New Hampshire last week and last night won just 11 percent of the vote in Delaware, a state where he had focused much of his time and resources.
"It is now time to make a difficult but realistic decision," Mr. Lieberman said.
The voting on the busiest night thus far in the Democratic battle is recasting the race as the candidates churn ahead through a difficult month of contests, starting this weekend with Washington and Michigan, two states where Mr. Kerry is in strong shape, and continuing to Virginia and Tennessee next Tuesday, providing Mr. Edwards another opportunity to display his Southern strength.
For now, at least, Mr. Kerry faces an energetic challenge from Mr. Edwards. And aides to General Clark were looking to a victory in Oklahoma to establish him as a player in a race where he has often seemed to be standing at the sidelines.
Mr. Edwards posted his victory in the state where he was born, and some Democrats said the first-term senator would be under pressure to prove that his appeal went beyond the South. But Mr. Edwards came in second in the Iowa caucuses, and Mr. Kerry's advisers have increasingly viewed him as their biggest obstacle to the nomination. And his strong showing in Oklahoma startled some of Mr. Kerry's supporters, and put him in a position where he could least keep a foot in the door, providing an alternative for Democrats who are uncomfortable with Mr. Kerry.
Aides to Mr. Edwards announced that he would take a bus trip on Friday through Virginia, which has a primary on Feb. 10, and that he would compete in the Michigan caucuses this Saturday, in an effort to erase a perception, being pressed by the Kerry campaign, that his was merely a regional candidacy.
Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, who had once looked to clinch the nomination with the round of contests yesterday, suffered another disappointing night. Dr. Dean spent no money on advertising in those states where there were contests yesterday but had campaigned in South Carolina, Arizona, New Mexico and Missouri.
Dr. Dean was trailing the pack in Arizona, Missouri and South Carolina, and he moved early in the night to try to blunt the damage of the showing, with an appearance before supporters in Washington State, which will hold a caucus this weekend, where Dr. Dean had turned his attention.
"Well, the votes are starting to come in and we're going to have a tough night tonight," Dr. Dean said. "But you know what? Here's why we're going to keep going and going and going and going and going, just like the Energizer bunny. We're going to pick up some delegates tonight, and this is all about who gets the most delegates in Boston in July, and it's going to be us."
Mr. Edwards's aides said he had about $1 million on hand, though he will now be under intense pressure to raise far more money quickly.
Mr. Kerry won states far outside his home region, including in the Midwest and the Great Plains. In South Carolina, he came in second, ahead of General Clark, who is also a Southerner and who had once looked to win in the state, and Mr. Sharpton, the only black candidate in the race, who had at one point predicted he could win a state where about half the Democratic electorate was African-American.
The contests yesterday marked the first time the candidates faced competitive races in states with sizable groups of minority voters.
In South Carolina, surveys of voters leaving the polls found that Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards each drew about one-third of the black vote. Mr. Sharpton drew just one-fifth.
Mr. Kerry did well among Hispanic voters in Arizona. Nearly 2 in 10 voters in Arizona said they were Hispanic, and half of them voted for Mr. Kerry.
The poll in South Carolina also found that voters looking for a candidate who stands up for what he believes were much more likely to vote for Mr. Edwards than for Mr. Kerry. But voters looking for someone who could defeat President Bush were more apt to back Mr. Kerry.
Nearly half the voters in South Carolina said the economy and jobs were the most critical issues in casting their vote; nearly half of them voted for Mr. Edwards, twice as many as voted for Mr. Kerry.
The polls were taken in Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina, and were conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International for a pool of the five television networks and The Associated Press.
Democrats interviewed as they cast their votes around the nation yesterday echoed the same themes that were heard among party members in New Hampshire and Iowa: that they were looking first and foremost at who could defeat Mr. Bush.
But in St. Louis, Mike Showers, 54, who said he had been unemployed since a Norwegian company bought the food processing plant where he worked and shut it down, said he was worried about Mr. Kerry.
"I don't believe that Kerry is the strongest candidate," Mr. Showers said. "To me, he reminds me of Al Gore, who they all said could beat George Bush easily."
He said Mr. Edwards "doesn't have alot of political experience, but he's from a middle-class family and he has middle-class values, and that's the most important thing to me."
Mr. Edwards, looking fatigued, said in a television interview last night that he would seek in the days ahead to draw contrasts with Mr. Kerry, based on differences in the two men's upbringings and some of their positions.
But pressed in an interview on CNN by Bob Dole, who was the Republican candidate for president in 1996, about how he would do it, Mr. Edwards acknowledged that he might be constrained by the way he had presented his candidacy as avoiding the kind of attacks that are part of politics now.
Mr. Dole, who said he was speaking from experience, suggested that it would not be enough for Mr. Edwards to try to distinguish himself from Mr. Kerry by pointing only to their differences on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Kerry voted for in the Senate.
"The key for me, Bob, is I got to this place by running a very positive, uplifting campaign, which is something that you and your spouse know a lot about," Mr. Edwards said. "I have to be very careful not to lose that."
"That doesn't mean that I don't have to point out clear differences between myself and other candidates, between myself and Senator Kerry, that go beyond trade and background," he said. "There are significant issue differences between us, and those will become clear as we go forward."

How the Voter Polls Were Conducted
The primary day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting stations yesterday throughout Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina.
The polls were conducted by Edison Media Research of Somerville, N.J., and Mitofsky International of New York City for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News.
The results are based on voters in 30 to 40 randomly selected precincts across each of the four states: 2,093 voters in Arizona, 1,378 in Missouri, 1,501 in Oklahoma and 1,982 in South Carolina. The Arizona results include 401 self-described absentee voters interviewed by telephone.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus three or four percentage points from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these four Democratic primaries.
Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about voting in the Democratic primaries on Tuesday misstated the size of John Edwards's South Carolina victory over John Kerry in some copies. It was about 45 percent to 30 percent -- a difference of 15 percentage points, not 15 percent.

Old-Style Dominican Food Gets the Nuevo Treatment

BYLINE:  By Eric Asimov

 BODY:
IT didn't take long to realize that something was unusual about Bohio, a friendly new Dominican restaurant in Washington Heights that promises "Viejo Latino" cuisine with a stylish twist. 
 On my first visit, I asked for a cafe con leche, a drink that is about as viejo as you can get. "No cafe con leche," the waiter said. "We only have espresso." 
 "All right," I said. "But make it a double espresso." He looked at me dubiously, and nodded. Soon he reappeared, with two little cups, each filled to the brim with espresso.
Bohio's reach may sometimes exceed its grasp, but its ambition offers a welcome alternative to the steam-table Latino restaurants that dominate the neighborhood. These places, which can all make cafe con leche blindfolded with their hands tied, typically offer flavorful, if warmed-over, dishes at extremely low prices. If I wanted a great skirt steak or roasted pork in Washington Heights at 2 a.m. after a night of dancing, there would be no better place than El Presidente, on Broadway near 165th Street. But if I wanted a meal before the party in a place with low lights and a warm atmosphere, I wouldn't hesitate to pick Bohio.
Bohio, a Taino Indian word for the wooden huts that serve as rural gathering spots in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, has long been a dream of its owner and chef, Jose Reyes. Mr. Reyes, who grew up in Washington Heights, learned his way around the kitchen from his mother, Esperanza, a cook for many years at Bergdorf Goodman.
After refining his techniques at the New York Restaurant School and restaurant jobs at Erizo Latino and Bistro Latino, Mr. Reyes turned his attention to his old neighborhood, fantasizing about a place that served the Dominican food of Washington Heights but would also appeal to those who wanted a more refined atmosphere and presentation. With a loan from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development agency, and considerable recipe assistance from his now-retired mother, Mr. Reyes opened Bohio in December, about a year behind his personal schedule.
Bohio has the glossy, polyurethaned look of new construction, and while the food is indeed viejo Latino, or traditional, it has some inevitable culinary-school touches. Chunks of pernil ($13), or roasted pork shoulder, are arrayed neatly around a carefully molded portion of moro rice. Chopped herbs are sprayed across the plate. But I eat every bite. The pork is full of garlic and citrus flavors, with crisp exterior pieces, and the rice, made with gandules, or pigeon peas, has a wonderful nutlike flavor. Pork chops ($15), too, are edged with garlic and citrus. Though they're a trifle dry, I like them. 
In fact, many dishes are cooked a little bit more than I would choose, not surprisingly. One night I took my friend Raphael, who is part Dominican and has made a close personal study of Dominican cuisine. "Dominicans like everything well done," he said, as we cut into a piece of flank steak ($16) that had been ordered medium rare but was just a bit pink. Nonetheless, the chewy beef had plenty of flavor.
If you like meat fried until it can be fried no more, the parrillada for two ($25), is perfect. It includes carne fritta, or long twists of beef fried to the consistency of jerky, chunks of pork fried until crisp, mild yet irresistible longaniza sausage, savory fried yuca, and, best of all, pica pollo, pieces of chicken fried until the crust is crisp and crackling, yet full of flavor. At lunch, you can order the pica pollo ($7) separately, with rice and soupy, fragrant red beans. 
There's not much of an appetizer selection, but I'd be very happy with bollitos ($6.50), spheres of sweet plantains stuffed with codfish and cheese. They resemble Spanish croquettes, but are purely Caribbean. 
Desserts include a dense, intensely caramel-flavored flan, sitting on a pool of syrup with two crisp wafers rising like antennae, and pumpkin fritters ($6.50), like golf ball-size spheres of rich pumpkin pie, coated with cinnamon and allspice. 
Bohio has not yet received its liquor license, but expects to soon. No word on when the cafe con leche license will arrive.

HEADLINE: Sichuan's Signature Fire Is Going Out. Or Is It? 

BYLINE:  By DENISE LANDIS; Brian Palmer, in New York, and Violet Feng, in San Francisco, contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
FIRE is a not unfamiliar sensation in food. Cuisines all over the world get a zap from chili peppers in dozens of guises. But there's nothing like the numbing sparkle that the food of Sichuan gets from the Sichuan peppercorn -- huajiao, as it is called there.
 "You can't cook Sichuan food without huajiao," said Wang Dinggeng, the chef at Grand Sichuan International on Second Avenue. "You can't get that special ma la flavor," he said of the peppercorns' numbing (ma) and burning (la) effects. 
 But will the tingle be around for much longer? 
Since 1968, the federal government has banned the import of Sichuan peppercorns, which are the dried berries of the prickly ash shrub. The Agriculture Department did not really enforce the ban until two years ago, and its effort is expected to dry up supplies soon. Or maybe not.
Some chefs and retailers say that they are unable to find the peppercorns, which are often an ingredient of five-spice powder, a common Chinese seasoning. Others say they are selling what was stockpiled before the enforcement effort began.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, some Chinese stores are selling them surreptitiously, and some Manhattan shops carry them in unlabeled bags.
In 1968, the Agriculture Department prohibited the import of all plants and products of the citrus family, of which the Sichuan peppercorn is a member, because they could carry a canker that destroys citrus trees. The ban was not strictly enforced before a revision of the department's manual for field inspectors, after the canker had begun to devastate citrus crops in Florida. The revision specified that the ban applied to Sichuan peppercorns (Zanthoxylum simulans) and the Sansho peppercorns (Zanthoxylum piperitum) used in Japanese cooking. 
The canker is caused by bacteria that are harmless to humans but highly contagious among members of the citrus family. It is spread by physical contact. There is no known chemical treatment for the disease, and both infected trees and those nearby must be destroyed.
But while it is known that the prickly ash shrub, which grows in China, Japan and North Korea, carries the canker, department officials could not point to any scientific study or research that showed that the dried peppercorns carried it.
"Unfortunately, the popular Sichuan peppercorn is banned from import into the United States due to its classification in the citrus family," Dore Mobley, a spokeswoman for the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said in a statement. When asked whether there had ever been a case of peppercorns contaminating citrus trees since the ban was imposed in 1968, Ms. Mobley did not point to any.
"Citrus canker poses a significant threat to not only citrus in Florida, but citrus in California, Texas and Arizona as well," she said in the statement. "Therefore an across-the-board ban on citrus from specific countries known to have the disease is the cornerstone of our efforts to protect U.S. agriculture."
Last month, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service approved a treatment to kill the canker by heating the peppercorns to 140 degrees. But that changes their quality and character. No other treatment, including irradiation, kills the canker.
The peppercorns seem more readily available in the East than in the rest of the country, but baffled customers everywhere are looking and not finding them. Because peppercorns have a shelf life of several years and the ban has been enforced for about two years, the shortage of peppercorns is only now being felt. While some prices have gone up as high as $25 a pound, the peppercorns were selling for $4 a pound in New Hampshire this week.
Bob Pizza, the assistant manager of the Spice House, a small family-run business in Milwaukee, Wis., said that in the fall of 2002, an Agriculture Department inspector confiscated the store's supply of the peppercorns, about four or five pounds.
But Ms. Mobley said the inspection service had only 130 inspectors dealing with smuggling and improper importation, so not all stocks could be confiscated. 
Finding the peppercorns can be challenging.
An owner of one of the largest Indian and Middle Eastern food stores in Manhattan, with an extensive array of spices, said in a telephone interview that he could not get the peppercorns anymore. But a visit to the store found them on the shelf. Clerks at one large grocery store in Chinatown said they had none, but they were on the shelf in unlabeled bags.
When a New Jersey distributor was asked over the phone whether he sold Sichuan peppercorns, he said he did. But when the reporter identified herself as a writer for The New York Times, he said he had not had nor sold Sichuan peppercorns for many months and did not believe he would have them again.
A New England food distributor who had a fresh stock of Sichuan peppercorns said she had just gotten it from an importer in New Jersey. But the importer said that couldn't be true because Agriculture Department inspectors had confiscated his stock of the spice about a year ago.
In markets in the Chinatowns of the San Francisco Bay Area the peppercorns were hard to find, but Sichuan peppercorn powder and oil were on the shelves.
When a Chinese-speaking reporter went to a large Chinese grocery in Oakland and asked for some, the clerk pulled a bag of them from under the counter, saying she would not have sold any to an English-speaking customer.
The peppercorns were on the shelves of a Chinese medicinal store in San Francisco.
"Well, if you want to buy from a wholesale market, they won't sell it to you because you are a stranger," a clerk at the store said. "Even here, I am not selling any to foreigners. I heard it took a lot of trouble getting those peppers here." After the crackdown, he said, "people basically took a lot of trouble transporting them to India and then Mexico and then into the U.S., but I won't tell you the name of the wholesale company."
One wholesale company in the Bay Area is apparently continuing to supply regular customers with the spice.
Eric Tucker, the chef at Millennium Restaurant in San Francisco, said he regularly uses Sichuan peppercorns and never had trouble finding them in Chinatown.
But John Zhang, the owner of Grand Sichuan International, said the problem is real. 
"We face the shortage of peppercorn and don't know what to do," Mr. Zhang said in an e-mail message from China, where he was traveling.
Martin Yan, the cookbook author and television personality, said it was unlikely that large Asian food distributors would import the peppercorns.
"The peppercorns are inexpensive, and there is little to be gained in taking such a risk," he said. "They are used in such small quantities that even a pound will last a long time."
He said that small quantities of the peppercorns might be sent into the United States by being hidden in personal mail.
Mr. Zhang said that some of the peppercorns now being sold are inferior varieties from southern China, not Sichuan Province. 
Sichuan peppercorns are reddish brown, have a rough texture and often have tiny stems mixed in among them. They are sold whole with bitter black seeds in the centers, or (as is generally preferred by chefs) cracked open and seeded. They can be found in food markets in Asian communities and where Chinese medicines are sold. They are sometimes incorrectly described as flower buds, probably because a common name for them is flower pepper. Other names that are often used in Asian markets are wild pepper and fagara.
They can be purchased overseas and in Canada, but anyone trying to bring them into the United States could be fined $1,000 for having a prohibited, undeclared, concealed agricultural product.
Eddie Schoenfeld, a consultant with decades of experience in Chinese restaurants, said that Chinese chefs would be unable to cook certain dishes without Sichuan peppercorns, but that they could still create many popular recipes in the Sichuan style. 
"It's as if tarragon became unavailable to the French," Mr. Schoenfeld said. "They would still be able to make bearnaise sauce. It wouldn't be the same, but it would still be good."
Mr. Zhang is not so sanguine.
"If there was not the Sichuan peppercorn any more," his e-mail message said, "the Sichuan cooking would be definitely hurt."

HEADLINE: So This Is a Cooking Class? 

BYLINE:  By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
EVERY January and September, the course catalogs arrive and the pressure mounts: Improve your Spanish! Your abs! Your relationships! Your knife skills! 
 New Yorkers of a culinary bent are easy marks -- there's always something to learn in the kitchen. What home cook doesn't itch to master roasted vegetables once and for all, to transform boneless chicken breasts into fascinating new permutations, to sail into the uncharted waters of Asian soups? 
 Eager home cooks can always find schools and chefs who promise to demystify the French bistro or the Japanese teahouse in one class. Schools like the Institute of Culinary Education offer a chef-for-a-day experience, with professional-grade equipment, teachers in chefs' whites and plenty of hands-on practice. Some programs offer demonstration classes, like those at DeGustibus at Macy's; there, a star chef performs onstage, for students who simply sit back, watch and eat. And some of New York's most popular cooking classes take place in the homes of chefs like Paul Vandewoude (formerly of Tartine and Titou), who have simply transported fans of their restaurants into their own home kitchens. 
But having taken five classes at five different schools last semester, I'm convinced that the freshest and most intensely instructive ones are found elsewhere. They are private classes offered by a cadre of young chefs who have opted out of the restaurant industry to teach in students' home kitchens, their business fueled by word of mouth and the Internet. As if planning a party with a caterer, the host gets to determine the menu, invite the guests, send someone out to do the shopping and flop on the sofa while someone else cleans up. 
To many home cooks, taking a private cooking class sounds impossibly grand, akin to hiring a personal chef. But it is surprisingly economical, especially if guests help foot the bill. In contrast to some top schools, like Cooking by the Book and the Institute of Culinary Education, where a class with as many as 20 students can cost as much as $130, the typical home class runs about $500 for six people, or $200 for two.
"It's like a dinner party," said Marc Horowitz, a commodities trader who was the host of a class in his SoHo loft. "But you can't help learning something." 
Mr. Horowitz's choice was a crash course in Southeast Asian cooking, taught by Jennifer Herman Clair, a graduate of the institute's professional culinary program. "I love Thai food," he said, "but didn't know how to start cooking it. And I would never have understood how the flavors are supposed to balance each other -- hot, sweet, sour, salty -- if I hadn't taken a class." 
Gina Lu, who designs jewelry under the name Jemma Lulu, played host to a cooking class in her downtown apartment last month. "I wanted to choose the menu; you can't do that in a cooking school class," Ms. Lu said. "And I liked the fact that my husband could chip in or just hang out on the couch. I think he may have taken a nap between the entree and the dessert." 
Ms. Lu's class was taught by Jamie Sydney, a New York native who graduated from the French Culinary Institute in 2001. Ms. Sydney soon focused on teaching in-home classes, she said, because she realized that the people who most need cooking lessons are the least likely to take a class. "When I was in cooking school, I'd go out to restaurants with my friends, and they seemed so intimidated by the most basic food," she said. "We'd be eating roast chicken and someone always said, 'I could never make this.' But of course they can. Anyone, and I mean anyone, can learn to roast a chicken." 
Ms. Lu planned her class by looking over the options on Ms. Sydney's Web site; together they tailored the menu to a six-person dinner, accounting for the guests' dietary prohibitions and preferences. "I had never cooked with porcini mushrooms," Ms. Lu said, "so we decided to include them in a squash soup. Jamie convinced me to do a potato gratin; I had never made one because I thought it would be a pain to slice the potatoes thin enough. And I did want to make a really good roast chicken."
When Ms. Sydney arrived, she brought along several kinds of potatoes, plus a professional-size stainless steel mandoline and a handout about the differences among russet, Yukon Gold, purple and fingerling potatoes. In the course of the prep work for the roast chicken, Ms. Lu said, she also learned "more than I knew there was to know" about simple, crucial steps that are second nature to professionals -- like browning and salting the chicken before roasting it. 
Janice Stanton, a real-estate manager who has taken about 30 classes from Jennifer Herman Clair, started what she calls her remedial education with one-on-one classes, but soon invited friends to attend and now has a class on most Wednesday evenings. "People always end up clustering in the kitchen at dinner parties anyway," Ms. Stanton said, "so it feels very natural to have a class going on there." 
When I held a class in my apartment, I left the menu up to Ms. Sydney. I took advantage of another service she offers -- sending out invitation cards, something I would never have bothered with for a weeknight dinner party, but it sent a thrill of anticipation through those on my guest list (the menu is on the card). 
She built a menu of baby lettuce salad with walnut-crusted rounds of goat cheese and French breakfast radishes, snapper fillets steamed in parchment with shredded leeks, a saute of artichokes and chanterelles and tarte Tatin. Having arrived early, lugging four huge boxes of utensils and ingredients, she cleared the kitchen counter of its usual clutter of phone messages and mail, and nudged us out of the room while she set up a workstation for each recipe. Fueled by a martini each (not provided by Ms. Sydney; hosts are responsible for wine and other drinks), we began cooking at 6:15. 
Though one student's attention kept drifting to the N.F.L. playoffs, Ms. Sydney kept others focused on her hands, which never stopped moving as she talked us through every task. First, she sliced a log of goat cheese into rounds, explaining that the thickness of the rounds and a precise oven temperature would make it possible to heat the cheese without melting it. (Showing a cheflike attention to detail, she had brought an oven thermometer; most home ovens are off by at least 25 degrees.) 
As in all cooking classes, there was a fair amount of repetitive scut work ("Remind me never to make this dish," one of the artichoke-trimmers said). But the mood grew festive again as each of us folded a fish fillet in parchment paper with leeks, fresh thyme sprigs and golden olive oil, then marked the packet with our initials so that we could compare results later on. 
Although each dish was simple in itself, the class did take well over four hours; by 11 p.m., all of us felt overstuffed with food, drink and information. But the next morning, I was able to recall clearly just how Ms. Sydney had taught us to pleat the parchment paper around each fillet of snapper, how high the flames shot up when she sauteed the mushrooms (as she pointed out, "home cooks tend to be afraid to blast the heat -- but it's the only way to get food to brown the way it's supposed to"), and how surprisingly quick it was to julienne leeks once she sharpened my knives. 
SINCE private classes focus closely on a few dishes (the Institute of Culinary Education and New School classes often attempt as many as a dozen recipes), home students have more time to explore not only how, but why a restaurant-roasted chicken might taste different from a home-cooked one. Ms. Clair teaches in-home and school classes, and says she can impart a lot more information at home, simply because guests ask more questions. "In a school class, you can see that people are intimidated by cooking with strangers," she said. "No one wants to be the idiot who asks the question that everyone else knows the answer to." 
Mr. Horowitz said: "I can't overemphasize how much more comfortable it is to take a class at home, with just your friends around. Especially for guys." Mr. Horowitz added that he was lucky that his girlfriend was willing to clean up afterward: Ms. Clair, like some other teachers, does not include dishes as part of her services.
Another advantage of home classes is that you learn how to cook using your real kitchen, not a fantasy one. "There's not much point in learning to sear a steak on a professional stove if you live in a studio apartment with an electric stove, and use the pans your mom handed down when you got your first apartment," said Dina Cheney, a graduate of the Institute of Culinary Education.
Ms. Clair says that a cook can be taught in any kitchen. "All of my students tell me the same story beforehand -- that their kitchens are too small, their pots are too old, that they have never used their oven and aren't even sure that it works," she said. 
Alex Oefeli, a Swiss chef who teaches privately, says his students often cite the opposite problem: a deluxe kitchen that they don't know how to use and therefore avoid as much as possible. Mr. Oefeli, who cooked at Atlas until recently, stumbled upon teaching as an offshoot of his catering business; many chefs who do in-home catering may also consider teaching privately. And many cooking schools will happily arrange private classes by their instructors, in the school's own kitchens. (Expect to pay more than an in-home class would cost.) 
Ms. Cheney started teaching immediately after graduating in 1999; Ms. Clair also has little restaurant experience. A more typical cooking-school instructor would be a battle-scarred kitchen veteran, someone who has made thousands of entrees, knows all there is to know about cream sauces, and is ready to pass on his skills to a new generation of professionals. "I myself am more of a home cook," Ms. Clair said. "And I think that makes me a better teacher for a home cook. Teachers from a restaurant background don't think about how dirty the kitchen is getting, or whether cooking steak au poivre is going to fill your apartment with smoke." 
Ms. Sydney also says that she often ends up providing students with a kitchen consultation, sharpening knives and reorganizing cabinets as the meal progresses, and helping clients to see what tools they do and do not need. Ms. Stanton agrees that learning her way around her own kitchen is what has really kept her cooking, even in between the Wednesday evening classes. 
"I had a good-looking kitchen," Ms. Stanton said, "but I never cooked, and Jennifer spotted that immediately. She said in the nicest possible way, 'What kind of person doesn't have a whisk?' I didn't need a whisk to order in Chinese food. Now I have a whisk, and tongs, too."

HEADLINE: Is a Blue-Collar Future a Luxury on the Waterfront? 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Sabato F. Catucci stalks the piers on the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn, where he has built a thriving business handling cargo containers, lumber, coffee and cacao beans. Mr. Catucci, the owner of American Stevedoring, has plans for a liquor distribution centeron Pier 12, where his company would unload beer and spirits bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, bringing hundreds of new jobs to Red Hook.
 But last month, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey told him it would not extend his lease of Piers 6 through 12 beyond April, while it explored "alternative uses for the property." Though Representative Jerrold Nadler says he may have persuaded the Port Authority to grant a temporary reprieve, the longer-term fight to save Mr. Catucci's maritime operation is just one skirmish in a battle raging through Red Hook and neighboring Gowanus over the future of the hardscrabble area. 
 The small manufacturers, distributors and businesspeople who have helped revive that stretch of the Brooklyn waterfront in the last decade say the city and the Port Authority are writing off the area's maritime and industrial base in favor of a future filled with luxurious waterfront apartments featuring spectacular views of Manhattan and Governors Island. They say rents have risen sharply and speculators are holding industrial properties off the market in the belief that the city will rezone the area for residential development -- a move they contend will make it all but impossible for many of these companies, and thousands of jobs, to survive. 
The struggle mirrors what is happening in Long Island City, Queens, and Greenpoint and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where gentrification and a shift to residential zoning are under way, worrying manufacturers who provide blue-collar jobs.
"This is in many ways the most complex land-use battle in the city," Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said of Red Hook. "You've got competing uses, with tradeoffs between jobs, waterfront access, housing, retail jobs and industrial jobs. It requires a very textured approach."
He and other city officials say that a good number of Red Hook's buildings sit unused or underused, so the city and Port Authority are studying the area to determine how to make the transition from an industrial waterfront to an office-based economy. They will not say whether they envision luxury apartments, though they say they favor a mixed-use neighborhood where residential and commercial developments coexist.
But the small-business owners say coexistence is a pipe dream. A boom for luxury apartments will price them out of the neighborhood, they say, and the new developers and residents will have little tolerance for the gritty realities of a working waterfront. 
"People who live in Red Hook depend on these jobs; they're willing to put up with the truck traffic and the congestion," said Igor Katsman, vice president for operations for Snapple Distribution, which rents warehouse space and employs 250 workers. "But when you start putting up $500,000 condominiums, those people don't want trucks on the streets."
In the meantime, Mr. Katsman said, he fears that the uncertainty over the area's future will put him out of business. "Nobody wants to give us a long-term lease because they're all speculating that the zoning will be changed to residential," he said.
Mr. Doctoroff said that the city and Port Authority expect to complete their latest study on the future of Piers 6 through 12 sometime this month. He also said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg plans this spring to issue the city's long-awaited policy on preserving industrial space citywide.
But there is an increasing fear at Community Board 6, whose district includes Red Hook, that the Bloomberg administration has a different vision for the neighborhood. Last month, the city granted a variance to convert four floors of a six-story industrial building to 152 luxury apartments. The Red Hook-Gowanus Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit opposing the variance, saying it would touch off a conversion craze.
"It feels like Red Hook is being dismissed as the viable maritime and industrial community that it is," said Phaedra Thomas, the chamber's administrator. "They've determined that its future is as a luxury waterfront community."
Until the 1950's and 60's, much of shipping industry in New York Harbor docked in Red Hook and South Brooklyn, where longshoremen, warehouse workers and truckers lived in the neighborhood and walked to work. Most of the jobs disappeared as the Port Authority built a modern container port on the other side of the Hudson River in Newark and Elizabeth, N.J., a move that is still seen as a profound betrayal in Brooklyn.
But in the last 10 to 15 years, the Red Hook waterfront has come back to life as light manufacturers, artisans, distributors and woodworkers moved into abandoned industrial buildings and shipping resumed on some of the piers. According to a survey by the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, the number of businesses in Red Hook climbed to 457 in 1999, from 291 in 1991.
Mr. Catucci said he moved 110,000 shipping containers at the Red Hook container port last year, up from 18,211 in 1994. He established the biggest port for cacao beans in the world, although it has lost ground in recent years to Camden, N.J. and Philadelphia. He said he employed roughly 750 workers, including many from the nearby Red Hook Houses, where unemployment runs as high as 30 percent.
The Port Authority has complained that it spends millions of dollars a year subsidizing a barge that transports the containers from Brooklyn to New Jersey. But Mr. Catucci says he pays about $6 million of the $10 million cost of the barge and is developing plans for beverage and food distribution centers that would import goods bound for Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island, not New Jersey. He says that could eliminate the need for the barge in five years. 
If the city decides that in the long run the piers could be better used for housing or recreation, he said, he will gradually move his business to the largely deserted South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. But he has lost business while the Port Authority kept him in limbo over his lease -- and the city, he said, could lose hundreds of jobs, once again to New Jersey.
"I'm not going to stand in the way of progress, but I've got to know where I'm going," he said. "We lost 400 jobs at Domino Sugar last week. I don't want to lose these jobs, too. You'll never get them back."
A senior city official suggested that the loss of American Stevedoring could be offset by new jobs at a passenger ship terminal, an Ikea store and a Fairway supermarket all proposed for the area.
Robert Hughes, manager of the Erie Basin Bargeport, where 500 people work on barges and tugboats and at a beer distributor, said it was critical that the city retain Red Hook as its last working waterfront aside from Howland Hook in Staten Island. Tom Fox, president of New York Water Taxi, said the growth of ferries would continue only if there are places in the harbor to berth, repair and service boats. 
"There's a mile or more of waterfront property that, depending on the whims of elected officials, might be taken out of maritime use," Mr. Hughes said.
A year ago, Carnival, the big cruise ship company, worked out a proposal with the local community board and Mr. Catucci to build a $100 million passenger terminal at Pier 7 for the Queen Mary 2 and other ships, because of overcrowding at the city's terminals on the west side of Manhattan. But the city rejected the plan. Yesterday, Kate Ascher, an economic development official, said the city would invest $250 million over the next 10 years in passenger terminals, including two berths in Red Hook, although she acknowledged that she did not know where the money would come from. In the meantime, the city offered Carnival a temporary berth at Pier 7.
Community leaders worry that if the city does not move more quickly on a permanent terminal, Carnival will follow Royal Caribbean, another cruise line, to Bayonne, N.J. "We expected the departure of Royal Caribbean would be a wake-up call for the city," said Giora Israel, a Carnival vice president. "But so far we haven't received a viable proposal."
Bruce Batkin, an owner of the building at 160 Imlay Street that was granted a residential variance, said he thought the city's study indicated that the waterfront was well suited for residential development, despite the lack of public transportation. Across a short stretch of water, he said, the city plans to create a resort and conference center on Governors Island.
"We think this should be a template for successful coexistence of commercial and residential," he said.
Jeffrey Levi, chief executive of John's Gourmet, a high-end food manufacturer that employs 70 people a block away from Imlay Street, is not convinced. The people moving into expensive apartments, he said, will have concerns about truck traffic, noise, smells and Dumpsters. He pointed out how the Gillies Coffee Company in Sunset Park, another Brooklyn industrial neighborhood undergoing gentrification, was fined by the city last year after a resident complained about the smell of coffee.
With the area's future so uncertain, Mr. Levi said he is considering moving to New Jersey.
"For me to expand, it means I would have to invest another quarter of a million dollars," he said. "I'm not sure it makes sense if I'm going to have baby strollers rolling down the block."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders and Service Index Show Economy Keeps Growing 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
An index of service industries rose to a record in January and factory orders in December increased for the third time in four months, reports released yesterday showed, suggesting the economy is strengthening from the fourth quarter.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index for nonmanufacturing businesses jumped to 65.7, the highest since the survey's inception in July 1997 and exceeding forecasts; the reading was 58 in December. Since April, the gauge has held above 50, signaling expansion. 
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that orders placed with manufacturers in December rose 1.1 percent.
"There is good momentum that is covering a wider range of industries," said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Banc of America Securities in New York. "The reports continue to show solid growth. Capital spending is continuing to grow and broadening to other areas. We are looking for consumer spending to be a little stronger" this quarter.
Economists expected the institute's index to rise to 60, from 58.6. A 0.2 percent rise was forecast for December factory orders.
The purchasing managers group reported Monday that its gauge of factory activity was the highest since 1983. The purchasers' index of manufacturing rose to 63.6, reflecting a jump in production.
It is "reassuring to see both I.S.M. readings for January point to a torrid pace of activity," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. "I believe that growth will pick up to at least 5 percent in the first quarter." 
The report on factory orders showed a 0.3 percent rise in bookings for durable goods, reflecting greater demand for business equipment. Nonmilitary capital goods orders, a proxy for business investment, rose 0.8 percent in December.
Orders rose 2 percent for nondurable goods, possibly because of an increase in the value of petroleum. 
Factory stockpiles relative to sales fell to a record low of 1.26 months, suggesting production will strengthen in coming months.
The index of new orders for nonmanufacturing companies rose to 64.9, the second highest on record, from 59.5 in December. Order backlogs eased to 53.5 from 55.5. The index of prices paid, a measure of costs for purchased materials and services, fell to 59.7 from 60.3 in December. The inventory index dropped to 49.5 last month from 51.5. The employment index slipped to 53.4 from 54 in December.

HEADLINE: As Group of 7 Gathers, Europe Looks Like an Outsider 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
When finance ministers of the Group of 7 leading industrial countries convene on Friday in Boca Raton, Fla., the European delegation may find itself stranded on the sidelines.
 The fall of the dollar against the euro has frustrated exporters and political leaders in Europe, and there is little hope that they can reverse the policies of either the Bush administration, which seems content to let the market push the dollar downward, or Asia's central banks, which have intervened heavily to curb the rise of their currencies against the dollar. 
 "The U.S. and Asia have entered a symbiosis, in which Asia is financing the American recovery," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist for Deutsche Bank in London. "For Asia, that's fine, and for the U.S., that's also fine. The problem is for the bystander." 
European officials seem resigned to their currency's bearing the brunt of the dollar's downward adjustment. Exchange rates are likely to be Topic A among the United States, Japan, Germany, France and other countries, but few here expect the Boca Raton meeting to yield more than a general statement, carefully worded to avoid roiling the markets.
Similarly, the European Central Bank is not expected to lower interest rates when its policy board meets here in Frankfurt on Thursday, even though many analysts worry that the surging euro could derail Europe's fledgling recovery by dampening exports. The consensus forecast is that the bank will keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at 2 percent.
So far, the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has limited himself to speaking out against "brutal" movements in exchange rates -- a strategy known as verbal intervention, which analysts said had been effective in slowing the euro's rise in recent weeks.
The euro was unchanged today at $1.2531. 
With so much about the direction of global exchange rate movements now beyond Europe's control, some experts say that the 12 nations sharing the currency should turn their attention instead to reviving their domestic economies. That would make Europe less reliant on exports for growth, and less susceptible to collateral damage from a stampeding currency.
The disparity between exports and domestic demand has become striking here. In Germany, exports rose 4.1 percent in November, compared with the previous month, even though the euro strengthened. Retail sales, however, fell 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter despite heavy Christmas promotion and discounting.
"There was a virtual collapse in retail demand in Germany," said Jorg Kramer, the chief strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Frankfurt. "This is the really problematic spot in the German economy."
Mr. Kramer attributed Germany's continued weakness to a confluence of factors: the stubbornly high unemployment rate, confusion over the government's efforts to overhaul its tax code, and the fear shared by many Germans that their incomes will stagnate in a slow-growth economy.
Fixing those problems will not be easy.
The German and French governments are already running budget deficits well in excess of the European Union's limits, giving them little room to pursue looser, more stimulative fiscal policies. And Europe's political leaders may be losing their taste for broader changes-- like opening up their labor markets or rewriting tax codes -- now that their countries are no longer in a recession.
"It would be nice if Europe did something about demand, but unfortunately, there's not much it can do," said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
Mr. Gros and other Europeans take comfort in the fact that the rising euro has not had the calamitous effect on exports that many predicted. In fact, he said, Europe's exports to Asia have been buoyed by the Japanese central bank's frequent and heavy interventions in the currency markets.
"Asia is experiencing extremely lax monetary conditions," Mr. Gros said. "These countries are flooded with money."
Over the last year, the German apparel maker Hugo Boss has struggled in its home market, as well as in France and the United States. But its business has soared in Asia, particularly in China and Japan. Sales in Japan, where Hugo Boss opened two new stores in Tokyo, jumped 19 percent in the first nine months of 2003, the most recent period with results available.
"It's a booming region for us," said Philipp Wolff, a spokesman for Boss, based in the southern town of Metzingen.
Like many German exporters, Hugo Boss has protected itself somewhat against fluctuations in the exchange rate through hedging transactions with banks. That is one reason exporters have not been more clamorous in calling for a cut in interest rates.
Many of the hedge positions will, however, expire halfway through 2004, according to executives at several companies. If the euro stays as high as it is now, people here said, the drumbeat will grow for a rate cut or even an intervention by the European Central Bank.
Until now, the bank has taken the position that the revival of the global economy offsets the negative effects of a stronger euro. Recent comments by members of the bank's governing council signaled that it remains more focused on inflation than on the exchange rate.
"Foreign exchange rates are not a target for the E.C.B.," said Ernst Welteke, the president of the Bundesbank and a member of the European bank's council. "They only play a role insofar as they impact on the price level, and that is why we are monitoring them closely."
By regularly expressing concern about exchange rate movements, Mr. Welteke and Mr. Trichet are reminding currency traders that there are risks to buying euros, analysts said. The message is that the bank could, if necessary, intervene in the currency market. 
For the most part, though, Europeans who worry about the euro must pin their hopes on changes elsewhere. 
"You hope that in the U.S., domestic demand growth will slow," Mr. Mayer of Deutsche Bank said. "You hope that the Chinese will be comfortable in letting their currency go up versus the dollar. You hope that the Japanese will not be able to buy up every dollar offered to them."

STATE FARM TO CLOSE LO UISIANA CENTER EMPLOYING 1,000

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 The State Farm Insurance Company will close its office in Monroe, La., which employs 1,086 people, and move most of the work to operations centers in Tulsa, Okla., and Columbia, Mo., company officials said yesterday. The decision, after a yearlong efficiency study, means the Tulsa center will gain up to 250 jobs and the Columbia one will add as many as 350 in the next 18 months, company officials said. Consolidation details have not been determined, said Steve Short, vice president for operations at State Farm, which is based in Bloomington, Ill.

Dot-Com Survivor Hits on Right Plan

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
The burials received the most attention when the dot-com bubble burst nearly four years ago, but some companies stuck it out, retooling, reinventing and repackaging themselves, sometimes painfully, to survive in an industry of short product cycles. One was Intranets.com of Woburn, Mass.
 Intranets.com went through two makeovers, and two names, before it hit on what appears to be a winning formula. 
 Along the way, the firm also found some unusual uses for its Web-based data-and-document management system: helping NASA keep track of the data after the Columbia space shuttle disaster, and providing a community Web site to a consortium that aids families and survivors of the 2001 terrorist attack. 
Intranets.com was born in 1997 as Intranetics, offering a software package to help businesses manage their daily activities like sharing documents and posting their company calendars.
When sales of its shrink-wrapped software lagged in mid-1999, the company changed its name to Intranets.com to call attention to its core service, the setting up and running of company intranet sites. 
It also began giving away its online services and relying solely on Internet advertising for revenue. That did not work. Subscriber numbers soared but red ink gushed, and the dot-com crash forced the company to switch strategies again -- this time to a paid online service.
Such nimble change from one model to another is standard practice in the dot-com world.
While complete data on the fate of Internet companies are hard to come by, a 2002 report by Webmergers Inc., now part of the 451 Group, found that nearly 5,000 dot-coms -- half or more of the estimated 7,000 to 10,000 start-ups -- were either acquired or shut as the sector consolidated.
And the financing drought of 2001 created a virtual frenzy of adaptive behavior, whether redefining their customer base, offering new products or entering new markets, according to Tim R. Miller, a 451 Group analyst in San Francisco. 
NewRiver, a company in Andover, Mass., that made compact disks loaded with legal disclosure documents for insurance companies, expanded its customer base to a whole range of financial institutions, for example. Now nine years old, the company had 2003 revenues of $34 million. 
United Online of Westlake Village, Calif., simply started charging for its NetZero Internet service after advertising revenue shriveled up in early 2001. Mark Goldston, chief executive of United Online, said he made the decision while on a chairlift at a Colorado ski resort.
And ObjectVideo, a provider of video streaming based in Reston, Va., aimed at a new market, the security industry, gaining customers like the Customs Service, seaports and airports, according to Dr. Alan Lipton, the chief technology officer.
Intranets.com switched strategies twice before getting it right. In its original incarnation as Intranetics, it sold its software package to about 200 customers for $5,000 each, racking up about $1 million in sales.
The software, which had to be installed on a company's server, enabled the users to manage data and documents and to communicate with employees in scattered locations. 
Demand stagnated, however, so Intranetics changed course in 1999, renaming itself Intranets.com and offering its software free.
Within 90 days, it had signed up 60,000 people, companies or organizations. That number grew to 1.3 million users spread around the world, using 50 million on-line minutes a month doing everything from sending e-mail messages, checking company data or taking part in company discussion groups.
Intranets.com grew to 70 employees and began a similar service in Japan. Though the company was losing $1 million a month by early 2001 (with revenue of $100,000 a month), nobody seemed to mind.
Market share, after all, was the holy grail of dot-com start-ups; actual earnings could wait.
Like so many other Internet startups, Intranets.com figured that the number of its customers would skyrocket, allowing the company to go public or be sold within a few years.
"That was in vogue then," said Rick H. Faulk, who became chief executive in August 2001. "If you weren't losing that much, you weren't an official dot-com."
But by the time Mr. Faulk, 54, a veteran of PictureTel, a videoconferencing firm based in Andover, Mass., took the helm, he said, "We knew we had to scrap what we were doing and start all over again."
Mr. Faulk's challenge was to convert free users into paying customers. But because the company's two previous business models were so different, it was not clear that customers would go along. "We were worried because this was tried by a lot of companies, and it didn't work," he said.
Still, he knew many small businesses wanted intranet sites but could not afford to create their own. So Intranets.com asked its 600,000 most active users to start paying $3 a month for the services. 
The company's employees were skeptical. They held a contest to see who could correctly predict the number of customers who would sign up. Most predicted a number far short of the 75,000 who did.
Suddenly, the company was bringing in subscription revenue of $175,000 a month after accounting for late payments and nonpayments. Revenue rose to $6 million last year from $1 million in 2001 and from $3.7 million in 2002. 
Today, with 175,000 customers from nearly 7,000 companies and organizations, the company says it has one of the largest paid Web subscriber sites.
The company's services have been used by the United Services Group, a consortium of 39 organizations, to allow the Salvation Army, the Red Cross and other groups to talk over issues instantly and share information to help their clients after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"This has been a critical tool to help us to focus on the need of those affected," said Lauren Rosen, the coalition's program director.
One of Intranets.com's biggest clients is NASA, with 4,500 users, which relied on the company as the central data repository when the Columbia space shuttle broke up over Texas in February 2003. All data, including video and photography, of the shuttle's failure was logged into a site for members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Group to study from any location.
Shunning advertising does not always make sense for a dot-com business, of course.
Ganthead, a Fairfax, Va., online community for technology project managers, had the misfortune of starting one month before the Internet bubble burst.
"We couldn't get subscribers fast enough to generate revenue," said the founder, David Garrett. His company turned to advertising and prospered.
Intranets.com, however, says it will stick with its subscription fees. It plans to expand its overseas presence by marketing versions of its software in France, Germany and Spain, and it also plans to add a host of new products in this country. Mr. Faulk projects revenue of $10 million this year, with $1.5 million in earnings.
Last week, in an e-mail message shortly before he rushed off to the Super Bowl, Mr. Faulk acknowledged that his company had been on a roller coaster ride.
It paid off, he said, because "we stuck with it."

HEADLINE: Black and Hispanic Acceptance Eludes Mayor, Despite His Efforts 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS; Marjorie Connelly and Oren Yaniv contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
From the time he took office as a Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg has made repeated and explicit efforts to reach out to black and Hispanic residents, from giving unvarnished apologies for police mistakes to speaking at Al Sharpton's headquarters on the observance of Martin Luther King's birthday.
 Moreover, in a noticeable shift from his predecessor, he has made social issues like low-income housing a central goal of his administration, a policy that is likely to favor blacks and Hispanics. 
 Through it all, though, his approval ratings among black and Hispanic New Yorkers have been poor. The ratings began fairly strong, considering that he is a Republican, but they have slipped during his first two years in office.
Even this week, just days after his emotional and applauded appearance at a funeral for a 19-year-old black man who was the victim of a police shooting, his approval numbers have not risen above 35 percent among blacks or Hispanics -- substantially below the approval rating he is given by white New Yorkers, which rose to 53 percent in the same poll. 
The results among black residents are somewhat better than what Rudolph W. Giuliani saw at a similar point in his first term, but not much improved, especially considering what many regarded as the polarizing nature of Mr. Giuliani's policies and style. Among Hispanics, Mr. Bloomberg's rating is even lower than Mr. Giuliani's at this point. 
An examination of polling data and interviews with residents and political experts suggest strongly that Mr. Bloomberg's problems are not rooted in classic party loyalty or in any fundamental suspicion that the mayor's policies or thinking is discriminatory. Instead, the disapproval is based much more on economics, specifically the belief that the billionaire Mr. Bloomberg somehow cannot relate to black and Hispanic residents' everyday lives.
Though whites have also indicated in polls and interviews that they resent the mayor for raising taxes, particularly the property tax, the issue has a particular resonance among middle-class blacks and Hispanics, many of whom are first-time homeowners or work in or own small businesses. 
"What do I think of Bloomberg? Forget it," said Raymond Santos, a real estate businessman in the Bronx, when asked his views on the mayor. "The property tax thing was insane, completely insane, and even though we get this one-time rebate back, it showed he doesn't understand how tough it is out here. He should never have done it in the first place."
His comments were echoed in numerous interviews around the city. Leeanna Joseph, a waitress at Carmichaels diner in Queens, said that she found Mr. Bloomberg to be "someone who doesn't relate to the average person." 
"I know he has a lot of money," she added, "and I think that he just doesn't understand the regular person."
Mr. Bloomberg's aides said the lackluster approval ratings and reaction to Mr. Bloomberg were a disappointment but not unsurmountable. 
"We think that our job is to hammer away at the big problems and move the smaller ones off the table," said William T. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director. "And that's what we've been doing. Of course, we would like the numbers to be higher in every demographic group, but we're not here to achieve certain poll numbers in February of 2004. We're here to accomplish things for the city of New York."
Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg has said all along that polls matter little to him. But the issue of his standing among blacks and Hispanics goes beyond the numbers. Politically, it is no small hurdle to clear. His likely opponents when he seeks re-election in 2005 include at least three black candidates and one Hispanic candidate. The opinions of people like the Rev. Kirby Spivey 3rd, a youth minister at the Calvary Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens -- he feels the mayor "seems to be kind of in his own world" -- will take on added weight.
"He spent so much money on his campaign that it seems he bought the mayoralty," Mr. Spivey said. "And he doesn't seem like he understands the common man and woman."
Opinions can change, particularly at a time when the economy is perking up, less drastic budget decisions are ahead and Mr. Bloomberg has at his disposal a vast income to bombard the airwaves with the accomplishments of his administration and good news from the Bloomberg years.
Mr. Bloomberg is already seeing some improvement among all New Yorkers. Poll results announced yesterday by Quinnipiac University show his approval rating by all New Yorkers has now split, with 44 percent approving and 45 percent disapproving. That is an improvement over the last several months and the highest overall rating the mayor has received since February 2003.
Interviewed after Mr. Bloomberg had visited the family of the dead man, Timothy Stansbury Jr., had spoken at his funeral and after Mr. Bloomberg's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, had said the shooting appeared to be unjustified -- an unusual moment in the city's recent history -- Henrietta Bishop still said she was dissatisfied with the Bloomberg administration. 
"It was good that he reached out for the family," said Ms. Bishop, who lives in Harlem and works with handicapped adults. "But don't just reach out for that particular family after the fact. I think it should be an ongoing thing." She said she didn't vote for him "and I definitely won't vote for him again. I wouldn't dare cast my vote for him."
Pollsters and political scientists consider the Bloomberg findings somewhat confounding, especially considering that Mr. Bloomberg had stronger support among the city's Hispanic and black voters than is conventional for a Republican. In fact, he was elected with about 25 percent of the black vote, and Hispanic voters divided their votes almost evenly between Mr. Bloomberg and his Democratic rival, Mark Green.
But interviews and polls point to Mr. Bloomberg's economic policies as the source of his problems, as well as a visceral perception by blacks and Hispanics that he does not care about their daily struggles.
"We're in hard times in the city, but it's compounded in communities of color that have yet to get their footing in education and health care," said City Councilwoman Yvette D. Clarke, who represents the Flatbush and Crown Heights sections of Brooklyn. "The property tax increase has had a devastating impact, the layoffs and so on. " 
"His policies are not as in-your-face as those of the Giuliani administration, but the signal is still sent that you're an afterthought in the process or not a thought at all," Ms. Clarke said.
Even Mr. Cunningham, the mayor's communications director, acknowledged that there is an economic component to the disparity in the mayor's approval ratings.
"We had two difficult budget years with a lot of headlines and stories about how tough it would be and how we had to cut money," Mr. Cunningham said. "And the people who are most apt to be concerned about social programs provided by the city are working class and poor people, and that would track with census data with minority communities."
But, said Mr. Cunningham, the news is not all badfor Mr. Bloomberg.
"If you were to say that any Republican mayor other than John Lindsay had the support of more than a quarter of the minority voters, Republicans would be ecstatic," Mr. Cunningham said. "And Democrats would be worried. And the Democrats should be worried."
But, said some political strategists, so should Mr. Bloomberg. "Unlike when he first ran, he now has a record," said John H. Mollenkopf, director of urban research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
Mr. Mollenkopf pointed out that Mr. Bloomberg won in the aftermath of an ethnically charged Democratic primary and runoff in 2001 that left many Hispanic voters, and some black ones, too, displeased with the ultimate Democratic nominee. That defection was coupled with strength among moderate-to-conservative white voters.
So far, the people running or most likely to run against Mr. Bloomberg include Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president and the city's best-known Hispanic politician and Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields and City Councilman Charles Barron, all of whom are black.
But some Democratic politicians said Mr. Bloomberg's problems were not party problems. "Of course, many Latinos and African Americans are first-time homeowners and they were angry about the property tax increase," said Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr., a Bronx Democrat. "But it's not just that and it's not just his policies, and it's not a party thing, either, because he got a significant amount of Latino votes, especially for a Republican. 
"It's his attitude," Mr. Diaz said. "And it's the feeling that he doesn't really care about us. Many people feel that we don't have a seat at the table."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Some lessons from Sweden on the pros and cons of privatizing Social Security.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
"YOUNGER workers," President Bush said in his State of the Union address, "should have the opportunity to build a nest egg by saving part of their Social Security taxes in a personal retirement account." 
 According to former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, the president believes that the reason he was elected was his bold -- some would say risky -- stance on replacing part of Social Security with personal accounts. If the president holds onto office in November and his party continues to hold Congress, the creation of some sort of personal retirement accounts as part of Social Security seems likely. 
 Although it is impossible to know what form such accounts might take, in 2000 Sweden instituted a system of personal accounts that holds many lessons for any country seeking to reform its retirement system. 
Sweden now has a blended system, an approach Mr. Bush apparently favors. Employers and employees contribute a combined 16 percent of payroll toward a "pay as you go" retirement system like Social Security, and an additional 2.5 percent toward individual retirement accounts. Those born after 1954 are fully in the new system, while older workers are phased in. 
The reform process began in 1991, when a center-right coalition came to power. At the time, Sweden's generous retirement system was expected to exhaust its "buffer" funds in about 20 years, a more dire situation than what now confronts the United States; Social Security will not exhaust its trust fund until 2042, according to the latest projections. 
To address its problems, Sweden set up a committee with representatives from all parties in Parliament. Because the reforms were expected to last for decades, there was pressure to devise a plan with broad support, said Annika Sunden, an expert on pensions at Stockholm University. There was agreement back in 1994 that reform would include individual accounts, so beginning in 1995 the government began tucking away 2.5 percent of payroll for employees to invest once the system was set up. 
Personal investment accounts were not established until 2000, with a bewildering array of funds to choose from. Some 456 funds participated initially, and the number has since grown to around 600. Most funds invested in stocks, with a quarter primarily in Swedish stocks. Workers could choose up to five funds. 
Anyone who did not choose a fund was automatically assigned to the default fund, which was set up by the government. The default fund must invest 80 to 90 percent of its assets in stocks. 
A central pension agency records all the accounts and fund values. The agency also ran an ad campaign to discourage people from going into the default fund. 
Nonetheless, a new study by Henrik Cronqvist and Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago finds that a third of Swedish workers did not make an active choice when the system started in 2000, and were therefore assigned to the default fund. Since 2000, fully 92 percent of new enrollees have not made a choice and have been added to the default fund. 
Apparently, the large number of funds to chose from paralyzed many individuals from making a choice. This has also been the experience of many 401(k) plans that have a default option in the United States: the default option, whatever it may be, is chosen by a high proportion of investors. People are also reluctant to switch once they are in a fund, a tendency that the economists William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser have called status quo bias. 
Another bias that Mr. Cronqvist and Mr. Thaler documented is home bias, a tendency to pick funds composed of Swedish companies, as opposed to a diversified portfolio of companies from around the world. Nearly half the money actively invested was in Swedish stocks. The default fund, by contrast, was better diversified: only 17 percent was in Swedish stocks. 
They also found that people tended to pick funds in sectors that had done well recently, and to pick funds with low fees. The average fee for active choosers was 77 basis points, or 0.77 percent of the funds invested. For the default fund it was just 16 basis points. Chile's mandatory savings plan provides another point of comparison. Fund management fees were much lower in Sweden than administrative costs in Chile's plan, probably because the central pension agency orchestrated rebates and advertised the fee rates.
How did the funds do? 
Sweden had bad timing. The stock market tumbled just after the program started. 
It turns out, however, that the default fund lost less money than the aggregate portfolio of selected funds. The average selected fund fell by 40 percent in the first three years of the program, while the default fell 30 percent. 
Although three years is a short period, there is no evidence that the active choosers made better choices than those assigned to the default fund. 
For the United States, the main lesson from the Swedish experience, Ms. Sunden said, is that the default fund should be constructed very carefully, because it will attract many investors. (Ditto for 401(k) plans.) She also highlighted that more use should be made of generation funds, which move money into less risky assets as workers approach retirement, and that converting funds into annuities should be mandatory for retired workers. 
The consequences of making a bad investment decision in Sweden are much less severe than they would be in the United States if Mr. Bush gets his way and allows workers to divert part of the 12.4 percent of their paycheck that goes to Social Security -- half from the employee, half from the employer -- into personal accounts.
Sweden devotes 16 percent of payroll to an earnings-linked pension system, creating a strong safety net beneath individual accounts. Sweden also established a "guaranteed pension" that provides a minimum pension amount, in excess of the poverty line, to anyone with little or no pension income. 
All this leads one to wonder if it is possible to design a system that diverts some Social Security contributions into personal accounts yet still provides adequate insurance against bad luck and bad investment decisions. Moreover, the current American system is not beyond repair. In their new book, "Saving Social Security: A Balanced Approach" (Brookings Institution Press), for example, Peter A. Diamond of M.I.T. and Peter R. Orszag of the Brookings Institution outline a plan to preserve the best elements of Social Security by making politically difficult but sensible reforms, like indexing benefits to rising life expectancy and collecting some payroll taxes above the earnings cap. 
Sometimes, a little status quo bias is not such a bad thing.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO; 
G.O.P. Revives Line of Attack Against Kerry

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Republicans and their allies have begun laying the groundwork for a familiar line of attack against Senator John Kerry: that he is "out of sync" with most voters, "culturally out of step with the rest of America," a man who votes with "the extreme elements of his party," as Ed Gillespie, the Republican chairman, has put it in recent days.
 In short, that he is a Massachusetts liberal. It is a charge that ultimately proved devastating to Michael S. Dukakis, the Democrats' presidential nominee in 1988, who ended the campaign battered by the Republicans as "a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.," a product of the "Harvard boutique" who coddled criminals and was too much of a legalistic liberal to require school children to say the pledge of allegiance. 
 Some of the so-called wedge issues that polarized voters and resonated back then, when President Bush's father was waging the attack, may not have the same power today, but others have risen in their place. 
This year, the state's liberal image is being highlighted anew by its role in the growing debate over gay marriage. 
The state's highest court on Wednesday ruled that people of the same sex must have the right to marry -- not just to enter into civil unions -- if the state is to comply with its previous rulings.
Conservative leaders said the court decision only underscored the need for a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. Mr. Bush appears increasingly likely to embrace such an amendment. Mr. Kerry says he supports civil unions, not same-sex marriages, but has opposed a constitutional amendment outlawing them.
"This could be a very defining difference between the candidates," said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative group.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Mr. Kerry clearly sought a middle ground. He said he believed in protecting the "fundamental rights of gay and lesbian couples, from inheritance to health benefits," but added that he believed the answer was civil unions. 
"I oppose gay marriage and disagree with the Massachusetts court's decision," he said.
The Kerry campaign, which includes several veterans of the Dukakis campaign, says it will not make the mistakes of 1988, when Mr. Dukakis was widely seen as too passive in the face of the attacks. "We welcome a debate with the likes of Ed Gillespie, Karl Rove and this White House about who's out of sync with Main Street America," said David Wade, a Kerry spokesman.
"Their tired old G.O.P. attack dog just won't hunt," Mr. Wade said, adding that Republicans would be running against "a Democrat who fought for his country in war, put criminals behind bars as a prosecutor, stood up for balanced budgets in the Senate," and "kept faith with America's veterans."
Another Kerry adviser was more blunt. "This is not the Dukakis campaign," the adviser said. "We're not going to take it. And if they're going to come at us with stuff, whatever that stuff may be, if it goes to a place where the '88 campaign did, then everything is on the table. Everything."
Republicans assert Mr. Kerry's problem is his own voting record, and argue that it is very fair game. Mr. Gillespie, in a recent speech, asserted that Mr. Kerry's voting record was, by some measures, even more liberal than the senior senator from Massachusetts, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, another icon of liberalism.
Ralph Reed, chairman of the Bush-Cheney campaign in the Southeast, said on Wednesday, "More important than labels is the fact that he has a voting record over 20 years in the U.S. Senate that is out of the mainstream, simply out of step with where the American people are, by consistently voting to weaken national defense, undercut our intelligence capability and massively raise taxes."
Mr. Kerry and his allies dismiss that characterization of his record, noting, for example, that he was one of the first Democrats to sign onto the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, argued that Mr. Kerry's background as a decorated veteran and a tough prosecutor also come into play.
"It is hard to demonize as an irresponsible leftist a man who has locked up criminals and shot communists," Mr. Frank said. "That's John Kerry's record. Kerry's cast a couple specific votes that are unpopular, but so has Bush. In general, I like our ground better."
Still, Republicans do not seem cowed by Mr. Kerry, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, who left the campaign trail on Wednesday after winning five of seven nominating contests the previous day, and returned to Boston for what he said would be an "administrative day." 
In his speeches, Mr. Gillespie has highlighted several national security and economic votes, but also some of the social issues that have proved so divisive in the past. He noted that Mr. Kerry voted against the ban on a procedure used in second and third trimester of pregnancy, one critics call partial-birth abortion. That legislation was signed into law by Mr. Bush last fall.
Mr. Gillespie also noted that Mr. Kerry voted against the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, barring federal recognition of same-sex marriages, a measure that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Kerry said at the time that while he opposed same-sex marriage, he was voting against the bill because "I believe that this debate is fundamentally ugly, and it is fundamentally political, and it is fundamentally flawed.

HEADLINE: Shrinking City Syndrome 

BYLINE:  By KATE STOHR

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, the prevailing wisdom was that cities grow, sprawling ever wider. As the world population hit six billion, experts warned of explosive overcrowding in the megacities of the developing world. Shrinking cities were considered an anomaly, the result of isolated economic upheaval or traumatic political events. "Smart growth" became a rallying cry.
 In fact, while city dwellers make up nearly half the world's population, new research by the United Nations and other demographers has shown that for every two cities that are growing, three are shrinking. Some cities that were bustling centers of commerce just a generation ago have become modern-day Pompeiis. Cities that have lost more than a third of their population include St. Louis, Phnom Penh and Johannesburg. 
 The shrinking city syndrome is leaving planners and city officials with, among other things, the challenge of preserving and reusing buildings with architectural and cultural interest.
In Manchester, England, where the population has fallen by 48 percent since 1931, dress patterns still hang on the walls of derelict textile mills. And in the former East Germany, which experienced a mass exodus after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, dozens of midsize cities have shrunk, forcing those left behind to grapple with job losses, empty schools and a falling tax base. 
The problem is so acute that a group of researchers based in Berlin is holding an international competition to address it. The competition, which aims to find fresh approaches to dealing with population loss in urban areas, is sponsored by a $3 million research project, Shrinking Cities (www.shrinkingcities.com), financed in large part by the German government.
"Even though the development in Germany is quite shocking, it is not the first or only place that this kind of crisis is taking place," said Philipp Oswalt, the project director.
More than 450 cities with populations above 100,000 have lost 10 percent or more of their populations since 1950, including 59 in the United States alone, the project found.
It has enlisted teams of architects, artists, journalists and others to study four regions in particular that have hemorrhaged people and jobs: Manchester and Liverpool; Ivanovo, Russia, a state-sponsored manufacturing center in the days of the Soviet Union; the Detroit metropolitan area; and the Halle-Leipzig area of what was East Germany. Their research will culminate in Berlin in September with an exhibition of 10 proposed projects from each area.
"The classic urban planning tools don't work," Mr. Oswalt said. 
Traditionally, urban planners advise bulldozing eroded neighborhoods and starting from scratch, he said. Now some of the same sites that were singled out for "slum clearance" in the 1960's are undergoing a second round of urban renewal.
Efforts in the 1990's to spur economic growth have also failed, Mr. Oswalt said. Entire streets -- along with sidewalks, lights and sewerage and electricity lines -- were plopped into the Halle-Leipzig region, for instance, after the reunification of Germany led to a 14 to 30 percent drop in population in the cities there. Planners assumed that if enough was invested in infrastructure, private investment would follow. Instead the result was a series of "illuminated meadows," as they are known in Germany.
Every city, of course, is different. But research by Shrinking Cities has revealed that planned development is often counterproductive. And buildings left vacant often lend themselves to curious and unexpected uses that can trigger development at the grass-roots level. 
Manchester failed to perk up in the 1960's despite investments in new building projects. Then, in the 80's and 90's, musicians flowed in, attracted by rock-bottom rents. The "Mad-chester" music scene spawned not only homespun record labels and illegal raves, but also new condominiums, bars and businesses in the city center.
In order to prepare for the Commonwealth Games in 2002, Manchester decided to "brand" many abandoned and run-down buildings rather than demolish or renovate them. Shrouded with positive slogans, the buildings helped put a positive spin on Manchester's shifting landscape.
In Detroit, churches now occupy a number of abandoned bank buildings, and the Michigan Theater, once a lavish jazz-era movie palace, has become a private parking garage (complete with velvet curtains). 
"Planners, developers and some architects see these wastelands and they say, Let's just make it a tabula rasa. Let's just knock it down and start again," said Dan Dubowitz, an architect in Glasgow. "They don't think imaginatively about how culturally rich these structures can be."
Mr. Dubowitz has spent 12 years documenting discarded spaces in Europe and New York and now works with planners to redevelop them. "There's a lot that goes on while these places are decaying that make them very important to the life of the city," he said. "So something quite negative happens when you come along and erase these sites."
The challenge, he and others say, is to overcome the fear many associate with abandoned spaces.
"We have to think about shrinking cities in more than just a negative way," said Dan Pitera, director of the Detroit Collaborative Design Center, a community-building architectural practice at the University of Detroit Mercy.
Mr. Pitera, who is one of the curators from Detroit participating in the Shrinking Cities project, said that he and a team of other architects and researchers estimate that Detroit loses people at the rate of 1.7 every hour. Even the dead are leaving: suburbanites exhume up to three graves a day to move loved ones out of the city, Mr. Pitera said.
Rather than "filling in the gaps" or recreating a city in an image of its past, Mr. Pitera said, Detroit should infuse new life in discarded spaces, erasing the ghosts without erasing the buildings themselves. 
Working with community groups, the Detroit Collaborative Design Center has, for example, converted wrecked houses into temporary art installations. In a similar project, an artist, Tyree Guyton, helped turn dilapidated houses on one block into polka-dot found-art sculptures, and they are now a tourist destination.
"We need to define density as something other than just buildings and structures," Mr. Pitera said. Detroit may never grow back to its former glory, he continued, but that doesn't mean it can't be a vibrant city. "We need to start tapping into the creative, spontaneous solutions that are already happening in these cities and turn them into strategies," he said. 
In other words, smart growth in reverse.

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE INTERNET; 
Survey Finds 'Opinion Leaders' Logging On for Political News

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
The people trolling the Internet for political news, reading the blogs of presidential candidates and bombarding their friends with campaign-related e-mail notes are not just computer wonks. They are not just college students. They are not even all Howard Dean supporters, according to a study to be released today by George Washington University. 
 What the Americans who have flocked to the Internet this campaign season have in common, according to the study, is that they are much more likely than the average citizens to serve as an opinion leader in their community. Nearly half have never before participated in organized politics, though they are now significantly more likely to donate money to candidates. 
 The surge in Internet use for politics has been the focus of much attention in recent months, particularly because of its role in the rise of Howard Dean. After Dr. Dean's string of primary losses, online organizing quickly seemed to lose some of its cachet. 
But the George Washington survey, conducted by telephone and on the Internet with the university's partners, RoperASW and Nielsen/NetRatings, provides the first close look at who is actually logging on to get and spread political information. Politicians and anyone else interested in political organizing, the survey's sponsors say, risk considerable harm to their cause by dismissing the importance of the Internet as a potent new tool. 
The group of Americans who regularly take advantage of online political forums is still small, but they have potential to be very valuable for candidates, the survey found. Nielsen/NetRatings surveyed 1,392 people online who visited political and news Web sites late last year. Roper interviewed 1,029 people in a random telephone survey.
"The main finding of the study is that if you want to reach the people who are reaching everyone else, that place is still the Internet," said Carol Darr, director of the university's Institute for Politics, Democracy and the Internet. "The growing support for this medium is not dependent on any one candidate."
Using questions developed by Roper to determine how "influential" an individual is -- typically used for marketing purposes by corporations and advertising companies -- the study found that online political activists are nearly seven times more likely than the average citizen to influence their peers when it comes to telling them what to buy, where to go on vacation, and which politicians to support.
Roper says about 10 percent of Americans typically fall into its definition, which requires participation in a combination of community activities that might include making a speech, attending a PTA meeting or writing a letter to a newspaper. Only 7 percent of the American population regularly use the Internet for political purposes, according to the study -- but 69 percent of them are "influential."
The study defines "online political citizens" as people who have visited the Web site of a candidate or political party in the last two months and participated in at least two other online activities, like sending political e-mail or making a contribution. The study also revises the prevailing impression of online politicos as impassioned Internet or other students with lots of time on their hands. About 60 percent of them have college degrees, and just over one-third are ages 18 to 34. Nearly two-thirds are male, and 86 percent are white, compared with 81 percent of the population. 
Many political analysts caution that for crucial elements of political organizing, the reach of the Internet still pales in comparison to traditional media like television or radio. But some said the George Washington survey helped todefine its emerging role. 
"Internet politics has been a lot of guesswork up till now," said Phil Noble, founder of PoliticsOnline, a nonpartisan political newsletter, who had seen an early version of the survey's results. "The question has always been is the Internet a good way to reach out and mobilize people? This says the answer is yes, and lays out its dimensions."

HEADLINE: Truckers Look in Their Ranks For 'Fallen Angel' Writer 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C., Feb. 4 

 BODY:
The letter was brief and to the point. 
 "I'm a fleet owner of a tanker company," it said. "I have access to castor pulp," a reference to the raw material to make the deadly compound ricin. "If my demand is dismissed, I am capable of making Ricin." 
 The note, attached to a metal vial containing the powder and addressed to the Transportation Department, was dropped off in October at a mail-sorting office at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport. A similar letter appeared in November at a mail-processing center that serves the White House. Both notes were signed "Fallen Angel," law enforcement officials said. 
As investigators explore possible links between the parcels and the presence of ricin in a Senate mailroom, trucking executives and the drivers who haul the nation's goods wondered whether one of their own might have used bioterrorism to publicize opposition to trucking rules that took effect last month. The regulations, which aim to reduce accidents by reducing how long drivers can stay on the road, have roiled the industry, which is already reeling from a recessionary drop in freight and higher fuel costs.
Thepresident of the South Carolina Trucking Association, Rick Todd, said if the person responsible for the ricin contamination was a trucker "it is certainly awful for the image of our industry, especially for the millions of hard-working truck drivers across America." 
"It's hard to imagine anyone could be this upset about these changes," Mr. Todd said. 
Among the road-rattled drivers who were filling their fuel tanks at a truck stop near here, passions ran high, especially among independents, drivers who own their rigs and who say the regulations lead to longer hours and less money.
"This guy must be a kook, but at least folks are going to listen to what he's saying," said Joe Thompson, who has been driving his 18-wheeler for 10 years. "The feds are killing us with their bureaucracy." 
After the letter was found here, Daniel Somerson, an advocate for owner-operators whose homemade Web site criticizes the rules, said F.B.I. agents had interviewed him and his wife. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Columbia, Tom O'Neill, would not comment on the investigation but said agents were looking into the possibility that a disgruntled trucker was responsible for the parcels. 
Federal transportation officials say the rules, which took effect on Jan. 4 and have a 60-day grace period, would save 75 lives and prevent 1,300 fatigue-related accidents a year by establishing a routine for truck drivers that they say more closely mirrors natural work and sleep rhythms. 
Officials say the changes are the most far-reaching for the industry in 65 years, reducing daily driving time, to 10 hours from 11. 
The most contentious change involves calculating workdays. Drivers can be on duty only for 14 hours a day, meaning that if a driver spends 6 hours awaiting goods at a factory, a delay that truckers say is not uncommon, the driver can stay on the road for just 8 more hours.
Time spent stopped for fueling, napping or eating is not counted as rest time. Some drivers say that keeps them behind the wheel for longer uninterrupted periods. In some cases, drivers say, the rules make them drive faster. 
"We've got to get the same work done in less time, and that makes the job more stressful," said Bob Williams, a "tanker yanker," a hauler of hazardous chemicals. "Listen, we're adults, and we know when it's time to rest. If we didn't, we'd be in a graveyard already." 
Coming on the tail of higher fuel costs and a three-year recession in the industry, trucking companies and owner-operators say the rules will lead to higher costs, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.
"This is not good for the economy," Mr. Williams said at the counter of the Travel Centers of America truck stop as other truckers nodded assent. "The government just threw this in our lap. Understandably, we're not very happy."
Not everyone is displeased over the new rules, especially those that mandate a 10-hour break after every 14 hours. Fleet drivers who receive steady salaries or hourly wages are the biggest winners. But for owner-operators who are paid by the mile, less driving time means less money and more time away from home. 
"These new regs are going to put us under," said Rodney Snyder, a driver for 14 years. "I'm thinking of getting out of the business."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
Penguins Take Precipitous Fall From the Top

BYLINE:  By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
To see their Penguins play Tampa Bay on a slushy winter night last week, the hockey fans of Pittsburgh took an upward trek on a slippery slope of their hilly city. At the top stood the round-roofed Mellon Arena, also known as the Igloo, an appropriate nickname on a day filled with snow, sleet and freezing rain.
 Inside, despite an announced sale of 9,391 tickets (a season low), the 16,958 seats looked to be about one-third occupied. Those who showed up saw the Penguins lose, 6-2, their seventh consecutive defeat in what is now an 11-game losing streak. The team, which is off for the All-Star Game break, has lost 17 of its last 19 games. 
 Twice the Stanley Cup champions, in 1991 and 1992, the Penguins are caught in hockey's perfect storm. They have a low budget, the National Hockey League's oldest arena, poor attendance and the worst record among the 30 teams. On this night against the Lightning, most of the scattered customers sat quietly, as if frozen. Even the beer stand behind the center-ice seats was closed. 
Just a decade ago, the Penguins were the N.H.L.'s best team and by far its most entertaining. In 1992-93, they won 56 regular-season games. Although in gradual decline since then, they reached the final four of the Stanley Cup playoffs as recently as 2001. They used to sell out most of their games; cheers and music reverberated beneath the arena's quirky curved ceiling. It all seems so long ago.
Their plunge has been drastic, the worst-case scenario in the league, which insists it needs a major revision in its collective bargaining agreement with the N.H.L. Players Association. Although the union is skeptical about some of the league's assertions of financial hardship, everyone pities the predicament of the Penguins.
In addition, the Penguins are the only team in major professional sports whose principal owner is also the star player: labor and management in the same body. And he isn't just anybody. He is Mario Lemieux, 38, who came out of retirement in 2000 after being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame and buying the team out of bankruptcy.
But Lemieux is unable to play because of hip surgery after scoring one goal in 10 games this season. People who know him say he is disillusioned by the business of the sport as he watches his mixture of tired veterans and young prospects lose relentlessly under Ed Olczyk, a first-year coach.
Although the Penguins said they are determined to follow their business plan and build for the future with low-salaried prospects, the present is an ordeal.
"I don't sleep," Olczyk said. "There's a lot of pressure."
In one of last week's defeats, a critical opposing goal came after a Penguin was penalized for arguing with an official about an offsides whistle.
In another defeat, the key goal came after the Penguins were penalized for having too many men on the ice. After losing to Tampa Bay, Olczyk, as he left the bench, yelled at Vincent Lecavalier, the Lightning player who had angered Olczyk almost three months before by celebrating excessively after a goal in a 9-0 victory.
In postgame news conferences, Olczyk often sighs, grimaces, pauses, frowns and shakes his head sadly. There is so much more to fret about beyond the daily grind.
"We know the building issue is hanging above our head," Olczyk said, referring to the stalled quest for a new arena. "Our payroll is not exactly very high. Everybody's waiting to see what's going to happen next September."

Waiting for Labor Settlement
He was referring to the negotiations between team owners and the union to replace the collective bargaining agreement that expires Sept. 15, before the start of the next season. The league has said it needs "cost certainty," a phrase the union interprets as a synonym for a salary cap.
There is the possibility of a lockout. A 15-week shutdown delayed the 1994-95 season. The union said that lockout, which cut off the cash flow to franchises, contributed to the financial decline of the Penguins, whose payroll of about $22 million is roughly half the N.H.L. average.
The people who run the Penguins say that a favorable labor settlement, along with a new arena, an improving economy and maturing players, could revive a franchise that joined the league in its 1967 expansion to 12 teams from 6. Without a new arena -- even if everything else works out well -- the team may be sold and may leave Pittsburgh after its arena lease ends in 2007.
That possibility was raised last summer by Lemieux, who was owed $32.5 million in 1999 before converting most of that debt into equity in the bankruptcy settlement. Lemieux declined requests for an interview, but the team president, Ken Sawyer, voiced the company view.
"It's really up to the public sector now to come to us and say, 'We're ready to sit and talk about the arena,' " Sawyer said. "The clock is ticking: 2007 is when the team could leave town, and that possibility is real."
Teams in similar circumstances have moved under the administration of Commissioner Gary Bettman. The Quebec Nordiques became the Colorado Avalanche in 1995, and the Winnipeg Jets became the Phoenix Coyotes the next year. Assuming a favorable labor agreement, a growing economy and the improvement of the young players, Sawyer said: "This team may be attractive to markets which we would not even consider today. So that, in itself, will be kind of a deadline that the community will have to address."
But the community does not seem eager to address it at the moment. The city government faces a budget crisis. The population of both Pittsburgh, in Allegheny County, and the surrounding region is diminishing. During snowstorms last week, some roads were not cleared quickly because of cutbacks of personnel and trucks.
A regional governmental unit called the Sports and Exhibition Authority recently oversaw the building of a baseball stadium for the Pirates and a football stadium for the Steelers. But the executive director of that body, Stephen G. Leeper, said in a telephone interview that a new hockey arena should not be considered for Pittsburgh until the N.H.L. gets a new financial structure that includes sharing revenue among owners.
"It's not a viable league," said Leeper, who said last week that he would step down in two months. "It's a sport that sort of boggles one's mind. They need to do some soul-searching. They never talk about revenue sharing. Other teams have newarenas and they are still failing. Management doesn't want to address their own failures. Before one comes asking local government to do this or do that, they have to get their own house in order."

Aiming for a New Arena
Bill Daly, an N.H.L. executive vice president, said that increased revenue sharing "is almost necessarily a part of the solution." Of the Penguins in particular, Daly said "The vital signs are not as dire as current attendance would suggest."
The effort to build a new arena in Pittsburgh, Daly said, "hasn't played out as we all would have hoped." But he also said the fan base is strong in Pittsburgh and that the league is "dedicated to the Pittsburgh market."
"Pittsburgh, in terms of local television, has been one of the strongest teams in terms of ratings and reach," Daly said. As for moving the franchise, Daly said, "I don't want to consider that as a likely prospect."
Dan Onorato, the newly elected Allegheny County executive, said: "We're not in a position to put local money" into a new arena. Tom Murphy, the Pittsburgh mayor, said through a spokesman, "There is absolutely no city operating budget funding available for construction of a new arena."
People close to Lemieux have said he feels misled by elected officials who he believes promised a new arena when he took over the team. Onorato said, "I don't see anything in writing."
In recent seasons, the Penguins have traded stars like Jaromir Jagr, Aleksei Kovalev and Martin Straka to cut their payroll. Two months ago, Lemieux turned down a $4 million portion of his compensation for his executive role. Last week, the team sent back Marc-Andre Fleury, a rookie goalie, to his junior club; he could have made $3 million in bonuses if he had stayed the full season. Sawyer said that the team expects to lose about $5 million on operations this season and that it is carrying debt of about $30 million to $35 million.
Although Lemieux is still one of Pittsburgh's most admired citizens, his fellow residents were not all pleased that public money helped to pay for baseball and football stadiums.
Christopher P. Briem, a regional economist with the Center for Social and Urban Research at the University of Pittsburgh, wrote in an e-mail message: "The perception that this was all done against people's wishes has some lasting effects. Couple that with a financial crisis in the city and you get a real mean atmosphere for any projected public support for a new arena. In terms of direct economic impact, it's hard to justify public money for sports venues. The common rejoinder is that the advertising effect of a major sports team is worth public investment. That is nearly impossible to quantify."

Gambling Could Provide Cash
Not everyone is pessimistic. Expressing optimism about the team and offering money to build an arena is Edson R. Arneault, the chairman of MTR Gaming Group. He sponsors the Penguins with arena advertising and runs a resort that includes horse racing and slot machines in Chester, W.Va., about an hour's drive from downtown Pittsburgh.
Arneault said about $60 million toward the cost of a new arena could be raised through gambling if the state of Pennsylvania would grant him a license for thoroughbred racing and slot machines near Pittsburgh. The money would help fill the gap between the $47 million the Penguins say they can invest in an arena and the money the state would provide toward the projected cost of more than $250 million.
"We think it is a win-win situation for Allegheny County," Arneault said.
He has worked with Lemieux for four years as a sponsor and has come to know him. "It's been rough on him because he's not used to the business end of the deal," Arneault said. "He's used to being told he is the greatest hockey player which, arguably, he is. But when you get down to the nuts and bolts of business, it's tough, and he's learning and he's getting a little bit tougher."
Would the N.H.L. approve of gambling revenues to finance a new building? "This is mainstream America right now," Arneault said. "We've taken it out of the back rooms into the front rooms. People are no longer shying away. They're saying, 'Look, we like to gamble.' Gaming is becoming a mainstream industry."
Daly, the N.H.L. executive, was asked what the league thought about the use of gambling money to pay for a new arena. "I don't think we've ever been asked the question," he said, before adding, "I don't think it would be problematic."
Ted Saskin, senior director of the players association, said the Penguins' situation is more complicated than just an arena problem. "They are suffering from the overhang of the last owners' lockout," he said.
Regarding Daly's warm words about revenue sharing, Saskin said: "I'm glad he says that. It's something we feel strongly about." Saskin said that although the union is aware of Pittsburgh's problems, "We're not going to negotiate to the lowest common denominator or the highest."
When the Penguins played with great energy in a 5-3 loss to Philadelphia last Saturday afternoon, they left the ice to a standing ovation from many of the fans in the Igloo.
"Obviously, they liked the way we played," said Ryan Malone, one of the team's best rookies and the first N.H.L. player born in Pittsburgh. "We played hard and the crowd respects us for it. That's the way the town is. We put on a good effort, but, obviously, it's better when you win."

HEADLINE: Legislators Greet Rowland's Speech Politely, but Warily 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Studiously avoiding any mention of the scandals that have plagued his administration, Gov. John G. Rowland unveiled a spending plan Wednesday that seemed intended to please both parties, and earned a polite but cool reception from legislators.
 Mr. Rowland sketched a hopeful portrait of the state's slowly recovering economy and promised to balance a $41 million budget deficit while avoiding both layoffs and cuts in state aid to cities and towns. He even offered new money and support for programs like drug sentencing reform and early education. 
 "For the first time in several years, I'm optimistic about our state budget," Mr. Rowland said, in his annual State of the State address.
But a number of legislators said they felt profoundly uncomfortable as they sat listening to Mr. Rowland, a Republican, who is facing the first impeachment inquiry of a sitting governor in state history.
Most of the lawmakers rose and clapped as he was introduced, and there were none of the rowdy protests that had been predicted.
But while Republican lawmakers gave the governor standing ovations at several points, there was often a cold silence on the Democratic side of the chamber. A number of legislators were absent, and at least two Democrats stayed away as a gesture of protest.
Although Democrats did not find a great deal to dislike in the governor's budget, many of them clearly viewed the speech as little more than an appeal for sympathy. Mr. Rowland punctuated his address by introducing three veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, four students from a New Haven public charter school and an elderly volunteer who works in the state's prisons. To some Democrats, that was a transparent effort to draw applause.
"It certainly was well orchestrated to elicit sympathy for other people which would hopefully be transferable to him," said Kevin B. Sullivan, the Senate president pro tem and a Democrat. "Today was a magnum opus of introductions."
It has been almost two months since Mr. Rowland first admitted he had lied about receiving free gifts and work on his private cottage in Litchfield. Since then, a number of officials have called on him to resign, including some of his fellow Republicans. A House committee was formed last week to decide whether to recommend his impeachment.
The closest Mr. Rowland came to addressing his own precarious position was at the end of the speech, when he said - in an ostensible reference to the state's economic recovery - "Adversity can beat you down, or it can make you stronger."
At that point, the governor's wife, Patricia Rowland, smiled for the first time during the speech.
For most of his 34-minute address, Mr. Rowland emphasized crowd-pleasing topics like providing aid to the families of soldiers killed in battle, providing new assistance to the state's smaller cities and an opposition to new casinos. He promised to avoid a possible $55 million cut in state aid to cities and towns.
He also included several items that could be seen as olive branches to Democrats, who control both houses of the legislature. He received a standing ovation when he promised to look at prison reform efforts that have been championed by Representative Bill Dyson, a Democrat, saying, "it's time to put greater emphasis on substance abuse treatment and prisoner re-entry programs." He also promised new money to remove 750 people from a waiting list to get into group homes run by the state's Department of Mental Retardation, and he spoke of financing a transportation initiative proposed by House Speaker Moira K. Lyons. 
Mr. Rowland is better placed to afford new spending than he was a year ago, when a huge budget deficit led to bitter struggle with legislators that lasted for months. The legislators agreed on a two-year budget, and Mr. Rowland now has the luxury of tinkering with that agreement rather than seeking a substantially new spending plan.
The speech also included some more controversial items. Although the governor said he would not raise any income or business taxes, he proposed to raise cigarette taxes to $2.05 from $1.51 per pack, which would tie Connecticut with New Jersey for the highest rate. He also proposed increased taxes on chewing tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
Lawmakers from both parties expressed doubt about the idea.
"I don't think those taxes are going to go anywhere," Ms. Lyons said. "I don't think my caucus is going to support them, and the Republicans say they aren't going to support any taxes."
She and other leading Democrats also said they would oppose another item in the budget: a school voucher program for 500 students in low-performing schools that would cost the state $1.5 million.
To many, the budget proposals were overshadowed by the anxious drama of the governor's appearance in a house full of angry and skeptical lawmakers.
"I really wasn't sure how it was going to be, and I was nervous," said Senator Judith Freeman, one of 11 Republican senators who has called on the governor to resign. But she added, "It was a good speech - a little bit of everything."

HEADLINE: Bush Expected to Endorse Amendment on Marriage 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
President Bush condemned the Massachusetts court ruling on gay marriage on Wednesday, and conservative groups said the White House had informed them that the president would soon endorse efforts to pass an amendment to the United States Constitution defining marriage to be between a man and a woman.
 Mr. Bush, in a statement issued by the White House on Wednesday night, stopped just short of explicitly backing a change to the Constitution, but left little doubt that he is heading in that direction. 
 The ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court "is deeply troubling," Mr. Bush said. 
"Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman," he said. "If activist judges insist on re-defining marriage by court order, the only alternative will be the constitutional process. We must do what is legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage."
Conservative activists who have been in touch with the White House on the issue said they now had no doubt that Mr. Bush had made up his mind to back their call for a constitutional amendment.
"After conversations in recent days with the appropriate people, I have absolutely no doubt the president will in fact take this step in order to ensure that marriage in the United States remains between a man and a woman," said Gary Bauer, the conservative activist who was a Republican presidential candidate in 2000.
Mr. Bauer, who spent the last two days in meetings with conservative groups to develop a strategy for pushing an amendment, said he expected Mr. Bush to make an announcement "sooner rather than later."
Glenn T. Stanton, a policy analyst for the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, said its founder, Dr. James C. Dobson, heard in a conversation on Tuesday night with the president's senior adviser, Karl Rove, that Mr. Bush had decided to back an amendment.
"We heard last night that President Bush is going to come out very clearly advocating the passage of a federal marriage amendment and he is looking for the opportunity to do that," Mr. Stanton said on Wednesday. "It is not a question of if but when."
As the issue has raced through the courts in Massachusetts and other states -- and risen to the top of the agenda of conservative groups, thereby becoming a more pressing political issue for him -- Mr. Bush has moved step by step since last summer toward supporting a federal constitutional amendment. 
White House officials would not confirm that Mr. Bush had made up his mind, but they said they would not discourage reporters from drawing the conclusion that the Massachusetts ruling was exactly what Mr. Bush was thinking of when he warned in his State of the Union address last month about judges ignoring the will of the people on the issue.
"If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process," Mr. Bush said in the State of the Union speech.
Mr. Bush has tried since becoming governor of Texas to position himself as a new kind of conservative who can appeal to the political center. His statements on gay marriage have always been carefully respectful of gay men and women, and his reluctance to throw his weight behind an amendment reflected in part a desire not to alienate moderate voters.
Many social conservatives, though, have been impatient with the president on the issue, pressing him to take a stand. Mr. Bush's conservative base is especially important to him in this election year because his political strategists say that his re-election could hinge much more on his ability to turn out the vote among conservative voters than on winning over a diminishing pool of more moderate swing voters. 
There have been signs of restlessness among conservatives over Mr. Bush's willingness in the past few years to support or agree to substantial increases in government spending. The White House is trying to head off that discontent, and the budget Mr. Bush sent to Congress on Monday calls for sharp restraint on federal spending.
But while economic conservatives and the groups that represent them in Washington tend to make their case loudly and forcefully, White House officials have always been more concerned about religious and social conservatives at the grass-roots level. Mr. Rove has fretted publicly on a number of occasions about Mr. Bush's failure to motivate more evangelical Christians to vote in the 2000 election, saying millions of them stayed home that year.
With the Massachusetts ruling, some conservative leaders said, Mr. Bush and other politicians have little choice politically but to get behind an amendment.
"As of today, there is no gray area at all, no area behind which they can hide," said Sandra Rios, president of Concerned Women for America, a conservative group.
The constitutional amendment most likely to win the backing of Mr. Bush and conservative groups is one that has already been introduced in Congress. The House version, sponsored by Representative Marilyn Musgrave, Republican of Colorado, states: "Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution or the Constitution of any state, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."

HEADLINE: THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: THE NORTH CAROLINA SENATOR; 
Edwards Campaigns in the South, but Looks Beyond, Too

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Feb. 4 

 BODY:
With little rest and a raspy voice but a bounce in his step from his primary successes, Senator John Edwards on Wednesday rushed on to Tennessee and Virginia, which will hold the next primaries crucial to his candidacy.
 At the same time, behind the scenes, his aides wrestled with how to convince voters beyond the South that Mr. Edwards, who is from North Carolina, could compete and stand as the sole challenger to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the leading candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The campaign has all but ruled out the Michigan caucus on Saturday and had no plans to compete in Washington State, which also has a caucus on Saturday. 
 Instead, Mr. Edwards, turning his eye to the Wisconsin primary on Feb. 17, began broadcasting a commercial there Wednesday, while sending staff members there to lay the groundwork for what his strategist believe will be a pivotal showdown. The campaign announced that Mr. Edwards would visit Milwaukee on Saturday.
But the need to keep pace with fund-raising intruded on Mr. Edwards's schedule. He attended fund-raisers in New York City and New Jersey on Wednesday night but sought to make the most of his time with an appearance on CBS-TV on "The Late Show With David Letterman" to read the Top 10 list. (The No. 1 answer to things never before said by a presidential candidate: "Read my lips, no new wardrobe malfunctions.")
Wednesday was also a day to play up the results from Tuesday night, when Mr. Edwards won the South Carolina primary and came close to winning in Oklahoma. He sought to portray the race as already down to two or three candidates.
"This is a very fluid race," Mr. Edwards said at a news conference after speaking in Memphis. "It looks like it's narrowed down to two, or maybe three, candidates. And I think if it's two, it's myself and Senator Kerry. I'll let General Clark argue for whether he should be No. 3."
Mr. Edwards is counting on a boost in momentum from anticipated triumphs in here and in Tennessee, and he plans to campaign in both states every day leading up to the primary. He began broadcasting two commercials in the two states Wednesday, including one that focused on the theme of "two Americas" divided by class, which his campaign says helped with his recent successes.
Mindful of Tennessee's early voting option, he issued a plea at a rally in Memphis: "I came here today to ask any of you who have not yet voted to go from this place and go vote and vote for John Edwards. I need you. I need your family, your friends, every person you can touch."
At a rally at Norfolk State University, Mr. Edwards broke from his standard remarks and warned that the country's "economic security" was imperiled by the transfer of jobs overseas. With polls showing voters concerned about the economy, Mr. Edwards plans to highlight proposals every day to reverse job loss.
"Protecting America also means protecting America's economic security," Mr. Edwards said, his voice cracking from lingering bronchitis. 
He attacked what he called the exorbitant growth of corporate executive pay and the practice of some American companies moving operations overseas, suggesting that President Bush has not done enough about either.
"This president is putting our economic security at risk every single day," Mr. Edwards said. "The very idea that we have a million plus jobs leaving America and going overseas endangers our economic security."
He added: "Twenty years ago, we all listened, when we were worried about what was happening to some of our automobile manufacturers, we listened to the refrain, buy American. Why don't we hire American?"
It was also clear Mr. Edwards would aim for the votes of African-Americans. Norfolk State, where he spoke on Wednesday, is a historically black college, and he planned a visit to another one, Tennessee State University in Nashville, on Thursday.
And it was apparent that more than anything, Mr. Edwards plans to play up his natural appeal to Southerners. He may have a slight edge in that regard in Tennessee and Virginia.
He lived in Nashville from 1978 to 1981, working at a law firm not long after graduating from law school at the University of North Carolina. He and his wife, Elizabeth, had their first child, Wade, there before moving to Raleigh, N.C. Mrs. Edwards, also a lawyer, lived in Virginia from 1977 to 1978 while a law clerk to a federal judge.
Still, Mr. Edwards's campaign struggled to overcome Mr. Kerry's solidifying position as the front-runner, a powerful magnet for undecided voters. Exit polls in South Carolina showed that voters who chose Mr. Kerry did so in large part because they found him more likely to beat Mr. Bush.

THE scene could not have been more incongruous or telling. There, in a room off the lobby of a hotel in Kohler, Wis., Jackie Autry, who was running the Anaheim Angels for her husband, Gene, walked into the caucus of small-market clubs during the owners' first discussion of revenue sharing in 1993.
 Think of that: the Angels of Anaheim, Calif., a small-market club; Jackie Autry at the table along with the owners of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Kansas City Royals, the Minnesota Twins and others of legitimately small-market size. Who was going to walk in next, George Steinbrenner? 
 What had Major League Baseball come to in Southern California that the Angels would share a table with teams from cities far smaller than the geographic and demographic area just south of Los Angeles?
The answer was not in the status but in the terminology. Rather than small-market clubs, they were low-revenue clubs, and the Angels had done such a poor job of operating themselves that they had played themselves into a low-revenue club.
To the north, meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers had maintained their status as a high-revenue team. They continued to draw more than three million fans a season, and they continued to spend lavishly on their player payroll. But while the Angels had ground themselves into a low-revenue team, the Dodgers had squandered themselves into a losing team.
Later this month, both teams will enter spring training with new owners. Arturo Moreno, a businessman of Mexican descent, bought the Angels from the Walt Disney Company last May for $182.5 million. Frank McCourt, a Boston real estate developer, bought the Dodgers for $430 million last week from the Fox Entertainment Group, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
They are not starting out even. Seven months before Moreno acquired the Angels, they won the World Series. The Dodgers, on the other hand, have not reached the postseason since 1996 and have not won a postseason game since they won the World Series in 1988. 
Moreno starts ahead in another way. Because he already owned the Angels, he was able to function the way he wanted this winter. He shored up his mediocre lineup by signing right fielder Vladimir Guerrero, and he bolstered the pitching staff by signing Bartolo Colon and Kelvim Escobar, guaranteeing an overall expenditure of $140 million.
McCourt, whose acquisition of the Dodgers was delayed for three months while he got his financing in order, was unable to authorize expenditures that would have improved the National League's weakest offense. The Dodgers, however, did have the league's most effective pitching staff last season.
Both new owners declined the opportunity to discuss their plans, whatever they may be. A spokesman for the Angels said Moreno does not do telephone interviews, and a Dodgers spokesman did not respond to a request to interview McCourt.
The most salient question an inquiring person might ask McCourt is what he can do to revive the vibrant organization the Dodgers were before Murdoch. Peter O'Malley, who sold the team to Fox, was never his father's son in his involvement in Major League Baseball, but few men were able to match Walter O'Malley's brilliance.
At least Peter O'Malley understood what it took to maintain a competitive team; that much he learned from his father. The Dodgers' philosophy was basically to finish in first place every few years and remain competitive in between.
Fox bought the team in 1998 for $311 million and tore up the fabric of the organization, making one mistake by firing the general manager, Fred Claire, who understood the organization, then compounding it by replacing him with Kevin Malone, who promptly pronounced himself "the new sheriff in town" and sent the Dodgers spiraling downward.
The speculation is that McCourt will replace the current general manager, Dan Evans, but it will take some deft moves by Evans or his replacement to turn the Dodgers into a contender this year.
Pat Gillick, who pitched for and graduated from the University of Southern California more years ago than he can remember, would be a natural as the new Dodgers general manager. But having retired three times as a general manager, he said the other day that he was happy living in Toronto and working as a consultant for the Seattle Mariners. 
Billy Beane, the mastermind of the Oakland Aberrations, would be another ideal candidate, but word out of Oakland is that the Athletics' owners won't even let the Dodgers interview him. 
But a decision on a general manager is just one of the moves McCourt has to make. His overall task is to rescue the Dodgers from the Fox plague of ownership, in which the Dodgers suffered the way the Yankees did under CBS ownership in the 1960's.
Baseball officials have portrayed the McCourt purchase as another leg in the return of teams to family ownership, reversing the trend of recent decades in which corporations assumed command of teams. Moreno's ownership of the Angels is cited as another example, even though his silence on the telephone is as enlightening as the baseball views of corporate executives who are clueless when they begin making baseball decisions.
The reality is that the vast majority of teams are currently owned by wealthy individuals -- businessmen, entrepreneurs -- and not corporations. Moreno, for example, had $182.5 million to spend for the Angels because in 1999 he sold his outdoor advertising company for more than $8 billion.
That is not the kind of bankroll previous family ownerships operated on, the Griffiths in Minnesota, for example, but it's the kind of money needed to operate a team in today's economic climate.
If he doesn't already know it, McCourt will quickly learn that fact of baseball economic life. Some people believe he is in over his head financially, but he has been trying to buy a team in recent years -- the Boston Red Sox a few years ago -- and now he has succeeded. 
His ultimate success is another matter.

HEADLINE: Toil, Tears and Sweat in Brooklyn 

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON

 BODY:
After Jesus Colon immigrated to the United States from Puerto Rico in 1917, he worked days and his brother worked nights. The schedule was convenient for a family too poor to afford two pairs of pants. Mr. Colon, who died in 1974 after becoming a writer and political activist, recalled going off to his job every day in clothes that were still warm from his brother's body.
 In the annals of historical moments, the story of Mr. Colon's trousers isn't quite the Battle of Gettysburg. But in the populist rendering of the past now on view at the Brooklyn Historical Society, it's the homely details that matter. The artifacts include a barber's chair from the 1930's and a help-wanted sign from 1915, posted on the side of a replica of a brick building: "Button sewer for overcoats wanted, one flight up." 
 "Brooklyn Works: 400 Years of Making a Living in Brooklyn," which will be on view for the next three to five years, marked the reopening last October of the Historical Society after a $23 million renovation that took four years. 
The striking, 120-year-old building of red terra cotta and brick, at the corner of Clinton and Pierrepont Streets in Brooklyn Heights, has been restored to its original elegance. You can get some idea of why it cost so much in "A Building's Story," a separate exhibition about the renovation. ("Brooklyn Works" shouldn't be confused with the show opening in April at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, "Open House: Working in Brooklyn," an overview of art produced in the borough since the 1970's. The jobs depicted at the Historical Society tend to be grittier, taking place on farms, in sweatshops on the waterfront or in factories.)
The dichotomy between the down-to-earth appeal of "Brooklyn Works" and the exquisite elitism of the building that houses it vividly illustrates the evolution of history museums. This landmark treasure, designed by George B. Post, architect of the New York Stock Exchange building, reflects the aristocratic impulse of 19th-century museum builders.
But "Brooklyn Works" takes the modern, heterogeneous approach of charting history's course by finding significance in ordinary lives.
"We wanted personal stories because that's how people learn history best, by making a personal connection with somebody from the past," said Ann Meyerson, the museum's curator of exhibitions, interviewed in the building's grand library, still looking naked as it waits for some 155,000 volumes to be reshelved later this year, along with piles of manuscripts, maps, periodicals and newspapers. "We had 3,000 square feet and 400 years of history so we had to figure out a way to present it that wouldn't be overwhelming but would be deep."
The influence of television, especially the History Channel, is apparent in this shrewdly produced, viewer-friendly excursion through Brooklyn's labor history. No surprise to learn that Mike Wallace, the Pulitzer-Prize-winning historian, who has frequently worked with the cable television channel, was one of the advisers on the "Brooklyn Works" exhibition.
Sets that might appear on a soundstage recreate an 18th-century farmhouse and a city block from the early 20th century, with audio narrations taken from letters and diaries. The exhibition begins with a kind of reality television show. A cheerful video display of Brooklyn's workers, past and present, it assures visitors that while this may be history, it will not intimidate.
Younger visitors, raised on TV-style-irony, will feel right at home watching a film that Domino Sugar produced in 1920 about its Brooklyn refinery, which began operating in the 1880's, when about 60 percent of the nation's sugar was processed in New York. The film has been supplemented with peppy, yet caustic, commentary on what working conditions were really like (it was boiling hot; it could take three days to get the dust out of your lungs). This part of the exhibition has special resonance since the American Sugar Refining Company, which acquired the Domino plant on the Williamsburg waterfront in 2001, closed the refining operation last week.
Parents may also want to take their families to the temporary exhibition "Let Children Be Children," running through March 7, a poignant collection of 25 photographs taken in the early 20th century by Lewis Hine, a teacher-turned-photographer whose images documented the struggles of immigrant and working-class life. These sobering silver gelatin prints show very young people selling newspapers, shining shoes, toiling in factories. Hine's work led to federal child labor legislation signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938.
"Brooklyn Works" manages to be accessible without glossing over the complexity of a particularly complicated piece of labor history, which turns out to be about immigration patterns as much as about work. 
At the turn of the 20th century, for example, immigrants made up 40 percent of Brooklyn residents, almost the same as their percentage today. But while the borough's newcomers early on originated primarily from England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Africa (by way of slavery), later from Germany, and later still from Eastern and Southern Europe, the family guide to the exhibition indicates the provenance of subsequent waves; it is now available in Arabic, Russian, Spanish and Chinese -- as well as English.
The museum staff was careful to observe another aspect of Brooklyn's changing population, which now includes 850,000 people of African descent. Thirty-four percent of Brooklyn's work force comes from this large group, which had its own history of struggle in entering the universe of established wage earners. "We wanted to show that it was really hard to get work if you were a person of color," said Wendy Aibel-Weiss, vice president for exhibits and education.
The show stresses how the unglamorous field of civil service opened the door to job security and middle-class life for African-Americans. One such beneficiary of the system, a transit worker, explains it like this: "A man couldn't just come and look in your face and say, 'You're black and I don't like you.' "
While the exhibition focuses on the borough's largely uncelebrated laborers, it succumbs to traditional Brooklyn nostalgia for Coney Island and the Dodgers -- celebrating the latter with a blown-up excerpt from an article in The New York Times written by Gay Talese in 1960, about the demise of Ebbets Field. Describing the sledge hammers knocking down the dugout, Mr. Talese wrote: "After 44 years as the home of the Dodgers and a monument to daffiness, the park began to vanish in favor of a proposed 1,317-family middle-income housing project."
Dodger lore was easy. But finding out about the rest was difficult because Brooklyn is Brooklyn, hip in some quarters, perhaps, but still so overshadowed by Manhattan that in a recent episode of "Sex and the City," a move to the borough by one character is considered almost as calamitous as another's breast cancer. So when Ms. Meyerson, the curator, began collecting data five years ago, she discovered that very little research had been devoted to Brooklyn labor history.
She and other researchers met with neighborhood organizations and ethnic groups to take oral histories. They recorded 78 individual stories, which will become part of the museum's archive, and interviewed more than 100 people altogether. They advertised in local newspapers and on the museum's Web site, and were rewarded with an outpouring of artifacts.
A retired chemical engineer, a graduate of Princeton, got in touch to say that his great-grandfather, Archibald Wallace, had been a rope maker in Brooklyn in the 1830's, when rope making was a significant industry. (In a job survey taken in the Village of Brooklyn in 1796, rope maker was one of the most frequently mentioned occupations, along with tavern keeper.)
The great-grandson provided a silver snuffbox, a photograph and a directory with his forebear's name in it. 
Along with kitschy Brooklyn products like bottles of Rheingold beer and Virginia Dare pure vanilla, the museum team uncovered commentary from Francis Woolsey, an Irish immigrant who drove a streetcar in Brooklyn in the 1870's, and Sadie Frowne, a 16-year-old Jewish garment worker from Poland. "The machines go like mad all day," Ms. Frowne said about the sweatshop where she worked in 1902. "Sometimes in my hurry, get mine finger caught and the needle goes right through it." 
Though the rise and decline of the waterfront is chronicled in fine detail, the saga of the Brooklyn Bridge, itself a brutal tale of workers' woe, is absent.
This was a conscious decision by the curators, partly philosophical, partly logistical. "We originally wanted to include the bridge because it's so iconic and everyone wants that story told," Ms. Meyerson said. "If we had 10,000 square feet, we would have included it."
But ultimately she and the other curators decided to risk pulling in an audience without offering a star. They limited their focus to work that connected Brooklyn to the rest of the world, not the local economy -- and they considered construction too local, even construction of one of Brooklyn's most potent symbols. Instead, the protagonists of this story produced more mundane but far-reaching products like textiles, sugar, gum, beer, rope. 
This engaging exhibition reminds us that while occupations may change, some aspects of human toil remain constant. The words of a native son, Alfred Kazin, spoken by an actor evoking the writer's Brownsville childhood in the 1920's, resonate today. Writing about his mother, Kazin observed:: "Work was her life. Work and anxiety."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Once Upon a Time in Central Europe, When Unruly Was the Rule

BYLINE:  By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
Conceptualism, the most easily transportable artistic practice, spread like a highly contagious virus all over the world in the late 1960's and 70's. "Parallel Actions: Conceptual Tendencies in Central European Art From 1965 to 1980," an exhibition at the Austrian Cultural Forum, focuses on that one region where it flourished -- parallel, as the title suggests, to its occurrence elsewhere. 
 The show was organized by Hedwig Saxenhuber and Georg Schoellhammer, who are Viennese curators and magazine editors. Few of the more than a dozen artists represented will be familiar to New Yorkers. Their countries include Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Serbia and Slovenia. Among the participants, Valie Export of Austria, who once famously invited passers-by to feel her breasts inside a cardboard box covering her chest, is the best known in the United States. 
 This show's visual interest is minimal: various forms of paper make up most of what is displayed -- photographs, collages, posters and other printed matter, as well as some grainy, semiabstract films shown on video monitors. There is already a look of antiquity about most of this material. And without a catalog to fill in artistic, social and political backgrounds, much of it remains enigmatic to a contemporary New York viewer.
Still, the show provides an intriguing glimpse of what some radically minded people thought was worth doing in the name of art at a certain moment in history and in places remote from the Western world's major urban art centers.
Among the works on view are black-and-white photographs with typewritten texts documenting absurdist performances by Jiri Kovanda of the Czech Republic, which recall 1960's performances by American artists like Vito Acconci and Adrian Piper. The caption for one picture, of Mr. Kovanda apparently doing nothing in particular, explains that he was performing actions scripted so that passers-by would not realize he was doing an art performance. In another case he rides up an escalator while standing backward and locking eyes with the person behind him.
Some art historical context might help at this point. Conceptualism is a late development in a centuries-old debate about whether artists should be seen as mere artisans or as intellectuals on a par with poets, philosophers and scientists. Modernism advanced the debate by devaluing craft and repositioning the artist as an innovator of ways of seeing and thinking about art, the self, society and the world.
Meanwhile, from modern philosophy, the idea arose that reality is not fixed but is shaped or constructed by the way people think, what they believe and how they describe the world. This gave Conceptualism its traction: if you could change the way people ordinarily think, you could change the world.
And to do that, you needn't do much. Slight but purposeful deviations from ordinary modes of thought or behavior, like those performed by Mr. Kovanda, might conceivably alter whole cultural and social landscapes. It is the art world's version of the butterfly effect.
One instance of this line of thought is Milenko Matanovic's "Collective Fixing of the Point." In the gallery, Mr. Matanovic's work appears as a small photograph of an antique statue on a tall column, with a little circle inscribed just above the statue's head. A text invites people to concentrate on an imaginary point above the statue in Slovenia, the country where the artist lived; this is to be done from 11 a.m. to noon on a certain date and thereby "inscribe the point into the memory of the world." As the artists of the Fluxus movement had come to believe, going from individual imagination to global reality might not be such a great leap.
Another strategy was to focus on art world conventions. For his 1971 exhibition Goran Trbuljak of Croatia simply put up posters announcing, "I do not wish to show anything new and original." In theory, at least, Mr. Trbuljak's Bartlebyesque renunciation would cause viewers to reflect critically and subversively on the arbitrary nature of the art system and its connection to broader, equally arbitrary systems -- academic, economic, governmental and otherwise.
Sanja Ivekovic, a Croatian artist, confronted contemporary politics and power directly in a 1979 performance called "Triangle," documented by photographs and text. The prose explains that while President Tito of Yugoslavia was going by in a motorcade outside Ms. Ivekovic's apartment, she sat on her balcony reading, sipping whiskey and pretending to masturbate in full view of a surveillance officer stationed in a building across the street. The police quickly came to her door and ordered her to stop. What, if any, further consequences followed we are not told.
This is the big question raised by an exhibition of this sort. Unlike paintings and sculptures, which are comparatively self-sufficient, the kind of activities addressed here do not travel well without good supplementary information.
Julius Koller, a Slovakian who invented something called the anti-happening, organized a group of young artists into a Ping-Pong club, founded an organization called U.F.O. (for "Universal Futurological Operations") and continues to make an annual absurd photographic self-portrait as a "U.F.O.-naut." He looks like an artist worth getting to know better, and others may be also.
But without more information about the contexts that these artists worked within and what influence, if any, their works had in the world, one feels more baffled than informed. And the skeptic is allowed too easily to conclude that it all might amount to not very much.

"Parallel Actions: Conceptual Tendencies in Central European Art From 1965 to 1980" remains on view at the Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, through March 20.

HEADLINE: Report Questions Bush Plan For Hydrogen-Fueled Cars 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush's plan for cars running on clean, efficient hydrogen fuel cells is decades away from commercial reality, according to a report by the National Academy of Sciences. 
 Promoting the technology in his State of the Union address a year ago, Mr. Bush said a hydrogen car might be available as the first vehicle for a child born in 2003. On Monday, the Energy Department included $318 million for both fuel cells and hydrogen production in its 2005 budget. "Hydrogen is the next frontier; a hydrogen economy is where the world is headed," said Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy. 
 The Bush administration anticipates mass production of hydrogen cars by 2020. But the academy study, released Wednesday, said some of the Energy Department's goals were "unrealistically aggressive." 
Fuel cells produce electricity by putting hydrogen through a chemical process, rather than burning, and their exhaust consists solely of water and heat. Some scientists think they have great promise, not only because they are clean, but also because the hydrogen can be produced from solar or wind power, thus reducing oil imports and the emission of gases that cause global warming.
But the least-expensive methods of hydrogen production use fuels like coal or natural gas, and those create pollution, experts say. Hydrogen is also difficult to ship and store. In addition, power from fuel cells is far more costly than the same amount of power from a gasoline engine.
"Real revolutions have to occur before this is going to become a large-scale reality," said one of the report's authors, Dr. Antonia V. Herzog, a staff scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It very possibly could happen, but it's not a sure thing."
The report said battery-powered cars or hybrid cars, which use gasoline and electric motors, could turn out to be better choices. And over the next 25 years, the effects of hydrogen cars on oil imports and global-warming gas emissions "are likely to be minor," the report said.
A second pessimistic assessment came from Joseph J. Romm, the chief Energy Department official in charge of conservation and alternative energy in the Clinton administration. His book "The Hype About Hydrogen" will be published this spring.
"Fuel-cell cars will not be environmentally desirable for decades, because there are better uses for the fuels you can make the hydrogen out of," Mr. Romm said in a telephone interview.
Most hydrogen produced today is made from natural gas, he said, and using that gas to make electricity, and thus replace coal-based electric plants, would do more for the environment than using the gas to make hydrogen to replace gasoline. He said society would get more energy from a cubic foot of natural gas burned in a modern gas-powered electric plant than if it was converted to hydrogen.
Mr. Romm also said there is currently no way to deliver the hydrogen to vehicles. "People who want to build 'hydrogen highways' and drive a hydrogen car in 10 or 15 years on a mass scale, are just kidding themselves," he said.
The Bush administration has shifted emphasis from a Clinton-era program to develop hybrid cars into a far more ambitious, long-term project to commercialize fuel cells.
Mr. Abraham, the energy secretary, said he had recently been host of a meeting of energy ministers from around the world, and they agreed that fuel cells offered promise for reducing pollution and dependence on imported energy. "I see it as not only a wise investment for America," Mr. Abraham said, "but really where the world is heading."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Collapse of a Canadian agency amid a fragile economy is a cautionary tale for the industry.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
An agency company based in Toronto, Wolf Group Integrated Communications, which has extensive holdings in the United States, is suddenly unraveling, closing its New York operation and selling or closing all but one of its remaining offices.
 The rapid disappearance of Wolf, which began last Friday in New York, is an unwelcome reminder to Madison Avenue of the fragility of the recovery of the advertising economy that is anticipated this year. 
 "There's always this optimism with advertising agencies, 'If I get one more win, it'll be O.K.,"' Sharon Napier, president and chief executive at the Wolf office in Rochester, said yesterday. 
"I think we all knew it was going to be a very tough year when we saw the financials for the whole network," Ms. Napier said, referring to the offices in Atlanta, Cleveland, New York and Toronto as well as Rochester. "I'm not sure anyone realized it could end so abruptly." 
The problems at Wolf, which had 2002 revenue estimated at $37 million by the trade publication Advertising Age, are being traced to an ambitious expansion during the industry boom in the mid- to late 1990's.
The office in New York was formed in 1998 through the acquisition of a well-known midsize agency, Partners & Shevack, and the office in Atlanta was opened in 1999 by the managers of the Rochester agency to help serve a large client of theirs, Eastman Kodak. 
Wolf "bought a lot of agencies and ran up some good numbers in the good years," said Stan Sutter, associate publisher and editorial director at the Marketing Media Group in Toronto, a division of Rogers Media that publishes Marketing Magazine, the Canadian advertising trade weekly. "But were they really the great properties to buy?"
Gay Haines, worldwide chief executive at Kendall Tarrant, the recruiting company in London that specializes in advertising, said that agency companies like Wolf took part in a buying binge "when acquisitions were the name of the game at any price."
Ms. Haines contrasted that approach to the one taken by agency companies that sought to expand by "buying good businesses at a reasonable price and, more importantly, pick up great talent" when their overexpanded counterparts stumble.
For instance, last week, as Wolf was disintegrating, another company based in Toronto, MDC Partners, was acquiring 60 percent of the Kirshenbaum Bond Creative Network in New York, which owns shops like Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners and Media Kitchen.
Larry Wolf, the chairman of Wolf, who founded the agency company in 1967 with his wife, Mary, said in a statement this week that "this past year was extremely difficult for us financially, which unfortunately led us to this decision" to close and sell so many operations. 
The Cleveland office remains open, Mr. Wolf said in his statement.
In addition to the closing of the New York office, where 50 people worked, Wolf closed its Toronto agency, called Flavor, and sold the Rochester agency along with the Atlanta office to Ms. Napier and other senior managers there. 
Ms. Napier said she and the other managers completed the buyout agreement with Wolf, "which we were hoping to do anyway," last Friday. She will continue as president and chief executive for the Rochester and Atlanta operations, which are being renamed.
Ms. Napier said that she "didn't have any idea the New York office was closing till the afternoon on Friday." 
Nor did the 50 employees there, the trade publication Adweek reported on its Web site. They were told that day of the decision by Paul Kelly, president and chief executive at Wolf, in a visit from Toronto. Days later, Mr. Kelly resigned his posts at Wolf.
For several years, the New York office landed additional assignments from clients as well as gaining new accounts in reviews. But the streak ended last year when the agency came up short in 10 reviews, Adweek.com reported.
Last year, the office also lost the contract to create the Empire State Development Corporation's "I Love New York" tourism campaign, with spending estimated at $8 million a year, as well as the media planning and buying duties on the account for the Scotts Company, the maker of lawn- and garden-care products, with billings estimated at $80 million.
The Wolf New York office did keep the creative assignment for Scotts, which is shifting to an agency being formed by Mike Rogers, who had been executive creative director at Wolf New York.
Gordon Hecker, senior vice president for North American marketing at Scotts in Marysville, Ohio, confirmed a report by Adweek.com that the company would hire Mr. Rogers's new agency, the M.L. Rogers Agency, to handle the creative assignment. 
The fate of other accounts at the New York office when it closed, including the AAMCO automotive-repair chain, Equal sweetener and Mott's food products, is unclear.
The sudden end to Wolf does not seem to daunt an agency executive with expansion on his mind, Scott Goodson, creative partner at StrawberryFrog in Amsterdam, which just opened its first full-service outpost outside the Netherlands, in New York.
"There's room for everybody," Mr. Goodson said, "except for some people."
"The reason we want to come into the States," he added, "is that the greatest brands are in the U.S., and the greatest marketing people, and StrawberryFrog wants to be part of that."
As for the notion that the Wolf executives based in Toronto probably at one time had similar thoughts, Mr. Goodson said that he and his colleagues have "managing more efficiently, faster and better" as foremost on their minds rather than expansion for expansion's sake.

HEADLINE: Shell Says Net Income Fell 19%, And It Offers a Bleak Forecast 

BYLINE:  By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Royal Dutch/Shell reported disappointing year-end results and production forecasts on Thursday while its embattled chairman and chief executive, Sir Philip Watts, said he intended to stay on.
 Shell has been on the defensive since it said on Jan. 9 that its proven reserves were 20 percent less than previously reported. The discrepancy has led investors to look more closely at the company's two-headed capital structure, and the company said on Thursday that it would be willing to re-examine its foundation. 
 But analysts said that willingness, coupled with the weak results and production outlook, comes a bit late. 
"Perception has gone through a seismic shift," said Ivor Pether, head of portfolio construction at Royal London Asset Management. 
Shell, he added, was once seen as "ultraconservative, but very high quality, with lots of good projects out there." 
Shell said that fourth-quarter net income fell 19 percent from a year earlier, to $1.88 billion, because of the costs of shutting refineries and because of write-downs. Analysts had expected $2 billion in net income for the quarter. For the full year, net income was up 35 percent, to $12.69 billion. 
Sir Philip, who is scheduled to retire in June 2005, said in a conference call with reporters that he was determined to stay on and address the company's problems and that he had the wholehearted support of the board. He also said that he would be speaking with investors in coming weeks, and that he was open to changing the structure. 
Shell's predictions on its future oil and gas production were also disappointing. Production is expected to be flat in 2004, then fall in 2005, Shell said, rather than growing 3 percent a year as predicted at the beginning of 2003. 
"At some point, we'll start worrying about them not having enough oil to produce in the future," Mr. Pether said. "They need to boost reserves relative to production by 25 percent." 
Still more negative news could come from the company's refining division. Shell acquired more refining assets when it bought Texaco out of a joint venture in 2001, but has suffered since because crude oil supplies in the United States are dropping. 
The company is planning more sales of the refineries it gained at that time.
"If we don't crack refining, we won't meet our performance targets," Sir Philip said in a meeting Thursday afternoon with investors and analysts, alluding to making the company's refining profitable.
Shell's numbers looked even weaker relative to the industry's recent performance.
In a report on the results titled "Shell Transport and Trading: There are ways to sleep easier," Merrill Lynch analysts wrote, "Over all, a very disappointing set of results, particularly given that Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco last week beat the market consensus by 15 percent and 8 percent, respectively." 
The stock of the two public companies that make up Royal Dutch/Shell fell only slightly on the news, analysts said, because they had already fallen sharply last month after the announcement of lower reserves. Shares of Royal Dutch Petroleum were down 1.32 percent, to 37.50 euros, in Amsterdam. Sharesof Shell Transport and Trading fell 1.92 percent on the London exchange to close at 358.50 pence. 
The Merrill report warned, however, that all the bad news might not yet be priced into Shell's stock. The valuation, the report said, is still not compelling, particularly when Shell's peers like BP and Total are better positioned to benefit from the current economy, and more likely to grow.

HEADLINE: United's Discount Airline Will Fly From Dulles 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Ted, the new low-fare carrier from United Airlines, will begin flights from Washington Dulles International Airport in April, two months after making its initial flight, out of Denver, next Thursday, United officials said yesterday.
 The announcement of new service for Ted came as Delta Air Lines confirmed that its low-fare airline, Song, would pull out of Dulles airport in April. Delta is scaling back its plans for Song, an airline-within-an-airline that began flying a year ago. 
 A third low-fare carrier, ATA, said it would start offering business-class service this summer. ATA is making the move as low-fare carriers increasingly embrace frills and other features to win the business of bargain-seeking travelers. 
Low-fare airlines flew 24 percent of domestic passengers in 2003, according to the Department of Transportation, their largest share to date. Some economists say that the discount carriers could easily take 30 percent of the market within a few years, at the rapid rate they are expanding service.
United, the nation's second-largest carrier behind American Airlines, plans to use Ted as an important part of its effort to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Ted's flights will initially be focused on the West Coast and Florida, using Airbus A320 jets configured in two classes of service, economy and the slightly plusher "economy plus."
Dulles is the only United hub on the East Coast. United said Ted would fly from there to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Tampa in Florida, and to Las Vegas. It expects to have 15 Ted flights a day by May from Dulles. Sean Donohue, the United executive in charge of Ted, said more flights from Dulles would be added if Ted proved successful with passengers in the area. 
In selecting Dulles, the airline is wading into a crowded market for low-fare flights on the Eastern Seaboard. JetBlue Airways already serves the airport, west of Washington in northern Virginia, while Song had started flights there in September.
Yet another new low-fare carrier, Independence Air, is to begin flights from Dulles in November. Independence is owned by Atlantic Coast Airlines, which serves as United's regional carrier on the East Coast. 
But Atlantic Coast is trying to get out of its contract with United, which runs through 2010, and reconstitute itself as a low-fare carrier on its own. 
Just as Ted arrives at Dulles, Song will depart. It is ending its three daily flights from there to Orlando. The jet from that route will be used by Song to fly between New York and Fort Myers, Fla.
Song, which cost Delta $65 million to develop, was meant to appeal to passengers who had been defecting from major carriers in search of cheaper tickets. Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, configured 36 Boeing 757 jets, with 199 seats each, to fly routes from New York to Florida and elsewhere.
But under its new chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, Delta is reviewing its operating structure and in the process has scaled back some expansion plans it had for Song, company officials said this week.
In an interview on Wednesday, Song's president, John N. Selvaggio, said his airline could play an important role as Delta battled low-fare airlines like Southwest and JetBlue for passengers in the East and elsewhere in the United States. Delta is striving to cut costs and is pushing its pilots' union to grant concessions so it can keep pace with the lower labor costs won in recent months by airlines like American and United.
So Delta has postponed plans to expand Song's service from Kennedy International Airport, its main hub. Delta said last week that it would invest $300 million at Kennedy to expand service there but announced only two new flights for Song. 
Mr. Selvaggio said Delta originally envisioned Song as a defensive measure to keep from losing passengers to others. But he said it could be an offensive weapon as well, aimed at passengers who prefer direct flights over the connections that are routine for travelers on Delta.
"What Mr. Grinstein wanted to do was undertake a strategic review" of the kind of service the airline would provide, Mr. Selvaggio said. From now on, he added, Delta would examine its routes to determine whether to offer the service instead on Song. "We want to have a strategy that makes sense," he said.
ATA said yesterday that its business-class seats, which will be introduced in August on its Boeing 737's and 757's, would cost no more than $399 one way. It will also offer upgrades to business class from coach for a modest fee on the day of travel, but has not yet decided how much to charge.
In providing business-class service, ATA, the 10th-largest airline in the United States, will be following the lead of AirTran, which has gotten a warm response to its business- class service. John Happ, senior vice president for marketing of ATA, said the airline expected most of its business-class seats to be sold through the same-day upgrades, a feature also offered by AirTran.
By contrast, Southwest, the largest low-fare carrier and the nation's sixth-largest airline, has so far refused to add features like seat assignments or the audio systems available on Song, JetBlue, AirTran and soon on Ted. It has said it is studying the idea.
Even though many corporations are trying to keep a tight rein on travel budgets, Mr. Happ surmised that travelers would be willing to pay slightly more for a little comfort. "A bag of peanuts and all coach seats is one way to do it, and they clearly have a recipe for success," he said of Southwest.
But he added, "We believe there's a business traveler looking for a very different experience."

HEADLINE: Drug Discount for Elderly May Confuse as Well as Help 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Consumer advocates are warning that millions of elderly Americans will face a bewildering array of new government-approved drug discount cards this spring, and Bush administration officials acknowledge that a major effort will be needed to clear up the confusion.
 Administration officials said yesterday that 106 health industry companies -- an unexpectedly large number -- met a deadline last week for applying to sponsor the new cards. The cards will be available to 10 million Medicare beneficiaries who do not have drug coverage, as a precursor to the prescription drug benefit scheduled to begin in 2006. 
 Industry executives and consumer advocates say that officials have not yet answered many questions about the cards -- how users will go about making the most of the available discounts, for example, or how the cards will mesh with existing drug subsidy programs.
"We're talking about people who are vulnerable economically and who may be taking quite a few medications," said John C. Rother, director of policy and legislative affairs for AARP. "This will be complicated. We need to get clarity, guidance from the administration." 
The applicants include retail pharmacy groups, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other companies. Medicare officials said they would announce the approved sponsors in late March, but companies that specialize in managing drug benefits have already faxed contracts to thousands of pharmacies, urging them to agree to payment terms for the cards.
Each sponsor will offer a unique mix of discounts based on the deals that they cut with drug makers, but Medicare participants will be allowed to have only one government-approved card.
Sponsors will begin marketing the cards in April, enrollment will start in May and officials have promised that pharmacies will start accepting the cards in June. Medicare says that the cards will provide discounts of 10 to 25 percent from retail prices on many drugs.
Companies that have applied to offer cards include the big pharmacy benefit management companies, including Medco Health Solutions, AdvancePCS, Express Scripts and Caremark Rx; health insurers like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna and Wellpoint Health Networks; and pharmacy trade groups, including the National Community Pharmacists Association and the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. As card sponsors, health plans and pharmacy benefit managers hope to get a head start on capturing Medicare customers before 2006, when the cards will be replaced by a government-financed drug benefit under the new law. The sponsors will be closely watched by government officials and patient advocates to ensure that rebates they obtain from drug makers are passed along to Medicare enrollees, as the program requires. 
Pfizer and Eli Lilly, which issue cards offering discounts to low-income people on drugs they make, said that they would make the same discounts available to any holder of a Medicare drug card who meets their income limits. A spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline said the company would continue to offer its own discount card as well as the TogetherRx card that it sponsors with seven other manufacturers.
Officials of the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that they were working at a breakneck pace to meet the program's timetable.
"It's important that we get information out in a way that people will understand it," said Leslie V. Norwalk, acting deputy administrator of the agency, which has lost several of its top officials to private industry since the passage of the new Medicare law last November. "It's critical that we educate as many Medicare beneficiaries as we can possibly reach."
No one knows how many competing cards will be available in a given city or state, but residents of big cities are likely to face complicated choices. "If there are 30 or 40 card sponsors in the New York area, including chain drugstores and insurers, it is going to be really hard to compare card to card in a way that will make sense to a lot of people," Mr. Rother said.
According to Ms. Norwalk, consumers will be able to use the Medicare Web site, www.medicare.gov, to compare prices of 209 classes of drugs offered through cards available in their ZIP code. Card sponsors will be required to cover those classes of drugs.
But only 6.5 million, or about 19 percent, of Americans 65 and older have access to the Internet at home or work, according to comScore Media Metrix, an Internet research firm. And in December, fewer than one-half of 1 percent of those looked at the Medicare site, where basic information about the cards is available. 
"They talk like everybody is a technology specialist," said John M. Rector, senior vice president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent drugstores and worries that their competitors, the pharmacy benefit managers, will use the program to build enrollment in mail-order drug plans. "Not everybody can do those things."
The drugstores, not surprisingly, have a different strategy. They plan to urge Medicare customers to enroll in a pharmacy-sponsored card plan, which will offer 90-day supplies and counseling by pharmacists and will stress lower-cost generic drugs. 
Ms. Norwalk at Medicare agreed that it would be "confusing for a beneficiary" to decide which of many possible discount cards to use. 
Medicare participants are permitted to have only one Medicare-approved card, for which the sponsor can collect a maximum $30 annual fee, but "the number of other cards they have is up to the individual," she said. "We hope the pharmacy can help the beneficiary figure it out." Participants can switch Medicare-approved cards once over the program's lifetime.
Companies applying to be card sponsors through Medicare must arrange networks of conveniently located pharmacies, but pharmacies do not have to accept the Medicare cards.
"The reimbursements are very poor," said Russell Gelles, owner of the Apthorp Pharmacy on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "A lot of pharmacists are taking a wait-and-see attitude" before deciding whether to accept the cards.
Many health care companies say the new cards will be good for business. "The government expects to spend $1.8 trillion on drugs over the next 10 years," said Alan Spielman, general manager of federal programs at Medco Health Solutions, a big pharmacy benefit manager. "It is a major growth opportunity for us."
David B. Snow Jr., chief executive of Medco, said he expected that drug makers would agree to sizable rebates for the Medicare program, resulting in lower prices for consumers than through other discount programs.
"The manufacturers are under pressure to provide access to their drugs to people who can't afford them," said Barbara A. Ryan, a drug analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. "They want to prevent the government from stepping in with price controls on drugs some day."
The annual fee for the card will be waived for an estimated 4.5 million low-income Medicare enrollees, and they will be eligible for a $600 credit to use toward discounted drugs. 
But in the past it has been difficult to enroll all those eligible for low-income health programs. Consumer advocates say that some low-income people may be better off sticking with coverage from subsidized drug programs in states like New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
People also may be able to save money by buying drugs from Canada, experts said, though the Bush administration, under pressure from American drug makers and distributors, has warned about safety and quality issues with such drug imports, which are illegal. 
"It's going to be near impossible to make an informed choice," said Diane Archer, a policy expert at the Medicare Rights Center, a patient advocacy organization that has posted questions and answers about the program on its own Web site, www.medicarerights.org.

STRAUS, PHILIP A. SR.

 BODY:
 STRAUS--Philip A. Sr. Of Mamaroneck, NY died on February 4, 2004 at the age of 88. Born in New York City in 1915 to Albert and Hilda Fisher Straus, Mr. Straus was a graduate of Fieldston High School and Harvard University, majoring in Economics. After serving in Italy with the US Army Air Force in WW II, he joined the firm of Neuberger & Berman where he became a Senior Partner and Investment Manager, and excelled for more than 50 years until retiring at the age of 84. An extraordinary businessman, he was a world traveler, adventurer, and lover of the arts, history, politics, skiing, tennis, and sailing. A lifelong philanthropist, he was an ardent supporter of early childhood education, a rational defense policy, and the visual arts. He was the loving husband of Lynn (Gross) for 54 years, the devoted father of Philip A. Jr. (Margaret Harris), Donald (Carol Goss) and Katherine, cherished grandfather of Miriam, Peter, Elizabeth, and Sarah as well as a dear uncle of Jane WeinbergButcher. His sister Bella Weinberg predeceased him. The family is receiving visitors Friday evening and Saturday and Sunday afternoons (Feb. 6-8). A memorial service is tentatively scheduled for 2PM on February 29 at the Ethical Culture Society of Westchester, 7 Saxon Wood Rd., White Plains, NY. To confirm the date and time, please call 914 948-1120 or check www.ethicalsocie tywestchester.org/ events.htm.

STRAUS -- Philip A. The Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni of Bank Street College of Education mourn the passing of Philip A. Straus. Phil began his involvement with Bank Street in 1958, eventually joining the Board of Trustees, where he served until 1986 when he was elected to serve as a Life Trustee, the Board's highest honor. He has been a spirited advocate and champion for Bank Street and the students we serve on our campus and beyond. Together with his wife Lynn, a Bank Street alumna, Phil helped Bank Street to meet many of its ambitious goals and to improve education for all children. We are extremely fortunate to have benefitted from his leadership, wise counsel and friendship over the past four decades. "He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again." The entire Bank Street Community joins together in offering condolences to Lynn, his beloved wife, and the entire Straus family. Augusta Souza Kappner, President Sue Kaplan, Chair, Board of Trustees
STRAUS--Philip. With deepest sorrow Neuberger Berman marks the passing of our retired partner Philip Straus. He embodied the spirit of integrity in the pursuit of excellence that is the foundation of our firm's culture. He was one of our first partners, joining Roy Neuberger in 1947, and the two men remained deepest friends. For many years, he was our leading investment manager for client accounts. He was not only a shrewd investor but also an insightful businessman, and his leadership enabled us to grow as a firm and to thrive in changing times. Most of all, his ethics, his humanity, his philanthropic generosity, and his willingness to teach are what enabled our firm's success. We will miss him, as will his many clients. Our condolences go out to his wife Lynn and his family, and all the people who were touched by his achievements. The employess of Neuberger Berman
STRAUS--Philip. The Board of Trustees and staff of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services acknowledge with great sorrow the death of Philip Straus, an ardent and generous supporter of JBFCS and its Institute for Infants, Children & Families.

Kaplan, Chairman of the Board Alan B. Siskind, Ph.D. Executive VP and CEO Rebecca Shahmoon Shanok, MSW, Ph.D., Director, Institute for Infants, Children & Families

HEADLINE: Tuning Out The G.O.P.'s Siren Song 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Maybe it's too much to hope for. But I wonder if we aren't watching the beginning of a decline in the effectiveness of the Republican Party's divide-and-conquer strategy.
 For nearly half a century the G.O.P. has displayed an unparalleled mastery of the ugly art of devising campaigns that appeal to the very worst in us. It's always the whites against the blacks, the middle class against the poor, the conservatives against the hated liberals, with the word "liberal" spat out with the kind of disgust that's usually reserved for child molesters. 
 The party's at it again this year with talk of defacing the Constitution with its first discriminatory amendment, a ban on gay marriage.
But there are other currents moving through this election season that may tend to pull some diverse segments of the population closer together politically. For example, there are few things worse for a president seeking re-election than large numbers of jobless voters. Even in a state as solidly pro-Bush as South Carolina, the No. 1 issue on the minds of voters is a staggering loss of jobs.
Neal Thigpen, a political science professor at Francis Marion University in Florence, S.C., said he believes that President Bush will carry the state easily in the fall. But he told me: "I don't think Bush will do as well as he did four years ago. I think his stock is down a little. I'm not gonna kid you."
The Bush tax cuts and the turnaround in the economy have been a boon to folks at the high end of the economic ladder. The Wall Street Journal ran an article on Wednesday about the resurgence of lavish spending by the investment crowd. It featured accounts of giddy highfliers getting married at the palace of Versailles, stepping up their purchases of Porsches, Lamborghinis and Rolls-Royces, and exhibiting "a renewed appetite for chartered jets."
At the same time, the underclass and the middle class are increasingly facing similar predicaments: job losses, hard times and an extremely uncertain future.
The blows are coming from myriad directions. On Tuesday The Times's Milt Freudenheim wrote: "Employers have unleashed a new wave of cutbacks in company-paid health benefits for retirees, with a growing number of companies saying that retirees can retain coverage only if they are willing to bear the full cost themselves."
Anxiety about jobs and the economy may be knitting together voters who in past years felt they had little in common.
Another broad issue that increasing numbers of voters are coalescing around is President Bush's credibility problems. There were no weapons of mass destruction. So why have we sacrificed the lives of more than 500 American troops and thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians? What was the noble cause for which they died?
On the home front, Mr. Bush has come up with a budget that is so irresponsible and deceitful it has rattled public officials and ordinary voters on the right and the left. (The Times, in an editorial headline, called it "The Pinocchio Budget.") As presented, the budget would jack up military spending by 7 percent, to $26.5 billion. But that figure does not include the money needed to cover the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We'll get those numbers later. After the election.
What the budget does include are additional tax breaks for the wealthy, along with proposals that would deal potentially crippling blows to government support for education, environmental protection, veterans programs, low-income housing, child care and the like.
What seems to be unsettling to large numbers of voters (not just hard-core anti-Bush Democrats) is the notion that events are slipping -- or have slipped -- out of control, that there is no endgame in Iraq, no plan to rein in runaway deficits, no strategy to put Americans back to work, and no limit to the Bush administration's willingness to shower its friends with favors and public dollars.
The Democratic primaries and caucuses have drawn record turnouts and sparked genuine excitement. Republicans are expressing concern that the administration has been thrown on the defensive. Already there is an attempt by the G.O.P. to divert attention from the real issues by chanting incessantly about gay marriages and the fact that John Kerry is -- uh-oh -- a liberal from Massachusetts.
That would be a travesty, and I hope the voters don't allow it.

HEADLINE: Get Me Rewrite! 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Right now America is going through an Orwellian moment. On both the foreign policy and the fiscal fronts, the Bush administration is trying to rewrite history, to explain away its current embarrassments.
 Let's start with the case of the missing W.M.D. Do you remember when the C.I.A. was reviled by hawks because its analysts were reluctant to present a sufficiently alarming picture of the Iraqi threat? Your memories are no longer operative. On or about last Saturday, history was revised: see, it's the C.I.A.'s fault that the threat was overstated. Given its warnings, the administration had no choice but to invade. 
 A tip from Joshua Marshall, of www.talkingpointsmemo.com, led me to a stark reminder of how different the story line used to be. Last year Laurie Mylroie published a book titled "Bush vs. the Beltway: How the C.I.A. and the State Department Tried to Stop the War on Terror." Ms. Mylroie's book came with an encomium from Richard Perle; she's known to be close to Paul Wolfowitz and to Dick Cheney's chief of staff. According to the jacket copy, "Mylroie describes how the C.I.A. and the State Department have systematically discredited critical intelligence about Saddam's regime, including indisputable evidence of its possession of weapons of mass destruction."
Currently serving intelligence officials may deny that they faced any pressure -- after what happened to Valerie Plame, what would you do in their place? -- but former officials tell a different story. The latest revelation is from Britain. Brian Jones, who was the Ministry of Defense's top W.M.D. analyst when Tony Blair assembled his case for war, says that the crucial dossier used to make that case didn't reflect the views of the professionals: "The expert intelligence experts of the D.I.S. Defense Intelligence Staff were overruled." All the experts agreed that the dossier's claims should have been "carefully caveated"; they weren't.
And don't forget the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans, created specifically to offer a more alarming picture of the Iraq threat than the intelligence professionals were willing to provide.
Can all these awkward facts be whited out of the historical record? Probably. Almost surely, President Bush's handpicked "independent" commission won't investigate the Office of Special Plans. Like Lord Hutton in Britain -- who chose to disregard Mr. Jones's testimony -- it will brush aside evidence that intelligence professionals were pressured. It will focus only on intelligence mistakes, not on the fact that the experts, while wrong, weren't nearly wrong enough to satisfy their political masters. (Among those mentioned as possible members of the commission is James Woolsey, who wrote one of the blurbs for Ms. Mylroie's book.)
And if top political figures have their way, there will be further rewriting to come. You may remember that Saddam gave in to U.N. demands that he allow inspectors to roam Iraq, looking for banned weapons. But your memories may soon be invalid. Recently Mr. Bush said that war had been justified because Saddam "did not let us in." And this claim was repeated by Senator Pat Roberts, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee: "Why on earth didn't Saddam let the inspectors in and avoid the war?" 
Now let's turn to the administration's other big embarrassment, the budget deficit. 
The fiscal 2005 budget report admits that this year's expected $521 billion deficit belies the rosy forecasts of 2001. But the report offers an explanation: stuff happens. "Today's budget deficits are the unavoidable result of the revenue erosion from the stock market collapse that began in early 2000, an economy recovering from recession and a nation confronting serious security threats." Sure, the administration was wrong -- but so was everyone.
The trouble is that accepting that excuse requires forgetting a lot of recent history. By February 2002, when the administration released its fiscal 2003 budget, all of the bad news -- the bursting of the bubble, the recession, and, yes, 9/11 -- had already happened. Yet that budget projected only a $14 billion deficit this year, and a return to surpluses next year. Why did that forecast turn out so wrong? Because administration officials fudged the facts, as usual.
I'd like to think that the administration's crass efforts to rewrite history will backfire, that the media and the informed public won't let officials get away with this. Have we finally had enough?

HEADLINE: Rise in Workers' Productivity Slowed to 2.7% Last Quarter 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
American workers' productivity grew at a 2.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Labor Department reported yesterday, well down from the previous quarter's heated pace though slightly higher than expectations. 
 Productivity, a measure of how much an employee produces for each hour of work, slowed from a 9.5 percent pace in the third quarter, the report said. Analysts had expected a 2.5 percent increase. 
 A separate report showed that initial claims for unemployment benefits rose last week after reaching a three-year low.
Companies added 144,000 workers in the fourth quarter and hours worked rose the most in three years, suggesting that businesses were no longer depending solely on gains in efficiency to meet demand. 
"We saw companies finally needing to increase the number of hours worked after cutting hours and workers through the prior three years," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Investment Services in St. Louis. "This is a trend we will likely see followed in 2004. Companies will need to ramp up hiring."
And a Federal Reserve governor, Ben S. Bernanke, said in a speech yesterday that economic growth of more than 4 percent this year "is not at all unreasonable." Productivity gains, Mr. Bernanke said, would restrain inflation and provide room for interest-rate setters to "be patient" in the next six months.
Even at a slowed pace last quarter, the rise in productivity was enough to cause unit labor costs, or the amount paid for each unit of production, to fall 1.3 percent annually. 
For all of last year, productivity rose 4.2 percent after a 4.9 percent increase in 2002. The two-year average was the largest since 1950-51.
William Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services, said, "Corporate profits are rising fast, and that normally is a predictor of companies' willingness to spend on both equipment and new hires."
The average number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment insurance fell last month, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims last week rose 17,000, to 356,000, which may have reflected construction layoffs from snowstorms in several parts of the country, a department spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Finance Chiefs to Chide Bush on Deficit 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
When the United States opens a two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations on Friday, the Bush administration will come under fire for a plunging dollar and a surging budget deficit.
 Though officially still committed to a strong dollar, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is fending off European leaders who fear that the dollar has fallen so far against the euro that European exports will soon be in jeopardy. 
 The dollar has lost more than one-quarter of its value against the euro over the last year, and it has declined to a three-year low against the yen despite intervention by the Bank of Japan to keep the yen from rising. 
The weak dollar has provided a big lift to American exporters, because it makes American products cheap in other markets. Exports shot up 19.1 percent in the last three months of 2003, and all signs point to further increases ahead. 
"They are delighted with the cheap dollar, because the cheap dollar creates jobs in an election year at the expense of foreigners, who don't vote," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic forecasting business in Valhalla, N.Y.
Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, predicted Thursday that the trend on exports would continue. "The dollar has come down, and I think that will pass through over time to a strengthening of our export markets and will help us recover some of this trade deficit that we have been facing," Mr. Bernanke said in a speech in South Carolina, Reuters reported.
Mr. Bernanke gave a mostly optimistic assessment of the economy and said the Fed had the luxury to be patient about any increase in interest rates because of low inflation.
At its last meeting in late January, the Fed left the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at just 1 percent, but retreated from its promise to keep rates low for "a considerable period."
At the same time, President Bush's new budget proposal has convinced many traders that the federal budget deficit will remain quite high for years to come and that the United States will be an even bigger borrower of foreign money than it already is.
New details about Mr. Bush's budget suggest that the deficit will not decline by half over five years, as the administration has predicted, even though cuts to domestic programs will be even deeper than first imagined.
Among other things, the White House has proposed a new tax credit for uninsured people to buy catastrophic health insurance. The measure would reduce revenue by $65 billion over 10 years, but the administration listed the cost as zero because it promised that it would find -- though it did not spell out -- other ways to offset the credit's expense.
President Bush has vowed to reduce the deficit to $237 billion in 2009 from $521 billion this year. But that estimate does not include the cost of keeping troops in Iraq or the tax changes the administration supports that would cost at least $2 trillion over the next 10 years. 
European leaders are fretting that the combined impact of the United States' budget and trade deficits will hurt their growth.
"The twin deficits are a concern in this respect," Ernst Welteke, president of Germany's central bank, said in a speech earlier this week. "The domestic causes of these imbalances need to be addressed."
European countries like Germany and France have budget deficits that are at least proportionate to that of the United States. But that has not prevented European leaders from complaining about the United States' rising indebtedness to the rest of the world.
Senior Treasury officials say the budget deficits have had little or no effect on the trade deficit or on interest rates. The real problem, they contend, is that Europe and Japan need to speed their own growth to rates closer to those of the United States.
But the declining dollar could make the budget deficits more expensive to finance. Foreign investors, and foreign central banks in particular, have been the biggest buyers by far of United States Treasury securities, and the weakening of the dollar reduces the value of those holdings. 
Last year, analysts estimate that the Japanese government bought about $200 billion in American securities, largely as a way to prop up the dollar in relation to the yen. In January, the Japanese intervened even more extensively, buying up about $67 billion.
But a sharp drop in the dollar reduces the value of American securities held by the central banks as well as by foreign private investors. To the extent that foreign demand for Treasury securities wanes, the United States will be forced to offer higher interest rates to finance its borrowing.
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a policy research group in Washington, said the Bush administration was feeling little remorse.
"The administration wants a continued gradual orderly decline in the dollar, and the Europeans want to stop the rise in the euro," Mr. Bergsten said. American and European leaders would like to see the Japanese reduce their intervention and the Chinese relax their policy of locking their own currency, the yuan, at a fixed exchange rate to the dollar.
Regardless of what the administration does, analysts predict that the dollar will continue to fall for some time. The United States is now running a current-account deficit of $500 billion a year, or 5 percent of the gross domestic product. The current account is the broadest measure of trade and financial balances with the rest of the world. 
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has called that imbalance unsustainable. A drop in the dollar serves as an automatic adjustment mechanism, making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
But some analysts predict that investors are now so pessimistic about the dollar that they could push it down much further if the Group of 7 countries show willingness to stem the decline.
Investors will be closely watching the communique issued by the finance ministers on Saturday. At the last meeting, the group helped depress the value of the dollar by issuing a united call for greater "flexibility" in exchange rates -- a message intended to pressure Asian nations, especially China, to allow their currencies to rise in value.
This time, European ministers would like some kind of acknowledgment that the dollar has fallen enough. 
They would also like to drop the word "flexibility," with its implication of letting the dollar float to whatever level set by the market.
Larry Greenberg, an international economist at Reid, Thunberg, an investment advisory firm, said the differences between Mr. Snow and his counterparts would not be easy to smooth over.
"The irreconcilable differences are clear," Mr. Greenberg said. "The Europeans have staked out a position that the weak dollar is the Americans' fault. The American view is that they don't really care."

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Future Colored By a Flirtation With Citigroup 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank, emerging from a top-to-bottom overhaul of its operations, announced an ambitious new profit target on Thursday. But news of a brief flirtation with Citigroup overshadowed the optimistic outlook.
 Deutsche Bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, met with Citigroup executives in New York in mid-January to explore the possibility of a deal, executives close to the discussions said. While those discussions were preliminary and general in nature, they followed a meeting that the chairman of Citigroup, Sanford I. Weill, had with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany in Berlin last summer. Mr. Weill sounded out Mr. Schroder on how the government would respond to a takeover, according to an executive close to the situation. 
 The Financial Times reported on Thursday that Deutsche Bank had broached, then ended talks, about a deal with Citigroup, because of Mr. Ackermann's worries about its political fallout in Germany.
Talk of a merger comes at an awkward time for Deutsche Bank, given that Mr. Ackermann is on trial on charges of improper bonus payments. And the talk raises questions about the bank's future even as it is beginning to reap benefits from the economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as from its own internal cost-cutting regimen. Deutsche Bank, Germany's financial flagship, is seen as a main player in any reshuffling of the European banking landscape. 
On Thursday, Mr. Ackermann declined to comment on the Financial Times article, saying that the bank was not now in negotiations with anyone, and insisting that it was not vulnerable to an unsolicited offer.
"I do not expect a hostile takeover, and we are not ready for a friendly one," Mr. Ackermann said to reporters after a news conference in Frankfurt.
"First we want to show what we can do," he said.
What Deutsche Bank can do is leverage its dominant position in Germany, Europe's largest economy, as well as its investment banking, asset management, and trading businesses in London and New York. For a foreign bank intent on breaking into Germany's vast but fragmented market, analysts say, Deutsche Bank offers perhaps the only worthwhile entree. 
And Deustche Bank is no stranger to trans-Atlantic deals, having acquired Bankers Trust for $10 billion in 1999
Shares of Deutsche Bank rose 2.5 percent on Thursday, to $80.20, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in Frankfurt, its shares rose 1.4 percent. 
Deutsche Bank currently has a market value of nearly $47 billion -- a steep price tag, but one Citigroup could swallow. Still, while Citigroup was known for its aggressive deal-making under Mr. Weill, it has been pursuing smaller acquisitions in recent years. Its biggest deal in recent years was its acquisition of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, Mexico's second-largest bank, for $12.5 billion in 2001.
The January talks between the banks appear to have been quite preliminary, with executives noting that Mr. Ackermann has spoken to executives from other American banks as well. Germany has been rife with rumors about bank deals, now that its economy has sputtered to life and its banks are regaining a semblance of health. Deutsche Bank, as the nation's leading financial institution, figures high on the list of targets for foreign banks eager to break into the German market.
For Mr. Ackermann, a Swiss-born investment banker, the speculation about Deutsche Bank's future comes as he stands trial in Dusseldorf. He and other former directors of the telecommunications conglomerate Mannesmann are accused of paying improper bonuses to its executives amid a takeover battle with the Vodafone Group of Britain.
If the court convicted Mr. Ackermann, he would almost certainly have to resign, which analysts say would hobble Deutsche Bank at a time of potentially seismic change in the banking industry.
Adding to Deutsche Bank's headaches, the bank's former chief executive and its current board chairman, Rolf E. Breuer, is being sued in the United States on allegations that public comments he made about the debt-ridden media empire of Leo Kirch helped precipitate its collapse.
Some rivals of Deutsche Bank said its public resistance to a takeover, and its suggestion that one might meet political hurdles, was intended to buy time until these legal distractions were cleared up.
Indeed, industry analysts and bankers said they were doubtful that a friendly takeover of Deutsche Bank would raise political alarms. 
And Deutsche Bank's German roots are becoming more tenuous, in any event. At Mr. Ackermann's financial presentation on Thursday, half the senior executives sitting on the dais with him strapped on headphones so they could listen to an English translation of his German remarks.
Deutsche Bank generates the bulk of its profits outside Germany, in businesses like investment banking, sales and trading, and asset management. Of the bank's 67,682 employees, only 29,857 are based in Germany.
Mr. Ackermann said on Thursday that Deutsche Bank hoped to earn 6.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in annual pretax profits, compared with 3.6 billion euros in 2003 and 1.4 billion in 2002. The bank reported net income of 1.4 billion euros last year, more than triple the amount in the previous year.
One of Deutsche Bank's German legacies is a cost structure considerably more expensive than those of competitors like Citigroup. Mr. Ackermann said the bank had whittled its costs through layoffs, and now had a cost-to-income ratio of 79 percent. The ratio at Citigroup is about 50 percent.
Mr. Ackermann said it was unfair to compare Deutsche Bank's costs with those of Citigroup because the two are in different lines of business. He said Citigroup's consumer credit franchise saddled it with more risk. "You'll never come to Deutsche Bank for credit cards in India," he said.
Analysts generally praised Deutsche Bank's performance, which was in line with their expectations. 
"Ackermann has done a great job," said Mark Hoge, a banking analyst with Lehman Brothers in London. "The cost structure is better; the franchise is stronger; capital is being managed more efficiently."
But Mr. Hoge expressed skepticism about Deutsche Bank's revenue and profit targets. To achieve its projected 9 percent increase in sales, he said, the bank would need an alignment of events outside its control, including a stock market boom and a rally in the dollar.
Mr. Hoge also said Deutsche Bank had apparently made no provision for paying larger bonuses to its bankers. Those payments would cut into the projected pretax profit of 6.5 billion euros, he said.
To judge by his tone on Thursday, Mr. Ackermann is not burdened by a lack of confidence. He drew criticism in the news media recently when he was photographed on the first day of his trial in Dusseldorf, smiling and flashing a victory sign at one of his fellow defendants.
Mr. Ackermann said the gesture had been misinterpreted. "I want to apologize in case anyone was hurt and took this as a sign that I don't respect the judges or Germany's judiciary system," he said.

Old Enough For the Army, Not the N.F.L.?

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
HE had only a few weeks to go in Iraq when he jumped into the Tigris River outside of Baghdad, dove in after his company sergeant the way he would have once went for a fumble. He was 20 years old and not coming home. Not long before Christmas, Todd Bates drowned.
 He played football for Bellaire High School in southeastern Ohio, in a blue-collar town shriveled in recent years by devastating job cuts in the steel mills and coal mines. Thousands moved away, most up to Columbus, according to the school's football coach, John Magistro. 
 Todd Bates would have loved to follow them, the coach said, given anything for an invitation to play football at Ohio State, to have been a classmate of the state legend, Maurice Clarett, out of Youngstown, an hour and a half away.
"Todd was not a great football player, but he was a kid who truly loved the game," Magistro said yesterday in a telephone interview from the school weight room. "He played guard on the offensive line, defensive tackle, was voted a captain by his teammates as a senior.
"Todd didn't have much growing up. His mother wasn't around. His grandmother raised him. A big boy, 240-pounder, one of those kids who gets so much mileage out of football, out of the friendships."
He finished high school and joined the Ohio Army National Guard. All around town, people would see him training with 50-pound weights on his back, slimming down to a muscular 190 pounds. Then he was gone, off to Iraq with the 135th Military Police Company, his choice, and one from which there was no moralizing sports commissioner to save him from making.
In the real world, that's what it means to be 18, or 20, the age at which Todd Bates died trying to fish another man out of a foreign river and the age at which Maurice Clarett has decided he is ready to carry the football into the massive hulks in those National Football League trenches.
Oh, no, says the N.F.L. That's too young, too risky, too much of an infringement on the country's reigning sports superpower. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue argues that Clarett, who would probably prefer Baghdad to more college classrooms, should stay in school. Tagliabue says Clarett will need more than a consent slip from a United States district court judge to gain entry into the upcoming N.F.L. draft. Tagliabue's army of lawyers will appeal a potentially historic decision that has gone against the league.
Pardon the metaphorical assault, but on the subject of the N.F.L. and its self-serving draft eligibility rules, even the judge of the United States District Court in Manhattan, in her ruling announced yesterday in New York, couldn't help herself.
"While ordinarily the best offense is a good defense, none of these defenses hold the line," wrote Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, adding later, "because the N.F.L. cannot prevail in any of these defenses, the rule must be sacked."
It was the right call, be it on anti-trust law or the more high-minded proposition that those who are old enough and tough enough to patrol the streets of Baghdad or Kabul are probably ready to catch a ball over the middle and take a hit from Ty Law. If not, then it's time for the N.F.L. to stop feeding half of America during Super Bowl week and start investing in a developmental vehicle that might actually facilitate the only meaningful reformation of major college sports.
Who really believes that the N.F.L. ever cared about players getting a college education? Who ever thought that this has been about anything other than preserving a free minor league system with all the promotional perks, not to mention enough annual national television revenue to rebuild half a dozen cities in Iraq?
Back in Bellaire, a 20-year veteran of the coaching wars could plainly see that the rules are outdated, unfair and all about a system that best serves the administrators, not the playmakers. 
"Remember, this is the state where everyone's going crazy about LeBron James," said Magistro, who has sent two players, Dallas receiver Joey Galloway and Cleveland linebacker Ben Taylor, to the N.F.L. "I don't know how you can allow kids to go in sports like basketball and hockey but not in football. I don't agree with that. I think maybe football does need to develop a farm system."
If this sounded more like the pragmatism of a steelworker than the idealism of an educator, maybe it is because Magistro has watched the local jobs disappear, the population sink from more than 10,000 to fewer than 5,000 and too many high school graduates struggle to find their place in the community. Off the top of his head, he could think of six of his former students who have been serving in Iraq, a reflection of small town values and a depressed economy.
Unlike the ivory tower inhabited by Tagliabue and his battalion of lawyers, it's the real world, 101. "It's a town that's suffered, that gets something out of us doing well, like when we made the state final four last fall," Magistro said. "It's a nice place to live, if you have a job."
No one was surprised when they heard how much Todd Bates had tried to do his, going into the Tigris to rescue Sgt. Aaron Reese of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, on Dec. 10. Neither man survived. In a year-long tour, they were the only men lost from the unit, the last of whose members returned to Ohio last Saturday morning, in time for the Super Bowl, our annual Armageddon for which a real war hero would have been too young to qualify as a dependable team man.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 7, 2004

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, most of a sentence was omitted in some copies yesterday from the last paragraph of a Sports of The Times column on the main sports page. The column supported a federal judge's decision that the National Football League's rule restricting younger players from entering the draft was in violation of antitrust laws. The affected passage, with the omission shown by brackets, should have read: " Pardon the metaphorical assault, but on the subject of the N.F.L. and its self-serving draft eligibility rules, even the judge of the United States District Court in Manhattan, in her ruling announced yesterday in New York, couldn't help herself."

HEADLINE: Irregularities in State Lease Benefit Rowland Associate 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
A businessman with close ties to Gov. John G. Rowland has made an extra $700,000 on property he leases to the state in New Haven because of irregularities in the way the renewal was handled, state auditors have concluded. 
 This is the second time state officials have been criticized for issuing lucrative leases to friends or associates of the governor. 
 The other lease involves a building in Windsor, Conn., that is owned by Mark and Allicia Wertheim, who are friends of the governor and his wife. In an investigation in 2002, Connecticut's attorney general found that the lease was "rigged" to provide other payments to the Wertheims beyond the $838,000-a-year lease payments, and four state employees were disciplined as a result. 
 In the most recent case, the landlord is Robert V. Matthews, a local entrepreneur who has drawn the attention of federal investigators looking into whether the Rowland administration has steered contracts to favored parties. The state has until Feb. 19 to produce records concerning Mr. Matthews and his companies. Mr. Matthews received a personal subpoena in June. 
 As a friend and former neighbor of Mr. Rowland's, Mr. Matthews acknowledges having done favors for Mr. Rowland before and after he became governor in 1995. When Mr. Rowland separated from his first wife in 1992, he moved temporarily into a carriage house on Mr. Matthews's property. Nine years later, Mr. Matthews allowed the governor to vacation at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., in a deal that caused the State Ethics Commission in Connecticut to impose fines and restitution.
 Mr. Matthews also got involved when the governor no longer needed his condominium in Washington, D.C. Mr. Matthews arranged for his niece to rent it and then helped find a buyer who paid the governor $68,500, far more than comparable units in the building were fetching.
 The relationship has not been one-way. Companies owned by Mr. Matthews have received millions of dollars of economic assistance from the state, and Mr. Rowland once made a phone call from a golf course to help woo a company to Connecticut on Mr. Matthews's behalf. Mr. Rowland has said such calls fell squarely within his duties as the state's chief corporate recruiter. 
More recently, Mr. Matthews has complained that his ties to Mr. Rowland have hurt, rather than helped, him in his dealings with the state. 
 Specifically, he has said that the Department of Public Works' wariness about renewing its lease at 1 Long Wharf in New Haven, given his relationship with the governor, cost him money because it was keeping him from getting the going rate on that space. With the space being used by social service agencies, he said, he did not want to use eviction to cut his losses. 
 But the state's top two auditors, Kevin P. Johnston, a Democrat, and Robert G. Jaekle, a Republican who was Mr. Rowland's running mate in his unsuccessful bid for governor in 1990, issued an opinion last month that the process by which Mr. Matthews's lease was renewed contained many irregularities.
 They said the state's failure to renew the lease by the June 4, 1999, deadline reopened the deal, forcing the state to pay $1.54 per square foot in additional rent each year to stay put. They said the lapse also played a role in the state's having to pay about $95,000 a year for additional parking. 
 The auditors also concluded that state employees knew and failed to tell the State Properties Review Board, which reviews leases, that the consultant whose expertise they were relying on, Archie D'Amato, worked for Mr. Matthews. Mr. D'Amato was presented to the oversight board as a "private consultant with a long history of real estate expertise in the Connecticut market" who could corroborate the need to pay $70 a month per car for the overflow parking that was no longer covered by the new lease. 
 Mr. Matthews did not return phone calls seeking comment for this article.
 In the past, he has defended his dealings at 1 Long Wharf by noting that the lease predated the Rowland administration. In an essay he wrote for The Hartford Courant last June, he remarked, "Can someone show me how long-term leases, put in place under Gov. Lowell Weicker's administration, could be affected by John Rowland?" 
 Nothing in the auditors' letter, dated Jan. 16, 2004, tied the governor to the renewal of the lease. But the auditors concluded that the state would have been entitled to renew the original five-year lease, which expired on Dec. 1, 1999, for $14.46 a square foot had it simply notified the landlord by June 4, 1999. The original lease would have also entitled the state to some additional parking at no charge. 
In a letter dated July 3, 2003, Theodore R. Anson, then commissioner of the Department of Public Works, said that the department's failure to meet the deadline was a "clerical error." Mr. Anson resigned from his post in September after admitting to having accepted free architectural plans for his home from a state contractor. 
 The auditors sharply criticized the state's handling of the renewal, saying, there was no documentation that the department had mailed the notice on time or made any effort to persuade Mr. Matthews to honor the terms in the original lease. 
 Alan S. Plofsky, the executive director of the Ethics Commission, was the first to raise questions about the renewal last year, and referred the matter in June to the state's auditors for further study. 
 Now that the auditors have substantiated Mr. Plofsky's assertions, they have taken the next step: referring the matter to the governor for possible action. 
 "We've read the auditor's report and we're reviewing it," said Ross Garber, the governor's in-house counsel.

HEADLINE: Other Boroughs Beat Manhattan in Weathering Recession 

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
New York City's outer boroughs weathered the recent recession better than Manhattan, losing proportionately fewer jobs and seeing private-sector wages increase while Manhattan's payroll declined, according to figures released by the state's chief financial officer. 
 Total wages paid by private employers in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island increased by 6.1 percent from 2000 to 2002, even as they fell in Manhattan by 7.1 percent, according to the figures, which were issued by the state comptroller's office yesterday with a report on the city's economy. While Manhattan lost more than half the jobs created there during the 1990's, Queens lost only 20 percent of such jobs from 2000 to 2002 and Brooklyn lost only 5 percent. 
 The loss of jobs outside Manhattan, however, was offset by salary increases in the jobs that remained, the study showed. At the same time, the other boroughs saw an increase in the number of jobs with a neighborhood focus, like service, administrative and health care jobs, even as they lost employment in manufacturing and air transport. 
 The outer boroughs' relative strength and stability reflect the peculiar effect of the recession on New York City. Conventional wisdom holds that when the economy sinks, blue-collar neighborhoods are hit the hardest. This recession, which particularly clobbered the finance and high-tech sectors, had a disproportionate effect on Manhattan, a national center of those industries. The other boroughs could not miss what they never had.
 The boroughs outside Manhattan even showed stronger growth than the generally sprawling and affluent suburban counties around the city. In Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange and Putnam Counties, wages grew by 3.3 percent from 2000 to 2002, according to State Department of Labor statistics, about half as fast as in the outer boroughs. 
 The report focused in particular on Brooklyn, which the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said was insulated from the contraction that occurred elsewhere in the city after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Manhattan, with its financial base near the World Trade Center, and Queens, with an export-oriented economy around two airports, suffered the largest economic damage after the attacks and lost the most jobs. 
 "The news is pretty good," Mr. Hevesi said at a breakfast at Long Island University in Brooklyn yesterday. "It's not great, but considering the three years we've had, it's pretty good." 
 In fact, in a case of the Brooklyn tortoise outpacing the Manhattan hare, from 1998 to 2002, private-sector wages in Brooklyn, adjusted for inflation, increased by 7.8 percent, the fastest growth in the city.
 None of which is to say that the outer boroughs have rendered Manhattan an economic also-ran. From the start of the boom in 1995 through 2002, total wages paid in Manhattan jumped by 51 percent while those in the other boroughs increased only 32 percent. Manhattan employers now pay nearly four times the total wages of employers in the other four boroughs combined.
 According to the report, based largely on State Department of Labor figures, the boroughs outside Manhattan lost 1 percent of their private-sector jobs from 2000 to 2002. Moreover, the average salary in the sectors that lost the most jobs was about $38,400, while the average salary in the fastest-growing sectors was only $29,800. But, due primarily to salary increases, total private-sector wages in the outer boroughs grew from $35.8 billion in 2000 to $38 billion in 2002, an increase of 6.1 percent. 
 Total wages in Manhattan dropped both because it lost 7.1 percent of its private-sector jobs, and because the salary difference between jobs that disappeared and jobs that were created was much greater than in the other boroughs. The average salary in the sectors that lost the most jobs in Manhattan was $85,500, while in the fastest-growing sectors it was $59,300.
 As in the rest of the country, the economies of the other boroughs have shifted from manufacturing toward service. In Brooklyn, for example, the fastest growing job categories were social assistance and nursing and residential care, the latter reflecting, among other things, the graying of Brooklyn's established middle class.
 For example, Sunrise Assisted Living, a company based in Virginia that runs high-priced housing for the elderly, has opened centers in Mill Basin and Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, since 2000. Employment at clothing stores and hardware stores has also grown, reflecting the expansion into urban markets of big national chains like Home Depot, which now has four stores in Brooklyn, said Kenneth Adams, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce.
 That growth, Mr. Adams said, is likely to continue. "Brooklyn still is under-retailed," he said. "There's still pent-up consumer demand, and retail is going to continue to add jobs." 
 One of the more surprising findings to emerge from the state labor figures was that the Bronx, widely seen as the city's most economically backward borough, actually showed the strongest growth in recent years. 
 Total private-sector wages paid in the Bronx grew by 8.2 percent from 2000 to 2002, the most in the city. Nearly 3 percent of all private-sector wages paid in the Bronx went to members of the New York Yankees. But even setting aside the team's payroll, which jumped to about $171 million from $107 million during that period, Bronx wages still grew by 7.3 percent.
 Not only that, but the Bronx was the only borough where private-sector employment actually increased during the height of the economic downturn. 
 The Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., attributed the growth to the expansion of several colleges in recent years, including the College of New Rochelle and Mercy College. Other fast-growing sectors in the Bronx included health care, which Mr. Carrion called the borough's leading employer, and restaurants and bars.
 The Bronx is even seeing growth in fields that it does not want. Waste management companies added 480 jobs in the Bronx from 2000 to 2002, at an average salary of $47,000.
 "That one we're not happy with," Mr. Carrion said. "We want those people to work somewhere else."

A Portrait of a Neighborhood Is Now Just a Click Away

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Want to know how many vacant lots are in your neighborhood? How steep the rent increases have been? The rate of mortgage foreclosures? How many people live in "linguistic isolation" (bureaucratese for "non-English speakers")? 
 Under a new federally financed program, anyone wanting to tap into a wealth of housing (and other) information about any of New York City's neighborhoods -- would-be home buyers, renters, policy makers or community advocates -- can log on at no charge to a simple-to-use Web site at www.nychanis.com. 
 Nychanis stands for New York City Housing and Neighborhoods Information System, and the Web site is the design child of Michael H. Schill, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University's School of Law, and Denise Previti, a former researcher at the center. It was financed by a $457,000 grant from the United States Department of Commerce, with matching contributions from local foundations and banks.
 "The project is part of a national movement toward democratizing data," Professor Schill said. "The idea is that government agencies and private organizations collect huge amounts of information that average people have no way of accessing. With Nychanis, anyone can have this data at their fingertips."
 Someone wondering whether to buy a home in the Flushing or Whitestone sections of Queens, for example, could readily discover that the inflation-adjusted median value for single-family homes in the community rose to $300,000 in 2002, from $215,000 in 1999. From 1999 to 2002, the percentage of individually owned housing units increased to 49.6, from 47.2. Approximately 60 percent of the area's housing was built before 1960, with 22.5 percent built before 1939, the data show.
 A Web searcher could draw a social portrait of the neighborhood. In Flushing-Whitestone, for example, the percentageof students in public elementary and middle schools who performed at grade level or above in English rose to 60.8 in 2003, from 52.2 in 1999. Violent crimes dropped to 3.54 per 1,000 residents in 2001 , from 7.84 incidents in 1990.
 Someone weighing whether to rent an apartment on the Upper West Side could find that more than 76.8 percent of the rental units in the neighborhood are rent-regulated in one form or another, leaving 23.2 percent at market rate. From1999 to 2002, the median rent for all apartments -- including regulated units and those in public housing -- rose by 10.3 percent to $950. If someone wants to buy an apartment on the Upper West Side, they could find that the inflation-adjusted median value rose to $600,000 in 2002, from $322,000 in 1999.
 The Web site offers 65 categories of information about each neighborhood.
 "Not only can people download data tables," Professor Schill said, "they can create custom-made maps, graphs, pie charts. 
 "If a community group is concerned that subprime lenders are targeting minority communities, it can create a map showing where subprime loans are most prevalent, then overlay where most minority families live."
 The statistics come from a host of sources: New York City's Departments of Planning, Finance, Housing Preservation and Development and the police and, on the federal level, the Census Bureau and the Departments of Commerce and Education, as well as data collected in accordance with the National Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
 Someone logging on can enter an address and obtain information based on the local census tract, subborough area, community district, school district or police precinct. "It blends the housing data with digital maps of the city," said Richard Annitto, vice president of Bowne Management Systems, the company that designed the site. "It's the most complete source for housing statistics in the city."
 The Department of Housing Preservation and Development has already used it for policy purposes. "Because of our interest in homelessness, we mapped where the overcrowded apartments are," said Harold Shultz, the department's special counsel.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Marshaling City Housing Data"A new, free interactive Web site brings together diverse information on New York City housing and population as a reference tool for home buyers, parents, researchers, banks and community advocates. On www.nychanis.com, users can choose neighborhoods and view or compare them in terms of housing vacancies and costs, land use, income, school attendance, crime and many other factors. The site can map or chart results in various ways, and includes a calculator for further analysis of data. A user can then store the information in a personal account for future use. This map, for example, shows boroughs by rental vacancy rate, with darker shades for higher rates.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; 
Expulsion and Suspensions Leave St. John's in Shambles

BYLINE:  By RON DICKER

 BODY:
St. John's expelled one starting basketball player, moved to expel two others and disciplined three reserves last night. The actions came after an incident involving a 38-year-old Queens woman that began in a strip club in a Pittsburgh suburb.
 The woman was charged by the Pittsburgh police with lying about her claim that she had been raped by several St. John's players she met at the club. Although no players were charged, the university took action against the six players on a team suffering through one of the worst seasons in St. John's history. 
 St. John's expelled Grady Reynolds immediately; suspended Elijah Ingram and Abe Keita and will seek their expulsion, pending a hearing; and suspended Lamont Hamilton and Mohammed Diakite from the team for unspecified violation of rules stemming from the events Wednesday night. Tyler Jones also faces unspecified punishment by the team's interim coach, Kevin Clark. 
Ingram, the team's leading scorer, Reynolds and Keita are starters. If Ingram and Keita are also expelled and Hamilton and Diakite remain suspended, St. John's will have nine players on its roster with eight regular-season games remaining.
Even without criminal charges against players, the incident is the latest in an avalanche of problems for the basketball program. St. John's players have been involved in other off-the-court incidents over the past year; the coach, Mike Jarvis, was fired early this season; and the team has a record of 5-14 over all and 0-8 in the Big East.
The woman, Sherri Ann Urbanek-Bach, of Astoria, Queens, who is unemployed, was arrested and charged with fictitious reports to law enforcement, prostitution and criminal theft by extortion, the police said. All the charges are misdemeanors. She was being held in the Allegheny County jail and will be arraigned today, the police said.
The woman said she was raped in the hotel where the St. John's players were staying after their game with Pittsburgh on Wednesday night. After being questioned by the police early yesterday, the St. John's players returned to New York.
The woman did not have obvious injuries, said Cmdr. Maurita Bryant, of the major crimes division of the Pittsburgh police. Urbanek-Bach was interviewed a second time last night and the police concluded that her claim was not true, Bryant said.
Part of what cast suspicion on Urbanek-Bach was a cellphone with videotape of portions of the incident, said Lt. Kevin Kraus of the major crimes division for the police. The phone belonged to one of the accused players, Kraus said.
Several St. John's players went to the Club Erotica in the Pittsburgh suburb of McKees Rocks, where they met the woman about 2:30 a.m., the police report said. She accompanied them to the Westin Convention Center Hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, where they raped her, the report said she told the police.
Ingram is a sophomore guard from Orange, N.J., who turns 20 today. Keita, a 24-year-old senior from Tolland, Conn., and Reynolds, a 23-year-old senior from Abbeville, Ala., are starting frontcourt players. Diakite, 23, a senior center from Rockville, Md., Hamilton, 21, a freshman center-forward from Brooklyn, and Jones, 19, a freshman forward from Lakeland, Colo., are reserves.
"Although no charges have been filed by the police, based on the facts we have confirmed, the university has immediately suspended three players from the team for violation of team rules and behavior inconsistent with St. John's mission and values," the university said in a statement before the woman was charged.
Those three players were Ingram, Reynolds and Keita. The university later issued another statement with further actions against them, as well as its discipline of the other three.
The incident is the latest black eye for the basketball program. Earlier in the season, Jarvis suspended the senior Willie Shaw for his second marijuana-related offense. Then Jarvis was fired over the team's poor play and his criticism of the university's facilities.
Last season, Reynolds was charged with assaulting a female student; the matter was settled over the summer with Reynolds agreeing to take anger-management classes.
St. John's has the worst record in the Big East. It has been a huge dropoff for a program that five years ago, under Jarvis, reached the final eight of the N.C.A.A. tournament.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Goal Is 'Thin' Pact With Teachers 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
As contract talks with the city teachers' union start in earnest today, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is reaching for a prize even bigger than mayoral control of the school system: a scrapping of the 42-year-old, 200-page teachers' contract and its thicket of work rules.
 The Bloomberg administration plans to propose wiping away decades of details in favor of a "thin" contract citywide: about a dozen pages that would give principals the right to hire and fire, and would end seniority rules that give teachers a say over everything from what schools they work in to what grades and subjects they teach. 
 In the past, city officials have often tried to tame the contract with clauses and exceptions. But nobody has tried to sweep it aside. 
 "It's climbing Mount Everest," said Eva S. Moskowitz, the chairwoman of the City Council Education Committee who in November held a series of politically charged hearings on the education contracts. 
 The contract has long been at the core of disputes over who is to blame for the ills of public education in New York City. Mr. Bloomberg, like many of his predecessors, sees the contract as an obstacle to effective management. The union says that mayors routinely scapegoat the contract to mask their own failures on education issues.
 In recent days, the mayor's office ordered city education officials not to discuss the talks. And yesterday, a spokesman for the mayor, Robert Lawson, declined to comment. But the mayor and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein have made no secret of the concessions they want.
 In a speech to business leaders last week, for instance, Mr. Klein offered a scathing assessment of the current contract and called for sweeping changes, including merit pay for successful teachers and bonuses for teachers who agree to work in struggling schools and for teachers in subjects that are hard to staff, like math. 
 "At the heart of the problem are the three poles of civil service: lockstep pay, seniority and life tenure," Mr. Klein said. "Together they act as handcuffs and prevent us from making the changes that will encourage and support excellence in our system."
 Mr. Bloomberg is so determined to break apart the contract that the teachers' union president, Randi Weingarten, took the extraordinary step last August of moving to outflank him by publicly offering to try a thin contract in perhaps 150 schools. But Ms. Weingarten has said her members are not prepared to abandon the existing contract in all 1,200 schools, and she has cautioned the mayor, who faces re-election in 2005, that contract talks could quickly hit an impasse if he pushes for too much too fast. 
 Officials familiar with the city's bargaining strategy, however, said the administration had no intention of heeding Ms. Weingarten's warning. They said the mayor's negotiators planned to push immediately for a citywide deal, a move that several officials said would put the city and the union on a collision course and that Ms. Weingarten, in an interview, said would sound the "death knell" for negotiations. 
 "They know we will reject it," she said, adding that she believed the administration was planning to sabotage the contract talks so it could blame the union and teachers for failures in the mayor's education reform initiatives, collectively called Children First. "They are looking for a fight," Ms. Weingarten said. "That says to me there are some real fundamental flaws that they identified in Children First that they need to try and scapegoat the teachers." 
 In addition to her proposal for a thin contract, Ms. Weingarten, in her speech to business leaders last month, also offered to address another age-old complaint of city officials by speeding up the dismissal of incompetent teachers, a process that can now drag on for years. Ms. Weingarten said those offers demonstrated substantial good faith on the part of the city's 80,000 teachers, many of whom view the contract as their only protection against a city education bureaucracy they regard as unwieldy and unpredictable. 
 "We have spent the last several months proving to them and the city that despite the demoralization of teachers right now and the fact that there are lots of problems in the schools, we want to be problem solvers," Ms. Weingarten said. 
 One official said the city labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, had been working in recent days to persuade Ms. Weingarten not to walk away from the talks, even if the administration makes a citywide thin contract as its starting point in the negotiations. 
 The talks are complicated by politics on both sides. Ms. Weingarten, though popular among her members, nonetheless faces re-election this spring, a process that usually calls for union leaders to take a tougher stance. 
 Mr. Bloomberg is struggling to lift his approval ratings in the polls ahead of a re-election campaign next year. He has told voters that education is his most important issue and that they should judge him largely on his ability to fix the schools. 
 Ms. Weingarten, who is also chairwoman of the coalition of municipal unions, and the teachers could easily decideto stall the talks until after the November 2005 election in hopes of negotiating a contract with a Democrat who has a more favorable view of organized labor. The current contract expired last May 31, but it remains in force until a new one is negotiated. 
 The two sides are also likely to clash over money. Mr. Bloomberg maintains that the city has no money for raises and that the unions have to pay for any raises through productivity savings. In recent weeks, Chancellor Klein has had his staff scrambling to identify such potential savings. 
 But with the mayor also saying that the economy is improving, the teachers' union believes the city should be able to afford increases.
 Experts on public education and New York State labor law say that the union clearly has the upper hand. 
Bertrand B. Pogrebin, a labor lawyer who frequently represented the Board of Education in contract negotiations, said many protections for teachers and their contract are codified in state law. 
 Because teachers view themselves as education professionals, their contract demands often extend beyond the usual issues of wages and hours to include a role for teachers in educational policy. And once the city agrees to contract clauses, Mr. Pogrebin explained, state labor law requires that the union agree before they can be removed. 
 Some experts said the city and the union were in danger of missing an extraordinary opportunity to help the schools. 
 "If the city and the union agree to revamp the contract," said Arthur Levine, the president of Teachers College at Columbia University, "that would be enormous. It's a real opportunity to build this profession if each side is willing to give." 
 Mr. Pogrebin said that in the best schools, the contract is typically not a factor. 
 "There are schools all over the city that are blocks away from another school that's failing and this one is a gem, and it has the same mix of kids," he said. "That's because the principals and the teachers have made some kind of deal and they are doing basically their own thing." 
 "The best labor-management relationship," he added, "puts the contract in a drawer."

Camus and the Neo-Cons: More in Common Than They Might Suspect

BYLINE:  By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
It was a heady moment. Liberation was at hand. The world's most powerful totalitarian state had been defeated. World-historical struggles had come to an end.
 Such was the situation after the Soviet Union collapsed. And the sense of triumph was palpable. In an essay reprinted in "The Norman Podhoretz Reader" (Free Press), Mr. Podhoretz wrote a "Eulogy" for neo-conservatism -- the political and cultural movement with which he and the magazine he edited, Commentary, had been so closely identified. It was a eulogy that proclaimed satisfaction and closure. For two decades, Commentary had advocated unrelenting challenges to Soviet power, and while the downfall had never been seen as imminent, it had always been hoped for. 
 In his introduction to this new collection -- which samples Mr. Podhoretz's argumentative power and rhetorical range over nearly 50 years -- Paul Johnson notes that the Soviet collapse also brought to its end an era in American intellectual life in which Mr. Podhoretz had been a major player. 
But as central as Soviet Communism was to neo-conservativism, the eulogy, of course, was premature. History did not come to end. Free-market economies ran into trouble. Genocidal massacres took place. Terrorism erupted. Old conflicts were metastasizing, emerging in new configurations. So neo-conservativism continues, now even taking center stage, named as the ideology behind President Bush's foreign policy. 
In neo-conservatism's continued evolution, though, how are lessons learned from the past to be applied to a transformed world? An example from the past may show how vexed such questions can be. 
Consider the period just after the Second World War, when another tyranny had just collapsed. It seemed as if the Allies had, through their trials, learned something about totalitarianism and democracy. Could those concepts be used to understand the Soviet Union, the West's erstwhile partner? Was it something very different (a humanitarian revolutionary state gone awry) or something very similar (a fascistic state beyond saving)? 
Such issues affected the impassioned arguments between the two most important writers in postwar France, Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. In his new book, "Camus and Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel That Ended It" (University of Chicago), Ronald Aronson, who teaches at Wayne State University, traces the nuances of their friendship, their mutual influences and hostilities, and the themes that still haunt contemporary debates. 
Their schism over Communism was not academic. At the time of France's liberation, buoyed by its Resistance role, the Communist Party had 400,000 members; that figure almost doubled by 1946, and the party joined a coalition government. In addition, according to Mr. Aronson, the party dominated the largest trade union, published dozens of newspapers including the country's two largest, and had a payroll of more than 14,000. The Communist Party was part of the mainstream in a way it never was in the United States. 
But its allegiances were just as open to question: it slavishly followed Soviet leadership; fellow travelers idealized the Soviet Union, despite readily available accounts of horrors. Andre Gide, who visited Russia in the 1930's, said he doubted whether anywhere, even in Hitler's Germany, the "mind and spirit are less free, more bowed down." 
Camus had joined the party in Algeria in 1935 and left two years later in dismay. Mr. Aronson even implies that Camus' views on absurdity and freedom grew out of that experience. 
Then, in France, during the German occupation, Camus did heroic work as editor of a Resistance newspaper, Combat. Sartre, in their developing friendship, called Camus an "outstanding example" of a life lived in "engagement." After the war, both men saw an opportunity to remake the world, redressing social ills. Both also wanted to steer the French left away from the Communists while distancing themselves from the growing cold war. 
But by 1948, Sartre had become a fellow traveler, even giving the party the right to censor one of his plays. He called freedom under capitalism a "hoax" and France a "society of oppression." He refused to denounce Soviet labor camps or the show trials. And he justified revolutionary violence, praising the African revolutionary Franz Fanon. 
Meanwhile, Camus found himself ever more repulsed by Communism, which he called "the modern madness." He saw Communism as a desperate attempt to create meaning and certainty. He wrote, "Those who pretend to know everything and settle everything finish by killing everything." If there were a choice between justice and freedom, meaning a choice between the ideal Communist state and the flawed Western state, he wrote: "I choose freedom. For even if justice is not realized, freedom maintains the power of protest against injustice and keeps communication open." 
After Sartre's journal, Les Temps Modernes, panned Camus's influential counter-revolutionary book "The Rebel" in 1952, the friends never spoke again. Sartre's influence was so strong that Camus' French reputation was not repaired even after winning the Nobel Prize in 1957. 
But Mr. Aronson does not want the reader taking sides. He insists that we have to "free ourselves from the dualistic thinking of the cold war," and not take the "currently fashionable" view praising Camus. Mr. Aronson argues, in fact, that "like many another anti-Communist, Camus wrecked his own moral and political coherence by avoiding talking about his own society" while Sartre correctly "confronted the violence of the democratic capitalist system" and the evils of colonialism. But in this, Mr. Aronson is simply taking Sartre's side without attending to its minefields. 
Camus, in his concreteness and human sensitivities, is more perceptive, and in his compassion, more trustworthy. He had a major influence on later French writers like Andre Glucksmann, Bernard-Henri Levy and Pascal Bruckner -- the neo-cons of the French left. And in Camus's rejection of utopianism and his acceptance of sad compromise there remain hints of what might form some sort of realistic political ideal.

New Wage and Benefit Cuts Expected at US Airways
Officials at US Airways, which is struggling to meet the conditions of federal loans that lifted it out of bankruptcy last year, began making the case for more wage and benefit cuts to skeptical union leaders who have already declared that "the concessions stand is closed."
 US Airways has been working on a strategy since December, when its chief executive, David N. Siegel, said that increased competition from low-fare airlines was forcing it to revise the business plan it used when it emerged from bankruptcy last spring. Page C3. 

Tax Protester Says He's Delusional
Irwin Schiff, who claims that no law requires the payment of income taxes, suffers from delusions, including a fantasy that he alone can properly interpret the tax laws, according topapers filed by his lawyers. The unusual filing asks a judge to deny a summary judgment in favor of the Justice Department that says Mr. Schiff owes $2.5 million in income taxes, fraud penalties and interest. C3.

Hint of Expanded Health Coverage
The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, said that "it is impossible" to get all Americans covered with health insurance, but he predicted that Congress would take incremental steps to expand coverage this year. A7.

Ericsson Returns to a Profit
Ericsson reported its first quarterly profit since 2001, leading the company to say that it believes the market has stabilized. C2.

Investigators Raid Kazaa Offices
Investigators for five major record labels raided 12 premises in Australia, including the offices of the company that owns Kazaa, seeking evidence of possible copyright infringement. C2.

Pressure to Meet Profit Goals
The pressure to meet quarterly earnings goals is causing many publicly traded companies to make decisions that could hurt them in the long run, a survey by Duke University and the University of Washington contends. C3.

West Virginia Opposes Plant Sale
The state of West Virginia will challenge a proposed federal agreement that requires the sale of an aluminum plant in the state to preserve competition in the aluminum industry. C4.

Cigna to Cut 9% of Work Force
Cigna plans to cut about 9 percent of its work force, or 3,000 jobs, because its membership ranks fell sharply in the fourth quarter. The news sent shares of the health insurer plummeting $5.55, or nearly 9 percent. Cigna reported strong fourth-quarter profits, but also reduced its quarterly dividend to 2.5 cents from 33 cents. C2.

Moody's May Cut E.D.S. Rating
Moody's Investors Service is considering cutting the credit rating of Electronic Data Systems to a level below that of investment grade, a move that could force the company to forfeit a $400 million credit line and pay higher interest on $1.1 billion of bonds. C4.

Earnings Dip Slightly at Belo
Fourth-quarter earnings at Belo fell to $42.4 million from $45.9 million in the period a year ago as a decrease in political advertising at its television stations offset improvements in other areas. C14.

GlaxoSmithKline Settles a Lawsuit
GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit contending that it blocked cheaper generic forms of its Relafen arthritis medicine, in violation of antitrust laws in the United States. C4.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
After the Decay Of Decay, a New Modernity

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
For those who want a souvenir of cultural wreckage, "Decasia: The State of Decay," Bill Morrison's 67-minute montage of decomposing nitrate film, has just been released on DVD. Already a cult classic, the movie is a time capsule of the postmodern obsession with decrepitude. What a space saver! Just pop this disc in the player and you'll have all the putrefaction you could ask for. Watch the Master Narratives Crumble! Entropy Now! Pomo's Greatest Hits!
 The movie was originally shown, in November 2001, as the visual accompaniment a symphony by Michael Gordon. In effect the "sight track" to a musical score, "Decasia" (Plexifilm) orchestrates a medley of burns, blots, water spots, scratches and figures that melt as voluptuously as Dali's clocks. Mr. Gordon's music is throbbing, industrial, precarious: an overture to an epilogue. 
 Watching the film you gain the impression that decay is itself decaying, sinking into obsolescence before your eyes. Sarah Boxer picked up on that metaphysical theme in her review of the movie in The New York Times in 2002. "There is a new order coming," Ms. Boxer observed. "What will it be?" What comes after the ravages of time, warfare, vandalism, indifference and disgust?
For the answer, change discs.
"A Constructive Madness," an hourlong documentary directed by Tom Ball and Brian Neff, from a script by Jeffrey Kipnis, is also available on DVD (information can be found at www.aconstructivemadness .com). One of several vivid architecture movies screened last year at the Museum of Modern Art, it documents Frank Gehry's design of the Lewis House, an $82 million folly that ended up on the shelf of unbuilt brainstorms.
Mr. Kipnis, surely the most adventurous architecture curator we have in this country (he's based at the University of Ohio, in Columbus), contends that the Lewis House was the incubator for the voluptuous, curving forms with which Gehry has been associated in the public mind since the completion of Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, in 1997. I'm not convinced that is accurate. Fluidity had already entered Mr. Gehry's vocabulary by time he exhibited lamp designs modeled after fish and snakes in the early 1980's..
But never mind. In "A Constructive Madness," his first film, Mr. Kipnis reveals something far more important than the genealogy of forms. He documents the birth of a concept that has led Mr. Gehry to the position of leadership he holds in the profession.
Narrated by Jeremy Irons in what appears to be a parody of BBC pompousness, this is a personal, semisatirical look at architecture behind closed doors, including the deceptively composed facade of Mr. Gehry himself. The film doesn't claim to what makes genius tick. Mr. Kipnis relies heavily on metaphor analogy: ocean waves, birds in flight and, above all, classical music. The film is nearly as symphonic as "Decasia."
Mr. Gehry would be quick to deny that he is any kind of philosopher. He sets great store by expertise. Yet he is hardly the first artist in history to have found an intuitive path to places that philosophers, scientists, doctors and other specialists are helping to carve out and interpret. This movie shows us Mr. Gehry and a small group of supporters (including Mr. Kipnis) feeling their way toward what Ulrich Beck, the German sociologist, has termed "the second modernity." This concept holds out hope of deliverance from indefinite decay.
Mr. Beck's term refers to a process of social and political change that is occurring in response to economic globalization. In his view many of our institutions are indeed crumbling away, as the exchange of capital becomes increasingly less subject to controls by cities, states and nations. Familiar laments about privatization and the decline of the public realm are symptoms of globalization. So is the intellectual impoverishment of cultural institutions at the mercy of market pressures.
Under the direction of Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim Museum has become a blazing symbol for that impoverishment. I don't feel bad saying this, because I believe that Mr. Krens enjoys being a blaze. Moreover, "A Constructive Madness" shows him in a more modulated light. Along with Peter Lewis, the client, and the architect Philip Johnson, Mr. Krens represents the crazy stew of personality, publicity and power without which architecture seldom happens.
If you want to know why the Guggenheim in Bilbao and the new Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles are important projects, you should familiarize yourself with Mr. Beck's concept of "rooted cosmopolitanism," a key idea within the larger framework of the second modernity. You can enjoy these buildings perfectly well without dipping into Beck (though "Conversations with Ulrich Beck," just published by Polity, is a good read for beginners). But I have found this concept essential to understanding why some buildings vibrate in the mind.
A visitor to Bilbao or Disney Hall enters into the framework of history. In this framework large urban centers, past and present, are seen to possess more in common with one another than with the host nations in which they happen to be situated. There is power as well as enlightenment in this realization.
Though the experience may settle in the mind, it arrives through the body: through the physical act of moving in and around spaces that are attuned to changing times. In them, individuals can perceive themselves occupying what I can describe only as a threshold condition between a street and a horizon.
New Yorkers got a preview of this sensation a few weeks ago, when Santiago Calatrava unveiled his design for the World Trade Center transportation hub. The warm reception that greeted the design was due only partly to its intrinsic merits. The project also satisfied a set of emotional expections.The ancient urban cycle from destruction to creation. The blossoming of an aesthetic that transcends postmodern decay. Above all, the vision of a new link between ground zero and the larger cosmopolitan world.
One day, perhaps, neuroscience will explain why some buildings seem to reach far beyond their physical dimensions. But you do not need the explanation to experience the effect. It turns out that bodies, buildings, streets and cities are still useful for certain things in the global age of digital information. We are only beginning to uncover how they work.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 14, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A Critic's Notebook article in Arts & Ideas last Saturday about one film on decay and another on architecture misstated the name of the university in Columbus, Ohio, where Jeffrey Kipnis, scriptwriter for the architecture film, is a professor. It is Ohio State University; there is no University of Ohio.

HEADLINE: BOISE LETTER; 
Down-to-Earth Problems in a City of Trees and Hills

BYLINE:  By Sarah Kershaw

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon on the top floor of the Boise State University student union, 30 people filed into a glass-walled room with a stark view of the Boise foothills, the city's magical mini-mountain range, steppingstones to the Salmon River Mountains, which eventually loop their way up to Idaho's eastern border and over to the Rockies.
 It was a clear winter day -- and a city that is close enough to drizzly Seattle and Portland, Ore., to be considered a piece of the Northwest has every right to gloat about its 234 days of sunshine each year. Puffs of fog clung to the sharp, snowy foothills that rise a mile above the Treasure Valley floor, telegraphing the kind of shocking beauty that can make Idaho look like one big postcard. 
 The people in the room, who might be considered the political and economic movers and shakers in this city of 193,000 people, were assembled by Boise's new mayor to talk about his transition. They were not there to discuss the foothills per se. It seemed right, though, that the hills were there in full view, representing themselves as another character in the debate over the future of Boise, at a time when the questions have so much to do with the look and feel of this place. 
The hills were a political battleground just a short time ago. But then a vocal group of people who wanted to keep developers out of the hills won what they consider a historic fight, persuading fellow residents to do something fairly unthinkable in Idaho: tax themselves, to the tune of $10 million, to buy open space.
"We can't afford to waste any time," the mayor, Dave Bieter, 44, told his advisers. "People's expectations are quite high."
Sometimes scandal does that to a city. And what happened with the last mayor, Brent Coles, was pretty earth-shattering for Boise, Idaho's capital, where city politics had largely been in the realm of the pure.
Mr. Coles resigned last February and in November pleaded guilty to two charges: presenting a fraudulent account or voucher for reimbursement from the city for tickets to "Oklahoma!" in New York City for himself and members of his staff; and misuse of public funds, for seeking reimbursement from the city for a trip he and a staff member took from New York City to Rochester. He was sentenced to 180 days in the county jail and three years' probation on those charges, both felonies.
The way this Republican-leaning city cleaned its political house, electing its first Democratic mayor in 20 years and replacing four longtime members of the six-member City Council, has allowed it to step back and dig into the bigger identity question.
"I think this could be seen as a watershed election," said Dr. Jim Weatherby, a professor of political science at Boise State. "It was as much about maintaining our quality of life as it was about partisan politics."
As isolated as Boise is, at the nexus of the high desert and the western edge of the Rockies and still close to the middle of nowhere, it became a migration magnet in the 1990's. It drew scores of jobless people from California and other depressed states to what was, until recently, an economic oasis.
Micron Technologies, now one of the world's leading manufacturers of superconductors and Idaho's largest private employer, was founded here in 1978. Hewlett-Packard is here, and Boise's other high-tech companies were spared much of the strangulation from the dot-com bust that left most of the Northwest in the dumps.
Recreation, the weather and the outdoor life are other big lures. Boise is known as the City of Trees, because the French-Canadian fur traders who came through the desert and discovered it in the early 1800's were delighted to find a cottonwood forest flanking what is now the Boise River. ("Les bois!" they shouted. The woods!)
In the summer, people take tubing breaks at lunch, floating down the river through the city. There is serious hiking to be done here, skiing less than 16 miles from downtown, world-famous white-water rafting, bike trails everywhere and -- although maybe not for long -- a reasonable level of traffic.
At the same time that it seemed everyone was discovering Boise, Idaho's birthrate remained among the highest in the nation and the state's rural and urban populations flip-flopped, with a majority now living in or near cities and a minority living in the hinterlands.
Boise itself grew by almost 70,000 people over the last decade, according to the 2000 census. Sprawl and the vast increase in vehicular traffic have caused huge concerns -- not just about congestion on the roads and the increasingly obvious need for much better public transit, but also about protecting the environment, in the broadest sense -- the very thing that seems to be drawing all these people here.
The Treasure Valley has a growing air quality problem because of smog resulting from cars. And its temperate inversions, once beautiful, now troubling -- this happens when cold air gets trapped under warm air in the valley -- are trapping pollution with them.
Growth is a topic everywhere these days, especially in the West. But the unusual thing about what is happening in Boise is that city officials and other concerned citizens are examining the problems of growth before they are full-blown problems.
"It's a smaller scale at this point," Dr. Weatherby of Boise State said, "but I remember when Phoenix was 400,000 and Mason, Tempe and Scottsdale were all distinct cities. It can happen, and it could happen here."
Elaine Clegg, the co-executive director of Idaho Smart Growth, a nonprofit organization founded in 1997, and one of the new City Council members, said, "In Boise, we have an opportunity to make some of these changes, to do some of these things before the worst of the damage is done, rather than after." 
At a noisy pub in the hip and busy downtown, Mayor Bieter seemed concerned about what Boise was facing. 
"It's fair to say this is about the identity of Boise," he said. "That's absolutely what the election was about, what the next six or eight years or going to be about: whether we have the guts to grow in a way that keeps the environmental natural resources that we have here and the livability of this city."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 7 on the growth of Boise, Idaho, misstated a place name in a quotation from Dr. Jim Weatherby, a professor of political science at Boise State, who commented on the phenomenon of sprawl. He said, "I remember when Phoenix was 400,000 and Mesa, Tempe and Scottsdale were all distinct cities." He did not say Mason.

HEADLINE: Job Growth Picks Up But Misses Forecast 

BYLINE:  By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Job creation revived in January after an abrupt year-end slowdown, with employers adding 112,000 jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday.
 It was the job market's best performance since the economy started pulling out of recession in 2001. But the growth in employment was well under the 175,000 jobs expected by forecasters, and short of the 150,000 new jobs that economists consider necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force. 
 The dollar fell on foreign exchange markets yesterday, and stock and Treasury bond prices rose sharply, indications that investors have concluded that the Federal Reserve is now less likely to raise interest rates soon.
 The unemployment rate declined slightly in January, to 5.6 percent from 5.7 percent in December, the bureau said. The jobless rate has fallen from a peak of 6.3 percent in June. 
 The bureau lowered its prior estimate of the number of jobs created since last August, to 229,000 from 278,000. But it also raised its estimate of the number of new jobs in December, to 16,000 from the meager 1,000 that briefly served as a symbol of a jobless recovery.
 "We're creating jobs," said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight, an economic research firm. "We're just not creating very many." 
 The numbers provided a murky enough picture of the job market's strength that officials across the political spectrum found support for their views. 
N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said that "112,000 jobs is a significant increase," adding that with the economy expanding, job growth should pick up. "We want to see more jobs created. We expect it will happen in coming months."
 Yet Democrats noted that the pace of job growth so far has done little to dent the net loss of 2.3 million jobs in the last three years. "This historically would be an anemic month of job growth for any recovery," said Gene Sperling, a top economic aide to President Bill Clinton who has been advising several of the Democratic candidates on economic policy. "But when it's following three consecutive years of job losses it is particularly troubling."
 Campaigning in Virginia and Tennessee, Senator John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, blamed the administration, saying it was encouraging an exodus of jobs to China through its tax and trade policies.
 He argued that the deficits in the nation's current account and its budget were inhibiting investment that could otherwise lead to job growth. 
 "This economic policy is great for corporate bottom lines, but it is bad for our workers and spits in the face of our values," Mr. Edwards said in a statement. 
 In light of the government's report last week that the economy expanded by 4 percent in the final quarter of 2003, economists struggled to explain the tepid pace of job growth.
 "We're in expansion phase; employment is the only piston that doesn't seem to be firing," said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. "We've seen stellar statistics in all the indicators except this one. This is the one fly in the ointment."
 While most recent indicators of economic activity point to a continuing robust expansion, since September the economy has added only about 73,000 jobs a month, on average. The average weekly wages of rank-and-file workers -- who account for about four-fifths of the work force -- increased by only 1.7 percent in January from a year earlier, losing ground to inflation.
 There are still 716,000 fewer jobs than when the economic recovery officially began in November 2001. Compared with past recoveries, the economy is almost eight million jobs short of what economists expect more than two years into a period of growth, said Steven Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley, in a recent note to investors.
 The 76,000 jobs added by retailers last month represented more than half of the overall job gain, and followed an unexpected loss of 41,000 retailing jobs in December. Mr. Gault at Global Insight said that the turnaround might just be a seasonal aberration: stores did not hire as many sales clerks as usual for the holiday season and so did not have to lay off as many in January.
 There was little job growth outside of retailing. The construction, education, and leisure and hospitality sectors added a total of 65,000 jobs. But 22,000 positions were lost in professional and business services, and cash-short states cut employment in the government sector by 13,000. Payrolls of temporary employment services, which recorded solid gains last year, shrank by 21,000 jobs. And manufacturing continued its 42-month decline, shedding 11,000 jobs.
 Some economists remain concerned that without better news on the job front, the recovery could falter, as financially stretched consumers run out of money to fuel growth. "The worry is that if we don't start to create jobs more substantially in the first half of the year, then the recovery in the second half of the year will be at risk," Mr. Gault said. "In the first half, people will get tax refunds, so that will boost spending. But after that, consumer spending will be dependent on employment."
 And job uncertainty still weighs heavily on consumers' minds. "Most consumers expect the unemployment rate to decline in the year ahead but are still apprehensive about the employment situation, due to the loss of jobs because of global competition," said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. "It will take substantial improvement of employment levels before this view is changed."
 There are some indications that more vigorous job growth could lie ahead. 
 Jeffrey A. Joerres, chairman and chief executive of Manpower Inc., which supplies temporary workers, noted that productivity growth in the fourth quarter fell below the pace of economic growth, an indication that employers will need more workers to sustain expansion. Until recently, the recovery has been marked by surging productivity, with employers extracting ever more output from their workers. 
 As in prior months, economists' difficulty in sorting out the job picture was compounded by large discrepancies between the Bureau of Labor Statistics' two samplings of the labor market -- a survey of 400,000 businesses used to measure job creation and a survey of 60,000 households used to calculate the unemployment rate.
 Economists, including those at the bureau, regard the payroll survey as a better indicator of employment growth, because of its broader sample size. But unlike the household survey, it does not capture the self-employed -- a group that tends to grow in weak labor markets. And some critics say it does not adequately survey new businesses, though the bureau disputes this.
 So even as employment measured by the payroll survey inched up modestly, the household survey recorded a jump of 496,000 jobs in January. Since the trough of the recession in November 2001, it has measured 2.2 million new jobs, compared with the drop of 716,000 jobs in the payroll survey.
 In a statement, Kathleen P. Utgoff, commissioner of the bureau, acknowledged that the agency did not fully understand the reasons for the discrepancy.
 "B.L.S. continues to investigate a number of possible explanations," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Optimismon Growth and Interest Rates Lifts Shares

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks climbed yesterday after a government report on job growth encouraged optimism that the economy was expanding at a pace that would bolster earnings without setting off a rise in interest rates. 
 Shares of companies dependent on a growing economy like the steel maker Allegheny Technologies and Alcoa, the aluminum producer, rose. 
 The jobs report -- coupled with comments Thursday by Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, that the central bank would not rush to increase interest rates -- signaled that the market's 11-month rally would not be slowed by rising borrowing costs, some investors said. 
 "The economy is strong enough to give us good earnings numbers, but the job growth and inflation numbers aren't high enough to cause the Fed to act," said J. Joseph Veranth, who helps oversee $2 billion at Dana Investment Advisors in Brookfield, Wis. "That's good news for the stock market." 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,142.76, with 434 of the benchmark's members and all 10 of its industry groups advancing. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 97.48 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,593.03. The Nasdaq composite index rose 44.45 points, or 2.2 percent, to 2,064.01, its biggest gain since Nov. 24. 
 The S.&P. 500 is up 43 percent since its 2003 low in March. This week, the S.&P. 500 and Dow rose 1 percent. The Nasdaq declined 0.1 percent, its third consecutive weekly drop, the longest string in a year. 
 Allegheny Technologies gained 74 cents, or 8.5 percent, to $9.50. Alcoa rose 70 cents, to $35.07, helping lift basic-materials shares by 2.1 percent.
 Computer-related shares advanced, paced by semiconductor suppliers. The S.&P. 500's information technology index rose 2.2 percent. Teradyne, which sells machines that test chips and circuit boards during production, added $2.32, or 9.5 percent, to $26.77.
 The Philadelphia semiconductor index surged 4.8 percent, its biggest gain since Oct. 28. 
 Goodyear Tire and Rubber rose 74 cents, to $9.97. The company's senior debt ratings were confirmed by Moody's Investors Service, which said the rating outlook for the company was stable. Goodyear expects its bankers to more than double the size of the term loan they will extend to the company, to $650 million. 
 Monsanto rose $1.98, to $32.29. The company, the developer of genetically engineered crops, may be able to collect $50 million in fees this year from sales of soybean seeds that can withstand its Roundup herbicide, Andrew Cash, an analyst at UBS, said. He raised his rating on the stock to buy from neutral.
 PepsiCo added $1.66, to $50.21. Gross margin, or the difference between what it charges for products and the costs to produce them, in PepsiCo's North American snack business is improving, and increased productivity in the beverage business will lead to higher profits, said Andrew J. Conway, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. He upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral. 
 Cigna shed $5.55, to $56.55. The company said that it would eliminate 3,000 jobs and reduce its quarterly dividend to 2.5 cents a share from 33 cents to save money after customer defections reduced fourth-quarter revenue.

HEADLINE: Retiring on a Budget 

BYLINE:  By Robert C. Pozen; Robert C. Pozen is a visiting professor at Harvard Law School.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
In its fiscal 2005 budget, the Bush administration proposes to encourage Americans to save more by creating two private savings accounts. These new entitlements may be worthwhile, but they are also expensive. Congress should not approve them unless the president also agrees to Social Security reform.
 The new accounts, called the Retirement Savings Account and the Lifetime Savings Account, would allow Americans to save for retirement or for major purchases, like a home or a college education. Both accounts would set a maximum contribution of $5,000 per year, allow earnings to build tax-free and permit tax-free withdrawals after a specified age, number of years or for a particular purpose. Most important, these tax benefits would be available without the income limits that apply now to I.R.A.'s. 
 Encouraging middle- and high-wage workers, who would be the most likely users of these accounts, to save more for retirement is good policy -- but only if accompanied by an effort to slow the growth of Social Security benefits. The key to this politically sensitive issue is to recognize that, unlike low-wage workers, middle- and high-wage earners generally go into retirement with personal savings (and in most cases pension income) that supplement their Social Security benefits. By linking reduced Social Security benefits with increased tax incentives for personal savings, it's possible to provide most workers with the same level of total retirement income at a lower cost to the government.
After retirement, Social Security benefits are adjusted annually for all recipients based on changes in prices to protect against inflation, a process known as price indexing. The initial level of benefits at the date of retirement, however, is based on individual workers' average career wages, adjusted upwards by the rate of the national wage increase during their career, a process called wage indexing.
Over the last 50 years, annual wages have grown more than 1 percent faster than prices in the United States. That means that wage indexing typically results in initial Social Security benefits 25 percent to 40 percent higher than a worker would have received under price indexing. In the aggregate, an immediate switch from wage to price indexing would eliminate Social Security's long-term deficit.
So why doesn't the United States move from wage to price indexing of initial Social Security benefits, as countries like Britain do?
The answer is that wage indexing of initial benefits protects what is called the replacement ratio -- the percentage of working wages "replaced" by Social Security in retirement. (If you made $50,000 a year on average in your career, and upon retirement got an annual Social Security benefit of $20,000, your replacement ratio would be 40 percent.) This replacement ratio is critical to low-wage workers, who typically depend primarily on Social Security for retirement income because they often have little in the way of personal savings or private retirement plans.
The solution is to maintain wage indexing of initial Social Security benefits for low-wage workers, while gradually introducing price indexing for middle- and high-wage workers. In 2012, for example, we could maintain wage indexing for all retiring workers with average career earnings of $25,000 per year or less. At the same time, we could have price indexing for all retiring workers with average career earnings of $113,000 per year or more. All workers between $25,000 and $113,000 per year would receive a mix of price and wage indexing based on a proportional formula.
Over the next 75 years, this partial move from wage to price indexing of initial benefits would greatly reduce the long-term deficit of the Social Security trust fund and extend the solvency of the system by decades. Of course, this change would mean slower growth of initial benefits for middle and high earners, although their monthly benefits would still be growing -- by thousands of dollars over the course of decades -- because of price indexing.
Yet these workers could maintain the same level of benefits if they contributed only 1 percent more of their wages to a new I.R.A. like the one president has proposed. The earnings on these yearly contributions, if invested in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds, would very likely make up for the slower growth of these workers' initial Social Security benefits.
In fact, Congress should do more to encourage workers to contribute more to their retirement accounts. The government could match contributions to these accounts, for example, or offer a tax deduction for part of such contributions.
Such a plan wouldn't have to be expensive to have an impact, according to estimates of Watson Wyatt, one of the world's largest actuarial firms. Matching 50 percent of contributions by all workers with annual incomes of $50,000 or lower, for example, and offering higher-wage workers tax deductions of up to $1,000 per year or 1 percent of their annual earnings, whichever is lower, would cost $10 billion to $20 billion per year. This is less than 10 percent of the annual increase in the net accrued liabilities of the Social Security system, which rose by more than $200 billion last year.
The savings plans in the president's budget present Congress with a rare opportunity to take up two related issues -- personal savings and Social Security -- that are too often addressed separately. For Democrats, this proposal would protect Social Security benefits for low-wage workers; for Republicans, it would promote personal savings accounts. And for most Americans, this proposal would offer a reasonable retirement income at a cost the country can afford.

HEADLINE: A Stingy Recovery 

 BODY:
It's a presidential election year, so the economy is being described as both feast and famine. The Bush administration would have you believe that the good times are roaring back, while Democrats paint a bleak picture of a broken nation, about to export its last few jobs to India and China.
 Neither portrait is accurate or conducive to a sound policy debate. Though there is a real recovery under way, the growth has yet to be translated into an equally robust expansion of corporate payrolls. The economy added 112,000 nonfarm jobs for the month -- a decent number, but far below expectations. The administration, which has presided over the loss of some two million jobs, predicted last fall that the economy would soon be creating some 200,000 new jobs a month. That target has not been reached, despite overall economic growth of 6 percent in the second half of 2003. The pace of growth is slowing, in fact, and public anxieties about the job market remain high. 
 It will be interesting to see how the president characterizes the economy when he appears on "Meet the Press" tomorrow. Mr. Bush would be wise to start tempering his triumphalism, lest he appear as out of touch as his father did in 1992. Republicans are stubbornly opposing an extension of federal unemployment benefits. Mr. Bush also exaggerates the short-term stimulative impact of his tax cuts, while denying the long-term threat posed by the resulting deficits.
Because the White House's view of the economy is driven by a political narrative, little effort is made to grapple with some of the thorny questions posed by the slow job growth. Has technology-driven productivity growth and outsourcing placed a new speed limit on the rate of job creation? Can the government raise this speed limit?
The Democrats are enamored of their own narrative of corporate robber barons' conspiring with low-paid overseas workers to destroy the American middle class. So the Democratic candidates also fail to engage the complex reality and are too quick to resort to protectionist demagoguery. 
The Federal Reserve Board, by necessity, is grappling with the new disconnect between tepid job creation and far frothier indicators. Alan Greenspan and his colleagues are keeping short-term interest rates at record-low levels, though earlier this month they signaled that the status quo could not last forever. Unable to indulge in political fables, the Fed, like many Americans, is clearly torn about how to react to this stingy recovery.

HEADLINE: No Relief in Sight for New Haven Line Riders 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Facing a winter of unrelenting breakdowns and delays, Connecticut and Westchester commuters on Metro-North's most troubled line are now being told they will be the last ones to see any replacements for the aging trains that are failing at levels that are angering and frustrating regular riders.
 Railroad officials say that because Connecticut has not come up with money to share the cost of new trains with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the commuters on Metro-North's New Haven line will not be receiving any of the 300 shiny new cars that are supposed to be able to withstand the cold and snow better than the current ones. All those cars will go instead to the Harlem and Hudson lines, even though the New Haven line has the oldest cars and the worst record this winter of keeping cars in service. 
 To make matters worse, Gov. John G. Rowland this week proposed a fare increase of 5.5 percent for Connecticut riders, following a 15 percent fare increase last year for trips from Connecticut to and from New York City. 
"Commuters are a stoic bunch," said Jim Cameron, vice chairman of the Connecticut Metro-North Rail Commuter Council, a watchdog group created by the state's legislature, the General Assembly. "They'll put up with a lot. But this, I think, has broken the back of indifference and everyone who rides the train is angry enough that they are going to take some action now." 
Mr. Cameron said his group's Web site has received three times the usual number of complaints in the past month. Commuters buttonhole him in the station, on the platform, on the train and at cocktail parties. Lawmakers, too, have heard an earful. "The level of frustration is extraordinarily high," said Andrew J. McDonald, a state senator who represents parts of Darien and Stamford. "People are disillusioned and rightfully so."
Service yesterday was typical of recent weeks. Of the New Haven line's 343 cars, 120 were out of service, contributing to the cancellation of 12 trains. About half of those cars would have been removed from service for normal maintenance and inspection, but the other half were awaiting repair from the damaging winter weather, said Daniel Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman.
The New Haven line trains -- many dating to the early 1970's -- are easily damaged by powdery snow, which is ingested by the motor as the train races along. Despite the rising thermometer this past week, the damage from the earlier snowfalls has continued to sideline cars because the repairs are time-consuming. Many parts must be custom-ordered, and there are only 18 service bays for 343 cars.
What makes the New Haven line stand out from the Hudson and Harlem lines is its reliance on two types of power, a catenary wire system in Connecticut and part of Westchester and a third rail line in southern Westchester and New York City.
The overhead wires, the oldest dating to 1913, become brittle in extreme cold, Mr. Brucker said. To preserve them, the railroad cuts train speeds on straightaways from 90 miles an hour to 50 or 60miles per hour. And the overhead arm attaching the train to the wires, which is usually lowered electronically, must sometimes be manually lowered in the ice and snow, "a delay that can easily cost anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes," Mr. Brucker said.
Commuters say the crowded conditions are just as irritating as the tardy and canceled trains. "During rush hour, there are a large number of people standing up," said Ken Weinrib, a lawyer who lives in Mamaroneck, N.Y. "It's like taking a subway for 35 or 40 minutes."
The preliminary findings of a study by the Connecticut Department of Transportation indicated a need for 350 to 400 new cars, at an estimated cost of $4.5 million a car. But officials say any such order will have to wait. "We do not have the money to buy new equipment now," said Harry P. Harris, chief of the agency's bureau of public transportation.
Instead, officials have embarked on a $150 million, seven-year program to rehabilitate 242 antiquated train cars, with 19 completed so far. Mr. Harris said the "rehab program" would "buy an additional 10 years out of the equipment."
Last year the Connecticut General Assembly approved the purchase of new rail cars with 2,000 seats, although not before 2006. That translates roughly into 18 to 20 cars, barely a dent in the overall fleet, critics say.
"Absolutely, it is not enough," Mr. McDonald said of the planned purchase. "There has to be a recognition that train service is no longer a matter of convenience, but of utter necessity. The health of the regional economy is intertwined with this issue."

HEADLINE: Democrats See Weaknesses In Rowland's Budget Plan 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Two days after Gov. John G. Rowland introduced his proposal to adjust the state's budget, prominent Democrats criticized his suggested cuts on Friday and questioned whether he could pay for the increases he had promised.
 The governor, a Republican in his third term, proposes adding almost $179 million to the $14 billion general fund budget adopted for the 2005 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. 
 Two months ago, many legislators predicted that Mr. Rowland would be especially weak during budget negotiations with the Democrat-controlled legislature after he admitted on Dec. 12 that he had lied about accepting free work on his lakeside cottage from people doing business with the state. 
That prediction appeared to have been confirmed on Friday. Although most Democrats said they had not finished studying the governor's proposals in depth, their immediate reaction indicated that his peacemaking gesture of increasing money for some favorite Democratic programs had failed to impress.
"Some of the proposals are clearly a gesture to reach out to the real people of Connecticut, but the question is, can he keep the promise?" said Moira K. Lyons of Stamford, the speaker of the House.
This year's deliberations concern adjustments to a budget adopted last August after a bruising set of negotiations. The General Assembly finally adopted a two-year budget in August, six weeks past the constitutional deadline, approving $13.5 billion for the 2004 fiscal year and $14 billion for the 2005 fiscal year.
The budget adoption followed months of bitter disagreement between Mr. Rowland and the Democrats. He vetoed several Democratic budgets. For eight weeks, the state was without a budget, with Mr. Rowland issuing executive orders to meet expenses. Before the budget was approved, the legislature was called into six special sessions.
In August, the legislature approved $921.7 million for transportation for 2005. The governor proposed cutting that budget by $6.6 million. 
On Wednesday, when Mr. Rowland opened the legislative session, he said his budget proposals support transportation programs started by Ms. Lyons. Butshe said his plan would reduce money in a fund she created last year to ease congested roads, a problem that is particularly critical in Fairfield County.
"Transportation is married to economic development," she said. "I see no need to raid the fund this year, when the state is facing a much smaller deficit than last year." 
When the 2004 fiscal year ends in June, the state is expected to face a $41.1 million deficit. Last fiscal year's deficit would have been as much as $756 million if not for a special session that increased taxes and reduced spending by $650 million.
The governor's proposal calls for $11 million to be cut from the budget of nearly $73 million for magnet schools. Such schools were part of a remedy to address a 1996 court-ordered desegregation of Connecticut schools. The State Supreme Court found that children in urban schools were not offered the same educational opportunity as their suburban peers. About 11,300 children attend 36 magnet schools; some 15,000 are expected to attend 48 schools in 2005.
Thomas P. Gaffey, a Senate Democrat who is chairman of the Education Committee, said the proposal undercut the court order. "Magnet schools were the marquee response to the Supreme Court decision, and to have to cut the programs so drastically is troublesome," he said.
But Marc S. Ryan, who prepares the governor's budget, said the reduction was misunderstood. Fewer magnet schools than expected were created for the 2005 fiscal year, saving about $4 million. About $7 million is saved by compelling the City of Hartford to pay more of its share of the cost of sending its children to magnet schools. Mr. Ryan said the city has been unfairly getting about $3,000 more state money per child each year than other cities.
To help close the deficit, Mr. Rowland proposes raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and other tobacco products by April 1. The increase is expected to yield $35.4 million.
But Martin M. Looney, a Democrat who is the Senate majority leader, said an increase in such taxes could make Connecticut merchants less competitive than those in neighboring states. Rather, Senate Democrats plan to revive the so-called millionaire's tax, devised last year but ultimately defeated. (Instead, taxes were raised to 5 percent from 4.5 percent on incomes across the board.)
The Democratic plan would increase taxes by 1 percent on any income over $500,000 for individuals and over $1 million for couples. Mr. Looney estimated that such an increase would raise $170 million a year in revenue. "The additional tax liability on this income would be offset by the federal tax structures that benefit such earners," he said.
In a move that might have pleased Democrats in a year when Mr. Rowland was less vulnerable, the governor's budget sits just $58 million under a spending cap required by the State Constitution. In other years, the margin was as high as $100 million.
Mr. Ryan dismissed the Democrats' criticism as merely their first impression. "No doubt they will come up with a few plans of their own," he said, "but when is all said and done, they'll see our budget is the best."

HEADLINE: U.S. Cites 'Excellent Progress' With Libya 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
The United States said Friday that it was making "excellent progress" with Libya in carrying out that country's decision to end its illicit weapon and missile programs and that curbs on travel by Americans and other sanctions could soon be lifted.
 The announcement was made after a meeting in London between Libyan officials and William J. Burns, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. 
A meeting of Libyan, American and British officials had taken place earlier. 
 After Libya agreed in December to end its weapons programs and to pay $2.7 billion to relatives of the 270 people killed in the 1988 downing of a Pan American jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, the United Nations formally lifted its sanctions.
The United States, however, said it would not follow suit until Libya began carrying out that agreement and took other actions against militant groups that would lead to its removal from the American list of countries that sponsored terrorism.
Mr. Burns and the Libyan officials "discussed additional ways to increase contacts," including the possibility of lifting restrictions on the use of American passports for travel to Libya and letting American citizens engage in commercial transactions during their travels there.
The announcement also said the United States would pursue the possibility of sending medical and educational teams. Also discussed was the possibility of economic aid.

HEADLINE: U.N. Gets Pledges to Rebuild War-Torn Liberia 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
An international conference here to raise funds to rebuild war-ravaged Liberia ended Friday, with donations of $520 million exceeding organizers' ambitions. 
 The two-day conference, sponsored by the United Nations, the United States and the World Bank, had set a goal of at least $488 million, which organizers estimated was needed to meet urgent reconstruction needs over the next two years. Liberia emerged last summer from years of relentless war. 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, addressing the conference after a weather-delayed arrival from Washington, said, "Liberia's successful reconstruction would send a powerful message to other long-troubled parts of Africa that the international community will stand behind those who seize the opportunity for peace and who set the course for democracy and sustainable development."
He spoke of the critical need to find a place in society for the thousands of children who were armed and pressed into combat.
At a news conference, Mr. Powell was also asked about the decision this week by Pakistan's president, Gen. Perez Musharraf, to pardon A. Q. Khan, the father of that country's nuclear program who admitted selling nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
"The action that he took with respect to pardoning Mr. Khan is something that he felt was appropriate for him to do," Mr. Powell said, "and he has explained his position thoroughly."
But Mr. Powell said he expected to speak with General Musharraf "to make sure there is a full understanding of what the A. Q. Khan network has done over the years, so that there are no remnants of it left."
Secretary General Kofi Annan, too, was asked separately by reporters about whether the steps General Musharraf took were enough. 
"The Khan situation, I know, sounds rather odd if you're going to deal firmly, but he's the president and the country has to manage its own national situation," he said.
But Mr. Annan added, "What is important is the commitment that they are going to plug the loopholes and deal with everyone involved severely -- that it's respected." 
In an introductory speech to the donors' conference for Liberia, he urged the delegates to "seize this opportunity to end a long-running nightmare that has disgraced humankind."
Many apparently were persuaded. Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said, "We hear a lot these days about donor fatigue, but there was no evidence of donor fatigue here today."
Gyude Bryant, chairman of Liberia's transitional government, said that with the aid his administration would pursue its goals of disarming and reintegrating combatants, reforming of the security services, maintaining public sector accountability, aiding refugees and preparing for elections in October 2005.
"Liberia will rise again," he said, prompting a standing ovation from the delegates, who represented 96 countries and 45 organizations.
United Nations envoys reported to the conference that almost all of Liberia's 3.3 million residents have been profoundly affected, with half of them displaced from their homes.
The unusual step that the United Nations took of focusing such fund- raising energy on Liberia alone reflected international concern that continued instability there could endanger the entire volatile region. 
Under its exiled leader, Charles G. Taylor, Liberia was a catalyst for civil wars and bloodshed throughout West Africa, an area with particularly porous borders.
The United States had earmarked $200 million for Liberia on top of $90 million already spent there, Mr. Powell told the delegates. He also pledged $245 million toward a peacekeeping force.

HEADLINE: Bush Decides To Enter Fray On TV Show 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
With his poll numbers slipping and Democrats attacking him and his credibility over the failure so far to find any banned weapons in Iraq, President Bush has decided to strike back. He will throw his first punch in the rough and tumble of a ring familiar to all candidates for high office: a Sunday morning news show.
 White House officials said the president had chosen to appear on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday to make a case that he has done well in handling the challenges of terrorism and a weak economy, and to bring the political debate back to the ground he wants to fight on. 
 "The president's very eager to go out and talk about his policies, the actions he's taken and why it's making the nation more secure," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. "He's more than comfortable talking about those decisions and he believes the country wants to hear from the president about these issues." 
But Republicans allied with Mr. Bush's re-election campaign said there was a heavy dose of politics behind the decision as well. As he faces intensifying pressure on weapons in Iraq, they said, it is more urgent that Mr. Bush go on the offensive. After saying for months that he was too busy dealing with the nation's business to descend into the partisan wars, Mr. Bush and his top advisers have concluded that the risk of remaining on the defensive outweighed the risk of dropping the pose that he was above politics and appearing on television in candidate mode, Republicans said.
Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush told him on Tuesday that he wanted to appear on "Meet the Press." Republican officials said Mr. Bush was eager to send a message that he is not afraid to take tough questions from the moderator, Tim Russert.
"He's been chomping at the bit for a while to get into the fray," said Charlie Black, a veteran Republican strategist who has close ties to the White House. "There's no better place to show you can answer the criticisms and put them behind you than on Russert."
Mr. Bartlett played down any suggestion that Mr. Russert presented Mr. Bush with a critical test. He said the president had requested some briefing material and had run over some likely questions with his senior staff on Friday afternoon, but otherwise was not engaging in any intensive preparations for the interview, which is to be taped at the White House on Saturday.
Mr. Bush's appearance will come after weeks of developments that, in the view of some Republicans, undermined the president's political strength and demanded an assertive effort by the White House to get back on track as the campaign heats up.
Mr. Bush's proposal for a return to the moon and a manned mission to Mars fell flat, they said. He got no bounce in the polls from his State of the Union address. He came under unusual criticism from economic conservatives in his own party over continued big increases in government spending and the rise in the budget deficit. Faced with a storm over the use of prewar intelligence about Iraq's weapons, Mr. Bush appointed a commission on Friday to study the issue, taking some of the gloss off the commander-in-chief persona that his political team had hoped to make central to his campaign.
At the same time, the Democrats began to coalesce around their front-runner, Senator John Kerry, allowing them to focus increasingly on attacking Mr. Bush rather than each other. With Mr. Kerry's emergence as the front-runner came another problem for the administration: the comparison, highlighted by Democrats, between Mr. Kerry's record as a Vietnam war hero and the questions about whether Mr. Bush fulfilled all his duties as a National Guard pilot in the same period.
"We always knew that as the Democratic race reached a peak it would focus coverage on the criticisms of the president," Mr. Black said. "At the same time, several other issues put the president on the defensive. It would have been smart strategy to go back on the offensive once the Democratic nominee emerged, but with these other things happening, the sooner the better."
Republicans involved with the Bush-Cheney campaign said the appearance on "Meet the Press" marked the start of a more aggressive phase of the campaign. The campaign's strategists are making final decisions on the shape and timing of an advertising campaign that will probably go on the air within weeks, Republican officials said. 
Campaign officials said Mr. Bush's appearance on "Meet the Press" was not a sign of panic or of any change in basic strategy.
"We're 269 days from the election, and that's several political lifetimes," said Terry Holt, the Bush campaign's spokesman. "If you've heard anything from the Bush campaign over the past 10 months, it's been that we expect a close race, and that's still operative."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES; 
Report EasesSome Fears That Rates Will Rise Soon

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks and bonds rallied yesterday on a January jobs report that offered something for investors in both equities and Treasuries.
 While the government reported the addition of 112,000 jobs, the increase was less than the 175,000 expected, a positive for bonds because slower growth means interest rates will rise more slowly. But the report was still the biggest monthly job gain in three years, a positive for stocks because more jobs mean more consumer spending. 
 Such a market response is not unusual at a time when investors are expecting a significant change in policy by the Federal Reserve -- in this case, a rise in interest rates -- but are confused about the timing. 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 97.48 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,593.03, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,142.76. The Nasdaq composite index finished 44.45 points, or 2.2 percent higher, at 2,064.01. All three market gauges, however, are still below the highs touched last month.
In the Treasury market, the price of the 10-year note rose 23/32, to 10112/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.08 percent from 4.17 percent Thursday. 
Several analysts said the smaller-than-expected job growth meant that the Fed would be able to wait a little longer before it finally begins raising its benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks, which is at a 45-year low of 1 percent.
"This morning's data was a signal that people could take their fingers away from the panic button," said Ward McCarthy, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
A small change in sentiment was also reflected in the fall of the yields on futures contracts on the federal funds rate. 
The dollar plunged 1.2 percent against the euro, another sign that many investors decided that the weaker job data made action by the Fed less imminent for now. In late trading, the euro was worth $1.2697, up from $1.2542 on Thursday.
At the same time, the job growth, while not as robust as expected, does show that hiring is picking up, which is crucial for the consumer spending that is powering the economic rebound and the growth in corporate earnings. 
Over the last five months, 366,000 jobs have been created, compared with a loss of 517,000 in the previous 12 months. 
Mr. McCarthy said that bonds also rallied yesterday because bond dealers came into work after selling a lot of Treasury bonds and notes in anticipation of a sell-off after a strong jobs number.
Some were apparently foreseeing a stronger-than-expected report after comments on Thursday from Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor. In a speech in South Carolina, Mr. Bernanke said that hiring would increase to meet growing demand. "I am pretty confident we'll see some big numbers fairly soon," he said, according to Bloomberg News. 
In addition, dealers had reduced their inventories of Treasury securities ahead of next week's Treasury auctions, when they expect to buy up the new issues.
So when the jobs number was weaker than expected, "it was a pleasant surprise," Mr. McCarthy said, and dealers bought Treasury securities.
Fed officials contributed to the uncertainty about their intentions in the statement they released Jan. 28, after their most recent policy meeting. In that statement, the central bank removed what had been a security blanket for investors: a promise to keep the benchmark interest rate low as the economy picked up steam.
That pledge was made in August, when members of the Federal Open Market Committee added these words to a statement after their meeting: "The committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period."
Fed officials replaced the "considerable period" language with a promise to be "patient" with any move to raise its short-term interest rate benchmark.
Mr. McCarthy called this a "baby step" toward a rate increase that has put the market on edge because participants now have to reassess their expectations for the timing of the rate increase based on the strength or weakness of each month's economic data.
"This subtle change has elevated the significance of these data releases," he said. "It means that market players will be continually revising their expectations as to the timing of the rate increase."
This means that the stock and bond markets could be volatile over the next several months as investors decide to buy one day when new economic data appears to delay Fed action and then sell the next day when new data appears to make a rate increase more imminent.

HEADLINE: The Nixon Recovery 

BYLINE:  By Charles R. Morris; Charles R. Morris is the author, most recently, of "Money, Greed and Risk."

 BODY:
Yesterday's good news on the job front, on top of strong growth in the last half of 2003, may finally signal that President Bush's economic recovery is on solid ground. There is still plenty to worry about. Unused production capacity continues to drag down business profits, and job growth, while finally rebounding, remains slow. Consumers have loaded up on debt and could be devastated by a spike in interest rates. But the economic tea leaves are more positive than they have been for a long time.
 If President Bush can maintain the recovery through his re-election campaign, he will be in rarefied company. Richard M. Nixon, in fact, may be the only recent president to accomplish this feat, timing a recovery from a midterm recession to coincide with his 1972 race. The reason this is sohard is that, despite all the bragging about creating jobs or speeding growth, presidents really have few economic tools at their disposal. Most federal spending is outside a president's direct control -- locked up in things like retirement programs that chug along pretty much by themselves. The same is true of taxes and interest rates. A president can set the agenda, but taxes are ultimately controlled by Congress. Interest rates fall under the domain of the independent Federal Reserve. 
 Yet Nixon proved that if a president plays his weak hand ruthlessly -- without restraint or regard for long-term consequences -- he can make the economy sit up and roll over at his command. In the end, of course, the Nixon "recovery" was short-lived and America soon paid a steep price for it. Unfortunately, Mr. Bush's economic performance so far is eerily similar.
Back in the early 1970's, with both high inflation and slow growth, Nixon's economic challenge may have been even more intractable than Mr. Bush's. So, with his re-election in jeopardy, Nixon and his Treasury secretary, John B. Connally, bludgeoned both the Congress and Federal Reserve into a truly radical experiment. Congress passed wage and price controls and the Federal Reserve simultaneously increased the money supply.
The gamble was that a big jolt of money would rev up the economy while the price controls would suppress inflation. It worked, allowing Nixon to win in 1972. But success came at a huge cost. Once the price controls were removed through 1973 and 1974, all the suppressed inflation came roaring out, hitting the double digits and plaguing the second half of the 1970's. Worse, the resulting collapse of the dollar led to the 1973 OPEC "oil price shock." Altogether, it was one of history's most expensive election campaigns.
Many analysts worry that a Bush-style recovery could be similarly catastrophic. Taking a page from the Nixon playbook, Mr. Bush has wielded his fiscal tools aggressively. Over the last two years, there has been a half-trillion dollar swing in the federal books, from a $100 billion surplus in 2001 to a deficit of about $400 billion in 2003, and an expected $521 trillion in red ink for 2004.
The deficits have been driven by deep tax cuts and unrestrained spending. That includes big increases for domestic security, but other initiatives as well, like a generous new subsidy program for industrial farmers. On the surface, this looks like a standard, if unusually forceful, application of textbook economics. The government is supposed to run deficits in slack times and stash away surpluses during the fat years. So why the worries? Mr. Bush's program, like Nixon's, is not the textbook one-time kick in the pants, but a rejection of a half-century's consensus on the proper management of a modern economy. 
The Bush program was not originally intended as a response to the recession. Instead, it was just the opening wedge of an unprecedented 10-year program to eliminate virtually all taxes on businesses and investment income, on the theory that everyone's better off when investors are well fed. The administration, in fact, first justified its program as necessary to head off high federal surpluses, then opportunistically switched the argument when the recession started to bite hard. The tax cuts, moreover, have come at a time when federal taxes, as a share of gross domestic product, are already at their lowest level since 1959.
President Bush's planners claim that budgets will be back in balance within the decade. But a recent Brookings Institution study makes those calculations look like sleight of hand. To keep cost estimates down, for example, the administration has built "sunset" provisions into almost all of its tax cut programs. In theory, when the sunset dates arrive, the tax law will switch back to its pre-Bush status. Fat chance. The administration itself is pushing hard to abolish all the sunset provisions. The Brookings analysts foresee deficits increasing every year for the next decade, with total red ink around $8 trillion.
The consequences of that could be bad enough -- higher interest rates and declining competitiveness and growth. But it gets worse. In the coming years, baby boomers will start making their first claims on Social Security and Medicare. There is no way the country can run deficits on the scale of the Brookings forecasts and decent retirement programs at the same time. Boomers do not take rejection with good grace, and their tolerance will not improve as they get older. From the perspective of 2010 or so, citizens may look back on the post-Nixon 1970's as halcyon days.

HEADLINE: BUSH SETS PANEL ON INTELLIGENCE BEFORE IRAQ WAR 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush created a bipartisan commission on Friday to investigate the quality of the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war and to address problems posed by weapons proliferation. He gave the panel until March 2005, well after the November elections, to submit its conclusions.
 Mr. Bush selected Charles S. Robb, the former Democratic senator and governor from Virginia, and Laurence H. Silberman, a Republican appeals court judge who was named to his job by President Ronald Reagan, as chairmen of the commission. 
 The president named an eclectic group to serve on the panel, including Lloyd N. Cutler, a former confidant of President Bill Clinton, and Senator John McCain, Mr. Bush's bitter rival for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination. Only one, Adm. William O. Studeman, a former deputy director of central intelligence, brings extensive professional experience in intelligence matters.
Mr. Bush had strongly resisted the idea of appointing such a panel. He relented last weekend, however, under pressure from both parties, as the inability of American inspectors to find evidence of illicit weapons in Iraq emerged as a political liability. 
In a hastily arranged appearance in the White House briefing room on Friday afternoon, Mr. Bush said the commission will "look at American intelligence capabilities, especially our intelligence about weapons of mass destruction."
Along with a speech on Thursday by George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, Mr. Bush's decision to name the panel represents an implicit acknowledgment that the prewar intelligence assessment that Iraq possessed illicit weapons may have included serious misjudgments.
With the panel not due to report its findings until March 2005, the naming of the commission may also help Mr. Bush to deflect election-year questions about why and how the administration and the intelligence community misread the Iraqi threat. But the panel's lack of experts in the murky world of intelligence gathering drew some immediate criticism.
"These are certainly prominent and well-respected Americans," said Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency. "But it is in my view unfortunate that there are no former cabinet officers, no former commanders in chief and no former senior ambassadors on the panel. This is a group that has limited experience in dealing with intelligence and foreign policy at the highest levels."
On the campaign trail and in Congress, Democrats swiftly questioned whether the panel appointed by Mr. Bush would delve sufficiently into whether the president and his top aides misused intelligence in building a case for war against Iraq. 
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, issued a statement saying that "I still believe we need a comprehensive, genuinely independent inquiry to provide our troops and all Americans the answers they deserve."
Others named to the panel include Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale University, and Patricia M. Wald, a Democrat who is a former appeals court judge who left the court to sit on an international tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
Two other members of what will be a nine-person group will be named later, Mr. Bush said.
In a written statement on Friday night, Mr. Robb said he looked forward to conducting "an independent review and assessment" of intelligence efforts.
In a separate statement, Judge Silberman said, "The country and the president must maintain confidence in the intelligence community, and I will do all I can to serve that goal."
American intelligence agencies are already under scrutiny from the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are examining their work on Iraq, and from the Congressionally appointed commission that is looking into the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. Some of those inquiries may be completed before the presidential election in November.
Even so, the commission's extensive mandate gives its review of American intelligence agencies the potential to be the most significant since the inquiry completed in 1976 by the Senate select committee headed by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho. 
Mr. Bush said the panel would be allowed complete access to intelligence agencies and to the work of the Iraq Survey Group, which is continuing its hunt for weapons in Iraq. He said it would seek "to figure out why" prewar intelligence about Iraq's illicit weapons had not yet been confirmed by facts on the ground.
More broadly, Mr. Bush said, the group "will examine intelligence on weapons of mass destruction and related 21st-century threats and issue specific recommendations to ensure our capabilities are strong." He said its work would include a look at intelligence on weapons programs in North Korea, Libya, Afghanistan and Iran. Mr. Bush did not mention Pakistan, which has emerged as the base for a black market for nuclear weapons materials. 
The Church committee, which looked into abuses involving intelligence activities and recommended reforms for the future, was composed almost entirely of senators with extensive experience in intelligence matters, including Mr. Church, then the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, John Tower of Texas, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee and Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota.
The White House said over the weekend that the new commission would include people with extensive experience as producers and consumers of intelligence, and it had widely been expected in Washington that its members might include former directors of central intelligence or national security advisers.
But in naming two judges and a lawyer to the panel, Mr. Bush may have been acknowledging the intersections between intelligence and the law in a time in which individuals, rather than countries, have increasingly emerged as American foes. Judge Wald was a candidate to become attorney general in the Clinton administration.
Among other members, both Mr. Robb and Mr. McCain have served on Congressional committees that oversee intelligence agencies within the military and the intelligence community. Mr. Levin, the Yale president, is an economist and Rhodes scholar who attended Oxford University with Mr. Clinton and was President Bush's first overnight guest at the White House.
Mr. Bush created the commission by executive order, a step that deprived Congress of a role in choosing its members. A draft of the order that was released by the White House on Friday night said the commission would examine "whether American intelligence agencies are sufficiently authorized, organized, equipped, trained and financed to identify and warn in a timely manner" and able to support American responses to "the development and transfer of knowledge, expertise, technologies, materials, and resources" associated with illicit weapons and related threats of the 21st century.

RobbMr. Robb, 64, a Democrat and the son-in-law of President Lyndon B. Johnson, is a former governor and senator from Virginia, who won a second term as senator in 1994 even after admitting he had acted inappropriately with a woman who was not his wife. He was defeated for a third term in 2000 by another former governor, George Allen. Before his political career, he served nine years in the Marines, including a combat tour in Vietnam, where he won a Bronze Star. Laurence H. SilbermanJudge Silberman, 68, works part-time on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, and is one of three judges who sit on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a body that hears appeals in matters of intelligence gathering. Considered a stalwart conservative, he was a senior foreign policy and intelligence adviser to the 1980 Reagan-Bush campaign, playing a role in a meeting with an Iranian emissary in an effort to have 52 American hostages released a month before the election. Lloyd N. CutlerA lawyer and the son of a lawyer, Mr. Cutler, 86, served as a senior adviser to two Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and now serves as senior counsel in the law firm he founded, Wilmer Cutler & Pickering. He was instrumental in helping Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, navigate through the peak years of the Whitewater investigation, which failed to produce any charges against the Clintons. Under Mr. Carter, he helped to win Senate ratification of the SALT II treaty. Richard C. LevinMr. Levin, 56, has been the president of Yale University, President Bush's alma mater, since 1993. A Democrat, he received a bachelor's degree from Stanford, studied politics and philosophy at Oxford University, where he became friends with Bill Clinton, and earned a doctorate in economics from Yale in 1974. He also serves on the National Academy of Sciences' board on science, technology and economic policy. John McCainSenator McCain, 67, a Republican from Arizona and member of the Armed Services Committee, ran against President Bush for the nomination in 2000. He was a strong supporter of the invasion of Iraq. A former Navy pilot who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he sponsored the current campaign finance law and pursues efforts to curb wasteful government spending. William O. StudemanMr. Studeman, 64, is a senior executive at Northrop Grumman, a military contractor, and a retired Navy admiral. He was director of naval intelligence in the Reagan administration; director of the National Security Agency in the first Bush administration; and deputy director of the central intelligence in the Bush and Clinton administrations until 1995. Patricia M. WaldBefore she served a two-year term on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, hearing cases of warcrimes, Judge Wald, 75, spent two decades on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the last five years as chief judge. She was an assistant attorney general in the Carter administration but twice took herself out of consideration to be attorney general in the Clinton administration, insisting that a job with such political pressures did not suit her.

HEADLINE: Nigeria in Probe Of Halliburton 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Nigeria on Friday ordered an investigation into allegations that a Halliburton subsidiary paid $180 million in bribes to land a natural gas project contract here. Vice President Dick Cheney was head of Halliburton at the time. 
 The allegations are already under scrutiny in the United States and France. Inquiries by the United States Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission were disclosed this week. 
 President Olusegun Obasanjo has ordered a "high-level investigation" into the allegations, a presidential spokeswoman, Remi Oyo, said here in the capital. Ms. Oyo said the investigation was being led by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
The $4 billion Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Plant was built in the 1990's by a consortium that included Kellogg Brown & Root, a unit of Halliburton.
Cathy Gist, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, said that the Nigerian government had not notified the company of the investigation and that Halliburton did not have reason to assume any of its employees had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The act bars American businesses and individuals from bribing foreign officials.
Ms. Gist said the company would cooperate with investigations by American officials.

THE CHEATING CULTURE
Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong
to Get Ahead.
By David Callahan.
353 pp. New York:
Harcourt. $26.
 LET the wonkfest begin! Because the money culture of the past decade was so chimerical, it is now time to consider what hit us, what the effects are and most important, why, when so many people got so rich, those of us who spend our lives reading books were so rarely among them. In the last few months Paul Krugman, a columnist at this newspaper, weighed in with his polemical collection "The Great Unraveling: Losing Our Way In the New Century," and Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi offered "The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke." Both books marshaled compelling statistics and anecdotes into reasons to feel impoverished, or feel better about already feeling that way. And both belong to a little-discussed subgenre of well-constructed, civic-minded books you take on airplanes only to wish in midflight that you'd brought a saucy novel instead. 
Gregg Easterbrook, a senior editor at The New Republic, and David Callahan, a founder of a policy center called Demos, enter the fray with well-constructed, civic-minded books full of compelling statistics and anecdotes. Easterbrook writes that the rising prosperity of the last 50 years made almost everything so much better for almost everybody that it is sheer perversity -- abetted by Freud, tabloid television and Thomas Pynchon -- to feel bad about most anything. Callahan argues that the winner-take-all ethos of the recent boom has bred dishonesty from the classroom to the boardroom, making life worse for almost everybody.
By the rules of the subgenre, the opening chapters of these books come on like crisp newsmagazine features, full of dash and numbers, followed by voluminous examples that basically make the same points, and capped with center-left prescriptions that could have been arrived at without all the bother. Specifically, both call for a higher minimum wage, broader health coverage and tighter corporate oversight. 
Easterbrook begins with a convincing case for good cheer. More Americans grow up with both parents, better health care, less physical toil, more leisure time, cleaner air and water, bigger homes, higher literacy rates and more cable channels than ever before. Average families now enjoy the privileges recently reserved for the rich: access to college, long life expectancies, fancy vacations, home ownership, central air conditioning and a fleet of cars in the garage. "Why do so many walk around scowling, rather than smiling at their good fortune in being born into the present generation?" he asks. Even the poor get too much to eat. 
When he turns to the other half of his paradox, that people are not happy, it is as if to another book. Ignoring an obvious connection -- that this dissatisfaction is a cause of economic growth, not just a symptom -- he dives into the delightfully named fields of "happiness math" and "forgiveness studies." According to the data, once people reach a threshold of about $10,000 a year per person, money has little to do with contentment. People are happy if they are optimistic, grateful and forgiving. He quotes an expert in gratitude research: "if you only think about your disappointments and unsatisfied wants, you may be prone to unhappiness. If you're fully aware of your disappointments but at the same time thankful for the good that has happened and for your chance to live, you may show higher indices of well-being." In other words, if you look on the bright side, you'll see more light. So much for the hundreds of paragraphs about wealth and health that came before. Easterbrook's prescriptions -- a $10-an- hour minimum wage, more foreign aid, lower tariffs on imports -- ignore what he has just said about happiness. These reforms might improve life for millions, but the rising taxes and retail prices he accepts in return are unlikely to make average Americans feel optimistic or grateful. 
Callahan, too, begins with a full quiver. From the adults around the Little League star Danny Almonte who lied about the boy's age, to the looters at Enron, WorldCom and Tyco, cheating scandals have filled the news. Though Callahan concedes in a postscript that no one really knows whether such cheating is on the rise -- no small concession, given his project -- he makes the case that high payoffs for winners and weak punishments for offenders have combined to encourage dishonesty among students, doctors, lawyers, taxpayers, auto mechanics, job applicants, stock analysts, file sharers and corporate executives. In a society obsessed with the bottom line, he writes, "The message isn't just that the world is unfair and the rich can get away with murder; it's that people who cut corners get ahead." Recent scandals involving mutual fund chiselers and steroid use among baseball players seem timed for the sequel. 
Callahan invokes a lost age of corporate altruism. He quotes Krugman that before the deregulation of the 1970's, "America's great corporations behaved more like socialist republics than like cutthroat capitalist enterprises, and top executives behaved more like public-spirited bureaucrats than like captains of industry." Even if this portrait were accurate, who would want our economic engines to follow socialist republics, given the way things worked out? Callahan's proposed remedies -- an $8.50 minimum wage, affordable health care, increased financial aid for college, ethics curricula in professional schools, a tougher S.E.C. -- are bigger than the problems they're meant to fix, however seriously you take Little League cheating. 
Though both of these books are relentlessly big picture, they resist the bigger picture -- which is how their isolated riffs fit into the greater symphony of the boom. The anecdotes and statistics shut out competing theses rather than tackle the mess that the boom so manifestly was. There's no use weighing which view is right, because both take on only a small bit of turf, and because they arrive at the same solutions. In either case, an in-flight movie wouldn't hurt.

 OUT OF GAS
The End of the Age of Oil.
By David Goodstein.
Illustrated. 140 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $21.95.
 IF all you knew about David Goodstein was the title of his book, you might imagine him to be one of those insufferably enthusiastic prophets of doom, the flannel-shirted, off-the-grid types who take too much pleasure in letting us know that the environment is crumbling all around us. But Goodstein, a physicist, vice provost of the California Institute of Technology and an advocate of nuclear power, is no muddled idealist. And his argument is based on the immutable laws of physics.
The age of oil is ending, he says. The supply will soon begin to decline, precipitating a global crisis. Even if we substitute coal and natural gas for some of the oil, we will start to run out of fossil fuels by the end of the century. "And by the time we have burned up all that fuel," he writes, "we may well have rendered the planet unfit for human life. Even if human life does go on, civilization as we know it will not survive." 
He's talking about 100 years from now, far enough in the future, you might say, that we needn't worry for generations. Surely some technological fix will be in place by then, some new source of energy, some breakthrough. But with a little luck, many readers of these pages will live until 2030 or 2040, or longer. Their children may live until 2070 or 2080, and their grandchildren will easily survive into the 22nd century. We're talking about a time in the lives of our grandchildren, not some warp drive, Star Trek future.
And what about that technological fix? "There is no single magic bullet that will solve all our energy problems," Goodstein writes. "Most likely, progress will lie in incremental advances on many simultaneous fronts." We might finally learn to harness nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun, or to develop better nuclear reactors, or to improve the efficiency of the power grid. But those advances will require a "massive, focused commitment to scientific and technological research. That is a commitment we have not yet made." Drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, and scouring the energy resources of national lands across the West might help the constituents of Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and Vice President Dick Cheney's friends in the energy industry, but it won't solve the problem.
Goodstein's predictions are based on a sophisticated understanding of physics and thermodynamics, and on a simple observation about natural resources. The supply of any natural resource follows a bell curve, increasing rapidly at first, then more slowly, eventually peaking and beginning to decline. Oil will, too.
It has already happened in the United States. In 1956, Marion King Hubbert, a geophysicist with the Shell Oil Company, predicted that oil production in the United States would peak sometime around 1970. His superiors at Shell dismissed the prediction, as did most others in the oil business. But he was right. Hubbert's peak occurred within a few years of when he said it would, and American oil production has been declining ever since. There was no crisis, because this country tapped the world's reserves, and the supply increased along with demand.
Now Goodstein and many others have shown that the same methods,when applied to global oil production and resources, predict a Hubbert's peak in world oil supplies within this decade, or, in the best-case scenarios, sometime in the next. Once that happens, the world supply of oil will begin to decline gradually, even though large quantities of oil will remain in the ground. The world demand for oil will continue to increase. The gap between supply and demand will grow. But this time the gap will be real; there will be no other source of oil (from the moon, Neptune or Pluto?) to flow into the system.
When the supply falls and the demand rises, the price will go up. That's no problem, economists say. With the high price, companies will go after more costly oil, and the market will take care of things.
Maybe not, Goodstein replies. "In an orderly, rational world, it might be possible for the gradually increasing gap between supply and demand for oil to be filled by some substitute. But anyone who remembers the oil crisis of 1973 knows that we don't live in such a world, especially when it comes to an irreversible shortage of oil." 
In the best-case scenario, he writes, we can squeak through a bumpy transition to a natural-gas economy while nuclear power plants are built to get us past the oil crisis. In the worst case, "runaway inflation and worldwide depression leave many billions of people with no alternative but to burn coal in vast quantities for warmth, cooking and primitive industry." 
President Bush has pointed to hydrogen as the ultimate answer to our need for transportation fuels, but Goodstein correctly points out that hydrogen is not a source of energy. It is a fuel produced by using energy. We can use coal to produce it, or solar power, or something else, but it is only a way of converting energy into a form that can be used in vehicles; it doesn't do anything to ease the transition away from oil.
"Out of Gas" -- a book that is more powerful for being brief -- takes a detour to explain some of the basics of energy budgets, thermodynamics and entropy, and it does so with the clarity and gentle touch of a master teacher. 
Then Goodstein gets back on message. Even nuclear power is only a short-term solution. Uranium, too, has a Hubbert's peak, and the current known reserves can supply the earth's energy needs for only 25 years at best. There are other nuclear fuels, and solar and wind power might help at the fringes. But "the best, most conservative bet for ameliorating the coming fuel crisis is the gradual improvement of existing technologies," he writes. We can improve the efficiency of lights, tap solar power with cheap photoelectric cells and turn to nuclear power. The problem is that we have not made a national or global commitment to do so. "Unfortunately, our present national and international leadership is reluctant even to acknowledge that there is a problem. The crisis will occur, and it will be painful." 
I hope Goodstein is wrong. I wish we could dismiss him as an addled environmentalist, too much in love with his windmill to know which way the wind is blowing. On the strength of the evidence, and his argument, however, we can't. If he's right, I'm sorry for my kids. And I'm especially sorry for theirs.

 WITCH-HUNT
The Mysteries of
the Salem Witch Trials.
By Marc Aronson.
Atheneum, $18.95.
(Ages 12 and up)
 Marc Aronson's "Witch-Hunt: Mysteries of the Salem Witch Trials," a highly readable narrative, dramatizes the old story and interweaves new historical interpretations. Aronson tries to help readers understand the enchanted world of the 17th century and the way fear and faith produced not caution and mercy but a contagious desire to punish. He sets the tale in the context of what the historian Richard Hofstadter called the paranoid style in our political history. Aronson's interventions cannot make the events in Salem exactly transparent, but he evokes the ways that incomprehension coupled with increasing terror can make us betray our legal safeguards and, ultimately, our better selves.
Aronson establishes essential historical context deftly -- a sudden and destabilizing political vacuum in colonial Massachusetts; violent strife between European settlers and Indians on the colony's northern border; and the growing divide in Salem between an economically dynamic, increasingly secular merchant class who supplied most of the accused and a poorer, more traditional agricultural sector, from among whose members came most of the accusers. 
There is background and motivation for familiar characters like the Indian (not black) slave, Tituba; the young accusers, Betty Parris, Abigail Williams and the sinister and potent 12-year-old Ann Putnam; and a portrait of the ghostbusting Cotton Mather as a young man. The judges' willingness to believe wild young women with unsubstantiated stories and unseen demons, the mounting number of executions, the moral struggles of the accused between protecting their lives and serving the truth are vividly told. While Aronson offers a number of recent historians' insights, the process through which the fear of evil shifted shape into evil itself remains ultimately, and tragically, intractable to reason.

Unpredictable Skies Still Loom for Airlines

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
THE nation's airlines were optimistic that 2004 would be the best year yet in what has been a difficult decade. Instead, the year has gotten off to a turbulent start, both for the airlines and their customers. 
 The major carriers thought the fledgling economic rebound might result in good winter results that would finally bring them back to break-even levels, and allow them to raise fares. Instead, the year began in chaos, both because of security scares overseas that forced delays and cancellations, and bad weather that gripped much of the United States. And the big airlines face the prospect of even more unsettled skies because of competition from low-fare carriers, which are planning to expand service on the East Coast and across the country. 
 Meanwhile, passengers, who were hoping that the air-travel experience was finally going to smooth out, must now deal with the fact that it may not. While they are being bombarded with offers of cheap fares, meant to make flying more attractive, they also have to face the uncertainty that their trips may not go off as planned. 
For both the industry and its customers, uncertainty is becoming the norm, and flexibility a watchword. 
"I think this year is going to be another tough year" for improving financial performance, said Larry Kellner, the president of Continental Airlines, who will succeed Continental's colorful chief executive, Gordon Bethune, at the end of 2004.
For Continental, and the rest of the industry, this year presents a number of challenges. The airlines are grappling not only with security issues but also with soaring jet fuel prices that they are trying to pass along to consumers, who simply refuse to pay more to cover higher costs.
Nor do they have to. Passengers have been deluged with offers of cheap fares this winter. Some of the deals are seasonal, such as British Airways' offer of $99 each way from New York to London, to help fill planes that would otherwise be sparsely loaded. 
But deals have also popped up on routes where customers once had to pay top dollar, like New York to Los Angeles or San Francisco. Increased transcontinental service by JetBlue, AirTran and Southwest means fares on almost every carrier have come down, as the major airlines have matched their low-fare rivals. JetBlue, for example, offered fares from $79 each way from New York to Los Angeles. Its chief rival, American, which JetBlue passed last year to become the biggest airline serving Kennedy Airport, vows it will not be undersold. 
On top of that, customers are being offered a variety of new extras along with low fares, from satellite radio systems on JetBlue and ATA, to fancy snacks from Dylan's Candy Bar, the trendy Manhattan confectionery, for sale on Song, Delta Air Lines' low-fare carrier. 
But passengers are dealing with some headaches, too. Ticket prices are bouncing up and down as the airlines try, thus far unsuccessfully, to increase fares to cover higher costs. Twice during December and January, several airlines applied and then abandoned charges meant to offset rising fuel prices, because competitors would not go along with them.
Rather than put up with attempts to make them pay more, passengers are heading where they can pay less. According to a Department of Transportation study published on Jan. 12, low-fare airlines carried 22 percent of domestic passengers in 2003, compared with 16 percent in 2000, the industry's peak year for domestic travel. Traditional airlines carried just 54 percent of domestic passengers in 2003, down 10 percentage points from their market share three years ago. Regional carriers made up the rest of the industry's business in both years.
The industry gets two more low-fare players this year. On Thursday Ted, the carrier started by United, is scheduled to begin service in Denver, where it will serve a collection of Western cities as well as two in Florida. Atlantic Coast Airways, which has operated as United Express on the East Coast, plans to introduce its own separate low-fare carrier, called Independence Air, this year, which will fly from Dulles airport, near Washington.
If those low-fare carriers weren't enough competition for the traditional airlines, they're seeing the passengers they value most -- business travelers -- dwindle, not just because the economy has been suffering, but because they are choosing low-fare airlines, too. People flying for work reasons, without buying tickets in advance, made up 20 percent of passengers in the first half of 2000, but that fell to 13.5 percent in the first half of 2003. And industry executives say slow job growth will keep that number of last-minute corporate travelers stagnant for now. "Until you see more corporations hiring people and beating the street for business, you are going to see some sluggish business travel," said Gary Kelly, the chief financial officer at Southwest Airlines.
The drop in business travel is especially troublesome for US Airways, which is struggling to stay in business after emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year. Though it seemed to be recovering, US Airways was jolted in November when Southwest announced it would begin service from Philadelphia, one of US Airways' three hubs, starting this May.
The decision, applauded by residents of a city that has long had some of the highest air fares, set off a crisis for US Airways. In a scramble to cut its costs before Southwest arrives in Philadelphia, US Airways put some of its biggest assets up for sale, including its East Coast shuttle, some of its gates at La Guardia and Logan Airport in Boston, and its regional carrier, known as US Airways Express.
Given that everything from fares to schedules to even the name of an airline might change with little notice, this is shaping up to be a year for passengers to write their travel plans down in pencil, not ink.

HEADLINE: Towns Born of Struggle and Hope 

BYLINE:  By JOHN D. THOMAS; JOHN D. THOMAS is editor of Playboy.com and a contributing editor of Playboy magazine.

 BODY:
THE post-Civil War South was a brutal and oppressive place for African-Americans. In a mass exodus, many left the region, compelled northward by floridly worded advertisements for new all-black settlements. One promoter described the town of Langston, Okla., as "Fertile as ever was moistened by nature's falling tears or kissed by heaven's sunshine."
 The advertisements worked. After the Civil War, there were some 50 all-black towns founded in the Oklahoma Territories (Oklahoma became a state in 1907). The initial settlers were Indian freedmen slaves who had been freed by their Indian masters -- but later freed slaves from the Deep South joined them in a quest to prove that blacks could not only govern themselves but also prosper economically if given the chance. 
 And they did. Many of the towns were quite successful, but they were eventually undone by factors including the Depression, Jim Crow laws, intimidation by whites and urbanization. Today, 13 of those original towns still exist in Oklahoma, and they all still have all-black or overwhelmingly black populations. 
When my parents moved to Oklahoma six years ago, I became a casual student of the state's history. After stumbling upon this unknown chapter of American history, I set out to visit some of these towns last year. It was the centennial of two of three of the most viable remaining all-black towns, more than enough of a reason to hit the road.
The best way to visit the towns is through formal tours, which are organized by several groups. The most prominent organizer is Cassandra Gaines, director of multicultural tourism for the city of Muskogee. She has been taking tourists to the all-black towns since 1997, and her success has led to consulting jobs with other states interested in developing African-American heritage tourism. Her groups travel by bus; an expert lectures on board, and local historians meet and guide them.
Logistically, joining a formal tour did not work for me, so Ms. Gaines helped me set up a solo trip to Langston (founded 1890), Boley and Rentiesville (both 1903). On a bumpy early-morning flight from Chicago to Tulsa, I flipped through my dog-eared copy of Hannibal Johnson's "Acres of Aspiration" (Eakin Press, 2002), a terrific survey of Oklahoma's all-black towns. I rented a car and headed toward Langston, site of Langston University.
The two-hour drive took me down rural highways that crossed Chicken Creek, Polecat Creek and Wild Horse Creek. Cattle grazed lazily next to tiny rusting oil wells that pumped with even less vigor. The school, founded in 1897, was named for John Mercer Langston, the first black member of Congress from Virginia, who served from 1890 and 1891. Sitting on a hill, its red brick buildings are an abrupt change from the pastureland.
Ms. Gaines arranged for me to get a tour from the university's historian in residence, Currie Ballard. In the 1890's, Langston was a vibrant place, with several grocery stores, a blacksmith, two physicians and a drugstore. Today, the school, a historically black university, is essentially the town; its 2,500 students account for most of its population.
The campus is spacious and immaculate. Mr. Ballard, a fount of knowledge about the town, first took me by the chapel. A pretty, white building, it opened 1996 and is a replica of the little Presbyterian church where the school's first classes were held. From there, we walked to the Melvin B. Tolson Black Heritage Center. A well-known African-American modernist poet, Tolson (1898-1966) taught at Langston, was the town's mayor from 1954 to 1960 and was named poet laureate of Liberia in 1947.
Officials at Langston University say that the Tolson Center is Oklahoma's sole site devoted to African and African-American studies. In addition to numerous pieces of African art donated by alumni, there are also many items related to Tolson, including his glasses, his Remington Quiet-Riter and a photo of him signing books at a ceremony at the White House in 1965.
When we left the Tolson Center, Mr. Ballard pointed out a proposed spot for the Oklahoma Museum of African-American History, scheduled to open in 2007, the state's centennial. He explained that the museum, which is being financed with state funds and private donations, will focus on issues including the state's civil rights struggles and black entrepreneurism in Oklahoma. He said the museum would not focus on the Tulsa race riots of 1921 and the rise of Tulsa's prominent, all-black Greenwood district (also known as the Black Wall Street) because the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa already featured extensive exhibits on those issues.
From there, we drove to Langston Lake. About a mile outside campus, it is a serene, tree-lined spot with covered picnic tables and barbecue facilities. Tours use it as a dining and relaxation area.
My final stop in Langston was the Indian Meridian. The tall, white monument was erected in 1922; it stands outside town on a dirt road. Mr. Ballard explained that it signified not only the former demarcation between Oklahoma and Indian territory, but also that it was the state's surveying center. "Think about it," he said. "The center of this state is in an all-black town."
I headed south and then east on the hour drive to Boley, once the crown jewel of the all-black towns. Just before you cross Boley's city line, you'll see a rather disconcerting road sign: "Hitchhikers May Be Escaped Inmates." It signifies the presence of the minimum-security John Lilley Correctional Center, which, including inmates and employees, accounts for about 500 of its 950 residents.
There was a time when Boley was a thriving place with more than 50 businesses, including a bank, an ice plant, five hotels, five groceries and even two photo studios. The African-American statesman and educator Booker T. Washington visited in 1904 and called it "the most enterprising, and in many ways the most interesting of the Negro towns in the United States." 
When I arrived in April, the pretty, mostly red brick downtown was anything but hopping, but every Memorial Day weekend it is packed when some 35,000 people attend Boley's annual all-black rodeo. Dating to 1909, the event takes place on the edge of town at the 40-acre Boley Rodeo Grounds, which has recently been renovated.
Boley is a quiet, charming place now, and its primary businesses are the prison and Smokaroma, which makes of industrial barbeque cookers. The founder of the company, Maurice Lee Sr., often cooks up barbeque for visiting tourists, and he treated me to some amazing ribs in the 1918 Boley Community Center. 
Boley is one of the few all-black towns with a formal museum dedicated to its history. The small collection is in a 1908 home that was named a national historic landmark in 1975. The town is expanding the facility. Displays include historic photos, bricks made by the Boley Brick Company in 1912, soda bottles from the Boley Carbonated Works and an advertisement for the 1921 "baffling western mystery," "The Crimson Skull." According to the ad, the film was "produced in the all colored city of Boley, Oklahoma," with an "all-colored cast" and "30 colored cowboys."
Before leaving town, I checked out Boley's other compelling, albeit macabre, attraction. On Nov. 23, 1932, a trio of bandits from Pretty Boy Floyd's outfit tried to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank. In the ensuing shootout, Boley's mayor and two of the gunmen were killed. The original marble cages are still inside the bank, which has been closed for years, and visitors can still see bullet holes in the walls. During the rodeo and tours, it's a popular stop.
A convenient place to stay while touring the towns is Muskogee, and I drove there from Boley and checked into a motel. The next morning I rose early, and after a hearty breakfast at the Speedway Grille ("The Best Little Burger and Chili House in Muskogee"), I headed south down Highway 69 for the short drive to Rentiesville.
On the outskirts of town, a sign heralds Rentiesville's favorite son: "Dr. John Hope Franklin Homeplace. Rentiesville, OK. Population 66." A noted historian, and writer and chairman of the advisory board of Bill Clinton's Initiative on Race from 1997 to 1999, Dr. Franklin was born in Rentiesville in 1915 and moved to Tulsa a decade later. 
One of the town's other famous citizens still lives there. Rentiesville has no real downtown anymore, but toward the end of the bumpy main road is the D.C. Minner Down Home Blues Club. A veteran blues guitar ace and member of the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame, Mr. Minner and his bass-playing wife, Selby, have been holding their Dusk 'til Dawn Blues Festival there every Labor Day weekend for 13 years. The three-day affair attracts some 7,000 fans. 
Mr. Minner's club is basically a rambling old country juke joint, with a scattering of mismatched tables and dinette chairs and aging pictures of blues artists lining the walls. When people visit on tours, he and his wife open the club and play a set. 
Mr. Minner was born on this spot in 1935 and moved back in 1985. Now getting too old to tour, he hopes to expand the place and add a museum. Mr. Minner said the all-black towns should be preserved as an inspiration to black people. "This is one of the few places where this history is still left," he said.
Actually, there is another place nearby where black history is well preserved. Just down the road from Minner's house is the site of the Battle of Honey Springs, also called the Gettysburg of the West. The battle, which took place July 17, 1863, involved the First Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry and was the first time black troops figured prominently in a major Civil War conflict. Some of those black soldiers went on to help found Rentiesville.
Honey Springs Battlefield, administered by the Oklahoma Historical Society, is a beautiful, sprawling place, with well-marked trails, an information center and monthly reenactments of Civil War life; every three years there is a re-enactment there using black troops. At the last one, about 11,000 people visited.
The next is scheduled for September 2005. At one end of the park stands a tall pink granite monument dedicated to those black soldiers. It reads in part, "At the Battle of Honey Springs, the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteers wrote a stirring page in American history becoming one of the first black units of the Civil War to play a key role in a Union victory." 
Standing alone in that battlefield at the end of my trip, I tried to come to terms with what I had seen. Like most Americans, I had had no idea these all-black towns had ever existed. The trip was fascinating and the people I met were full of hope for the future, but the dominant theme was struggle -- a struggle to escape the Deep South and to found the towns, and now a struggle to save them.

ECONOMY

BYLINE:  By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, will report to Congress on monetary policy on Wednesday and Thursday. And given the disappointing job numbers released last Friday by the Labor Department, economists say chances are reduced that the Fed would raise its benchmark interest rate in the coming months. 
 Although the economy has been growing at a decent pace for almost a year, it created just 112,000 new jobs in January, the government said. The unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent, from 5.7 percent, but many economists called the decline a statistical anomaly and said the rate continues to underestimate the labor market's problems. 
 "The relationship between economic growth and employment has broken down," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economic officer at Wells Fargo & Company.
To keep up with population growth, the economy must add 150,000 to 200,000 jobs a month. During the long expansions of the 1980's and 90's, monthly gains of more than 250,000 were common. Many economists say that the current numbers might be underestimating hiring somewhat, but that the biggest cause of the shortfall is American companies' increasing efficiency, allowing them to do more work with fewer hands. Some also blame the movement of jobs to countries with lower wages. David Leonhardt

HEADLINE: ART; 
Finding Art In Sports and Sweatshops

BYLINE:  By MURRAY WHYTE; Murray Whyte is an arts writer for The Toronto Star.

 BODY:
IN 1998, Brian Jungen, a 27-year-old artist in Vancouver, took apart a heap of identical Nike Air Jordans, splayed them open and restitched them into an improbably accurate rendering -- complete with real hair -- of a ceremonial mask used by the Haida people of British Columbia. He called it "Prototype for New Understanding."
 Curators and viewers alike were drawn to "Prototype," finding it both playful and provocative. It rounded up a number of contemporary ideas: an obsession with brand-name products, references to a global economy that allows them to be mass produced cheaply, and a postcolonial angst resulting from the buying and selling of North American native culture like so many Air Jordans themselves. The last of these Mr. Jungen knew well, living in Vancouver, where native products are a major part of a thriving tourist economy. 
 Soon Mr. Jungen, who is of European and Native Canadian heritage (his father, a Swiss, and his mother, a member of the Dunne-za tribe, both died when he was 8), was showing masks (he started with 9 and later expanded to 12) and other work in Canada, Europe and the United States. Currently he has a new site-specific installation at Triple Candie in Harlem. There he has shoved together 221 industrial sewing tables -- remnants of Harlem's sweatshop past -- and reconfigured them as a half-size, college regulation, though unplayable, basketball court.
Where he once used Native Canadian references, he has now stepped into the heavily freighted history of another North American minority culture, African Americans. "A lot ofsports gear was mass-produced right there in Harlem 40 years ago," Mr. Jungen said. "I'm drawing parallels between the history of industry and sweatshop production there and the attention given to sports as a way of escaping that manual labor, that manufacturing life."
The rift between aspiration and reality is a potent artistic motif for Mr. Jurgen. In "Shapeshifter" (2000), for example, he dismantled hundreds of white plastic stackable chairs and reconfigured them into the skeleton of a full-size right whale, a weighty spiritual symbol among Northwest native cultures. In another recent piece, "Beer Cooler" (2002), Mr. Jungen carved a host of traditional native images into a disposable polystyrene cooler, filled it with Budweiser King cans and took it to the Hammertown art exhibition in Edinburgh.
At the opening, the perplexed crowd looked on, not sure what to make of it. "That's because it was in an art museum," Mr. Jungen said. "People knew not to interfere with the work."
But keeping people away was hardly the idea behind "Cooler." Mr. Jungen was giving alcohol back to the Europeans, centuries after European colonialists had introduced it to native North Americans, with ruinous results. So he took it upon himself to break the ice, withdrawing a beer, pulling the tab and taking a sip. "I wanted to make sure that people knew this was my gift, so I helped myself," he said, chuckling. 
Was he kidding? Yes and no. Sanctity is not one of his priorities. As with the Nike masks, or the Triple Candie project, "Cooler" treads a line between humor and the politically incorrect. "I don't think all my work employs humor," he said. "Some of it does, but incidentally. It's more a sense of the absurd."
Mr. Jungen's dual heritage could be interpreted as a license to take jabs at both sides of it, but it's a notion he disavows. "There are so many people willing to burden me with certain ideas of identity politics," he said. "So it's very tricky. There's a certain nuance of Native Canadian identity, but I'm not necessarily interested in exploring my identity as an individual. I'm more interested in cultural identity in general."
Mr. Jungen sees the Harlem work as a broadening, not abandoning, of his basic themes. "A lot of people will look at what I've done and predict that I'll be doing a certain kind of work all my life," he said. "But I'm interested in all sorts of things. If I could reduce it down to my most basic take, I would say I like to dismantle purity and absolutes."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
A Ziegfeld Girl Who Can't Stop Dancing

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ

 BODY:
DORIS EATON TRAVIS, one of four living Ziegfeld girls, has gone from hoofer to dance teacher to horse breeder to author, a living testament to the fact that dancers are nothing if not flexible. Today, the follies are dead. Vaudeville is dead. Ballroom is dead. Five of Ms. Eaton Travis's six siblings are dead. But she is still dancing.
 Born in Norfolk, Va., in 1904, Ms. Eaton Travis first came to New York City with her mother and sister Mary in 1914 to audition for a Shubert Brothers production of "The Blue Bird." Her mother borrowed $200, packed a trunk with canned goods and a sterno stove, bundled her daughters on a train and headed for Broadway. 
 Ms. Eaton Travis recently returned to New York, from her 400-acre ranch in Norman, Okla., to promote her new book, "The Days We Danced: The Story of My Theatrical Family," a rambling but moving memoir published by the University of Oklahoma Press.
She had wrapped her marvelously erect 5-foot-2 1/2-inch frame in a black coat with a wide collar of black fox fur. "You have a bit of a wind out here," she said as she made her way to an interview at the Central Presbyterian Church, on Park Avenue, where the Ziegfeld Club, a nonprofit group that helps indigent women in show business, has its offices. In truth, it was painful outside, a bitter, blustery 15 degrees. One does not achieve the age of 99 by being a pessimist.
The club's headquarters have a spare, mausoleum-like quality -- putty-colored linoleum, fluorescent lighting and walls covered with old photographs: W. C. Fields with his thumbs at his waist; Florenz Ziegfeld in a fine pair of white shoes; Doris Eaton Travis, circa 1919, a pale, doe-eyed 15-year-old with a rosebud mouth and a steady gaze.
Ms. Eaton Travis stood before her picture and stared into her youthful face. "Was that I?" she said. "Oh dear. All I can say is I've come a long way, baby."
She can remember her first public performance, "The Cupid Dance" at age 5. She stood up to demonstrate: two simple, sweeping gestures with her arms and one brief turn and -- despite the cloud of white hair and markedly comfortable shoes -- she was the spitting image of a cupid, impish and preternaturally agile.
A week after graduating from eighth grade, Ms. Eaton Travis was cast in the 1918 Follies. She danced with them in 1919 and 1920 as well, and spent the next 15 years bouncing between Broadway and Hollywood. Then things went badly. The Depression took its toll, and worse, movies killed vaudeville. No Gypsy Rose Lee, Ms. Eaton Travis would not consider burlesque. By the mid-1930's, she was single, unemployed and hopeless. "You'd go down to an agent and 15 other people were applying for the same job," she recalled. "Psychologically you got so depressed."
She decided she wanted something else in life: a salary. But for the intervention of an old suitor who put in a good word for her, she would have been a dime-a-dance girl, not an instructor at the Arthur Murray dance studios. She eventually built a franchise of 18 Arthur Murray studios throughout Michigan. It was at one of those studios that she met Paul Travis, a businessman and dance student, whom she went on to marry.
In the 1960's, the twist and television vanquished ballroom and drove her out of business. In 1970, she and her husband moved to a ranch in Oklahoma where they raised quarter horses. In 1980, she enrolled as a part-time undergraduate at the University of Oklahoma. Twelve years later, at age of 88, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa.
"What was I going to do?" she said. "Sit there day after day and hold my hands? No!"
The Eatons were a theatrical family; at one point in the 1920's, four of the seven Eaton children were performing on Broadway simultaneously. Her sister Mary, a "toe dancer," actress and Lucky Strike girl, was a star -- the kind of woman who got her name in lights and inspired men to part with cars, furs and pianos. Another sister, Pearl, choreographed numerous films in Hollywood in the 20's and 30's but couldn't compete with Fred Astaire, who brought along his own choreographer, Hermes Pan. Unlike her two sisters, Ms. Eaton Travis stayed near the spotlight, but never quite in it. That fact -- and God -- she says, saved her. 
"Their show business careers ended, and they seemed to end with them," Ms. Eaton Travis said. Mary died an alcoholic, in 1948, and 10 years later Pearl was found beaten and naked, in a pool of blood, in her Los Angeles apartment. The murder was never solved.
Ms. Eaton Travis has a message for young dancers today: your career will end. "The final curtain does come down and then, for most people, there is nothing," she writes in her book. "No more applause. No music. No opportunity."
Still, dance remains deeply wired in her body. The only time she can recall not dancing, in fact, was when her husband died in 2000. "I feel sometimes that I just need to dance," she said. "In fact, sometimes at home, when I'm struggling with some problem, I'll just go turn on the music and dance." The movement and the music blending, she said, "is just like medicine. So I do that, when nobody's looking."
Ms. Eaton Travis has had a bit of a comeback in the last few years. In 1998, she returned to Broadway with a tap dance number for the Broadway Cares Easter Bonnet Competition. She had a cameo in Milos Forman's 1999 film, "Man on the Moon," and has appeared on "20/20" and "The Rosie O'Donnell Show." She'll be performing in the Broadway Cares benefit again in April. "We might be doing a conga," she said with a grin.

Banks New to Westchester Rush to Open Branches

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON MUTUAL'S latest Westchester branch opened at the end of January in the Arcadian Shopping Center in Ossining. It is the fourth of eight new "retail style" branches that the Seattle-based financial services company has planned for the county, and part of a network of 40 such outlets that it is opening in the New York metropolitan area.
 Commerce Bancorp, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., has also begun opening consumer-oriented branches in Westchester, with plans for six altogether. Its White Plains "store," as the company calls its new branches, is also part of a rollout of 40 in the metropolitan area, said its chairman, Vernon Hill. 
 Another financial institution expanding in the county, Charter One Bank, based in Cleveland, opened its first Westchester branch in White Plains in December. The bank, which operates about 600 offices in nine states from Michigan to Massachusetts, plans to open a branch in Scarsdale by April. Julie Anne Robbins, senior vice president of finance at Charter One, said the bank planned further expansion in Westchester after that. 
Webster Bank, which is based in Waterbury, Conn., and has been expanding in Fairfield County, opened a 3,500-square-foot branch in the village of Scarsdale in November. It plans to open two more Westchester branches this year, in Rye and in Yonkers. In all, it may open as many as 20 Westchester branches within the next two or three years, said John Spear, Webster's senior vice president for retail development.
Finally, Trustco Bank of Glenville, Schenectady County, has opened three branches in Westchester: in Briarcliff Manor, Bedford Hills and Elmsford. It plans to open another three county branches later this year, said Robert Leonard, a vice president.
In the wake of a rash of bank mergers and consolidations in recent years, the metropolitan New York area has become a prime target area for the new-style branches, Mr. Hill of Commerce Bank explained. He said that financial institutions like Washington Mutual and Commerce Bancorp saw an opportunity brought about by a perception that giant commercial banks born of the mergers were not focused on individual depositors or small businesses. He described the region as "underbanked compared to the rest of the nation."
Banks, which shifted their focus in the 1990's away from their branches to A.T.M. banking and, later, the Internet, have realized that their clients still want to do at least some banking in person, according to Ms. Robbins of Charter One. Hence, the focus on branch expansion now, she said.
Marsha Gordon, president and chief executive of the Business Council of Westchester, formerly the Chamber of Commerce, said the banks' expansion reflected recent economic growth in the county in general and particularly in its cities.
In addition to offering the usual services, many of the new branches are designed more like stores than traditional bank branches, and they are selling products like insurance and mutual funds as well as calculators, books and bank-branded merchandise. Indeed, the branches are based on the low-pressure marketing used by retailers like the Gap and Starbucks, and they bear little resemblance to branches of yesteryear, observed David Firestein, a principal and regional director for Northwest-Atlantic Real Estate Services in White Plains.
"They're not your grandfather's bank branches anymore," said Mr. Firestein, whose company represents Washington Mutual in finding sites for branches.
In the case of Washington Mutual, which acquired Dime Bancorp in 2002, the branches are being developed and furnished in the company's "occasio" style of retail banking. The word is Latin, meaning "favorable opportunity."
INTERIORS of occasio stores, which are usually 3,500 to 4,000 square feet, Mr. Firestein said, are designed to "reduce barriers between customers and bank employees." They have open floor plans with colorful centers of activity offering loans, insurance or other products. There are no roped-off areas, vaults or plexiglass teller windows, and browsing is encouraged.
Bank employees are dressed in khakis and blue or white casual shirts, as opposed to dark suits. The employees do not count or dispense money, leaving cash deposits and withdrawals to be handled by automated teller machines. Employees greet customers at the entrance and direct them to service areas.
Besides its Ossining site, Washington Mutual has opened occasio branches in Mount Kisco on South Moger Street, in New Rochelle on North Avenue and in Yonkers at Getty Square. It plans to roll out retail banking outlets in Eastchester, Hartsdale, Mount Vernon and Port Chester later this year. There are four former Dime branches in the county (in White Plains, Mamaroneck, Harrison and Scarsdale) that are larger than the new occasio branches. 
For its new outlets, Washington Mutual, sometimes shortened to WaMu, has leased property in busy shopping centers, with the goal of attracting the customer going to a Starbucks, supermarket or dry-cleaning establishment. Northwest-Atlantic Real Estate, Mr. Firestein said, searches for sites where people can run several errands, including banking, in a single outing.
"It's part of WaMu's effort to reinvent the banking business, to make it more consumer friendly in a period when everyone is always multitasking," said Mr. Firestein, whose company's other clients include Starbucks and Costco. "The idea is to park the car only once."
Commerce Bank takes a different tack when seeking real estate for its new branches. "Our prototype is a free-standing, one-story building with parking and drive-throughs," Mr. Hill said. Commerce Bank, which purchases its sites, eschews shopping centers and looks for one-acre sites close to residential areas, a food market, dry cleaners and other service establishments.
Commerce's White Plains branch, which opened last fall on Mamaroneck Avenue next to a Food Emporium and across the street from new apartment construction, is typical of its latest branches. They have white brick and glass exteriors and a red "C" on one side, said John Tolomer, a senior vice president and Commerce's market manager for Westchester.
In White Plains, Commerce purchased and razed a diner that had been operating on the city's main street for many years, building the new branch in the center of what had been the parking lot. 
Commerce's other new sites in the county, which also involve demolishing existing buildings, include two in Mamaroneck on Boston Post Road, one opposite the Jefferson Valley Mall in Yorktown, another in Mount Kisco and one in Chappaqua.
Commerce's branches are open seven days a week, with weekday hours from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Lollipops and dog biscuits are doled out at the drive-up windows; inside, customers have free use of an automatic coin-counting service.
Ms. Robbins at Charter One said her bank uses either free-standing space or stores near other retailers. In New York state, Charter One's focus so far has been in areas around Buffalo, Rochester and Albany.
Like the other banks, Webster is choosing highly visible locations for its new branches, which can be in shopping centers or among stores in downtown areas. Its Yonkers branch will be a 4,000-square-foot free-standing unit on a separate site, sometimes referred to as a pad, in front of a Bed Bath and Beyond store on Central Park Avenue. "Generally, a pad next to a shopping center is what we look for," Mr. Spear said. "But finding the appropriate site is sometimes difficult in Westchester because there's not a lot of new construction taking place."
Despite a shortage of available properties, Westchester is an ideal location for bank expansion, he said, because of its demographics. It offers both middle- and high-income depositors -- as well as small and medium-size businesses -- "the perfect combination for an expanding bank," Mr. Spear said.

As Newcomers Swarm, Sony Girds for a Fight

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
KUNITAKE ANDO, the affable and self-deprecating president of the Sony Corporation, laughs as he holds up his digital camera to show off pictures of himself playing golf in Hawaii. 
 Yet when talk turns to the challenges facing Sony, Japan's best-known company, Mr. Ando, 62, turns deadly serious. And for good reason. At a trade show in Las Vegas in January, he got yet another glimpse of the chaos enveloping the consumer electronics business. Companies from Dell to Microsoft to Nokia want a piece of the market for home-entertainment hardware that Japanese companies, including Sony, once dominated. 
 For a company that has long flexed its muscles and built a reputation on being first, Sony is now in the awkward position of having to play catch-up, and Mr. Ando knows it. But, he says, Sony will prevail by leap-frogging the competition and developing a new generation of products that few consumers can now imagine. 
"It's not scary for us" to compete against so many others, Mr. Ando said. "Offense is the best defense. Everyone is coming into this field, so we just can't wait and see what's going to happen."
Mr. Ando might have added that Sony has little choice. It is under attack from a number of electronics and software companies, many with billions of dollars to throw around, and it risks being marginalized if it sits tight. Just as worrisome, each new entrant to the business threatens to steal not just market share, but also the mantle of originality that Sony has built so carefully.
A few years ago, Sony would have sniffed at a low-cost computer maker like Dell producing flat-panel television monitors or a cellphone manufacturer like Nokia making hand-held video games. Not anymore. Sony executives know that these newcomers to the home-entertainment business can produce what they say they will, and do it for less than any company in Japan. Apple Computer's success with iPod, the digital music recorder, is also a reminder that Sony no longer has a monopoly on tech cool.
Sony, of course, has been under attack before, and often has rebounded in ways that few analysts had expected. Rarely, though, have so many competitors joined the home-entertainment market at once. Thanks to the commodification of the electronics industry, companies can buy components easily from suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea, China and even Japan. Having honed their cost-cutting skills, these companies can often produce products faster and more profitably than Sony can.
Having been upstaged by Apple, Samsung and others in certain product categories, Sony is taking action. Mr. Ando is one-half of a two-man team heading the company's ambitious, multipronged strategy, called Transformation 60. It is an effort to bolster profits, revamp the company's product lineup and repair what many critics see as a damaged reputation. To be completed by Sony's 60th anniversary, in 2006, the plan includes eliminating 20,000 jobs, cutting billions of dollars in expenses and quadrupling operating margins, to 10 percent.
Mr. Ando, who at times comes across as a bookish numbers guy, is in charge of meeting these targets, which, intentionally or not, will make Sony look more like a profit-driven American company than a typical Japanese one bent on grabbing market share at all costs.
The other major pillar of the plan is to design a new generation of products that will allow Sony to fend off challenges from Hewlett-Packard, Intel and others that are trying to put personal computers, not the television, at the center of home entertainment. Ken Kutaragi, whose is best known for creating the PlayStation video game console, is spearheading the development of these products.
Mr. Kutaragi's appointment to executive deputy president has helped to reassure skittish investors that Sony is serious about regaining its edge. Though its electronics are admired for their styling, Sony in recent years has rarely produced a hit that redefines the electronics industry the way the Walkman and compact disc player did years ago.
One exception has been Mr. Kutaragi's PlayStation, which produced a disproportionate amount of Sony's profits in 2002 and 2003.
To vault past the competition, Sony is joining hands with outsiders in some product areas. The company will spend $2 billion to produce next-generation liquid crystal displays with the Samsung Corporation of South Korea. Sony is also working with the Toshiba Corporation and I.B.M. to develop CELL, a high-powered chip that will become the centerpiece of an array of new digital gadgets. Last week, Sony said it would spend 120 billion yen ($1.14 billion) this year alone on building these chips. In other areas, most notably video games, Sony will try to blend its electronics and content businesses to produce the long-sought-after "digital convergence," the integration of software and hardware.
MR. KUTARAGI, 53, is a brash engineer and a rebel inside Sony, respected for his success but brushed aside by the company's more traditional managers. PlayStation has become a legend, not just because of its success, but because Mr. Kutaragi stomped and shouted until Sony executives agreed to build it.
While Mr. Kutaragi enjoys the limelight and his maverick image, Mr. Ando seems content to roll up his sleeves and tackle Sony's structural problems. He heads weekly meetings to cajole executives into making cuts to their divisions and working with rival factions in the company.
Though he is president, Mr. Ando has a difficult task in wielding authority. Thanks to the company's co-founders, Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka, Sony is dominated by proud, territorial engineers whose competitive spirit often produces superior results. But while the culture of the founders encouraged inquisitiveness and independence, it also bred extravagance. To the older generation of managers, cutting costs is synonymous with abandoning the founders' vision of a place where creativity comes first.
Though Mr. Ando says the company's restructuring plan is "on track," he acknowledges that he has had to play hardball with recalcitrant managers who resist his demands. For example, some division chiefs continue to hire workers even as they let others go. That has made it difficult for the company to reduce its head count and has complicated the efforts to eliminate 16 outdated product lines, and cut both its factory floor space and its number of warehouses by 30 percent, as planned.
"For the first time, we have to say, clearly, 'no,"' Mr. Ando said. "Creativity is not just doing whatever you want to do. As long as you can make a profit, it's O.K."
Early efforts are starting to pay off. On Jan. 28, Sony said it had earned a larger-than-expected profit of 92 billion yen ($872.1 million) in the October-to-December quarter last year. Though the electronics group is still vulnerable to threats from low-cost rivals, and PlayStation2 console sales have peaked, the company raised its profit target by 10 percent for the full fiscal year ending in March.
Notably, the number of workers taking the company's offer to retire early has exceeded expectations. As a result, Sony plans to spend 150 billion yen on restructuring efforts this fiscal year, 7 percent more than the company had announced earlier. 
But much more work needs to be done in the next two years if Transformation 60 and Mr. Ando are to be judged a success. And much is riding on that happening. For decades, investors have given Sony the benefit of the doubt, even when it racked up huge losses developing the compact disc, buying a movie studio and introducing a bevy of unique but ultimately marginal products. Patience, though, has worn thin as Sony's stature in the electronics market has diminished. The company, some analysts say, clung too long to analog technology that propelled it in a previous generation. While it tried to wring more profits out of its older televisions and video decks, other companies -- Sharp, Pioneer and Canon, to name just a few -- focused on a handful of hit products like flat-panel digital televisions, DVD recorders and digital cameras.
"Sony shifted too slowly," said Hiroshi Takada, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. "They thought the change to digital wouldn't come so quickly."
Mr. Takada says Sony understands that it is in "an emergency situation." The company has shown, he said, that it can turn on a dime and make the most of its brand name, most recently through its successful line of Cybershot digital cameras and its DVD recorders. 
Still, it will take several years before Sony and its investors reap the fruits of Transformation 60, analysts say. That is because many of the investments in new technology, like the designer CELL chip, will take time to make their way into new products.
THOUGH he appears content to work in the shadow of Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's chairman and the public face of the company, Mr. Ando, in many ways, has prepared his entire career for this moment. Born in Tokyo on New Year's Day 1942, he acknowledges being "neurotic" as a child. To challenge himself, he graduated from Bucknell University in Pennsylvania before earning a second bachelor's degree in economics, from the prestigious Tokyo University.
Mr. Ando's facility in English and exposure to Western culture made him a natural for Sony, which he joined in 1969. Unafraid to break with convention, Mr. Morita promoted the young Mr. Ando ahead of older managers. After stints in the contracts and licensing division and the television division, Mr. Ando set up a venture with Prudential Life, now called the Sony Life Insurance Company.
Mr. Ando cemented his reputation as someone who could tackle big projects and think creatively by bucking custom in Japan and hiring male college graduates as salesmen instead of homemakers, who go door to door for most mainstream insurers. Mr. Ando also worked closely with Mr. Morita and later ran Sony's American electronics operations, a business he was asked to revamp in the 1990's despite fierce opposition. His stature grew in '96, when he helped develop Sony's new PC, the Vaio.
Mr. Ando works closely with Mr. Idei. Unlike his often intimidating boss, Mr. Ando is down to earth. Instead of sitting in judgment at meetings as Mr. Idei does, he encourages debate before decisions. Where past presidents like Mr. Morita and Norio Ohga could be imperious, Mr. Ando is inclusive.
Or, as one Sony employee puts it, "The room does not go silent when Ando enters."
The company's goals, however, are neither small nor easily achieved. But with all the encroaching competition, Mr. Ando says he must put aside his nice-guy image and go all out. "Our credibility will really be questioned if we can't deliver what we promised," he said.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
The Outlook For Banking After a Wave Of Mergers

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
FOR the first time since the late 1990's, the banking industry seems to be bitten by the merger bug. 
 Over the last few months, Bank of America has announced that it is buying FleetBoston Financial. Then J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to acquire Bank One. Last week, there were reports that a combination of Citigroup and Deutsche Bank had been under serious consideration. 
 Thomas K. Brown, the chief executive of Second Curve Capital, a financial services research and money management firm based in Manhattan, talked last week about the wisdom of bank mergers. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Please briefly review banking conditions over the last few years.

A. Bank earnings suffered in 1999, 2000 and 2001 due to high credit losses and acquisitions that had been made in the 1994 to 1998 period.
Then we had a great period, beginning in 2002 and accelerating in 2003, of an earnings recovery driven by lower credit losses, improving net interest margins, the mortgage refinancing boom and the fact that the banks weren't doing stupid acquisitions. 
The economic fundamentals are improving, and that is by far the most important variable for the industry over all. Credit losses should continue to decline, and loan demand should be improving, along with net interest margins. 
But part of the core business, taking in deposits, is looking tougher. 

Q. Do you expect more bank mergers?

A. There will be more mergers this year, and more ill-considered ones. Investment bankers are out there urging people to get going. On the other side, the sellers are saying that the business is tough, we may not be able to grow at an attractive rate anymore. Also, price-to-earnings multiples in the banking industry have compacted, which makes it easier for the large banks to make big acquisitions than it has been over the last three years. So, the stars are aligned, which in this case is not a good thing.

Q. Why don't you find big bank mergers appealing? Doesn't size matter in this business?

A. The bigger the banks get, the less responsive they are to their customers. Also, and this is true in the United States, the bigger the deal, the less due diligence gets done.
To do a proper amount would potentially expose the fact that a transaction is about to happen. The due diligence in the Fleet/B. of A. deal, for example, was a joke. 
As far as size is concerned, big is a relative term. When a $20 billion bank wants to buy a $10 billion bank, that is a big deal. If the acquiree is more than 25 percent of the size of the acquirer, the risk of that deal destroying value for shareholders goes up exponentially. 

Q. You manage about $400 million worth of money in financial services companies. Is any of that money invested in big money center bank stocks?

A. We owned the money center banks in 2002 and 2003 on the basis of a recovery in credit quality and a return to their normalized level of earnings. We own none of them today.
The investment play here, as it has been since 1985, is to buy midsized and smaller players who know how to operate and grow their core businesses. The biggest myth in the banking industry is the one surrounding economies of scale. There is nothing that says profitability improves with an increase in size. Warren Buffett has said repeatedly that diversification is protection from ignorance. I prefer to own the banks that are not ignorant. 

Q. Which banks are the best in breed?

A. In my opinion, the best bank in the country is Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey. They grow their core deposits over 30 percent a year by offering great service against the big banks that don't.
Southwest Bancorp of Texas is another great bank. They have only been in business for the last 14 years, based in Houston and Dallas. They focus on the corporate market, and with loan demand coming back and interest rates moving higher, they should do well. They have been killing bigger banks like J.P. Morgan Chase that operate in those markets. 
Another smaller bank we like is M&T Bank, which is based in Buffalo. Warren Buffett is their second-largest shareholder. 

Q. Were you surprised to hear that Citigroup and Deutsche Bank were talking about a possible deal?

A. Yes, I was. Back in November, Charles O. Prince, the new chief executive of Citigroup , said that perhaps they were going to get out of more businesses than they were going to get into.
After hearing about this, I think Citi is going to do something else. They are under pressure to have more deposit funding of their U.S. assets. I would expect them to acquire another large depository institution in the United States. Given its size, however, there is probably not an entity that Citigroup could acquire that would itself be transforming.

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
Escaping to the Land of Cheaper Living

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times and the author of "Retire on Less Than You Think: The New York Times Guide to Planning Your Financial Future." His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the second Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I AM constantly amazed at the growing gap in living costs between big American cities like New York and San Franciscoand the rest of the country. 
 This difference, of course, can be good news for future retirees and most likely explains the increasing number of baby boomers who tell pollsters that they may relocate when they retire. They're just facing reality. The boomers have not been as good at saving as their parents were; a downsized lifestyle in a cheaper place will help them retire with less financial worry than if they try to stay put. 
 Evidence of the price gap keeps piling up.
Last month, Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm based in Rochester, Wis., released partial results of two studies that show just how widely prices can vary across the country.
The first compared the annual cost of conventional automobile insurance for a midsize sedan in various cities. The amount ranged from a low of $978 in Nashville to a high of $4,945 in Detroit. The four highest-cost cities after Detroit were Philadelphia, at $3,666; Newark, $3,557; Los Angeles, $3,258; and New York, $2,762. The four lowest-cost ones after Nashville were Boise, Idaho, $990; Richmond, Va., $1,038; Burlington, Vt., $1,039; and Evansville, Ind., $1,045. Runzheimer said the cities with the lowest insurance rates had fewer accidents and vehicle thefts.
The second Runzheimer study compared child care costs, not a big issue for retirees but nonetheless indicative of the price gap. The study found that the monthly cost for five-day-a-week day care for a 3-year-old in a for-profit center can be as high as $1,057.83 in Manhattan and as low as $339.44 in Baton Rouge, La.
Nowhere is the price gap more glaring than in homes, which for most people represent their greatest expenditure as well as their greatest asset. The February issue of Country Living magazine has ads for two houses that may jar you a bit if you're struggling with the mortgage payment on a cramped New York apartment or an overpriced California bungalow.
The first is a 3,560-square-foot Victorian house in Geneva, Neb., that was built in 1891. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it has four bedrooms, two and a half baths, three fireplaces, a two-car garage and an in-ground swimming pool -- all on a one-acre lot. Property taxes are $2,900 a year and utilities average $320 a month. The asking price is $195,000.
Carlene Whitehead, an agent at Bergen Real Estate in Geneva, a town of 2,200 in eastern Nebraska, about 55 miles southwest of Lincoln, said the magazine ad for the house had generated interest from many potential retirees. In fact, the day we talked she was awaiting the arrival of a possible buyer from New York.
"I had a lot of calls from people in higher-priced areas of the country -- New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston -- who are looking for a bargain, for a place to retire," Ms. Whitehead said. "Some of them said they're tired of coping with big-city life. We didn't have any idea we would get such a response." 
But she said that many of the callers might not realize how small Geneva is. In 2003, the average price of the homes she sold was $78,000. Nevertheless, she said, high-speed Internet service is available there, and the Lincoln airport is less than an hour's drive.
The second ad in Country Living is for a 3,252-square-foot house in Clay, Ky., a town of about 1,200 in the western part of the state. Built in the 1930's, the house has six bedrooms, two baths, a family room, an office and an enclosed porch. It also sits on a one-acre lot. Taxes are $1,790 a year and utilities run about $225 a month. The asking price is $179,000.
Maggie Sheets, an agent with Remax Heritage Homes in Madisonville, Ky., about 20 miles southeast of Clay, gives an account similar to Ms. Whitehead's. Ms. Sheets said that 75 percent of the people calling about the house were potential retirees.
"Many of them are just overwhelmed by the price and features of that house," she said. "But sometimes they don't realize how rural Clay is. They ask about museums and things like that." She said her average home sale last year was $78,000, the same as Ms. Whitehead's.
Clay, like Geneva in Nebraska, also has high-speed Internet service. There is a small commuter airport at Madisonville with flights to regional air hubs. There is a larger airport in Evansville, Ind., 45 miles to the north, and an even larger one in Nashville, about 130 miles southeast.
Homes are not the only things that are less expensive in these two towns. According to www.bestplaces.net, a Web site that compares cities and towns, it costs almost 60 percent less to live in the Kentucky region that includes Clay than it does to live in New York City. For the Lincoln-Geneva area of Nebraska, it's nearly 58 percent less. That means if you make $100,000 a year in New York, you can duplicate your lifestyle in Kentucky for a bit over $40,000, and in Nebraska for a little over $42,000.
These comparisons assume that you continue paying a mortgage and have work-related expenses. If, however, you have enough equity in your present home to pay cash for a new, less expensive one, and you are downsizing your lifestyle, the mortgage payment disappears and expenses drop even more. If you're retired, there go work-related expenses, too. 
The boomers may be on to something.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Whose Problem Is Health Care?

BYLINE:  By DANIEL GROSS

 BODY:
IT comes as no surprise that America's beleaguered manufacturers operate at a disadvantage to competitors based in China and Mexico, countries with rock-bottom labor costs and threadbare safety nets. But, increasingly, they are also having difficulty contending against rivals in developed countries. 
 American companies have ingeniously managed to contain labor costs through productivity gains, outsourcing and limiting wages. But the factors over which manufacturers have less control -- structural costs like those for corporate income taxes, employee benefits and rule compliance -- have surged, according to a study released in December by two trade groups, the Manufacturers Alliance and the National Association of Manufacturers. 
 Comparing wage compensation to total value added in manufacturing in several countries, the study concluded that the United States was more competitive than Canada, Germany, Britain, South Korea and France. But throw in structural costs -- which add 22.4 percent to the cost of doing business in the United States -- and American manufacturers' costs exceed those of counterparts in Canada, Britain and South Korea. Even France, reputedly hostile to business, isn't far behind.
How is it that the American economic system, thought to be far more friendly to businesses than the European system, has become a competitive disadvantage for American manufacturers? One of the main culprits is health care. And the solution may be something that has traditionally been anathema to corporate chieftains: bigger government. 
After corporate income taxes, employee benefits are the second-largest structural cost for American manufacturers, adding 5.8 percent to costs, according to the study. In all major economies, paying for health care means a combination of public and private money. But in the United States, businesses pay a larger chunk than do their European and Asian counterparts. 
"In Canada, for example, a lot of the expenditures for health are funded out of general revenues," said Jeremy Leonard, an economic consultant for the Manufacturers Alliance, and the report's main author.
In Canada, the private sector spends 2.8 percent of gross domestic product on health care; in the United States, the private-sector figure is 7.7 percent. And American private-sector spending falls disproportionately on big employers like manufacturers. Some 97 percent of members of the National Association of Manufacturers provide health care coverage for employees. In 2002 alone, General Motors, which covers 1.2 million Americans, spent $4.5 billion on health care. 
Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton, has referred to General Motors, Ford and Daimler-Chrysler as "a social insurance system that sells cars to finance itself."
Manufacturers can compensate for higher health care costs partly by holding down growth in wages. But they have fewer options when dealing with retirees' health benefits. "It would be good for the U.S. economy to get U.S. corporations out of retiree health care," Dr. Reinhardt said.
Large companies seem to be moving in that direction. Last year, only 36 percent of companies with 500 or more workers still offered a retiree medical plan to at least some retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, down from 50 percent in 1993, according to a recent survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. 
OF course, in Canada and the European Union, higher taxes on citizens pay for comprehensive coverage. This is a trade-off that big business seems increasingly to favor. Both the National Association of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of executives, supported the expensive Medicare prescription drug benefit enacted last summer. Top executives find that having taxpayers foot the bill for older Americans' prescription drugs is more palatable than digging into corporate coffers to pay for their retirees' benefits.
Few business leaders advocate that government provide comprehensive health insurance for American workers not in Medicare -- at least not yet. The National Association of Manufacturers would like the system to evolve from one in which employers provide benefits to one in which consumers buy health care. 
But, like the prescription drug benefit, such a shift would be likely to transfer the financial burden from companies to American taxpayers. Offering new tax credits is the preferred mechanism for turning insured Americans into health care consumers. And the creation of such credits would force the government to borrow more, reduce spending elsewhere or increase taxes. 
Whatever way, we all pay.

HEADLINE: The East Joins the Low-Fare Bazaar 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
LIKE well-dressed wallflowers at a Valentine's Day ball, travelers on the East Coast once watched with envy as people in other parts of the country were courted assiduously with low fares.
 Not that the airlines shunned their business. In fact, the East Coast has long been the industry's top market for corporate travel, with flights to and from New York, Boston and Washington accounting for huge chunks of the airlines' revenue. 
 Therein lay the rub. Major airlines could afford to keep prices low on the West Coast and in the South, areas dominated by vacation travel, knowing that they could milk the East Coast with high fares that business travelers had no choice but to pay. 
Not anymore. In the last three years, the East Coast market has become the equivalent of an air-fare bazaar. Low-fare airlines, led by JetBlue, Southwest and AirTran, are luring customers with prices that in some cases are 50 percent less than the going rate in 2000.
To protect their turf, major airlines like American and Delta are fighting back, expanding service, offering more free tickets to frequent fliers and slicing fares to once-unimaginable levels, like $79 each way from New York to Los Angeles.
And the price wars are just heating up. "The East Coast is shaping up to be a real slugfest," said Darin Lee, a senior managing economist at LECG, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Already, that brawl has drawn blood. Song, the much-ballyhooed low-fare carrier started last year by Delta, said last week that it would reassess its expansion plans. And analysts say US Airways, which emerged from bankruptcy last year, could be toppled right back in if it cannot come up with a new strategy.
New competition is stacked up like planes in a holding pattern over La Guardia, just waiting for its chance to land. Southwest, the nation's sixth-largest airline and the low-fare leader, will begin flying out of Philadelphia in May. Ted, the low-fare airline from United that begins service in the West this week, said on Thursday that it would add flights at Washington Dulles International Airport later in the year.
Independence Air, an offshoot of Atlantic Coast Airlines, a regional carrier for United, is scheduled to begin service in November, from Dulles -- or sooner if Atlantic Coast's agreement with United, which still has six years to run, is severed.
Even foreign airlines want into the game. Last week, WestJet, the Canadian low-fare airline, said it would begin flights to Florida and other destinations. And Sir Richard Branson, the British entrepreneur and founder of Virgin Atlantic, is considering Boston, Washington and San Francisco as the base for a low-fare contender that he hopes to start in the United States.
The competition on the East Coast could not come at a worse time for the major airlines, which have lost $15 billion since the downturn in the travel market began in 2000. In past decades, they used their financial power to fight off the low-fare airlines, undercutting their fares, expanding service on the same routes served by the newcomers and reeling in passengers with double and triple frequent-flier miles. 
BUT this time, the newcomers are in better shape than the majors they are staring down. Last year, JetBlue, AirTran, ATA Airlines and Southwest registered increases in numbers of passengers, while Northwest, Delta, American, United and US Airways all had decreases, in part because of a falloff in international business, a category in which the low-fare airlines generally do not compete. 
As tough as fare wars are for airlines, East Coast passengers could not be happier. Juley Fulcher, the Washington director of Break the Cycle, a nonprofit organization that works with youth against domestic violence, says her ability to fly on business comes down to finding an affordable fare. Her reason for choosing an airline, she said, is "price, short and sweet." 
In the past, depending on her destination, that meant hoping for a fare sale on United or Delta. But now, Ms. Fulcher often chooses between two low-fare competitors: JetBlue, which serves Dulles, and Southwest, whichflies from Baltimore.
She prefers JetBlue, with its seat-back video systems and seat assignments, to Southwest, which does not assign seats in advance. "You have that cattle-call feeling of having to run over people to get to your spot," she said.
That analogy applies to the East Coast aviation field, where history shows just how hard it is to compete for passengers. Since 1981, a dozen new low-fare airlines have started East Coast service, but one-third of them no longer exist.
Nobody is ruling out the possibility that another airline will disappear. "The list is bound to get a lot shorter before this is over," said Michael S. Allen, chief operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, an industry consulting firm.
On top of nearly everyone's most endangered list is US Airways, the seventh-largest American airline. Its beleaguered chief executive, David N. Siegel, has vowed to come up with "a big surprise" to fend off Southwest, which begins service on May 9 from Philadelphia, one of US Airways' three hubs.
But defeating Southwest, the industry's most profitable player, will not be easy. Even as US Airways has promised to stand toe to toe with Southwest, it has put its hubs and other assets, including its East Coast shuttle, on sale. 
"They'll probably drive US Airways out of business," Charles A. O'Reilly III, a business professor at Stanford, said of Southwest. US Airways, Professor O'Reilly said, had no excuse for not responding sooner to low-fare airlines' assault on the East Coast, which began when JetBlue, based at Kennedy Airport in New York, began flying in 1999. 
Even competing industry executives readily credit JetBlue for bringing lower fares to Eastern cities. "You have to look north to JetBlue," said Kerry Skeen, the chief executive of Atlantic Coast, based in Dulles, Va. 
Sean Donohue, the United executive in charge of Ted, said: "You have to be candid here. JetBlue added a lot of competition up and down the Eastern Seaboard."
That may be putting it mildly. During the four years JetBlue has been flying on the East Coast, fares from New York to cities it serves have fallen by 30 to 50 percent, Dr. Lee, the LECG analyst, said.
David G. Neeleman, who founded JetBlue in 1999, said the market was ripe for the kind of low-fare competition already found in other parts of the country. "We knew if we could touch a nerve with low fares and good service, there would be an explosion in air travel," he said on Friday. "And that's what's happened."
JetBlue cites the example set by Southwest, whose consistent profitability belies the idea that low-fare companies cannot make money. "It is one of our strengths, to be low-cost and efficient," said Gary Kelly, the chief financial officer of Southwest, based in Dallas. And in words that might chill his competitors, Mr. Kelly continued, "We are a growth company, and we have places we don't serve."
In fact, the sound financial situation of Southwest, JetBlue and other low-fare airlines is in sharp contrast to their East Coast precursors, like People Express, which tried to bring cheap fares to the market two decades ago.
"What you've had are stronger players who've been able to come in at a time of weakness for the larger players, and have been financed sufficiently to withstand competitive responses," Mr. Allen said.
Dr. Lee says Southwest, as well as airlines overseas, like Ryanair in Europe and Virgin Blue in Australia, have provided a template that People Express lacked. "Fifteen years ago, it wasn't clear to a start-up airline how to successfully run a low-fare airline," hesaid.
In 1981, People Express was the darling of its aviation day. Founded by Donald Burr three years after the government deregulated the airline industry, it lured hordes of passengers to the dingy North Terminal at Newark with dirt-cheap fares.
Despite the long lines and uncomfortable seats, it had a cult following among passengers and industry experts who praised its no-frills approach as visionary. But passengers eventually grew tired of the crowds and chaos, while major airlines ganged up on it, undercutting its fares and outwitting it with more sophisticated reservations systems. By 1987, People Express was gone.
WHY couldn't something similar happen this time? For a simple reason: the new low-fare airlines are more aware of mistakes they must avoid. Mr. Skeen at Atlantic Coast says the trick is to keep a lid on costs as well as ticket prices. Aside from streamlined labor contracts, the keys to controlling expenses include the Internet.
In the past, Mr. Skeen said, it cost airlines $15 to $20 per passenger to book a reservation, either through their own reservation centers or through travel agents. But tickets booked on the Web site of the new Independence Air will cost the airline 50 cents each to process, he said.
Another contrast is on the tarmac. Conventional wisdom among low-fare airlines has been to pick one type of jet and stick to it. Southwest has famously used just one family of airplanes, the Boeing 737, allowing it to simplify repairs and keep ground time short. That strategy has been mirrored by Delta's Song, which flies 199-seat Boeing 757's, and Ted, which will fly 156-seat Airbus 320's.
But the advent of small, nimble regional jets is setting the single-plane theory on its ear. On Monday, Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft maker, will begin producing the first of the 100 planes that JetBlue has ordered, with options to buy 100 more. JetBlue expects to deploy the planes, with 100 seats -- twice the capacity of the most-used regional jets today -- to some of the 800 cities clamoring for its business, many of which have airports too small to easily accommodate the bigger planes it flies now. 
New planes will let JetBlue, and potentially other low-fare airlines expand quickly. "Are they going to antagonize the majors? No. They are going to terrify the majors," Professor O'Reilly said. "They are going to get into those cities before the majors can."
John Selvaggio, the president of Song, acknowledges that the airline was begun by Delta as a defensive measure so that it could retain leisure travelers flying between New York and Florida, rather than let them defect to JetBlue and others. But Song has become more than an airline for vacationers. 
Business travelers, evidently happy with its low fares, fill a good portion of its East Coast seats. "There's been a tremendous blurring of that line" between leisure and corporate fliers, Mr. Selvaggio said. "When they fly Song, they like it," he said of the airline's frequent travelers. 
AS long as Song and other low-fare airlines are present, Mr. Selvaggio said, East Coast fares will not creep up once the economy comes back. With all the competition, he said, few airlines expect business travelers to pay top dollar for the convenience of getting on planes at a moment's notice. "People don't want to pay those high fares," he said. "Corporations are not approving those budgets. Everybody is looking for a deal. To the cities that these carriers fly to, the days of a $1,200 walk-up fare are gone."
That is a double-edged sword for Delta, which still carries 70 percent ofits passengers in its traditional hub-and-spoke system. Delta would prefer to have revenue increase, a prospect Song may not offer. Yet, without Song, it might lose business altogether, Professor O'Reilly said.
Mr. Kelly at Southwest says the East Coast is hardly the only market where travelers have become resistant to high fares. "I think everywhere in the United States you're eventually going to have fares offered at much lower prices than we've seen in the past," he said.
What could stymie the East Coast expansion? For one thing, a further decline in customers. Despite the flurry of competition, overall air traffic has fallen 7 percent since 2000, the industry's peak year for travel. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, continue to depress travel 30 months later. 
And without a robust economic recovery, all the airlines' hopes of finding passengers to fill their planes may not be realized, said Dr. Lee at LECG. "The one thing you can say about the airline industry," he said, "is that there are no guarantees." 
Indeed, Delta has already had to rethink its plans for Song. Last week, even as Ted, the new United operation, announced that it would use Dulles as a second hub, Song revealed its plans to end its Dulles service, which it began in September. Further, the airline is conducting a review of all its operations and will determine whether routes should be flown by the main airline or by Song, Mr. Selvaggio said.
Ted, too, has already had to adjust. Even before it began flying, the airline was forced to scale back its fares, which were supposed to top out at $414, one way, for last-minute tickets with no restrictions. Instead, no one-way fare on Ted will be more than $299. That matched the cap that Frontier, a low-fare rival based in Denver, placed on its fares. And it is the most that Southwest charges for any one-way ticket nationwide, although the airline does not serve Denver. Not yet, anyway.The major airlines, meanwhile, are trying to figure out their role in all this. Until recently, they argued that their extensive route systems, frequent-flier programs and potential first-class upgrades would keep passengers loyal. But the prospect of $250 tickets on routes that once cost five times more has eroded that customer fealty.
Now that United and Delta have waded into the battle with low-fare operations, the industry is wondering if and when the market leader, American, will do the same. The airline has been battling the low-fare competitors by matching fares when necessary, streamlining operations and aiming its appeal at its vast array of frequent fliers. In a move aimed at undercutting JetBlue's push west from New York and Boston, American offered a deal this winter, matched by Delta and Song, that gives travelers a free ticket, with restrictions, anywhere in its system after two paid trips from New York (or Boston) to California or Florida. American said last week that 150,000 people had signed up for the offers. Mr. Neeleman acknowledged that the major airlines' aggressive response was a reason JetBlue's transcontinental revenue fell during the fourth quarter, raising analysts' eyebrows.
But American hasn't been able to protect its position on one of its most important battlegrounds, Kennedy Airport. Last year, JetBlue nudged past American to become the largest airline serving J.F.K. Dominance there was a point of pride for American, whose New York operations, decades ago, contributed one-quarter of its revenue. 
Gerard J. Arpey, chief executive of AMR, American's parent, would not rule out the possibility of starting a low-fare operation. "I take seriously everything our competitors are doing," he said last month.
"The low-fare carriers are well capitalized and willing to sustain" their growth, said Mr. Allen at Back Aviation Solutions. But major airlines will not sit back on their hands and watch the East Coast market fall to invaders, he added: "It's not going to be a cakewalk."
East Coast passengers, meanwhile, no longer need to feel like children who didn't get Valentines from everyone in their class.
