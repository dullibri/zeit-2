HEADLINE: After Sheff: An Rx for Schools

BYLINE: By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
MEMBERS of a New Haven educational panel say resolution of issues raised by the Sheff v. O'Neill decision lies in promoting diversity and enhancing educational quality, and that neither can be accomplished without pursuing structural reform.
The panel, which was appointed by Mayor John DeStefano Jr., released a report last week that members said they hoped would contribute to improving education and reducing racial isolation in schools around the state. And, they emphasized, many of their proposals could be initiated without waiting for action by the General Assembly. 
 The Sheff v. O'Neill ruling from the State Supreme Court last summer also prompted Gov. John G. Rowland to appointed a state educational improvement panel (known as the Sheff panel) to make recommendations on how to remedy the inequalities among urban and suburban public schools. (The Governor's panel must submit its recommendations to the General Assembly by Jan. 22).
In looking at the underlying reasons for segregation, the New Haven group "took a more global approach" than the Sheff panel, said the group's chairman, the New Haven Superintendent of Schools, Reginald Mayo.
The president of the Greater New Haven N.A.A.C.P., Roger Vann, was chairman of the committee on structural reform, which called for affordable housing, for more jobs and economic development, and for property tax reform and other changes in the way public education is financed. Mayor DeStefano, one of the state's most outspoken advocates of property tax reform, noted that a recent survey of state residents indicates a preference for a cut in the property tax over a cut in the income tax or gasoline tax.
"Severe disparities in property tax rates are driving people of means out of urban areas and exacerbating racial and economic segregation," says the report. It calls for a "property tax circuit breaker" that would allow people to deduct "excessive" property tax payments from their income taxes. (The report did not define excessive.)
The structural reform committee's report also calls for increasing state payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for tax-exempt property or for revising the mandated exemption laws. And the committee calls for leveling the playing field in terms of per-pupil expenditures, which now vary by hundreds of dollars between the poorest and richest districts.
"There are many ways the state can help us achieve equity," said Mr. Vann. While the panel did not endorse any specific plan, he said one idea that was discussed was repealing the "hold harmless" provision in the current funding law that allows the 20 wealthiest school districts in the state to receive money for education, even though they do not meet the funding formula.
If that money -- $40 million -- were transferred to the 20 poorest districts, he said, it could be used for "targeted purposes such as improving the staff-pupil ratio, enhancing technology or expanding staff development." Mr. Vann added that though the issue has been discussed by the General Assembly several times in recent years, no action has been taken. Now, he said, "the Sheff decision might give it some impetus."
The 31 people appointed to the New Haven advisory group included teachers, administrators, members of boards of education, superintendents of schools, education-related organizations, community leaders, business people, New Haven aldermen and women, city administrators, parents and students. Most are from New Haven, but a third are from surrounding towns.
When Lynne Lieb, a member of the Amity Regional 5 (Woodbridge, Bethany and Orange) school board heard the panel was forming, she promptly invited herself onto it.
"We in the suburbs have tremendous advantages that we reap by living close to New Haven," she said, "and I think it should be more of a mutual relationship than it is. I have been very impressed with New Haven's magnet schools. I know people are concerned about local control, but if we think about local control in a larger sense, I think we can enrich each other's lives. I believe you can't have quality education without integrated education."
The president of the New Haven Federation of Teachers, Frank Carrano, was chairman of the committee on promoting diversity. Among its recommendations, he said, "the most important is that all school districts should provide space for students from other communities, but it should be a two-way effort, not just city kids going to the suburbs." (Last week, the Sheff panel came out with a similar proposal for open enrollment, but it assumed the movement would be virtually all from the cities into the suburbs, thus creating a potential for overcrowded suburban districts.)
The superintendent of the Woodbridge schools and an advisory group member, Peter Madonia, endorsed the concept of open enrollment. "It deserves to be tested," he said. Mr. Madonia also said that to achieve school choice "there must be both a long-term state commitment of dollars and protection against disenfranchising students in both urban and suburban communities." At issue, he added, is not just school space but also conditions like class size.
The open enrollment issue caused another suburban school superintendent, Bruce Storm of Branford, to leave the advisory group. Mr. Storm said that he supported everything in the report, but that some of it would be hard to sell to his community. . He said he recalled "some pretty awful things being said" in the suburbs during earlier attempts to bring about voluntary regional desegregation and forecast "some serious political backlash" but said he assumed that "a lot of these things" are going to be mandated by the legislature, and that he was "just going to do them."
Mr. Carrano's committee also recommended pre-school programs statewide, regional magnet schools and schools connected with large places of employment, so parents could take their children to a school near where they work. Since workplaces are more diverse than schools, this would enhance educational diversity. The committee also recommended exploring the establishment of two-way bilingual programs, so that being fluent in a language besides English becomes an asset.
The committee on enhancing educational quality, headed by Dr. Rod Lane of Southern Connecticut State University, recommended establishing statewide standards in curriculum, technology, professional development, parental involvement and diversity. Improving teacher education, limiting class size to 20, providing paid in-service training and improved public relations were also recommended. "I learned how many successful programs exist in the New Haven schools," said Dr. Lane, "but they don't get publicity."
The report specifically disavows publicly financed vouchers for private schools, saying "it would distract from the real business of diversifying and improving our public schools and communities."
Mayor DeStefano insists that the panel he convened should be seen as complementary to, not in competition with, the statewide Sheff panel. The report, which includes no specific price tag but whose recommendations would cost millions of dollars to implement, is being forwarded to the Governor and to the General Assembly for consideration. The Mayor pointed out that with all the talk of a tax cut -- whether property tax, income tax or gas tax -- money could be made available to improve education.
Advisory group member Patricia McCann-Vissepo, chairwoman of New Haven's board of education, said, "I don't think the legislature on its own is overwhelmingly motivated to do anything about this issue, so there has to be pressure from as many sides as possible. A lot of people on the panel feel, 'Why should we wait for the legislature?' Things like more urban/suburban interchanges, more regional schools, a workplace magnet school, could be implemented without legislative action."

HEADLINE: Anchor Wars Around the State's TV Stations

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN 

 BODY:
FOR years, television watchers in Connecticut have been switching around the dial, following their favorite news anchors who have made their own switching around, from station to station, almost a way of life.
The dean of the wandering anchors is Pat Sheehan who over the past three decades has worked at public television in Hartford; at WTNH, Channel 8 (ABC) in New Haven; at WFSB, Channel 3 (CBS) in Hartford, and is now doing the nightly news at WTIC, Channel 61 (Fox) in Hartford. 
 Others are close behind in their perambulations.
Al Terzi, who was once Mr. Sheehan's second banana on Channel 3, left there to work in Florida but returned to Connecticut to Channel 8 and is now back at Channel 3. Janet Peckinpaugh went from Channel 8 to Channel 3 and is now at WVIT, Channel 30 (NBC) in New Britain. Gerry Brooks, who once worked in Hartford radio, went from Channel 3 to Channel 30.
Some of the comings and goings have been accompanied by little incidents that pointed up the intensity of the television news business.
For example, after Mr. Brooks, known as the cutup of the anchors, decided to vacate Channel 3 for Channel 30, a big flap ensued when he appeared in an advertisement on Channel 30 for the United Negro College Fund before his contract time at Channel 3 had run out, upsetting officials at 3. And mysteriously, his popular feature, "The Brooks File," did not travel intact with him to Channel 30. Along the way it became "The Brooks Report."
The length of tenure at each station has depended not only on negotiated contracts but also on the whims of management and marketing surveys on who out there is watching what station, and when. So the anchors tend to arrive, eventually depart, and sometimes return.
Basically, the watching public accepted the appearances and reappearances of the anchors as part of the strange and wonderful world of television. Besides, in a state as small as Connecticut and with cable in most homes, people could follow their favorite anchors by just hitting the remote control.
And through all its changes of anchors, the one constant in Connecticut television was that all the anchors seemed to like each other, smiled a lot, exchanged little pleasantries, or bromides, between news items in a formula that has become familiar from Connecticut to California. The image was of one big happy family, regardless of where the television news siblings were working at any one time. And then last month, that whole image crashed.
Janet Peckinpaugh filed a suit in Federal District Court in Hartford against Channel 3.
Ms. Peckinpaugh has become one of the best-known women in the state through her work as a prime-time news anchor for 10 years, first at Channel 8 and then at Channel 3. She left the latter in 1994 and for the past year has been working part-time at Channel 30, in the lower-paying early morning time slot.
In her suit, she says that her fortunes fell at Channel 3 when the station decided to hire Al Terzi away from Channel 8. It seems Mr. Terzi did not want to work with her. The reason, she maintains, is that in 1987 when she and Mr. Terzi were working as lead anchors at Channel 8, Mr. Terzi attempted to attack her sexually in a New Haven hotel where both were participating in a charity telethon. She says that she told a lot of people about it, including station personnel. Shortly after, she left the station and went to Channel 3.
Now, according to her suit, she wants her old anchor job back at Channel 3 and damages.
Mr. Terzi has denied Ms. Peckinpaugh's allegation and Channel 3 management has issued a statement that anchor changes at the station are based on economic factors and audience research.
The filing of the suit turned out to be a major news story in the state and radio talk shows took up the topic, with plenty of people waiting on the phone lines to voice support for one party or another.
To many observers, this kind of response might be considered a bit bizarre since most of the callers had never actually met either Ms. Peckinpaugh or Mr. Terzi. But to people who follow the television business the outpouring of sentiment was no surprise.
"Television is a very visual medium," said Maureen Croteau, head of the journalism department at the University of Connecticut. "It's much more personalized than print. You can read a newspaper column for years but know little or nothing about the columnist. But in television there's a myth of contact. You feel you do know these people."
Ms. Croteau isn't very happy with what she calls "the cult of the cute" in television in which news anchors engage in little witticisms with each other, with the weather forecaster and with the sports reporter as part of the presentation of the news. She thinks it demeans listeners, if not the anchors themselves. "It's gotten out of hand. They underestimate the viewers and it's not necessarily something everyone likes.
In general, she added, television news is a tough industry, "with everyone having to be young and beautiful." "People don't stay in for the long term. Look at TV news and how many people are nearing retirement age." It was not a question.
She does not know, she said, why anchors seem to remain so long in Connecticut, at one station or another, except that Connecticut is considered a good place to work, and they get good money for an area that is not considered one of the major markets in the country.
Al Primo, the head of Primo News Service in Greenwich, agrees. "An anchor team is critical to the success of a station and you don't have to be in a major city to make big money today," he said. "Even though Connecticut is considered the 24th or 25th market in the country, anchors can make $250,000 to $400,000 a year now. I'm sure Al Terzi makes $350,000 a year."
Mr. Primo's company advises television stations on how to present the news. In fact, he said, he was the inventor of what is known as the Eyewitness News Program in which news anchors interact with one another in "a credible, interpersonal relationship." That was three decades ago, he said, at Channel 7 in New York when he added a second anchor to the newscast and Channel 7 quickly rose from third to first in the ratings. Eyewitness News is the same system that Ms. Croteau thinks has gotten out of hand.
Mr. Primo agrees that television anchors are some of the best-known people in today's culture. "These are the people you bring into your home by turning on a television set," he said. "They become icons in your life. They have celebrity status. When I go to lunch or dinner with them they're beseeched for autographs. They're the movie stars of today."
He is not happy about the latest development involving two of the celebrities. "My position is that such a serious matter should be tried in court, not on tabloid news shows or in newspaper columns," he said.
At the television stations, calls are not being returned by the celebrities, lest they be quoted on the Peckinpaugh suit.
One anchor, who said he very much wished to remain anonymous, summed it up: "What a mess. I'm glad I'm out of that."
The one person who does return calls is Janet Peckinpaugh.
She won't talk about the suit on advice of her lawyer, but about other things, sure.
Why has she remained in Connecticut, even though the last two years can't have been much fun?
"I made a conscious decision to stay here," she said. "I've loved Connecticut ever since I first came here. I grew up in the Midwest and I worked in radio in Washington and in television in Richmond, Va., for six years. But I never felt I belonged and I always had one bag packed." She laughed. "Now I can't move," she said. She has a lawsuit going.

HEADLINE: Controlling Pollution, But at What Price?

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
LOOK across the Hudson River from either shore and what do you see on many days? An orange-brown haze lurking over the landscape, which environmentalists claim is payment for the sins of the past and some business and government leaders call progress.
While environmentalists wag fingers at incinerators, increased vehicular traffic and smokestacks in the Midwest, many businesses counter that pollution is sometimes simply the unavoidable byproduct of economic growth. 
 Since the Federal Government announced on Nov. 27 its latest assault on smog and soot -- technically referred to as ground-level ozone and particulates -- the national and local debate over air quality has greatly intensified.
In places like Westchester, which are already classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as Severe II Non-Attainment Zones for ozone, such a debate often centers around matters of life and death.
Citing pressing public health concerns, Carol Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has proposed tougher regulations, which could force localities and businesses to find costly new ways to control smog and average Americans to make significant changes in the way they live.
Nationally, lobbying groups representing industry and some governors and mayors described Ms. Browner's proposals as Draconian and predicted costly changes for businesses, mandatory car pooling and restrictions on pleasure boats, lawn mowers and even outdoor barbecues. Gasoline prices could also increase.
Locally, reaction to the administrator's recommendations was diverse. While some business leaders dug in their heels and prepared to fight, Westchester government officials, though wary, said they would cooperate, despite the anticipated added costs.
Meanwhile, environmental groups applauded Ms. Browner's latest move but called for even stricter measures. And medical experts nodded their heads in agreement with the newest body of statistics linking airborne pollution with the growing death rate from respiratory diseases.
The proposed rules would tighten pollution limits, which many cities are already failing to meet, and for the first time the rules would apply to tiny particulates in the air.
The agency's statistics show that controlling smog and soot would prevent an estimated 40,000 premature deaths each year and reduce serious respiratory problems in children by about 250,000 cases annually.
The Clean Air Act of 1970, strengthened by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 and President George Bush in 1990, resulted in cleaner cars, fuel and power plants. And while the country's air quality has improved 30 percent since 1970, results of research linking ozone and particulates to increased respiratory ailments had not been forthcoming, despite promises by the Government.
The data was finally released and new standards proposed in the wake of a Federal court order stemming from a 1993 lawsuit against the Government by the American Lung Association.
Some 185 ozone-related studies on humans have shown harmful effects from ozone at current standards, including more than 1.5 million incidences a year of significant respiratory problems, like loss of lung capacity and exacerbation of both childhood and adult asthma.
In 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency mandated that businesses with 100 or more employees reduce commuter traffic by paying workers to take mass transportation or buying vans to transport them, among other things.
But after an extensive lobbying effort -- led by the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce -- the United States Congress and New York State agreed that employee commuter programs should be voluntary.
"Onerous" was the word Harold E. Vogt, president and chief executive officer of the county chamber, used to describe the 1990 regulations. This time around, he said, "We're still vigilant, but open minded."
The Government has acknowledged that carrying out the new rules could cost local governments and businesses up to $8.5 billion a year.
At Ziereck Manufacturing, a small company in Mount Kisco, which joined the lobbying movement two years ago, Gretchen Ziereck, secretary of the corporation, said, "We fought the regulations before, and if necessary, we'll fight them again."
Another concern, Refined Sugars in Yonkers, however, voluntarily complied with the program. It did so with great difficulty, Joseph L. D'Angelo, the office manager, said. Many workers at the company rotate shifts, and forming car pools was not easy, he said.
Ms. Ziereck, Mr. D'Angelo and other business owners continue to believe that they are being unfairly singled out and that the Federal Government should go after other sources of pollution, including airborne pollution originating in the Midwest.
"Why doesn't the Government look at smokestacks or diesel trucks and buses?" Ms. Ziereck said. "Why don't they get older cars off the road? How about more effective vehicle inspections? Just stop unfairly picking on small companies like us."
At the county's Department of Transportation, Commissioner Joseph J. Petrocelli predicted that the steps Westchester had already taken to reduce pollution from vehicular traffic would stand it in good stead in the next round of environmental upgrades.
The county provides shuttle service to and from the White Plains train station and industrial parks along Interstate 287. It has also been commended by Metropool, Inc., a nonprofit ride-sharing agency in Stamford, for developing a commuter-options plan.
In addition, Mr. Petrocelli observed, Westchester has 43 commuter railroad stations served by three rail lines and the second-largest public bus system in the state.
"Economic development and clean air really can go hand in hand," the Commissioner said, "particularly when you have a good transportation network already in place."
The Regional Plan Association in Manhattan, a nonprofit planning agency, has prescribed a $21 billion, 25-year transit plan, which would connect the Long Island Railroad, Metro-North, New Jersey Transit and New York City's subway system to encourage more reliance on mass transit.
Jeffrey Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the association, said that mass transit, electric vehicles and "a series of measures like more flex time at work and more telecommuting" could significantly reduce air-borne pollution generated by heavy commuter traffic.
In another branch of county government, Westchester's Director of Environmental Planning, Gina D'Agrosa, said she, too, was ready to comply with the regulations. The Planning Department's focus would be on particulate matter generated by three public incinerators at sewage treatment plants in Ossining, Port Chester and New Rochelle. If the county did not comply, it would risk losing Federal funds, she said.
The Environmental Protection Agency's latest recommendations would require communities to cut ozone levels by one-third to 0.08 parts per million cubic feet of air from 0.12 parts per million and would regulate tiny particles of dust down to 2.5 microns in diameter.
Westchester is in compliance with current standards for particles, but Manhattan is not, said Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is not known, however, whether the county meets the proposed new standards.
Maureen M. Morgan, former president of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester, an umbrella group, said she was pleased that the Government had finally taken the next step, especially since it missed a 1992 deadline to upgrade air-quality standards.
"Everyone keeps thinking they can avoid the really tough choices, but we can't anymore," she said. "We all have to figure out a better way."
But Marian H. Rose, chairwoman of the Lower Hudson Group of the Sierra Club and its New England Regional Conservation Committee, said: "Business is complaining that the new regulations are too strict. I think they don't go far enough. They should be even tougher."
Meanwhile, Westchester's Acting Health Commissioner, Dr. Howard N. Adel, and the Chief of Pediatric Pulmonology at New York Medical College and the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, Dr. Allen J. Dozor, said they were grateful that at least some of the health hazards from pollution would be mitigated.
Dr. Dozor said that pollution-induced asthma is the No. 1 reason for childhood emergency-room visits and hospitalizations.
"When the air quality is lousy, my phone rings off the hook," he said. "Kids are coughing, wheezing, short of breath. There's a long list of problems."
Health experts say that the smallest particles of polluted material cause the most trouble because they can lodge deep within the lungs, and children are considered particularly susceptible.
The incidence of pediatric asthma -- Dr. Dozor sees about 5,000 cases a year -- is greatest in Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle, the Westchester cities closest to Manhattan.
Although the county does not collect data for the incidence of asthma in the population at large, Dr. Adel at the County Health Department said, "Westchester undoubtedly suffers its share of the consequences of pollution."
The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking comments from the public before a Feb. 18 deadline. The person to contact in New York is Mary Helen Cervantes-Gross at (212) 637-4440.
The new standards are scheduled to be issued in their final form in June. Key Republican members of Congress, however, have indicated they intend to veto the new air standards under a 1996 law that gives them authority to review major Federal regulations.

HEADLINE: Can Poetry Provide An Economic Lift?

BYLINE: By LEONARD FELSON 

 BODY:
THE Windham area of eastern Connecticut, once a thriving textile center, has struggled for decades ever since the mills closed and moved South. Now it is in the midst of a revival, but it's not an industrial one. It's poetic, literally, although organizers hope it also will provide an economic boost to the region.
The Windham Area Poetry Project, a six-month effort that culminates in April, may be unlike the average poetry festival, for this one is attempting to reach residents, institutions and businesses that normally don't make poetry part of their lives. 
 There are 10 contests so far planned (with 15 more to be announced in the months ahead), with prizes lined up. Espirit Travel, for example, a local travel agency, will give a $50 certificate to the person who writes the best poem on travel; the Willimantic Food Co-op is giving a $25 gift certificate to best poem on food.
There will be poetry on public transit lines, a poetry slam at the Windham Boxing Club and Youth Development Organization, and an anthology of ordinary citizens' poetry to be published under the title "The Heroes of Daily Life."
"We hope this project contributes toward bringing the community together and getting people to cross boundaries that a lot of times they don't," said Alexander Taylor, a director of Curbstone Press, a Willimantic nonprofit publishing company that is one of the project sponsors.
Organizers are hoping that as the festival draws people to the area, they will shop in local stores and dine at area restaurants, and that the festival will become an annual event not only growing each year but also becoming something of a drawing card for tourists.
At its core, though, the poetry project is no more ambitious than to open the doors for people who normally don't read or appreciate poems. "Our objective is to let people know the enjoyment of poetry does not require a critical approach. It relates to all aspects of life," said Judith Doyle, the other director of Curbstone Press. "Poetry," she said, quoting the poet Roque Dalton, "like bread, is for everyone."
"You don't have to have a Ph.D to appreciate poetry. People say they don't understand poetry, that they aren't able to listen to poetry the way they listen to music," she said. To address that issue, the poetry project will reach out to settings beyond the academic. In Windham public schools, another sponsor of the project, the high school library is developing a poetry center, collecting contemporary poetry, including many books in Spanish, being donated from different presses around the country. More than 130 books have been received.
The high school sponsored a poetry workshop for all teachers in the fall, just as the festival was getting underway.
In the larger community, posters donated by the Streetfare Journal in San Francisco are glued to buses with this poem by the San Francisco poet George Evans:
That night we drank warm whisky,
In our parked car beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,
I fell in love with you.
Posters of illustrated poems also are hanging at the Willimantic Food Co-op and the Main Street Cafe, and other businesses are being encouraged to integrate poetry into the workaday world.
Most of the poetry events will be bilingual, free and open to the public. Poets who will be participating include Jack Agueros and the state's poet laureate, Leo Connellan, as well as Martin Espada, Gray Jacobik, Marilyn Nelson, Cheryl Savageau and Tino Villanueva.
Besides the travel and food contests, others will come from the University of Connecticut Book Co-op in Storrs for the best poem on reading, Paradise Cafe for one on diversity, the Mansfield chapter of the World Federalists for one on the idea of One World, the Storrs Friends Meeting for one on nonviolent reconciliation and Curbstone Press for one on work.
Elderly people will be eligible for a poetry contest. There also will be a contest for the best Spanish poem, the best poem on the subject of play and pets and one for the best religious poem.
The festival will culminate with "Poetry in the Park" in Jillson Square in Willimantic on the last weekend in April. Aside from poets, there will be storytellers and face painters to entertain children, and a book and arts fair.
Major funding for the poetry project came from the Connecticut Commission on the Arts as well as several other local foundations and businesses.
Mr. Taylor, who also teaches poetry at Eastern, said the festival should not be viewed as a frill. "Writing poetry in its proper context builds self-confidence in people and develops their problem-solving faculties," he said. "This is why M.I.T. encourages the study of arts for engineers."

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: John Feingold;
A Protector of Land Lists Ways to Save It

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
JOHN FEINGOLD, executive director of the Westchester Land Trust, says his interest in protecting the environment had its roots in his childhood when he saw firsthand the pollution of Long Island Sound and the disappearance of creeks and marshlands.
Today, Mr. Feingold, a resident of Pound Ridge, like many in the environmental field, believes things are better than what they were back then, but he also feels that more must be done. 
 The Westchester Land Trust is a nonprofit, countywide organization formed in 1988 and based in Bedford Hills. Its core mission is to preserve land. It does this, Mr. Feingold said, the quiet way -- not by confrontation but by persuasion and education. It has about 2,000 members. The number to call for information about the Land Trust's activities is 241-6346.
Mr. Feingold has more than 20 years' experience in the field of land protection and conservation. Before coming to the Land Trust in August 1995, he served as the New York director of the Regional Plan Association, overseeing environmental and land use initiatives in the state and New York City.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with him:
Q. Do you think it is better for the environmental movement if its activists are idealistic or should they be pragmatic and understand the economic issues as well? Which way will yield better results?
A. You've got to go in as an idealist with your eyes opened. It's very important for us as citizens to envision the kind of future that we want to have -- and then be pragmatic about getting that.
Q. Over the years some in the environmental movement have been criticized for not understanding the economic issues that environmental protection cause.
A. There is a quiet side to the environmental movement. I would say the Westchester Land Trust is right there, working with the establishment and citizens of the communities to envision what the future might be. I think it's important to say that the Westchester Land Trust is not a confrontational advocacy organization. We find that we are most effective when we are working with public officials and the private landowners and other organizations to identify the places that really need to be preserved and to work with a laser-like focus to preserve those specific places.
In some cases that means that we work with developers to insure that development is better than perhaps originally proposed. We do, however, feel it is very important -- this is our major goal -- to be in front of the curve, to be identifying and working with major landowners before the development proposals come forth for them. Our feeling is that once the blueprint arrives at the planning board it's in many cases too late. There are a plethora of other organizations that pick up the mantle at that point and become litigious and the like.
Q. Educating people, then, is the way to change attitudes?
A. Yes. The trust has really had two major thrusts to its environmental-education programs: we have a series of lectures and conferences that are focused on adults, where we try to train adults about land conservation and some of the tools and techniques to achieve the preservation. And we have a school-based education program for kids. In conjunction with Purchase College, we have an accredited teacher-training program and we put on a dozen teacher-training workshops. This year we're working with about three dozen schools here in Westchester on the programs.
Q. Generally, are things better today for the environment than, say, a decade or two ago?
A. What I think we've seen over the last 25 or 30 years have been pretty dramatic improvements in environmental quality, in this country at least. Internationally, I think we have some creeping concerns about growth and development in third-world countries that need to be addressed.
In America, we've made terrific strides, but we've only addressed 20 to 25 percent of the environmental issues. And the remaining ones are going to be the difficult ones. Those have to do with issues of nonpoint-source water pollution. We have to address the issues of chemicals and fertilizers that run off into the waters.
Q. You were formerly with the Regional Plan Association, and regional planning is still controversial -- hard to achieve. Communities do not consult other communities about development. How do we overcome that?
A. As it has been stated, we need to think globally and act locally. Municipalities need to work together to achieve those shared goals and objectives.
As an example of the work that the Westchester Land Trust is doing on that basis, over the last several years we have focused on regional systems that cross municipal and state lines. Currently, we are working to preserve the water quality of the Titicus River and the Mianus watershed. To do so, we have helped forge compacts that cross state lines into Connecticut and involve towns and cities.
Q. What are the environmental issues for Westchester this year?
A. What we saw in '96 were at least two major actions: one was the agreement on the development of New York City watershed property and secondly the passage of the state's Clean Water-Clean Air Bond Act. These were both things we worked very hard on during 1996. During 1997, we very much look forward to watershed-protection activities on the part of Westchester and New York City and new infrastructure investments, water-pollution controls and the protection of local drinking-water supplies through the bond act. We think these will be two major areas of activity that will just be hitting the ground during 1997, but they will have a real impact in Westchester.
Q. I understand that you work to protect -- or reclaim -- open space in some urban areas. What do you do?
A. The Westchester Land Trust is, in fact, one of the few environmental land conservation organizations in America that actually works in the inner cities, to create quality of life where it's lacking. For example, in southwest Yonkers, we're working in partnership with the Yonkers public schools to reclaim a derelict lot immediately adjacent to P.S. 18 as a neighborhood park and an outdoor environmental-education classroom. We have another program in Peekskill. These kinds of parcels are less than an acre in size, but from them we're able to create new urban environmental opportunities.
Q. You also deal with bigger parcels, don't you?
A. One of our major thrust areas in 1997 will be to focus on the pristine stream systems and the remaining big farms and the Hudson River habitat areas. Even where we have a relatively pristine stream there is development that is encroaching on it. This is the water that we drink and we rely on. We're focusing on trying to preserve this.
Q. How do you do that?
A. We work with individual landowners who have made donations of land or what we call "conservation easements" to the Land Trust.
Q. What is that?
A. It's essentially a perpetual agreement between a landowner and the Westchester Land Trust, with legal standing. It allows the land to remain in private ownership. However, the conservation values of the land are preserved. Generally, conservation easements prohibit any further development or subdivision of the land.
Q. Does the county have many such agreements?
A. We have 23 conservation easements throughout Westchester, ranging from Yonkers to Lewisboro. We are in the process now of negotiating or finalizing terms of conservation easements or the outright donation of land involving more than 1,800 acres throughout Westchester in places like Purchase and Ossining, Pound Ridge and elsewhere.

Office Space Market Coming to Life in Lake Success

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
THE turnaround of the office market in Lake Success, where the vacancy rate is now 12.4 percent, very much reflects the vitality of the broader Long Island commercial market. The Island's 13.4 overall vacancy rate is the lowest since the 12.7 percent rate in 1988.
Large blocks of space are hard to find in Lake Success, institutional investments are flowing in, renovations are a driving force and major new construction -- in the form of a pre-leased, build-to-suit project -- is possibly in the offing. 
 Building upgrades are still the leading source of new office development, illustrated by capital improvements costing $13 million that are under way at 1981 and at 1983 Marcus Avenue.
The two buildings, which total 660,000 square feet, were acquired earlier this year by Matterhorn One, a real estate investment fund managed by Canyon Partners of Beverly Hills, Calif.
Matterhorn purchased the mortgages as part of a package of assets from GE Capital Corporation of Stamford, Conn., and then foreclosed on the loans, which were in default, taking title in February.
"Value and the growth of the economy on Long Island is very positive, and the demographics are exceptional," said K. Robert Turner, managing partner of Canyon. The money-management firm's real estate funds are active investors on Long Island, he said.
Matterhorn, which is calling the two-building complex Gateway at Lake Success, has begun an improvement program that includes renovating the lobby and exterior areas, upgrading the cooling and heating systems, improving landscaping and signage, and upgrading parking.
As a result, new leases and lease renewals have been signed on 220,000 square feet of space in the two buildings, said Herb S. Agin, president of Sutton & Edwards, a commercial brokerage in Lake Success, which is handling the leasing for Matterhorn. Vacancies in both buildings have dropped from almost 20 percent to less than 10 percent, he said.
Last month, for example, the Greenpoint Financial Corporation of Manhattan began moving its consumer banking and mortgage operations into 105,000 square feet at 1981 Marcus Avenue, after leaving space it occupied in Flushing, Queens. There will be 600 employees at the Lake Success site.
The build-to-suit project proposed in Lake Success is for a 6.5-acre vacant site on Marcus Avenue, which was also acquired through a foreclosure, in this case by Mutual of New York, a Manhattan insurance company.
"Long Island has slowly improved over the last few years to the point that the next large tenant coming along will probably require someone to build a building," said Lawrence R. Botel, a vice president with ARES Realty Capital in Stamford. ARES is a subsidiary of Mutual of New York and its real estate portfolio manager.
AT least half the proposed 250,000-square-foot building would have to be pre-leased before construction could start, Mr. Botel said. To be called the Centre at Lake Success, the building already has a preliminary design by Peter K. Toh, a partner at the Spector Group of North Hills. It would have three floors of offices with setbacks for terraces, a day-care center, a cafeteria, and underground parking for 800 cars.
The two Matterhorn buildings, as well as the vacant lot owned by Mutual of New York, are in what was once called the Triad Office Park. The once thriving office center fell on hard times during the recent recession, illustrating how quickly fortunes can fall during a market downturn.
But Triad's problems were typical of problems encountered by many developers, said Mr. Agin of Sutton & Edwards.
Although the desirable Lake Success location helped keep vacancies fairly low during the recession, when leases came up for renewal tenants who had been paying annual rents of $25 a foot and up were signing renewals for $20 a foot, which was not enough to pay the owners' debt service, he said.
The goal of the original development group, which was composed of different partnerships with Irving Feldman of Lake Success as the general partner, was to build six buildings totaling 1.7 million square feet on 48 acres between Marcus Avenue and Union Turnpike, he said. The first building was completed in 1979.
Four more followed, with the 310,000-square-foot 1985 Marcus Avenue purchased in 1982 by the Chase Manhattan Bank Corporation, which occupies it.
In addition to the two buildings now owned by Matterhorn, another structure in the complex was also lost through foreclosure: the 220,000-square-foot 2001 Marcus Avenue, which was taken over by its lender, the Equitable Life Assurance Society in Manhattan, in 1995. It is still owned by the insurance company and is leased out to multiple tenants. The remaining building, the 350,000-square-foot 1979 Marcus Avenue, is still owned by a Feldman partnership, but an outstanding mortgage of more than $50 million, on which there also is a default, was discounted and sold by the lender, Bankers Trust Company of Manhattan, to a group of investors that includes Reckson Associates Realty Corporation of Melville, a real estate investment trust.
The investors expect to take title to the building in 1998 following foreclosure proceedings. Reckson, which purchased about a 70 percent share of the outstanding nonperforming loan, is taking an active role in the building's management.
According to Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island, based in Melville, the overall vacancy rate in Nassau at the end of the fourth quarter was 13.5 percent, a drop from 15.8 percent a year earlier. In Suffolk over the same period, vacancies dropped from 16.3 percent to 13.1 percent.
The Melville-Route 110 area, where vacancies were 17.6 percent a year ago and are now 10.5 percent, has become "incredibly hot," said Kevin P. Welsh, senior vice president of CB Commercial/Hampshire of Hackensack, N.J. The brokerage, which has two Long Island offices, is handling leasing at the 177,900-square-foot 538 Broadhollow Road in Melville, which is owned by a subsidiary of the New York Life Insurance Company.
The building, once occupied by the Grumman Corporation, which moved out in 1991, is undergoing $750,000 in capital improvements. CNA Insurance moved into 20,000 square feet in May, and Hewlett-Packard moved into 21,000 square feet last month, Mr. Welsh said. And negotiations with a California-based insurance company, which wants 50,000 square feet, are now being finalized, he added.
"The market has been turning around for a year and a half, but activity now is accelerating," said Theodore P. Sasso, senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company of Long Island in Syosset, a newly opened branch of the Manhattan brokerage.
"We're generating jobs again and we are getting them in diverse businesses with the high-tech industry continuing to grow," he said.
"We have become a market leader in software, the biotech industry is growing, and we are doing very well with financial services, of which Greenpoint, which Edward S. Gordon represented, is an example," he added.
Long Island has now regained two-thirds of the jobs that were lost during the 1989 to 1992 recession, said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a business group, and also a consultant to the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
BARRING a major selloff in the financial markets, she said, 1997 should see further growth, with the creation of between 10,000 and 15,000 new jobs.
But the improving economy has not yet translated into new speculative construction, in which buildings are built without lease commitments.
"You won't see a speculative building going up for a long time," said William T. Yorio, a managing director at Cushman & Wakefield of Long Island. "What you will see is a building started based on a majority of commitment to space."
For any kind of speculative construction to take place, rents would have to increase significantly from their current levels, said Paul F. Amoruso, president of Oxford & Simpson, commercial brokers in Jericho. "We've had absorption without a lot of rent increase," he said.
A developer would need a rental of $30 a square foot to justify the cost of new construction on a speculative basis, Mr. Amoruso noted, adding that rents in Nassau are still $22 to $24 a square foot and in Suffolk they are $20 to $22 a foot.
Scott Rechler, chief operating officer at Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, which owns a 35-acre parcel in Melville on which it could build 500,000 square feet, said he does not foresee the start of speculative construction for another two to four years. Before it starts, he said, rents would have to increase 25 percent over what they are today.
But that will happen, he added. "Good quality office space is drying up," he said, "and if tenants want to find locations they want to be in they will have to start paying more."

Wall Street's Boom Echoed in Fairfield Housing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
A SURGE in speculative building of multimillion-dollar homes in Fairfield County is being attributed by realtors, architects and builders to good times in lower Manhattan. The Wall Street boom has led home builders for the first time since the roaring 1980's to put up houses of at least 7,500 square feet with four-car garages and swimming pools in advance of finding buyers.
The number of homes under construction countywide in the $2-million to $6-million range has been growing for the last year. Each of the Gold Coast towns of Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan, Westport, Wilton and Weston report from 2 to 12 such luxury homes currently near completion or finished, on the market or sold, with more on the drawing boards. Buyers are widely identified as Wall Streeters bearing the fruits of a bull market. 
 Michael Hobbs, a New Canaan builder of $5-million and $6-million homes, said that "10,000 square feet is not a large house anymore, and you don't see some grizzled old guy coming in who spent all his life working to afford it -- you see a young guy who made it big on Wall Street and wants to enjoy it."
Mark Finlay, a Fairfield architect whose 10,000-square-foot houses in New Canaan, Greenwich and Darien sell for $3 million and up, said: "Our clients are youngish Wall Streeters and a percentage of celebrities. There is lots of money for wine cellars, guest quarters and billiard rooms. We are lined up six months in advance.
"People are building classic homes, not what they built in the 80's. They have all the bells and whistles, but the materials are the real thing and the architecture is timeless."
The Mayfair Construction Group in Greenwich is completing an 8,000-square-foot house in American Shingle style -- a homey, middle-class look from early in this century that in today's luxurious reincarnation is the rage. The house, on 4.6 acres with a pool off Round Hill Road in Greenwich's legendary back country, is for sale at $5.9 million. "It's a real family house," said Timothy Ryan, Mayfair's owner, "with a turn-of-the-century feeling."
In an era when a full-time domestic staff exists only in reruns of "Upstairs, Downstairs," the kitchen has again become the heart of the house, as it was in poor families for centuries, but with two dishwashers, commercial-grade stoves, refrigerators with sub-zero freezing capacity, polished granite counters and elegant woodwork.
Richard Girouard, a custom-home builder in upstate Farmington and Avon, began building in New Canaan last year. "When my banker at the American Bank in Waterbury suggested I look into this market, I could see that it was heating up because of expansion in Stamford," he said. As with most builders of expensive homes, his is a small, compact operation.
AFTER 22 years in the business, he has learned how to put up a house in less time than the one-year average that he saw in Fairfield County "and with better quality," he said. "I have the same work force for all my houses," Mr. Girouard said. "I keep the crews busy going from house to house so that there is no lag time."
Last year, he bought eight lots of a former New Canaan estate called Stoneleigh from an investor who had bought it from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The first three homes of 7,500 square feet, priced at $2.5 million on two-acre lots, were begun on speculation and sold while under construction.
Dr. Gary Cook, chief executive of Witco, a chemical corporation in Greenwich, and his wife, Brenda, bought one that is nearing completion. James Hall, an investment specialist with Swiss Bank, which is building a $145 million headquarters in Stamford, and his wife, Jennifer, bought the second house, and the third is in contract.
In addition to the Stoneleigh project, Mr. Girouard is building other houses on speculation in New Canaan. Some are as large as 6,500 square feet and priced from $1.2 million to $1.4 million on two- and four-acre lots. "One at Twin Ponds and one on Ponus Ridge were sold in the framing stage," he said. Two more have been started on Old Studio Road.
New Canaan is described by realtors and builders as the current hot spot for construction, an assessment borne out by its public school system. Additions under way at all three elementary schools will increase their capacity from 1,387 pupils to more than 1,800, and expansion plans for the middle school will go out to bid in May.
Stoneleigh appears to be the only high-priced subdivision of its size in the area. Most new construction consists of one or two houses on 8- and 10-acre parcels. It also falls into the half of new construction on vacant land, which can cost $750,000 to more than $1 million for a two-acre lot.
The other half involves demolishing older homes to make way for immense new ones. The practice has municipal officials considering new regulations limiting the square footage of buildings relative to the size of the lot. The longing for a grand country house -- English, Norman or Colonial -- can take its toll on the neighborhood.
In Darien, 17,000 square feet of a two-acre lot can be legally covered by a house, tennis court, pool, garage and other structures. "There is talk about adjusting it downward this year," said Ray Nurmi, the town planner.
"Scraping -- that's what they call tearing down and building new in England," said Dan Foley, New Canaan's planning director. "Most of the complaints we get are that houses people build to replace older ones are too big. The value is in the land, and so far what they are doing is legal."
Towns are also looking to protect what land is left. Plans are afoot in Greenwich, a town of 48 square miles, to set up a fund for the municipal acquisition of open space, including some of the scant 2,138 acres of vacant residential land available for development, according to Tom Baptist, the town's conservation director.
WHILE a segment of home buyers will probably always acquire their mansions the old-fashioned way -- by remodeling existing buildings, "busy young people don't want the hassle of redoing an older house," said Ruth LeBlanc-Jones, district manager of Coldwell Banker's new homes division based in New Canaan, whose office is handling sales at Stoneleigh.
"Once they see what it will cost in money, time and aggravation to rip out the plumbing, electrical and heating systems, make repairs and renovations, and still not get exactly what they want, they are better off investing in a new house," she said.
This resurgence of home building raises the specter of the 80's, when buyers fought bidding wars, running up prices to dizzying heights, only to find in the subsequent recession that their mortgages exceeded the resale value of their homes. High-fliers who bought multimillion-dollar homes for cash lost heavily on resales as well.
"I don't perceive this to be a market of the 80's," said Linda Hodge, a vice president at Preferred Properties in Greenwich, a real-estate company. "People then were buying high with the idea of selling higher a couple of years down the road."
Paul Hopper, a Greenwich architect, agreed. "In the 80's, a lot of homes were poorly constructed, overvalued and quickly outdated," he said. "Buyers today are demanding something that will hold its value."

For 1996, Office-Building Sales Top $1 Billion

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
WITH more capital available and its office market on an upswing, 1996 was a banner year for investor purchases of buildings in northern New Jersey, with more than $1 billion in sales. In the process the field of buyers grew, including several from out of state.
"Investors have seized upon office buildings because they are perceived as having the greatest potential return," said Andrew J. Merin, executive director of the financial services department at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage. While sales prices increased, they are still below replacement costs, he added. 
 Last year his concern reported that 28 buildings of 95,000 square feet or more, totaling 9.2 million square feet, were sold and 2.4 million more square feet in 8 buildings were under contract in the 11-county northern New Jersey market. That compares to 35 sales totaling 9.3 million square feet, purchased for $844 million in 1994 and 1995.
"Adding value is the name of the game today," said Geoffrey Schubert, senior vice president at the New Jersey offices of Koll, a national real estate firm. He said investors are buying on the theory that rents can be raised as the market continues to improve.
Local development companies continued to buy, often in partnership with large institutions. Among them were SJP Properties of Parsippany and Gale & Wentworth of Florham Park. But the dominant players were real estate investment trusts, led by Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford and joined by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation in Melville L.I.
Other out-of-state buyers included the Townsend Company of Towson, Md.; TA Associates Realty of Boston; K/B Realty Advisors with offices in Newport Beach, Calif., and Boston; and the Berwind Property Group of Philadelphia.
Prices rose to an average of $100 a square foot, up from $90 in 1995 and 1994, with Class A, mostly occupied buildings going for $150, according to Cushman & Wakefield. The rise did not scare off investors because rents also rose and the cost of buying a building was still 10 to 15 percent less than the cost of constructing one.
Many buildings trading hands are substantially leased and well located in tightening secondary markets. But the activity is spilling over to vacant or nearly vacant buildings and/or those in secondary locations in rebounding markets.
The strengthening office market is also stoking sales. Vacancy rates at year's end dipped 3 percentage points to 16.4 percent and average asking rents rose to $23.41 a square foot from $22.53, reported Cushman & Wakefield.
The lack of office-building construction also helped, as did the state's improving economy and job picture. New Jersey has regained 204,000 of the 262,000 jobs lost in the recession, according to state figures.
MOREOVER, capital for purchases is flowing in, mainly from institutional sources, including pension funds and real estate investment trusts. And the northern New Jersey market's size -- with 140 million square feet of space it is the sixth largest in the nation -- turned investors' eyes to New Jersey "as the current land of opportunity," said Mr. Schubert.
Cali Realty, for instance, purchased 15 buildings with a total of 3.3 million square feet of space at a total cost of $450 million. Its largest acquisition, and the biggest in the state, was the 1.9-million-square-foot Harborside Financial Center on the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. Cali bought it for $282 million from US Pension Trust, a division of US West, a telecommunications company in Englewood, Colo.
Of the competition from other investors, Thomas A. Rizk, president and chief financial officer at Cali said: "While the investment community is recognizing New Jersey as a good market, we started buying two years ago, giving us a huge headstart." He said his concern would "acquire its fair share" of the $1 billion in purchases it is considering. But if prices get too high and the return is too slim, "we will not buy," he said, adding that "nothing is in the pipeline to change our rate of acquisition."
He said he was continuing to look for well-leased buildings with rents that were at or below the market and that could be raised. The company may expand into Philadelphia and New York State, he added.
Another big buyer was K/B Realty, which bought 1.6 million square feet of space. That includes the 600,000-square-foot Metropolitan Corporate Plaza in Woodbridge, purchased from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for $41.5 million.
"We're buying opportunistic properties, those that are 60 to 70 percent vacant and have upside potential," said Robert A. Provost, director of real estate acquisitions for the company, which invests on behalf of large pension funds.
"New Jersey is getting crowded," said Mr. Provost. But that will not "preclude us from looking in the state," as long as there continues to be upward pressure on rents, demand from tenants for space and little new construction, he added.
Among the local companies with a hearty appetite for space was Gale and Wentworth, which acquired 1.5 million square feet in 11 properties. The largest was its $25 million purchase of the 560,000-square-foot, mostly empty former I.B.M. complex in Franklin Lakes.
The firm focuses on such properties where value can be added. It buys with its own equity and that of institutions such as Morgan Stanley.
"There is a lot of capital chasing a few good deals," said Finn Wentworth, a principal, Still, he said his firm is reviewing sales, totaling 1 million square feet.
Meanwhile, Reckson entered the market with the $56 million purchase of 500,000 square feet of space in a four-building complex in West Orange and an office building in Montvale. Scott Rechler, its chief operating officer, said his company did so "after monitoring the market for a year and deciding there were enough opportunities available."
AS it has done in Westchester County, N.Y., and Stamford, Conn., Reckson bought the properties from entities associated with a local developer, Robert Heller, and set up a New Jersey division "giving us a local market presence" said Mr. Rechler.
"Our goal is to create value in real estate over the long term," he added. What makes northern New Jersey distinct, he said, is its size and leasing activity. He said his company expected to close on several more buildings, totaling up to 1 million square feet, in the first quarter of 1997.
Some investors, like the Townsend Company, feel the playing field is getting too crowded. The company, as it has done elsewhere, bought a mostly vacant, 660,000-square-foot, three-building complex in Franklin Township from Mutual Benefit Life Assurance Company at "below replacement cost," said Daniel C. Cramer, vice president at Townsend. He said his company then leased out all but 130,000 square feet at $17.50 to $20 a square foot, adding that rents had been "in the $16 range." Brokers say the price was $27 million, a figure Mr. Cramer would not confirm.
The company also bought a 738,000-square-foot office building in downtown Newark, where he also hopes to increase the rents.
"We caught the market just as it was rising," he said. "We had one good year but with the increasing competition and sale prices it's questionable whether we will get a second."
Analysts say the pace of buying will slow when the prices exceed replacement cost -- about $150 to $180 a square foot -- or rents rise high enough, about $25 to $30 a square foot, to spark new construction. Another factor that could slow buying is if the state's economy sputters and tenants put leasing decisions on hold.
But, they add, since none of those factors are on the near-term horizon purchases are to expected to continue for another 12 months. Still, the volume will decrease due to a lack of high quality buildings being marketed, said David Bernhaut, director of the Cushman & Wakefield Financial Services Department in the East Rutherford office.
"We see a step up in buildings that have been stabilized and will be made available for sale by owners, who are looking to take advantage of the strength of the capital market," he added.
That will draw more investor interest, likely producing "increasing prices and decreasing returns, only this time for Class B buildings," said Mr. Bernhaut.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
An Old Word Is Back: Prosperity

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
ASK real-estate professionals what's on the horizon and their answers would have been unimaginable not so long ago: Speculative building of unsubsidized office towers in Manhattan for the first time since the 1980's. Conversion of older office buildings to hotels. Redevelopment of the retail spaces at Rockefeller Center. Finally, a decision on what to do with the New York Coliseum property at Columbus Circle.
These are events many real estate executives expect to happen this year, following what they say was the prosperity that finally returned to the market in full measure in 1996. 
 It was a year that saw vacancy rates in the most desirable midtown office buildings fall into the single digits for the first time since late 1994, and the Durst Organization all but complete leasing of its new building at the corner of Broadway and 42d Street before demolition of the old structures on the site was finished. The price of existing properties rose as well, with prime buildings selling at over $200 a square foot, which is double the level of just a few years ago.
In the retail area, Mickey Mouse and the Disney Company opened on the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street, making it clear that the long-awaited redevelopment of the Times Square area was really going to happen. Warner Brothers expanded and Niketown joined it, along with Tiffany and Chanel, on 57th Street, providing destinations for local shoppers and the tourists who continued to crowd the city's streets right through the end of the year.
"Popular culture is what's driving the city today, not the financial institutions of the past," said James A. Austrian, president of Austrian Shapiro & Partners, a real estate consulting company in New York. "Not many people are visiting Wall Street these days, but they are visiting Times Square and shopping at Disney and Warner and packing into theme restaurants. It's all related to entertainment."
Hotels were jammed almost to capacity, with room rates up sharply. Retailers benefited as well, with luxury companies establishing themselves uptown, while some big-box stores, notably Kmart, on 34th Street and at Astor Place, opening despite a political row between the Mayor and the City Council over whether they should be permitted in other areas of the city.
Office leasing, one of the primary engines that drive the New York economy, was brisk in the prime areas of midtown, although some brokers cautioned that much of the activity was from tenants seeking to upgrade their space or location, rather than economic growth or an influx of companies.
"There has been a lot of lateral movement in the midtown Manhattan market," said James S. Meiskin, the president of Plymouth Partners. He said that large numbers of tenants in less desirable Class B buildings had moved to Class A properties.
The result was to diminish the supply of Class A space available, increasing the pressure to commence new construction.
The availability of Class A space in midtown declined to 8.85 percent last month, compared with 10.4 percent in December 1995, according to RE/Locate, a real-estate information concern.
"There was a real energy in the market in 1996," said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker with the Edward S. Gordon Company. "There was a sense among customers that opportunities would disappear if they did not act quickly. In fact we saw something we had not seen in a long time: tenants competing for space."
Rents did not increase markedly -- rising to an average of $40.05 a square foot for Class A buildings in midtown in December, compared with $39.70 in the previous year, according to Re/Locate. However, brokers reported that landlords were offering less in free rent periods and other concessions. One estimated that the free rent period in midtown was down to about 6 months compared with 9 to 15 months in 1995.
Some market participants said the prosperity was not spread evenly, that the urge to upgrade had left owners of Class B buildings with increased amounts of vacated space. "It is a bifurcated market," said Ruth Colp-Haber, a partner in Wharton Property Advisors, a tenants' broker. "The best spaces in a market go first, but the B buildings in midtown are not participating in the boom."
Another cautionary note was sounded by Anthony E. Malkin, the president of W & M Properties, a company that owns and manages real estate. He noted that the Manhattan economy had generated just 25,000 net new jobs during the previous year and said that, in his view, much of the city's office -- as well as residential -- recovery had been driven by Wall Street, and especially such high-fee-generating activities as initial public offerings. "The I.P.O. market set a record in 1995, and 1996 blew that away," he said. "I have the sense that we are at the top of a very high pinnacle and if Wall Street hiccups the rest of us will get a bad case of indigestion."
Nevertheless, demand is strong enough so that combined Class A and B vacancy rates should be in single digits by the end of this year, said Darcy Stacom, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield.
"That means we are getting close to new construction," she said. "The need is obvious; there are tenants available and financing is available."
In the meantime, upgrades of older buildings are the hot product on the market, said Jerry L. Cohen, vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield. He said the rapid leasing of the former Metropolitan Life building at 11 Madison Avenue at 24th Street, where the telecommunications, elevators, electrical power and air-conditioning systems were completely retrofitted, is an example of how well this approach works.
"As brokers, it has been as if were have been selling used cars," he said. "Now we are in a new-car showroom."
 
Building Sales
 
Prices Rise to Levels Of the Mid-1980's
Another indicator of the strength of the market is the rapidly rising price of existing buildings, market participants say. "Last year brought us back to the levels of the mid-1980's," said Peter Hauspurg, chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties, a brokerage company specializing in sales. "I'm amazed at how quickly the office market has come back."
From a high of about $290 a square foot, the average value of Class A Manhattan office buildings fell to about $100 in 1993, he said. "Now it is back to about $200 a foot on average."
He said the ready availability of financing, particularly from Wall Street, was supporting the rise in prices. In addition, he said there were numerous transactions in which cheap debt was substituted for expensive equity, which had the effect of increasing the prices of the buildings involved. He said capital was currently available at 8 percent interest to replace funds with a 20 percent return.
Ms. Stacom said the availability of capital made possible deals that might not have been completed a few years ago. "I haven't added it all up yet," she said, "but I would not be surprised to find, if you include Rockefeller Center, that total sales in 1996 went over $4.5 billion, which is more than any time in the 1980's."
Ms. Stacom said she expected sales prices to keep rising until a new supply of prime space was announced. "In 1997 you are likely to see $300 a foot for trophy properties in midtown," she said.
There is one new building going up in midtown, of course, the 48-story, 1.6 million-square-foot tower being built by the Durst Organization. The project started last spring with Conde Nast, the publishing company, as the anchor tenant committed to lease 585,000 square feet of space.
In October, Douglas Durst, the president of the real-estate company, announced that the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom had agreed to leave its present location at Third Avenue and 56th Street and lease 660,000 square feet of space, virtually filling the office part of the structure.
Because of the building's location in the redeveloping Times Square area, it benefited from $10.7 million in city aid, and most real estate professionals said the project's economics would not have made sense without the assistance.
But with the continued strengthening of the market those economics are changing, market players say. "This is the year you will see the start of a nonsubsidized, speculative office building," Mr. Hauspurg said.
 
Retail
 
That's Entertainment: A Very Good Year
With the opening of the second Disney store in Manhattan, at the southwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue -- the first is at Fifth Avenue and 55th Street -- and a larger Warner Bros. Studio Store and a new Niketown on 57th Street, entertainment retail became firmly established in Manhattan.
"Good things happened in retail last year and Niketown and Warner Brothers helped add to the excitement," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of Lansco Corporation. "But you also had Armani and Versace uptown and J. Crew in SoHo. The whole retail sector had a lot of energy and many of the stores have done quite well."
One pleasant surprise was the Borders Books and Music store in the World Trade Center, said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director of Edward S. Gordon Company. "The was the first store of that size in that part of Manhattan and it was assumed it would be a 9-to-5, five-day-a-week operation," he said. "But it's doing well at night and on weekends and that has got other retailers looking in the area."
He said rents for retail spaces were up 12 to 15 percent last year over 1995 levels.
"Last year was the best for retail leasing since 1980," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in New Spectrum Realty Services, a New York brokerage specializing in retail leasing. "It helps that neighborhoods, like 14th Street and 34th Street, that were distressed are coming back with the help of their business improvement districts."
The biggest comeback of all is Times Square because it is the face the city projects to the world. "The transformation of Times Square is the most important urban renewal project since Lincoln Center in the 1960's," Mr. Fox said.
All retail specialists said the influx of tourists, encouraged in part by the city's improving image, has been a boon for storekeepers by increasing sales. "Try to exchange a package at Saks and you find that nobody's speaking English," Mr. Victor said. "Tourism used to be a seasonal thing, but now it's 12 months a year and that is wonderful for retailers."
"New York is has become the international city of the world now that it is perceived as safe and clean," said Mr. Cohen, of Cushman & Wakefield. "You have all the international companies that are located here, you have the United Nations and I've never seen as many tourists on the streets as there are now."
One question facing the retail sector this year is what will happen to the large stores offering a wide range of goods, often at lower prices than those in smaller shops already established in neighborhoods. A city administration proposal to alter zoning rules to allow them in old manufacturing locations was rejected by the City Council after extended debate.
"There will be an opportunity for large retailers to locate in New York," said Mr. Seligman of Edward S. Gordon. "That decision just made it more difficult, because it conveyed the impression that somehow New York has voted to keep big stores out."
Another question is what will happen at Rockefeller Center, which came under the management of Tishman Speyer Properties in a complex financial transaction last year. Brokers said the new management considers the retail operations of the center, which receives millions of visitors a year, in addition to its tenants, to be underutilized.
"They are looking at a lot of different concepts, including the creation of bigger spaces," Mr. Victor said. "They could combine the ground floor, the concourse and maybe even the second floor to make those big spaces."
A decision is similarly expected on how to redevelop the site of the Coliseum at Columbus Circle. State officials have said they expect to decide by spring which of nine competing proposals they will accept. The proposals, each backed by a development group, include a mix of residential, commercial and retail applications.
In addition, a decision may be announced on what will happen at the site of the former Alexander's department store, which occupies most of the block between 58th and 59th Streets and Lexington and Third Avenues. The property is controlled by Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook, N.J. Brokers said the company was trying to decide whether to develop the property as retail again or to convert the site to residential usage.
 
Hotels
 
Occupancy Rises, And So Do Prices
The surge in tourism that has helped retailers has produce nothing short of a boom for hotel owners and operators. Indeed, complaints are heard about how difficult it is to get a hotel room in the city or the suburbs.
The occupancy rate for hotels in the city last year was 81.5 percent, up from 79.5 percent in 1995, said John A, Fox, a director of PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels.
"That is the highest level of occupancy since we started keeping records in the 1960's," Mr. Fox said. Since there are certain periods of slack demand that are almost structural, he said it is not likely that occupancy rates would go much higher.
What can go higher is room rates, which increased to an average of $170.50 a night, about a 10 percent increase over the 1995 average of $155.50, according to Mr. Fox.
The higher occupancy rates and room charges, plus the fact that very little new construction is under way, are pushing up the value of existing hotels, according to Stephen Rushmore, the president of HVS International, which appraises values.
"Values went up 42 percent in 1996," he said, "compared to an increase of 31 percent in 1995 and declines of 23 percent in 1991 and 15 percent in 1992."
He said that domestic and foreign investors who would not touch a hotel property in New York in the late 80's and early 90's are looking for properties to acquire. "Most of the talk today is about conversions, which can be done more quickly than new construction," he said.
One example of this effort is the old Macmillan building at 52d Street and Third Avenue, where the upper tower is to be converted into a Marriott Courtyard hotel starting this spring.
Some new hotels are expected as well, including one to be built by Tishman Realty & Construction Company as part of its E Walk project along Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets.
 
The Suburbs
 
Despite Downsizing, Demand Grows
The demand for office and retail space extended to the suburbs ringing New York, although the effects of corporate downsizing continued to be felt in places like Westchester County.
"As a general rule, the buildings in the suburbs that are successful are the ones catering to small business, not big corporate clients," said Richard Podos, a vice president of Equis Corporation, a brokerage concern specializing in representing tenants. "And the reason is that there are fewer big businesses and a lot more small ones."
He said Class A property in northern New Jersey was growing scarce, although less desirable office space remained available. Nevertheless, he said, builders are cautious when contemplating new construction. "Speculative developers now build a building about halfway and then go out and market it like crazy before finishing," he said.
The flight to quality continued in the Westchester and Fairfield County markets, said Kim Mowers, a senior vice president and district manager with Grubb & Ellis. "Vacancies are in the single digits in Stamford and Greenwich because a lot of the people who were downsized and spun off started their own businesses," he said. "But the Class B market will continue to be frustrated because many of those buildings are functionally obsolete."
He said a good indication of the improvement in the market was the decision of the owners of 287 Corporate Plaza in White Plains., a building whose construction was halted as a steel skeleton in 1990, to proceed with the project.
 
Downtown
 
An Unclear Future, But Hope for Success
The future of New York City's other central business district remained unclear, although the success of the Borders Books store and projects to convert old office buildings to residences held out hope that the Giuliani administration's plan to transform the formerly commercial area into a neighborhood may succeed.
"The conversions are happening," said Michael G. Geoghegan, a consulting director of the Gordon company. "25 Broad, 45 Wall and 127 John Streets are being converted and by the end of 1997 there will be 1,500 to 2,000 rental units available." He said that while some of the older buildings in the area were unsuitable for use by the financial companies that are still the area's major employer, lower rents were an attraction to other companies. "Rentals are $8 to $10 a foot lower than midtown and with a spread of that size you start to see migration."
"I think we are going to see a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week market in downtown," said Mr. Cohen. "It's like the Upper East Side. People want to live near where they work. So if the residential is successful, it is going to help the office market."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Will the Diesel-Bus Fleet Survive Trenton's Eco-Politics?

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
The belching diesel bus, long a hallmark of New Jersey's public transportation system, will be fighting for survival this year in in the State Legislature.
Two bills introduced last year by three Democrats -- Anthony Impreveduto and Joseph V. Doria Jr., the minority leader, in the Assembly and Nicholas J. Sacco in the Senate -- would force New Jersey Transit to buy vehicles that run only on alternative fuels: compressed natural gas, electricity or ethanol, for example. They would also require the agency to use bio-diesel, which comes from soybeans, in all buses purchased in the current and two successive fiscal years. 
 While political experts doubted the bills would survive in their current form, they said the coming gubernatorial election year, along with the possibility of more stringent Federal clean-air guidelines, have made it likely that some environmentally friendly compromise will be produced.
So far the bills have gained the support of 20 assemblymen and senators, including Richard H. Bagger, conference leader for the Republican controlled Assembly. While sponsors would need stronger Republican support for passage, the support that Governor Whitman has given, in principle, for some move toward alternative-fuel vehicles is likely to help sway her party should she not chose to offer her own plan.
"It is an election year and the environment is an apple pie issue," said David P. Rebovic, a political science professor at Rider University. "The incentive on both sides of the aisle will be to latch on to this and push things forward."
Mrs. Whitman's interest in the issue became apparent on Wednesday, when Harriet Derman, the Governor's chief of staff, and Eileen McGinnis, her chief of policy and planning, began the first of what is expected to be several high-level meetings with environmental groups. Representatives from the State Department of Environmental Protection, which supports phasing out of the authority's more than 2,000 diesel busses, also attended.
According to administration officials, the Governor is looking at several options that would force New Jersey Transit to the table, among them placing language in the state budget to earmark money to build compressed natural gas fueling stations and to buy the buses that use the fuel.
Transit authorities in other large cities, as well as the Postal Service and many local delivery companies, have embraced alternative fuels like compressed natural gas, which is relatively pollution-free and cheap at the pump. Alternative-fuel vehicles now make up one of the fastest growing sectors of the public transit market, according to the American Public Transit Association. But New Jersey Transit has so far been reluctant to follow the lead, complaining that the five buses it purchased in 1991 have so far not peformed as well as those in the diesel fleet and that refurbishing a bus depot to handle a large number of compressed natural gas vehicles would cost millions of dollars.
They also say that new formulations of diesel have drastically reduced pollutants, though diesel exhaust remains a chief source of the soot and other emissions that foul the air and contribute to a variety of ailments from asthma to emphysema.
"We have had our share of problems with compressed natural gas," said Jeff Maclin, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. "And frankly I think we have exercised prudence in testing only a small number of these buses. To do otherwise would have raised questions as to whether this was a prudent use of tax dollars."
But mechanical engineers and fuel experts say most mechanical problems caused by compressed natural gas, such as its often uneven fuel content, have largely been overcome by new engineering technology. Other transit agencies agree.
Christopher Lynn, comissioner of the New York City's Department of Transportation, said the city's 55 compressed natural gas buses have far fewer problems than those of its aging diesel fleet. The buses are more economical to operate, he said, and performance -- the amount of time buses are on the road between shop visits -- has helped increase bus service by 30 percent.
"I just wish I could replace all 1,100 of our diesel buses," he said, noting that 174 more compressed natural gas buses have already been ordered by the city.
With a not-so-veiled reference to New Jersey, he added: "We're all part of the same ozone belt here and have the same pollution problems. But we can also have the same benefits because what we are doing in New York City can be be done anywhere."
If New York State's battle over alternative fuels is any indication, New Jersey may soon join the pack. Unlike New York City transit agencies, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority fought for years against committing to buses running on anything but diesel. But this changed after a bill, much like those now working their way through the New Jersey legislature, was introduced by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester County.
Although the bill has never passed, it attracted the attention of Governor George E. Pataki and other powerful politicians, whose patient prodding resulted in a compromise with the New York City Transit Authority last September. Under its guidelines, the authority would replace 500 of its diesel buses with ones that uses natural gas or electricity over a three-year period.
"That's the purpose of bills like this," said Assemblyman Brodsky, speaking of the similarities between his bill and those in New Jersey. "They have a mule and two-by-four quality to them, because they bang people over the head, wake them up to the problem and push the issue to the front."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Trucks Roll Along Town Streets, Trailing Protests

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: EAST AMWELL

 BODY:
Ilona English seems a prototypical resident of this sleepy, picturesque township not far from the cultural riches of Princeton. She is a Wharton graduate, a baby boomer who used to be a financial analyst but now breeds horses, the type of person usually too busy to delve into civic matters.
But there is one local issue about which she has become so passionate that she is willing to go to jail: the increase in the number of trucks rambling past her 250-year-old clapboard house on Route 518. 
 "I never protested in the 1960's, and I've never been arrested," said Ms. English, who is active in an antitruck group called Country Roads Coalition. "But I would gladly do it in this case. If we don't stop this, the whole state will look like the Turnpike and Bayonne."
Ms. English's aggressiveness is emblematic of a surge of civic activism in a well-to-do area that has not been a traditional hotbed of protest. But in the last year or so, half a dozen groups have sprouted in places like the Amwells, the Windsors, the Hopewells and the Princetons, alarmed by a host of transportation issues.
The Truckstop Coalition has distributed more than 500 "No Heavy Trucks" signs to homeowners on properties fronting Routes 31, 206 and 518 (including that of Ms. English). The Princeton Residents Traffic Safety Committee is also concerned about trucks. The Alliance of Bypass Committees objects to a road project called the Hightstown Bypass. The Sensible Transportation Options Partnership (STOP) opposes a project called the Millstone Bypass. The West Windsor Citizens Against the Turnpike Extension objects to both bypass projects.
These groups represent a collective counterweight to the trucking lobby and the State Department of Transportation. The groups are related, in that they are born of two recent changes that have bedeviled residents: the opening of Interstate 287 and the explosion of development in central New Jersey.
Only a few years ago, this area looked different. It was the kind of place where Ms. English could actually ride a horse and buggy into town to run errands.
Then came the completion of I-287 in November 1993. This created toll-free alternatives to the New Jersey Turnpike on local roads like Routes 31 and 206, saving north- and southbound Interstate truckers as much as $61 a round trip. Within 18 months, truck traffic on Route 31 more than tripled, going from 900 trucks a weekday to more than 3,000 a day in March 1995.
Meanwhile, central New Jersey was booming, as more corporations moved to Route 1 and more housing developments popped up on former farmland. No longer did retailers want (or have space) to stockpile goods in warehouses. Instead, they were demanding more just-in-time deliveries, just-in-time manufacturing. One result was an increase in the need for trucks, said Dianne Brake, president of the Middlesex Somerset Mercer Regional Council, a nonprofit planning group.
As a result, transportation officials have floated several plans, some decades old, said John Dourgarian, a public information officer with the State Department of Transportation. Here are three:
* The State Department of Transportation has broken ground on the Hightstown Bypass, which would reroute traffic around Hightstown and into East Windsor on a four-lane highway running from Route 571 just east of Route 535 to Route 33 near Exit 8 of the New Jersey Turnpike. Cost: $56.8 million. Opening: 1999.
* The State Department of Transportation has started environmental work on the Millstone Bypass, a two-lane 2.3-mile road that would channel traffic off Route 571 to ease the bottleneck at Route 1. Plans call for building an overpass near Harrison Street and sealing off parts of Washington Road. Cost: $40 million. Opening: 1998.
* The State Turnpike Authority plans to build Route 92, a four-lane 6.6-mile toll road connecting Route 1 just north of Princeton with the New Jersey Turnpike. Cost: $255 million. Opening: 2001.
But these projects have irked residents. Sandy Solomon, a member of the Princeton Residents Traffic Safety Committee, says building more roads will only entice more traffic. She says resources would be better spent trying to get trucks back on the Interstate highways, and trying to develop more pedestrian and mass transit alternatives.
"The D.O.T. is really the D.O.R.: Department of Roads," said Alan Goodheart, a landscape architect active in Sensible Transportation Options Partnership, which is primarily concerned with the impact of the Millstone Bypass on historic, elm-lined Washington Road. Its subcommittee, Good Options (GO), has proposed an alternative of building a Route 1 underpass below Washington Road.
These concerns have not fallen on deaf ears. In some areas, the Department of Transportation lowered speed limits. In Princeton, the Borough Council plans to introduce an ordinance that would limit the weight of trucks passing through town, said Mayor Marvin Reed.
In West Windsor, the planning board filed a lawsuit in October against the Department of Transportation, seeking to get more information about the Hightstown Bypass and demanding a new route, said Alan Di Sciullo, chairman of the planning board. In Trenton, Assemblyman Leonard Lance, a Republican, has introduced legislation that would restrict truck traffic on local highways.
The trucking lobby has not been impressed. "We haven't gotten off the floor laughing," said Sam Cunninghame, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, about Mr. Lance's bill.
"It's that not-in-my-backyard syndrome," Mr. Cunninghame said. "It's like vigilante. And people haven't thought it through: the better the economy is, the better the trucking business is going to be."
The Department of Transportation, already stung by criticism from many residents, has been treading carefully. "We do believe that these projects will be a clear benefit to the region," Mr. Dourgarian said. "With the issue of truck traffic, it's an issue that won't be solved overnight, but we are committed to seeing it resolved."
But how long that will take is something residents are becoming anxious about.
"There are a lot of people who are newly concerned, who are willing to do whatever it takes," Mr. Goodheart said. "It'll come to protests. It'll come to people lying down in front of bulldozers."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
A Delegation for Gingrich, But Not All the Time

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
In his first two years as Speaker, Newt Gingrich could not always count on New Jersey's Republican delegation to toe the party line.
They did not abandon the leadership on every vote, of course. They supported Mr. Gingrich on most fiscal issues, but they broke with the leadership more than any other delegation except Connecticut. 
 It was mostly on issues: the environment, gun control, Medicare and Medicaid, which are important for political survival in their districts and in a state dominated by voters who are fiscal conservatives but moderate on social issues.
Yet as Mr. Gingrich faced his difficult re-election as Speaker last week, New Jersey's Republican delegation did not balk. They did not join the handful of Republicans who defected because of Mr. Gingrich's ethics problems. All seven New Jersey Republicans voted to keep Mr. Gingrich in control of the House.
In the two weeks leading up to the vote, Representative Marge S. Roukema of Bergen County, the dean of the delegation, had expressed some reservations about supporting Mr. Gingrich before the ethics proceedings were completed.
Of all the Republican members of the delegation, Ms. Roukema is perhaps the most outspoken and best known for urging the leadership to take a more moderate stance on social issues from welfare to family leave.
Ms. Roukema said that she would have liked to see her party elect a temporary Speaker while House members awaited the final recommendations of the Ethics Committee and the report of James M. Cole, the committee's special counsel. But since that was not an option, she said she chose to give Mr. Gingrich the benefit of the doubt.
"I wrestled with this," she said. "I did not want to prejudge him. I did feel that I owed him that, as I would have owed it to anybody to reserve judgment until all of the information is out."
Based on the information that was available about Mr. Gingrich's ethics problems, Representative H. James Saxton of Burlington County said that he had no trouble supporting Mr. Gingrich last week. He credits Mr. Gingrich with moving not only Congress, but also the White House, toward the goal of reducing the size of government and lowering taxes, and he thinks he is the best leader to continue the job.
"The Speaker was accused of and admitted to what seems to me to be a minor infraction of House rules," Mr. Saxton said. "And so he should be held accountable for that infraction. However, in my view, and I think, in the view of other Republican members in New Jersey, that infraction and the penalty for it does not foreclose him the opportunity to be Speaker."
But Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Camden County, criticized Republicans for electing Mr. Gingrich. "He should not be Speaker," Mr. Andrews said. "To elevate someone who is third in line to the Presidency, someone who very clearly has lost the trust of the American people, is the wrong thing to do. "
Representative Mike Pappas, the newly elected Republican from Somerset County who filled Representative Richard A. Zimmer's seat, said he did not have any trouble giving his vote to Mr. Gingrich. "I supported him and I support him because the agenda he has been promoting is the same agenda that I have been promoting. That is tax relief, regulatory relief and more growth in our economy that would benefit business owners and working men and working women. I understand the concerns that have been raised about things. But I look upon the alternative. The alternative is Dick Gephardt. There is no question in my mind that Newt Gingrich's agenda is in sync with the American people."
In a speech after his re-election as Speaker, Mr. Gingrich struck a decidedly more conciliatory tone than he chose two years ago. In this 105th Congress, it appears that New Jersey Republicans may not have to battle over as many issues that are as important to the state, such as environmental protection, as they did in the last two years. "I believe that we have convinced those who wanted to strip away layers of environmental protection that we have an opportunity in the next two years to have environmental policies that are more balanced," Mr. Paxton said.
But most of New Jersey's Republicans vow that they will continue to be independent in those areas that are important to their districts and the state.
The public hearings will soon begin for Mr. Gingrich, who admitted last month that that he had provided the committee with "inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements" about a course that he taught at two small colleges in Georgia. The question is whether he improperly used tax-exempt programs for partisan purposes. Mr. Cole, the special counsel, will present his findings in detail later this month. Then the committee will make its recommendations for punishment.
That will be a far more interesting vote to watch.
"In my opinion, that will be the telling vote," Representative Roukema said. "That will be the determining vote. We will then determine the penalty, whether it is a simple reprimand, and only a slight breach, or whether it is a more serious matter."

Matter of Life or Death: Who Can You Trust?

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
RICHARD WEINER, the public relations executive who helped make the original Cabbage Patch Kids a phenomenon, says he believes unequivocally that terminally ill patients should be able to end their lives. His wife, Florence, who has written several books on practical health issues, is so ambivalent she considers this her "weak" issue. "When did euthanasia become doctor-assisted suicide?" she asks. And her sister, Simi Linton, a professor at Hunter College, went to Washington last week to demonstrate outside the Supreme Court against doctor-assisted suicide and to hand out leaflets for the group Not Dead Yet.
If three members of one close Upper West Side family can offer such a range of opinion in the abstract, one can only imagine the deathbed turmoil of kin in conflict. Money, morphine, guilt, control and convenience are common subplots in the drama surrounding a terminal patient. And the definition of terminal becomes more complex when doctors have to make a prognosis under the growing economic pressure of managed care. 
 Two months ago, a column about arranging for a cremation drew a surprisingly large response from older New Yorkers who wanted to be cremated decorously and at a moderate cost that they would prepay. They did not want to burden their survivors, but they also did not trust that their children wouldn't be "guilt-tripped" by other family members and funeral salespeople into more elaborate send-offs.
But for all their certainties about cremation, when I asked them about living wills and orders not to resuscitate, the discussion faltered. Giving someone else the right to pull the plug, they said, was not easy, especially since they distrusted doctors more than ever; decisions, they felt, might be made not for humane or even medical reasons, but for cost-efficient ones. These people didn't want to suffer, but they didn't want an accountant-assisted suicide.
It was at that time that Mr. Weiner happened to call, to promote the American Academy on Physician and Patient, a small, new organization dedicated to improving communications between doctor and patient, particularly by educating and sensitizing doctors. Mr. Weiner is on the board, and one active member is Dr. Timothy E. Quill, a principal in New York's case before the Supreme Court and a national standard-bearer for the legalization of doctor-assisted suicide.
Mr. Weiner is smart, charming and erudite (he is the author of Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications) but I told him I thought there were enough clubs for doctors. Sure, doctors need to be more sympathetic and to spend more time taking patient histories, but in these days of the five-minute exam, it's the patient who needs to be taught how to be in charge. Mr. Weiner agreed with that and, lexicographer that he is, agreed that the word "patient" needed to be replaced with something less passive, closer to consumer or customer.
In 1981, using public relations language and techniques, he was able to help create an image of cuddly, needy love around a bunch of ugly dolls. Can you imagine what he could do for really needy creatures? Like sick people? Still, his position was clear: the doctor is in the best position to offer a dignified, painless end.
"Doctors have to be convinced they can do a better job by understanding their patients, by knowing the whole person," he said. "Such a doctor would then also be in a position to help end suffering."
Maybe, says Florence, his wife, author of "Recovering at Home With a Heart Condition."
"I want a consortium, checks and balances, reviews," she said. "It's hard for people at their most vulnerable to assert themselves, especially disabled people, who are most dependent on doctors and have the least reason to trust them."
Her sister, Simi Linton, who teaches psychology in Hunter's Division of Education, is an expert in disability studies and is disabled herself. Legal doctor-assisted suicide, she said, would be the "slippery slope" down which a lot of people in wheelchairs would be rolled to death.
"Physicians are generally clueless about people's lives," she said. "I know people who have 24-hour care and are respirator-dependent and lead vigorous lives, married, with jobs. When they get depressed for the same reason anyone gets depressed -- got fired, divorced -- doctors are quick to ascribe it to disability. They assume disability is a tragedy.
"We can't allow physicians to make quality-of life and life-potential decisions. These are power and control issues. I'm also disturbed at how the media treats it, as: here are these poor folks; let's help them end their lives."
The Weiners and Ms. Linton have agreed to disagree on this one, but the debate will rage on, in courts, in kitchens and in hospital rooms.
Mr. Weiner, even though it's been years since he's been down in the Cabbage Patch, winces at my metaphor for giving accountant-whipped doctors too much power: You let those ugly little dolls into your homes, eventually they will start eating your kids.

HEADLINE: Can Superman Be Superseded By a Capeless Wonder?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
LONG ago on a Kansas farm, Martha Kent made the first supersuit for her teen-age son, Clark, who had arrived as a baby in a space capsule. Her Superman would wear a skintight blue leotard, a flowing red cape and a big red "S" on his expansive chest.
So attired, he went on to defend truth, justice and the American way, becoming the planet's most super superhero. Superman claimed a corner of the American consciousness known to Johnny Appleseed, Daniel Boone and Dick Tracy. 
 But soon the very essence of the Man of Steel will change fundamentally. Starting in the May issue of "Superman," which hits the stands in March, the costume lovingly fashioned by Ma Kent will be discarded in favor of high-tech garb, and his powers will become something far different: The man who could leap tall buildings in a single bound and stop bullets with his body will transmit himself through phone lines; bullets will pass though him like a vapor.
Superman will no longer need a cape. The red "S" will be blue, and the yellow background memory. No more red underwear, even the skimpier trunks of recent years. Instead, energy flashes will shoot from his bulkier body like lightning, and his hair will sprout the spiky topography of a club kid's.
Since the new look was previewed in magazines about comic books and on television news programs and talk shows this month, reaction has been sharp. Admirers of the old guy are, to put it mildly, grumbling that the new Superman resembles a tube of toothpaste and worse.
Written and telephone complaints have rained down on Mike Carlin, executive editor of DC Universe, the Time Warner comic-book unit, which owns Superman, Batman and scores of other superheroes. "Everybody says, 'How dare you?' " said the man who calls himself the most hated human in America.
Nowhere is the criticism sharper than on Superman Web sites. One writer called the change "a cynical gimmick"; another, referring to a sinister superhero, said, "This would have worked well for the Eradicator, but not Superman."
Still others fret that one more icon closely linked to the cultural history of the 20th century is being cast aside.
"His meaning to my generation has been lost," moaned Jules Feiffer, the cartoonist, who is 67 and who in his extensive writings about the Man of Steel has dubbed him the "ultimate assimilationist fantasy" in a melting-pot nation. Mr. Feiffer suggested the new Superman looks like "a suffering transvestite," "somebody who just came off the Geraldo show" or "an electic-shock patient."
Tibor Kalman is an influential graphics designer who has made waves by criticizing the processes of corporate creativity, championing a utopian American mythology that even he acknowledges never quite existed. It is his view that the new Superman emerged from a focus group.
"We think we own these characters," he said. "But the reality is that their look and actions are going to be defined by market forces.
"This just isn't human, and Superman's best quality was that he was human. Why don't they redo Mount Rushmore and give the guys better haircuts?"
Could it have something to do with the economic downturn in the comic-book industry, whose annual sales in comic outlets, a DC spokeswoman said, fell to some $450 million last year from more than $1 billion in 1993? Has a treasured icon been transmogrified as a sales gimmick?
The answer, of course, is yes. Mr. Carlin noted that Superman and Batman have weathered the industry slump better than most titles, but declared, "If comic books were selling 10 times what they are now, we would do the same thing to try to sell 11 times more. Everything is geared to selling comic books."
In particular, Mr. Carlin longs to lure the young readers -- especially comic-book-buying adolescents, now engrossed in CD-ROM's and the Internet -- that he fears Superman has lost. He goes so far as to claim a higher purpose: destroying the time-honored look of Superman can serve to pass his values on to an audience attracted by his cool new look.
"This is a way to try to get people to focus on something that feels old-fashioned," he said. "We can now keep the role model in the forefront of the public's eye."
Mr. Carlin, who oversees the team of 18 who write and draw four monthly and one quarterly issue of the Superman comics ($2.50 each), has shocked the public before, only to return to the status quo and count his money. In 1992, he killed the Man of Steel, resulting in the awesome sale of six million copies -- only to resurrect him and again spur sales.
Two months ago, he finally wed Clark Kent and Lois Lane, but only after Clark told his betrothed his other identity.
"If you stand for truth and justice, you can't start your marriage with a lie," Mr. Carlin said solemnly.
Lois thus thought she was marrying a full-time superhero, one who might sometimes wear cape and leotards and other times the off-the-rack threads of a mild-mannered reporter for The Daily Planet. But the new Clark has no superpowers. He wills Superman into being. When he is done saving the world, he wills himself back to whatever Clark was wearing before. (The new "energy being" will no longer need to duck into phone booths.)
So what about supersex? "It's like sleeping with a regular guy now," Mr. Carlin said, without disclosing what it was like before. But he then added an element of mysterious danger. "Realistically speaking, this could become a deadly problem for Lois," he said.
This is because of the tangled plot that has brought Superman to his new blue-costumed world. Some months ago, Earth's sun, the source of Superman's powers, briefly went out. He has since been struggling to get them back, going through a succession of punishing treatments that would have killed a mere mortal.
His new energy form -- and the new clothes that contain it -- is the result of this chemotherapy-like regimen. And it will all take some getting used to: as he zaps from place to place like a bolt of lightning, he will at first experience problems landing, DC editors say.
But it is not just the story line that is disturbing superhero junkies, design gurus and other cultural arbiters. It is such a radical change of appearance in such an immense cultural icon. Why? Why now? What is supertradition worth?
Mr. Carlin answers patly. "We have all the rights, and we can do whatever we want," he said.
Indeed, comic heroes change with some regularity. In the 1980's, Wonder Woman lost her high heels. Over the last year, Spiderman and Dare Devil were overhauled, only to return to their earlier forms after protest. But Superman has undergone only subtle sartorial alterations in 60 years.
Superman loyalists had thought their staid hero was as unchangeable as a "Leave It to Beaver" rerun, but Mr. Feiffer said today's trend represents a sharp reverse of tradition: once, he said, movie heroes resembled their counterparts in comics, but now the reverse is true. "They've all become Stallone," he said.
Mo Chin, 19, a freshman at Vassar College, agreed. "They're making him like every other superhero, aren't they?" he said as he browsed Jim Henley's Universe, a comic-book store on West 33d Street.
The question, in part, is one of pure design. Styles change. Today's superheroes, like Livewire, the Eradicator and many of the X-Men, are super bulked-up and cyber.
Ellen Lupton, curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Smithsonian Institution's design wing, has studied Japanese comic heroes. Superman's Japanese counterparts, she said, depict sexier, grittier heroes on black-and-white pages and are growing in popularity in the United States.
She thinks the new Superman is closer to this cooler image. "The cape is such a Count Dracula notion," she said. "Superman shouldn't need a magic carpet."
Another position is held by Dr. Alan Manevitz, a family psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, who owns some 30,000 comic books. He is writing a book on how the news and entertainment media, including comic books, affect youth. He suggests the big red "S" has deep and important meanings, sending a message of continuity across the generations.
"Children like to know there is somebody special out there to help them," he said. "They need to understand that there is some purity."
Superman himself grew up immersed in the traditional values of Jonathan and Martha Kent, playing softball and sitting under a tree with a book on that mythical Kansas farm. And many of his fans hope fervently he will go right back to the familiar muscle man after the latest change jangles cash registers for a while.
"We all know that this is a cheap sales gimmick designed to last four to six months," scoffed Mitch Cutler, owner of St. Marks Comics, at 11 St. Marks Place.
"We never say never," Mr. Carlin responded. "We never say forever."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Expanding, but Keeping an Eye on Value

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
FROM his staid gray suit to his low-turnover fund portfolio, Legg Mason's William H. Miller 3d is hardly a follower of fashion. But in 1996, a year when investors turned from mutual funds focusing on hot-growth companies to funds emphasizing more solid performers, Mr. Miller found himself, his funds and his value investing method very much in fashion.
Mr. Miller is manager or co-manager of three Legg Mason stock funds whose combined $3.2 billion in assets represents more than half the total of the company's 17 stock and bond retail funds. All three soared to top rankings last year: The flagship Value Trust fund, with a return of 38.3 percent, ended 1996 in the top 2 percent of all mutual funds; just behind it were Total Return Trust, which he manages with Nancy T. Dennin, and Special Investment Trust. In the fourth quarter, Value Trust, up 14.75 percent, ranked No. 2 among more than 1,700 diversified stock funds. 
 Armed with these impressive results, plus excellent performance from funds like its American Leading Companies Trust, Legg Mason plans to expand this year by creating a series of funds that will aim at the growing 401(k) market. The funds, for institutional investors, are expected to be introduced within six months and will be built on the company's successful retail portfolios.
"It is our strong intention to have 8 to 12 new funds," said Edward A. Tabor 3d, Legg Mason's senior executive vice president. "The beauty is we have the fund managers. We can take a Bill Miller and let him continue to run the Value fund, but at the same time he can have a portfolio almost, if not exactly, like Value that is distributed to institutional clients for, say, 401(k) plans."
LEGG MASON, based in Baltimore, started its first fund, Value Trust, in 1982, and has developed several others. But the group accelerated its growth in the last two years by acquiring asset-management operations. In January 1995, it bought Batterymarch and soon started two funds under Batterymarch management, Legg Mason International Equity and Legg Mason Emerging Markets. Last January, it acquired Bartlett & Company of Cincinnati, which oversees $211 million in assets in two stock mutual funds under its own name.
Legg Mason gained an international distribution line in February with the purchase of Lehman Brothers Global Asset Management, which had $2.9 billion in assets divided among institutional accounts and offshore debt and equity funds. The funds are now reorganized as the LM Global Funds.
"We want to build resources internally, but if it will take us three to five years to develop a product, we'll buy the expertise," said Raymond A. Mason, the company's chairman and chief executive known universally as Chip. The firm now manages more than $40 billion in assets, with a goal of $100 billion by 2000.
As it grows, the fund family is contributing a larger portion of Legg Mason's overall revenue. Half comes from the brokerage arm, called Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., but the asset management division, which includes the mutual funds, now generates 29 percent, up from 18 percent in 1990. The rest comes from commercial mortgage banking.
Mr. Mason said asset management "probably contributes over 40 percent of our profits, and probably the single biggest source of that group's profits is the mutual funds."
In the fiscal year ended in March the company took in $516 million, versus $389 million a year earlier, and earned $38 million, versus $16 million. In the first six months of fiscal 1997, earnings were $26 million, up 53 percent from the period a year earlier, and revenue was $296 million, up 23 percent.
Legg Mason was created through the merger of Legg & Company, a Baltimore firm that traced its roots to 1899, and Mason & Company, a Newport News, Va., firm founded by Mr. Mason in 1962. The company has always used value investing, and Mr. Miller has adhered to it, but with his own spin.
A former candidate for a doctorate in philosophy, Mr. Miller, 46, retains a scholarly bent that he applies to investing. He is on the board of the Santa Fe Institute, which is devoted to studying similarities within complex systems like economics, ecology and the body's immune system. Because these systems adapt to their environments, the Santa Fe theory holds that history does not always repeat itself. Using that idea, Mr. Miller and his six researchers try to look past traditional data on stocks.
"We say changes are context-dependent," Mr. Miller said. "This summer, when the market fell out of bed, it was because everyone believed the Fed would tighten based on a specific employment report. The Fed doesn't tighten because of one report. The environment was conducive for the Fed to tighten, but not all of the data indicated that it would." Mr. Miller stood pat on his funds and the Fed did not move.
Mr. Miller looks at price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-book value and cash-flow ratios, but only as a starting point. He says a forward-looking approach is to be more attentive to free cash flow than to earnings. "We bought a big position in I.B.M. two years ago when it was in the $50's," he said. "Before that, it had been a cash user. In 1994 it went cash positive, focusing on profitability, not sales growth." The stock is currently trading at $163. "We don't forecast the market or prices," he said. "We try to understand where things are going."
That approach has led Mr. Miller to a longstanding bet in the financial sector. In September, the latest portfolio reporting period, Value Trust had 47 percent of assets in financials; Total Return, about 40 percent.
"If you say what makes a company do well in this market, you would look for earnings growth faster than the market, return on capital that is higher than the market, dividends equal to or higher than the market, dividend growth that is faster than the market, a company that generates excess cash and management that uses excess cash to increase shareholder value," he said. "That's a description of the bank group."
Mr. Miller started buying bank stocks in the early 80's, when the Mexican debt crisis cut many prices; he suffered through the down times of the early 90's, adjusting his portfolio to hold banks he saw as positioned for recovery and growth.
"With hindsight, we can see it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Russel Kinnel, equity fund editor for Morningstar Mutual Funds.
PART of Mr. Miller's success can be attributed to a long investment horizon. Turnover in Value Trust is so low, said Christine Benz, associate analyst for equities at Morningstar Mutual Funds, that "it's positively glacial."
Mr. Miller said his average holding period was about five years, so turnover is about 20 percent a year.
Although his reading list includes books like "Adaptive Individuals in Evolving Populations," Mr. Miller is plain-spoken and likes to make stock-picking sound simple.
"We like to buy hysteria and sell euphoria," he said. "One of the reasons the fund has done well this year is there was hysteria in tech stocks." He cites a day last February when Compaq announced some distribution problems that sent computer stocks into a spin. He bought a million shares of Dell Computer at about $14; it is now at $60.
Of course, not every stock pick or yearly performance has fared as well. In four out of five years in the late 80's, Value underperformed the broad market. "In a recession, banks tend to go down more than other stocks and our heavy financial weighting hurt us," Mr. Miller said.
So how does he envision Value performing this year?
"If I were an investor looking to put my money in a fund today," Mr. Miller said, "I don't know that I would go with Value."
Instead, he prefers his Special Investment Trust for its emphasis on the mid-cap market. "Going forward, I would be surprised if Value outperforms Special," he said. "The relative performance of small or mid-sized companies will match or exceed large companies. This stuff tends to work in cycles."

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
Despite a Lack of Bells or Whistles, A Can Maker May Be a Good Buy

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
SILGAN HOLDINGS is hardly typical of the ventures taking a bow in the new-issues market. The company has nothing to do with the Internet or with some innovative medical device. No one thinks its business is about to take off. And while it is not exactly a Rust Belt manufacturer, the company comes close in terms of excitement: it is the country's largest maker of metal food containers, like soup and coffee cans.
But investors may find Silgan alluring nonetheless, particularly given some of its other distinctive qualities. For example, unlike many new issues, it has a reasonable offering price. And even people who shun new issues because they fear an economic downturn might want to own these shares, which seem recession-resistant. 
 Founded in 1987 by two former executives of Continental Can, Silgan has spent the last decade buying up consumer packaging businesses from companies like Del Monte and Nestle, and signing contracts to provide containers for their vegetables or cocoa. The strategy of the company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., is to shut down the least efficient operations and consolidate the rest, to become the low-cost producer.
"It follows the basic trend we have seen of outsourcing," said Ryan Jacob, the director of research for the IPO Value Monitor, a research service for new issues.
So far, Silgan has succeeded. "They have a very good track record of making acquisitions and folding them into the company," Mr. Jacob said. The company's share of the domestic market for metal food containers has increased from about 10 percent in 1987 to 36 percent in 1995, and sales reached $1.08 billion for the nine months ended last September.
But to finance all these acquisitions, Silgan has taken on substantial debt. As of Sept. 30, its balance sheet was weighed down with roughly $700 million in long-term debt, more than twice its proposed market value of roughly $300 million. Indeed, virtually all the roughtly $65 million that Silgan expects to raise from the new offering -- it will offer 3.5 million shares at $17 to $20 a share, within the next month or so -- is earmarked for paying off some of its high-cost loans. The company also has plans to refinance some of its debt.
Although those moves will save the company about $20 million in cash interest payments, Silgan will still be left with as much as $880 million in long- and short-term debt. That would generally raise eyebrows, but analysts are not concerned because of Silgan's good cash flow. "If you have very stable, consistent earnings, you can afford to take on debt," said Mark S. Basham, a new-issues analyst for Standard & Poor's.
While Silgan is not the only option for investors interested in the packaging business, its stock may be more attractively priced than that of competitors like the Crown Cork and Seal Company and the Ball Corporation, according to Mr. Basham. One reason is the lack of enthusiasm these days for new issues.
For example, the stock of Crown Cork and Seal closed at $52 on Friday, a price equal to 16 times the company's estimated earnings a share this year. But Silgan's stock, at an approximate offering price of $18.50, would be trading at just seven times its estimated 1997 earnings of $2.60 a share, adjusted for certain tax benefits.
True, Silgan deserves a lower multiple because of its high debt and because its stock is new to the market. But Mr. Basham, for one, thinks the stock should still trade at a higher multiple than its estimated one; he judges the proper multiple to be between 9 and 10, which would translate into a stock price of $23.40 to $26.
But in another contrast to many new issues, the stock may need to be held for more than a day or two to realize most of such a gain. To justify a higher price with higher profits, Silgan will need to continue to pare down debt and make smart acquisitions. Those efforts will take time, Mr. Basham warned.
The company also plans to expand its plastics business, making items like containers for high-priced bottled water. And it hopes to increase its share of the market for specialty products like metal fasteners for glass jars.
Investors -- especially those who get great comfort from the predictability of a company's business -- may find the wait worthwhile. While Silgan's business depends somewhat on the weather (the smaller the lima bean harvest, for example, the fewer the cans required), the company is less vulnerable to a downturn in the economy or in the stock market.
Nevertheless, Silgan "is certainly not going to be a big winner," Mr. Basham said. But sometimes a nice gain from a colorless stock is all you need to end up ahead.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Price of Success: An Unbalanced Portfolio

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
PICKING stocks may not replace fixing teeth as his profession, but Bruce Bieber, a dentist in Bayside, Queens, is no passive investor.
"Sometimes I get caught up in the frenzy of the market," Dr. Bieber said. "I'll study a company, especially some of the smaller Nasdaq companies, and if I think it's a good one, I'll go for it." 
 As with many other investors last year, Dr. Bieber's enthusiasm was well repaid. With the Standard & Poor's 500 earning a total return of 22.96 percent in 1996, his stocks and equity mutual funds grew substantially, giving his overall portfolio an estimated gain of 16 percent.
But as investors perform the January rite of reviewing their portfolios for the new year, the market's 1996 gains and the resulting enthusiasm for stocks put a particular spin on the job. As Lewis J. Altfest, Dr. Bieber's financial planner, described it, "Because Dr. Bieber's stock portion did so well last year, it's out of whack with the rest of his portfolio. Though he may not like it, it's time to rebalance and put more in bonds and cash."
In other words, because stocks have risen so much, they occupy a larger percentage of Dr. Bieber's holdings, and other investors' holdings, than they did before 1996.
This process of allocating assets among the basic classes of investment -- and regularly reviewing the allocation -- is crucial to a portfolio's success, accounting for more than 90 percent of the differences in investors' returns, planners say. Put another way, although investors may spend much time choosing between two different stocks, it is the broader decision of how much to apportion to stocks, bonds and cash that most powerfully affects returns.
Experts caution, however, that no one asset allocation is proper for everyone. "The asset-allocation plan for each individual will most likely differ according to age, income, financial goals, risk tolerance and other factors," said Joel Isaacson, a New York financial planner. And even for the same person, planners will differ on the allocation they consider appropriate.
"It's more an art than a science," Mr. Isaacson said.
Most experts agree, however, on certain generalizations. A single, 25-year-old investor with a long-term horizon would invest most of his money in equities, with the balance in bonds and cash. A couple in their 30's with young children would also have much of their long-term money in stocks, though probably less than the 25-year-old. And an older person about to retire might devote even less of his portfolio to equities.
But whatever the preferred percentages, the 1996 bull market has made many investors stock-heavy relative to their desired allocation. Dr. Bieber, for example, is 39. He and his wife, Aimee, and their two children, Evan, 11, and Dayna, 8, live in Plainview, L.I. In view of the family's income, college plans and other factors, Mr. Altfest's prescribed asset allocation plan calls for 78 percent stocks, 17 percent bonds and 5 percent cash. But after the success of stocks last year, the Bieber portfolio now looks like this: 83 percent equities, 14 percent bonds and 3 percent cash.
Last year's gains are not the only reason Mr. Altfest wants to lighten up on the stocks in Dr. Bieber's portfolio. Adding to the pressure is Mr. Altfest's overall view of stocks for 1997. "I think the U.S. stock market is at the high end," he said. "I want my clients who have a heavy equity exposure to be prepared for a possible correction."
Other experts agree.
"We think this year will be a moderately down year because we have had higher interest rates, declining earnings growth and very high price-earnings ratios," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in New York. In early December, he shifted his recommended portfolio from 50 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds and 15 percent cash to 45 percent equities, 35 percent bonds and 20 percent cash.
As investors review their asset allocations, however, they must avoid several mistakes. For example, while the recent bull market may make many investors overly enamored of stocks, a common error in the past has been the reverse: too much in bonds and cash. At the end of 1995, 36 percent of all 401(k) assets were in money markets, bonds or other stable investments, according to Access Research in Windsor, Conn.
"Investors usually lean toward fixed income or cash because they fear short-term risk and volatility," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. But given that stocks outperform other assets in the long run, these investors "are embracing the risk that they won't make their long-term goals on a real-dollar basis, after inflation."
Another common error: forgetting to include all relevant accounts in computing an allocation. Investors may include their 401(k) plan, for example, but forget that dusty I.R.A.
Moreover, many people may resist changing an asset allocation if it means reducing the portion of a portfolio that has done well recently. Many investors instead want to increase that segment, but given that rapidly appreciating assets are often what puts an allocation plan off kilter, "that's usually the wrong approach," Mr. Isaacson said.
Finally, "I recommend that investors never sell to rebalance a portfolio," Mr. Markese said. "You only balance with new money. If investors can avoid selling by using cash flow from distributions, income or inheritances to rebalance a portfolio, in the long run they'll come out ahead."
Generally, Mr. Altfest is planning to do just that with Dr. Bieber's portfolio, and the dentist heartily concurs. "That won't be quite as painful as getting out of some of these stocks that have performed well," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
New Software to the Allocation Rescue

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
FOR mutual fund investors, reviewing portfolios at the start of a new year can be a big chore. But this year, there is a lot of software available to expedite the task.
For example, Advisor Software of Orinda, Calif., offers investors a program called Mutual Max, which draws on a data base of 5,200 funds to examine the holdings of each fund in an investor's portfolio. The software displays extensive information about each fund in tables and charts. It then tallies the results to show the asset allocation of the portfolio's funds. Subtotals of other assets, like directly held stocks and bonds or cash, can be entered, too, to give investors their overall asset allocation. 
 The software can also compare the actual allocation to the investor's target allocation. If the numbers vary, the investor can try different fund combinations until the goal is met.
"Many people are surprised by the results," said Greg Hutchings, the managing director of Advisor Software. For example, he said, his father and his brother had thought their portfolios were more aggressively invested in stocks than they actually were.
One reason for the discrepancy is that some funds hold an unexpectedly large portion of their assets in cash. Another is that funds do not always invest as their nominal categories would suggest -- a matter that Morningstar Inc., the fund research company in Chicago, is addressing with its recent regrouping of funds based on actual portfolio holdings rather than on prospectus descriptions.
But because mutual funds must disclose their holdings only twice a year, the information that Morningstar and Advisor rely on may be outdated. A deluxe version of the Advisor software program, Mutual Max With Style, helps get around that problem and enables investors to engage in a more refined allocation of assets.
Based on the portfolio analysis theory of Prof. William F. Sharpe of Stanford University, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who is not involved with the company, the deluxe software displays the effective style of a fund as determined by comparing its returns with those of selected market indexes. The comparison, made monthly by Advisor Software, sidesteps the need to know the fund's actual holdings.
In addition to examining funds they own, users of Mutual Max With Style can scan the universe of funds to look for those that best fit their needs -- or those they want to avoid. For example, an investor might use the Sharpe analysis to help find the most aggressive of aggressive-growth funds.
Advisor Software also offers Style Data, an Excel spreadsheet, on the Internet to help investors categorize the strategy and risk of mutual funds, set their asset allocation and diversify their holdings.
Mutual Max is not a program for people new to fund investing. Its help files explain how to use the program; they do not explain how to set an asset allocation or determine an acceptable level of risk.
"The program is for the individual investor who has significant investment in mutual funds and is active with a PC," Mr. Hutchings said. "You don't need to be a math major." Still, knowledge of math or portfolio analysis would help.
People who need more elementary mutual-fund software can turn to Morningstar's Ascent or the Value Line Fund Analyzer. Both products teach about allocation and risk, and enable investors to create reports, perform screens, draw charts of fund performance and track individual portfolios.
Mutual Max costs $39.95, and comes with a preloaded data base of funds. Mutual Max With Style costs $94.95, with a funds data base and a style data base. Four quarterly updates of the funds data base cost $79.95, while 12 monthly updates cost $179.95. Four quarterly updates of the style and fund data bases cost $284.95; 12 monthly updates cost $854.95.
Both Mutual Max programs are Windows-based. Information is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.advisorsw.com, or the software may be bought by calling 800 738-6369.
Visitors to the Web site may also look up the returns-based style analysis for individual mutual funds, at no charge. Style Data, the Excel spreadsheet, has the styles of 5,200 funds and is available for $94.95. It will be updated monthly and may be downloaded from the Web or ordered on diskette.
Morningstar's Ascent 2.0, with toll-free technical support, costs $45; with quarterly updates, it is $95, and with monthly updates, $195. It can be ordered by calling 800 735-0700. Value Line has a range of Fund Analyzer offerings -- from $29 for a two-month trial subscription to the No-Load Fund Analyzer, to $395 for a year's subscription to its enhanced CD-ROM program with full data base, monthly updates and access to Value Line's on-line bulletin board for weekly updates. Value Line can be reached at 800 284-7607.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will Bad Loans Kill Japanese Banks?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Can the banks of one of the world's great industrial powers be brought to their knees by bad loans? Will most of them go broke?
Such were the fears that drove American bank stocks into the ground in 1990 -- and in the process created one of the greatest buying opportunities in history for those willing to take a chance on finding survivors. Today, Citicorp shares fetch almost 10 times what they sold for at the 1990 low. 
 Now those fears, after festering for years, are coming to a head in Japan. An index of Japanese bank shares fell 15 percent during the final four days of last week, sending the Nikkei 225 index tumbling. That broader average lost 11 percent of its value, roughly equivalent to the Dow Jones industrial average falling 731 points in four days.
The Japanese bank stock index was not exactly airborne before the latest plunge. Since the end of 1989, it has lost 61 percent of its value. That's just about how far the Standard & Poor's index of money-center banks fell before it hit bottom in 1990. One difference is that that plunge lasted a bit over a year. This one has lasted seven years.
The bearish case on Japanese banks has not changed much during those seven years. They have never really cleaned up their balance sheets after the bubble economy burst. No one knows how many bad loans there are, in part because the commercial real estate market has not been allowed to fall to the point where willing buyers would appear. The Japanese Government has stalled, hoping things will work out.
So far, they haven't, and bears see blood. "I think we are much closer to a meltdown in Japanese financial assets now than we have ever been," says Jeff Uscher, the editor of Grant's Asia Observer.
The current question for the banks is one of capital. Japanese bank accounting is sufficiently opaque that it is not easy to know just how bad off they would be if they wrote off all their bad loans, but the general suspicion is that they would be very bad off indeed. And one source of profits to add to capital -- from selling stock the banks own in other companies -- gets less likely every day the stock market falls.
As in the United States in 1990, the banks' problems are having an impact on the economy. A bank worried about its capital levels is not a bank eager to lend money, and the Japanese economy continues to limp along.
Over the last couple of years, Japanese banks raised billions of dollars in capital with a clever type of security that now appears to be coming back to haunt them. They sold convertible preferred stock, largely to foreigners, on what looked like can't-lose terms. The conversion rate would be reset if the stock fell, but not if it rose. But now one bank stock, Daiwa, has fallen so far that even the reset won't help. And with others not that far from the reset levels, it appears that some holders are scrambling to hedge their positions by borrowing common stock and selling it short. And that tactic only drives down the shares further.
We checked in with Gary Rosenfeld, of Rose Hill Capital Management, who runs a hedge fund devoted to Japanese securities. The plunge, he says, has left Japanese bank stocks oversold and likely to bounce back. "But fundamentally, I'm not sure if there is any real attraction," he added.
Which is the problem with accounting that hides more than it reveals. When people get suspicious, they assume the worst. If Japanese banks are not that bad off, it is time for them to open up enough to prove it.

HEADLINE: This Lead Dog Still Barks, but Has a Bit Less Bite

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
LAST month, Robert L. Crandall, the famously combative chairman of American Airlines, sounded a note of conciliation.
In a long interview in which he discussed the airline industry's prospects, as well as his own, the 61-year-old Mr. Crandall talked like a man who had grown more tolerant of a world that has never quite snapped to attention as precisely or as profitably as he wanted. 
 "The passage of time," he said over breakfast during a trip to New York, "has probably made me a little more understanding that you can't always move as rapidly as you'd like."
A stinging defeat last week will put that understanding to the test.
It was supposed to have been a good week for Mr. Crandall, the capstone to a series of bold moves over the last year.
Riding a strong industry comeback from the huge losses of the early 90's, Mr. Crandall trumpeted a big marketing alliance with British Airways last summer, saw his Sabre travel information subsidiary go public in a popular stock offering in October and placed an order in November for more than $6 billion worth of Boeing jets, American's first sizable order since the 1980's.
But Mr. Crandall made the Boeing deal contingent on his winning approval by American's pilots of a four-year contract that union leaders tentatively agreed to last fall. Without the contract, which put a tight cap on wage increases through 2000, the new planes could not be flown profitably and the order would be off, Mr. Crandall said -- a development that would restrict American's future growth.
On Wednesday, the pilots did not blink: by a 2-to-1 margin, they rejected the pact.
With company earnings strong again -- American's parent, the Dallas-based AMR Corporation, is expected to report record profits of about $850 million for 1996 -- the pilots say they are in no mood for raises that lag behind inflation, echoing similar sentiments at United Airlines, where mechanics also rejected a wage offer last week. (Another group of United workers accepted the offer; the outcome of a vote by pilots there will not be known until Friday.) Nor did Mr. Crandall give his pilots much reason to work with him; time and again, he has criticized them harshly in public.
It is anyone's guess what happens next. American says it might wind up scaling back its order with Boeing. Many of the pilots, however, say they are convinced that Mr. Crandall will buy the full order no matter what they do. On Thursday, their union, the Allied Pilots Association, which has about 9,000 members at American, warned of a possible strike if Mr. Crandall did not sweeten the wage offer. To underscore their harder line, union representatives said they would replace the five-member panel that negotiated the rejected deal.
But two things do seem clear.
One is that Mr. Crandall will indeed not be moving ahead as rapidly as he would like, either with the pilots or with Boeing.
The other is that it is hardly the first time he has stubbed his toe in labor negotiations, where his hardball positions are often criticized as counterproductive. He has drawn similar criticism over the years for his lobbying efforts in Washington, where he has also been given to making threats when a policy decision did not go his way.
"Bob has outsmarted his competition, but he does have an unfortunate history of failing to build consensus in Washington and with his work force -- that's been his Achilles' heel," said Clark H. Onstad, a former chief counsel at the Federal Aviation Administration and now a senior executive at Atlas Air, a cargo carrier in Golden, Colo.
Mr. Crandall said late last week that he was disappointed by the pilots' vote. "It's very disheartening, he said. "We negotiated with these guys for more than two years. The agreement is by any objective measure the best contract in the industry."
A spokesman for American, Robert A. Britton, said, "Clearly our goal is to reach an agreement with the union, preferably sooner rather than later."
Boeing apparently is willing to wait, at least for a while, for the pilots and Mr. Crandall to patch things up, although it is not clear how long the company will be able to commit part of its production capacity to the large order without a go-ahead. Under the terms of the now-postponed deal, American agreed to buy planes exclusively from Boeing for the next two decades in return for quick delivery and discounted prices. In a statement on Thursday, Boeing expressed confidence that an agreement with the pilots would be reached in the "near term" and that the plane order would then go forward.
Investors seem willing to bide their time, as well. Shares in AMR were off marginally on the day after the vote, falling $1.50, to $86.625. The stock finished the week at $85.125, down $1.50.
AS Mr. Crandall begins his glide path toward retirement, last week's setback was a fitting addition to the twists and turns of his storied career, a mix of industry milestones and miscues.
Since Mr. Crandall took over as president in 1980 -- he became chairman and chief executive in 1985 -- American's innovations have ranged from frequent-flier mileage to computer reservation systems to sophisticated software for setting fares. "If you're not the lead dog," he is fond of saying, "the view never changes."
But there have been times when he has demanded the lead-dog position and the rest of the team has not followed.
In 1992, he tried to force on the entire industry his so-called value-pricing idea -- a drastic change in the way fares are structured that eliminated deep discounts to big corporate customers. He made no effort to build consensus in advance, and his competitors and customers balked. Within months, he declared the idea dead.
Mr. Crandall, said Mr. Onstad, the former F.A.A. counsel, has had "a large number of imitators, but very few followers."
It is a problem that even Mr. Crandall recognizes. "Nobody wants to hear about it," he says of his opposition to the widespread practice of code sharing, under which two airlines market flights jointly in the computer reservation system. Mr. Crandall says that the practice is deceptive to consumers, who can book a flight on one airline only to wind up on another, and that he has reluctantly joined the trend so American can remain competitive.
Some day, Mr. Crandall said, people will wonder why they did not listen to him.
Plenty of people were listening in the early 80's, when Mr. Crandall instituted a two-tier wage contract, expanded the airline's hub-and-spoke system and invested about $20 billion in new planes and other equipment. Those moves enabled him to expand more rapidly than his competitors. By the end of that decade, the industry was making money and Mr. Crandall was lauded in the media as one of the toughest but most effective bosses in the country. "American Takes On the World," read the headline on a cover article of Fortune magazine in September 1990.
But in the early 90's, a big decline in travel prompted by the Persian Gulf war, combined with overambitious expansion, plunged the cyclical airline industry into its deepest trough ever, causing it to lose billions upon billions of dollars.
American's stock, which reached a high of $107 a share in 1989, tumbled during this period and has yet to recover completely. For some time now, investors have held the company to a different standard from other airlines. While American is widely perceived as a well-run company that occasionally blunders -- sometimes badly -- most other major airlines are viewed these days as in need of a turnaround or as recent turnaround successes. That is why the stock prices of newly rejuvenated airline companies like Continental and UAL, the parent of United, have far outpaced American's in terms of percentage gains.
American is a more steady performer, said Kevin C. Murphy, an industry analyst at Morgan Stanley. "They didn't have much low-hanging fruit to pick."
AT the industry's nadir, in the early 1990's, Mr. Crandall saw labor costs as American's big problem. Those costs left the airline's competitive position so bleak, he said then, that the company might have to shrink sharply and perhaps even largely abandon the airline business for subsidiary operations. The pilots had their own ideas about fixing American, and they commissioned a study in 1993 to suggest ways to run things better.
Mr. Crandall's frustration and impatience boiled over. In a meeting that September with analysts in New York, Mr. Crandall said the pilots' plan would ruin the airline. That plan, never adopted, would have used more American planes for shuttle-type service.
"If the pilots were in charge, Columbus would still be in port," he had said. "They believe the assertion that the world is flat."
Such remarks served only to widen the gulf between the two sides, many industry experts said. And Mr. Crandall, whose analytical skills help him win many a debate, has not been able to convince the pilots of much recently.
"People who want to preserve unnatural work restrictions or unnatural inefficiencies are kidding themselves," he said at last month's breakfast meeting, his first wide-ranging interview in more than two years. "I get very impatient with them."
He added: "My inability to persuade them that their self-interest is oriented toward growth, even if growth has to occur in ways that they think are not optimal, is very frustrating. My frustrations are completely a reflection of my desire to see the airline do more and do better."
American's pilots earn more than most of their counterparts at United States carriers, according to Air Inc., a career consulting firm for pilots. While the American pilots start out low, earning less than $30,000 a year, they can get more than $200,000 a year by the time they retire, at age 60. Over a 30-year career that began in 1996, they would average $125,000 annually (in current dollars), not including other benefits or retirement plans, Air Inc. said. American's profit-sharing plan is also among the most generous in the industry.
MANY pilots said their vote last week was for higher pay and against the company's desire to introduce jets to the fleet of its American Eagle commuter subsidiary, fearing that the planes would be used to take over some of their routes, thereby threatening their jobs. (The pilots at American Eagle are represented by a different union.)
They said the vote was not meant as a rebuke of Mr. Crandall, who, in fact, sent his president, Donald J. Carty, to reach the tentative agreement last fall with the pilots' leadership.
But the pilots clearly have a very personal beef with Mr. Crandall, particularly over his compensation. In 1988, to get him to turn down a job offer from a competing airline, AMR's board granted Mr. Crandall an award of stock, to be distributed in eight annual installments. The stock was valued at $12 million at the time. The value of AMR's shares has increased by more than 150 percent since then.
Since that award was made, Mr. Crandall's regular annual compensation has typically been less than $1 million. Last year, when American's revenues were about $16 billion, he received $662,500 in salary, with no bonus.
Still, many pilots think he is overpaid. A cartoon in the May 1996 issue of their union's magazine, Flight Line, shows Mr. Crandall running an AMR staff meeting. He is pointing to a sign on the wall next to him. Titled "AMR Transition Plan," the sign has an arrow pointing from a dollar sign to a likeness of his face. "Get it from the pilots," the cartoon shows Mr. Crandall saying.
The cartoon is part of a package of articles on AMR executive compensation that includes a time line showing how Mr. Crandall's pay, with the big stock award factored in, was increasing as he was winning concessions from pilots. The cover of the magazine reads: "The Amazing AMR Corp. Magic Show! Featuring Increased Executive Salaries, Record Profits, Large Executive Bonuses. Plus . . . the Newest Trick . . . Watch in Awe as Pilot Pay Cuts Appear Before Your Very Eyes!!!"
"He's getting increases in compensation because of the money he's saving the company," said Glenn Schafer, a pilot who helped to coordinate a lobbying effort among his colleagues to vote against the tentative labor agreement. "Mr. Crandall is a brilliant man, but at a certain point in time it becomes unethical and immoral for corporations to use employees to push downward on wages and working conditions to increase their own compensation," he said.
IN last month's interview, Mr. Crandall said the pilots were way off base. "The idea that I'm going to get individually rich if the company does well just isn't right," he said. "That isn't the way compensation plans are structured. It hasn't happened and it isn't going to happen."
Mr. Crandall received some backing recently when Graef Crystal, the widely quoted expert on executive compensation, wrote an article for the November issue of D, a magazine about Dallas, called "The Most Overpaid (and Underpaid) Chief Executives in Dallas." The section titled, "Why Robert Crandall Doesn't Make Enough Money" has its own cartoonish illustration, showing Mr. Crandall holding out a cup, as a beggar would, by the side of a road.
By Mr. Crystal's calculations, Mr. Crandall's total compensation package, including the stock award, was 69 percent less over the last three years than that of chief executives running companies of similar size with similar profitability.
"By my way of thinking, this is exemplary behavior," Mr. Crystal said in an interview. "He would certainly be a finalist in the Mother Teresa contest of C.E.O.'s in America."
Not that the American Airlines chairman is going soft. Mr. Crandall, a man of exaggerated features, a billboard smile and retro-slick hair, still maintains his Mick Jagger-thin body. He is still driven, even defiantly so -- he runs several miles a day on his treadmill (but refuses to give up his smoking habit). And he still practices the power breakfast, as he demonstrated during last month's interview, sending back his lone English muffin because it arrived buttered. When a new one arrived dry, as he had ordered it, he dug forcefully into a small jar of honey as if he were shucking a stubborn oyster.
"What keeps me motivated more than anything else is pride," he said. "Every day I get up with some idea of what we can do to make the company better." He wants American's earnings to be consistently better than those of its competitors, and he wants the airline to be considered the best in the world, something that he acknowledges he is not yet convinced of himself.
But he has, by all accounts, also throttled back the fire-breathing intensity. Those who know him say that his legendary bark is still there -- and it seems to grow loudest when talking about the pilots -- but some of the angry bite is gone.
In a speech in New York last month, Mr. Crandall -- the man who has likened the airline industry to legalized warfare -- stressed the need for all carriers to work together more effectively. "We must recognize that doing our best sometimes requires cooperation as well as competition," he said.
He is even changing his confrontational approach to Washington. Now, he is trying to build relationships, he said, rather than simply showing up to deliver a forceful message.
Mr. Crandall's wife, Jan, said in an interview that her husband also seemed less rushed these days. "Most nights, he does not want the dinner hour to end," she said. "He wants to sit and talk."
And when he talks, Mr. Crandall often has something interesting to say. He predicted, for example, that the rush by airlines to pair off in alliances will lead to even bigger groupings, providing new opportunities to save money. If, for example, the partner airlines collectively planned their new plane purchases so the cockpits were the same for each type of aircraft, the pilots of each airline could fly one another's planes. That way, the airlines could probably get more use each day out of their flying factories, which would help lower costs.
THIS idea of a simplified fleet was part of the logic behind the big Boeing order by American: one make of aircraft lowers training costs for pilots and mechanics, and also cuts inventory costs for spare parts.
Yes, Mr. Crandall conceded, such sharing of planes could create a logistical and operational nightmare. It also, of course, would be a problem for American's pilots. And how would he sort out the issue of liability in a crash caused by a pilot from one of the other partner airlines?
"Well, life is going to get more complicated," he said. "But life is already pretty complicated."
It can also be pretty frustrating, as he was reminded last week. But perhaps sooner than many people think, Mr. Crandall may put that frustration behind him.
"I have no immediate plan to retire, but I probably won't stay until I'm 65," he said. "There will be a graceful time to leave."
When he does, he will have plenty to do, he said. He wants to improve his sailing skills as well as his singing and piano playing. There is also more gardening to do with his wife And books to read -- particularly histories and biographies.
"Every day of my life after I stop working, I'm going to spend two or three hours reading," he said. "I can't imagine ever running out of things that I haven't gotten to yet."
After American, he said, he is unlikely to work in the airline business again. "My identification with American is so intense, to do anything in this industry would require being competitive with American," he said. "I would never want to do that."
Still, he said that if the phone rang with an attractive offer to run a business part time, he might consider it.
"The only difference between work and play is that work is what you have to do and play is what you choose to do," he said. "They are not necessarily different. Once you 'retire,' you ought to do exactly what you choose to do. I have always enjoyed the business world."
Well, perhaps not always, as when the pilots tripped up his plan to bring some shiny new planes into American's fleet.
"Business ought to be about new programs, new plans and new initiatives," he said. "And when it is, it's fun. When it isn't about those things, it's just kind of boring. You go to work and do what you have to do."

THE LOPEZ WARS
Feel Better Now, G.M.?
Nobody, but nobody, pushes General Motors around: that seemed to be G.M.'s attitude in its four-year fistfight with Volkswagen. Yes, yes, a hotshot G.M. executive named Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua defected to VW, taking with him a few colleagues and, his accusers say, cartons of "trade secrets." But has anyone suggested that VW then started turning out bootleg Chevrolet Cavaliers? That VW drew any serious blood? Well, no. It seemed mainly a pride thing, and G.M. demanded satisfaction -- like an abject apology and, say, $3 billion or $4 billion to ease the pain. Last week, though, it settled for far less: $100 million, still huge by corporate-espionage standards. And did VW apologize? Well, sort of. It acknowledged the "possibility" of "illegal activities."
 
STOCK MARKETS
As the World Turns
The world's financial markets seem to be on a giant seesaw: the more stock prices rise in the United States, the more they fall in Japan. In many ways, the two countries' markets are unrelated. American stocks just keep soaring -- yes, yawn, more records last week -- because they've forgotten how to do anything else, while Japan is plagued by a stagnant economy and bank troubles. But here's one link: American investors have pulled money out of Japan, compounding both the good times here and the bad times there.
 
COCA-COLA
When in Doubt, Redesign
The soda can speaks of timelessness: Coca-Cola "Classic," it assures us. It's "Always." It's "Unique." And the stuff inside most definitely stays the same -- no way is Coke going to mess with that again. But for all the intimations of eternity, Coke just can't stop tinkering with the can. Add a ribbon -- a "dynamic ribbon," if you please -- or subtract a ribbon. Enlarge, or tilt, the photograph of the old bottle. (Why adorn a container with a photo of a container? Oh, you just don't understand.) And now Coke -- probably the world's most recognized brand -- has done it again, introducing yet another look. Does it really imagine that shoppers, poised in the supermarket aisle, muttering, "Coke or Pepsi? Coke or Pepsi? Hmmm. Which has the newest design?" Apparently so.
 
REAL ESTATE
Helmsley, Man and Image
"Helmsley," over the years, has become an odd sort of name, evoking such a jarring mix of images. Here's the overriding image: of truly serious New York real estate, of the empire built over many decades by Harry Helmsley. But then, yes, there's Leona -- first the mighty queen of the spotless hotel, the ultimate in demanding bosses, then the humbled queen, jailed for tax evasion. The rival images maintained a delicate coexistence even as Mr. Helmsley's health faded. (He was deemed unfit to face tax-evasion charges himself.) But with Mr. Helmsley's death last weekend, all the rules have changed. Though some lawsuits remain to be resolved -- and though Mr. Helmsley did leave some pocket change, $25,000, to his long-time secretary -- his widow is practically the sole heir to his $1.7 billion fortune. New York City, meet the undisputed queen.
 
INAUGURAL SHOPPER
Get Your Instant History!
You can feel it. All across the land, Americans aren't wondering when the floods will stop, when that new job will appear, when cancer will be cured. No, they are asking themselves, "What can I do to make the inauguration as lavish as possible?" Well, the Inaugural Committee heard them, took pity on their anguish and called up QVC. So just tune in that shopping channel, and you will have the rare, one-time, golden opportunity to buy, say, a bronze inaugural medallion for just $36. That's $4 off, of course; it would be un-American to buy something that isn't on sale. Then, just think: one day, tears in your eyes, you can tell your grandchildren that, yes, you were there -- that in January of '97, the very month of the second Clinton inaugural, you were sitting in front of your TV set.
 
PRESERVATION
This Land Is Her Land
The idea of owning 51,000 acres in the Adirondacks seems wildly out of kilter -- it belongs to another era. And the vast Whitney estate was, in fact, carved out in the robber-baron days. But it's still there, in the heart of a six-million-acre park, and preservationists have been longing to add it to public lands. It's "the missing puzzle piece," one environmental lobbyist said. Subdividing it would be "the greatest disaster for the Adirondacks I could imagine." But Marylou Whitney, the society-queen heir to the estate, wants to do exactly that. Last week she proposed slicing off 15,000 of those acres and creating what in her circle are no doubt considered low-rent lots: a mere 300 acres each. And, oh yes: you could also buy Little Tupper Lake. It's all a ploy, some critics say, to drive up the price for the obvious buyer: New York State.

In the Market We Trust

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Common stocks, as such, are not superior to bonds as long-term investments, because primarily they are not investments at all. They are speculations.
-- "Investments and Speculations," by Lawrence Chamberlain and William W. Hay, published by Henry Holt in 1931. 
 The more data we analyze, the more confident we are that stocks are superior long-term investments. In the long run, the true risk resides with fixed-income investments, not with common stocks.
-- "Stocks for the Long Run," by Jeremy J. Siegel, published by Irwin in 1994.
THE American view of financial risks and opportunities has come a long way in six decades.
Four years after Lawrence Chamberlain, a respected investment banker, warned that stocks could not even be deemed an investment, the Social Security system was born as a way of providing an assured means of support for elderly Americans. Money would be raised by taxes on working Americans and, to the extent not needed to pay immediate benefits, invested in safe Government bonds.
In 1935, memories of the 1929 crash were fresh. No one suggested that the road to safety led through buying common stocks.
Now, three years after Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, published his influential book, a commission has recommended to Congress that the Social Security system be partly financed by common stock investments. It split on important details, but on the central thesis it came down solidly with Mr. Siegel: Stocks are safe, for in the long run they always go up. Bonds, including government bonds, whose real value can be eroded by inflation, are the risky asset.
The change has come slowly, with some converting early and some not at all. The stock market gained adherents in the 1950's and 1960's, then lost them in the 1970's, when inflation scared many investors away from all securities, and briefly into such hard assets as gold and diamonds. But since 1982, the start of a bull market with few historical rivals, the academic work showing that stocks are the best long-term investment has gained widespread acceptance.
Accordingly, investors have been willing to pay more and more for stocks, feeling secure in the knowledge that they will do well in the long run, even if prices fall over shorter periods of time.
One way to measure the changing attitudes is to look at the relative level of dividends on stocks compared with interest rates on bonds. Investors have the choice of buying bonds, with a guaranteed interest rate and certainty (barring default) of getting their principal back when the bond matures, or of buying stocks, with a less certain yield from dividends and the possibility that the stock's price could rise or fall.
In the aftermath of the 1929 crash, it became accepted wisdom that the dividend on stocks should be higher than the yield on bonds. After all, investors deserved compensation for taking the risk of falling share prices. In the late 1940's, investors were quite willing to buy bonds that yielded little more than a third of the dividends they could obtain from a diversified portfolio of stocks.
 
 
 
25-Year Recovery
 But as the widely forecast post-World War II depression failed to occur, investors gradually became more and more willing to buy stocks, and stocks became more expensive relative to bonds. In 1954, the Dow Jones industrial average finally got back to its pre-crash high of 381.17. There was nervous commentary, but no crash.
Then, in 1958, there was much hand-wringing over the fact that the dividend yield on stocks was now actually lower than the bond yield. A scary article in Business Week was titled "An Evil Omen Returns." It warned that stock yields had been below bond yields back in 1929, and look what happened.
But it didn't happen again. It was not until the 1970's that stocks again performed badly over a long period. And after prices began to soar again in 1982, academics gradually produced what they viewed as proof that rising stock prices, in the long run, were inevitable. That gospel has been proclaimed in newspapers, personal finance magazines and on countless television shows.
Now the interest you can get on a high-quality corporate bond is about four times the dividend yield on the stocks in the Standard & Poor's industrial average, but most on Wall Street figure that is irrelevant. Companies can return money to shareholders by repurchasing shares, and in any case it is the prospect of rising prices, not dividend income, that draws in buyers. "It's a sea change in attitudes," says Paul Macrae Montgomery, a strategist at Legg Mason, the brokerage house.
"The Jeremy Siegel book hit at exactly the right moment," Peter L. Bernstein, a founding editor of The Journal of Portfolio Management, said last week. Now the expected return from stocks is seen as "a reliable projection," he said. "I think that is just extraordinary," he added.
Last week, in The Wall Street Journal, Jonathan Clements, a columnist, confronted the question of what a parent should do if he had all the savings for his daughter's college education invested in stocks, only to have her go to college in one of those rare periods when stock prices had fallen substantially. Mr. Clements's response: Pay the tuition with borrowed money "while you wait for stocks to bounce back."
Some people are appalled by such attitudes and worry that research "proving" that stocks are the best long-term investments may persuade investors to bid up share prices until they are dangerously overvalued, much as happened in the 1920's.
Mr. Siegel admits that is possible but says share prices would have to rise another 25 percent or so, to perhaps 8,000, for him to be really concerned. Still, he is not enthusiastic about the idea of putting Social Security money into stocks. "Suppose we come to a 10-year period when the return on stocks is not good," he said. "They happen."

HEADLINE: The World;
China Grows, Russia Shrinks, Albright Juggles

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
RWANDA, Peru, Serbia and even Cyprus have lately had their share of Washington's fitful attention. But the big game afoot this year for Madeleine K. Albright, soon to be confirmed as Secretary of State, is how to handle relations with two of the world's largest and most insecure nuclear powers: Russia and China.
How Ms. Albright manages Russian weakness and Chinese ambition will help define Bill Clinton's Presidency. With NATO expansion, the hand-over of Hong Kong, trade disputes and imminent summit meetings, Russia and China will loom large on her plate. 
 But as the United States tries to gauge (and guide) the futures of these two transitional powers, Washington is going to have to make clearer choices: Will Russia and China be made truly welcome in the new world of economic interdependence and security cooperation, or will they be effectively excluded? And if they don't want to join, or feel the cost of membership is too high, what are the consequences for American foreign policy?
 
 
 
'Let's Do Lunch'
 These themes ran through the courtly, genial hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week on Ms. Albright's nomination. She echoed, in her careful answers, the official American position that the expansion of NATO is not directed at Russia or meant as provocation to Moscow, with which NATO wants to negotiate a separate security understanding or charter.
As for China, she said, Washington seeks a balanced, "multifaceted" relationship that seeks to envelop Beijing in the larger community of nations, and commit it to a shared set of responsibilities.
But Washington's arguments have not yet proved convincing. In their different ways, Moscow and Beijing still suspect that the Americans are being insincere or disingenuous -- the international equivalent of a cheery, "Let's do lunch sometime!"
After 70 years of distorted and disastrous Communism, most Russians want to be part of the larger European civilization that the czars only belatedly tried to enter, and that Lenin's fanaticism denied them. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its expansionist ideology, it is NATO that is expanding. The clear message is that Russia is not really to be welcomed; in fact, it is to be mistrusted and feared.
"Washington won't be able to continue splitting hairs, saying that enlargement has nothing to do with Russia but that a NATO-Russia charter will give Moscow some influence on decision-making," said Leslie H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
NATO's enlargement and its relations with Russia "is the single biggest security challenge of the next six months," a senior Administration official said. He and other senior American officials say that the Russians are undecided about whether to keep up their fierce opposition to expansion, in the hopes of derailing or delaying it, or to cut their best deal.
Before the Madrid summit in July, when NATO will announce its new members, the official said, "we need to have a package of understandings that makes concrete the rhetoric of cooperation with Russia." But, he said, "the Russians must first decide if they want to solve the problem, and start redefining it, so when expansion happens, which it will, it's not seen as a defeat." This may prove to be too much to ask of Russia, which is bound to feel ostracized, not embraced.
To the rising power of Beijing, conversely, the United States is trying to send an enticing message of welcome, of engagement instead of confrontation or containment. But the Chinese are not yet convinced.
Still Communist, and in the midst of an extended power struggle over the legacy of the silent, but living, Deng Xiaoping, Chinese leaders transmit strong messages about how they aren't really like Americans at all, and aren't at all sure they want to be. They cite cultural arguments about the Asian values of Confucianism and the collective versus Western values of individual rights and democracy, which is in essence a pretext to justify the party's unelected, Communist structure.
But the Chinese are also not convinced that joining the international club, at least as the United States frames it, is in their economic or military interest. This is not just a question of their arms sales to places like Pakistan and Iran, which Washington argues can violate international rules on nonproliferation. Nor is it just a matter of human rights and dissent, the heart of Beijing's worries about maintaining domestic controls in a time of wild economic and regional disparities.
Nor is it an issue of patriotic pride over the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, and annoyance that the West still tells Beijing how to handle Hong Kong's future -- which senior American officials say will be "an important benchmark" for relations. Nor is it even about Taiwan. China exercised a rare veto at the United Nations on Friday, blocking peacekeepers from going to Guatemala, because of its ties to Taiwan.
Beijing's internal debate about whether to join the World Trade Organization is for China the economic equivalent of the Russian debate on its future relations with NATO. After 50 years of relative autonomy and a refusal to let the outside world tell it how to run its economy, China is now getting $40 billion a year in outside investment through its "open door." But as Mr. Deng once famously said, the problem with open doors is that you can't stop some flies from getting in.
 
 
 
Membership Has Its Rewards
 President Jiang Zemin has made it clear that China wants to join the W.T.O., but as a "developing country" held to less stringent standards. The United States and its allies say China must open its markets enough to be able to join on "commercially acceptable terms."
Membership in the W.T.O., which is the organization that sets the rules and adjudicates disputes in world trade, has clear benefits for China in addition to symbolizing international acceptance. It would protect the Chinese, who have low production costs, from tariffs imposed by countries trying to protect their own, higher-priced products. But Beijing would also have to open its own protected markets. These issues go beyond the questions about textiles and compact disk copyrights that have already caused problems with Washington..
China would have to stop giving so much help to state-run and predominantly state-owned enterprises. And if another country dragged China to the W.T.O. and argued that tariffs or restrictive rules were protecting those companies from foreign competition, China would have to change or be penalized.
"The U.S. Government is willing to accept China as a major player in the world arena as long as it plays by the rules, whether in trade or human rights," said Stanley Roth, the former Asia director of the Clinton National Security Council and now at the U.S. Institute of Peace. "But does China want to be a normal country? One that plays by the rules and then helps to make them?"
"It's not clear to me they've faced this choice," Mr. Roth continued. "There's an intellectual lag between their economic progress and their ideology. But they won't be able to dodge these choices much longer."

HEADLINE: Harassment Case Against Clinton Now at Highest Level

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Monday in a case fraught with political peril and potential personal humiliation for President Clinton -- the sexual-harassment suit filed in 1994 by Paula Corbin Jones, a former state government employee in Arkansas.
It is a situation unprecedented in American legal history. No one has ever before filed a civil suit against a sitting President involving his private behavior. This one could force Mr. Clinton to answer questions about his sexual conduct, either in open court or in a written deposition, or it could give rise to a new form of legal protection for Presidents while in office. 
 The Court is to consider not the question of whether Mr. Clinton, then the Governor, asked Ms. Jones on May 8, 1991, as she says, to perform a sex act. It is to weigh a broader legal question: Can a sitting President, any sitting President, be tried while in office, or must the resolution of any civil suit related to private behavior await his term's end.
Ms. Jones's name may not even be uttered by the lawyers on Monday. The proceedings are sure to be formal and dust-dry. But of all Mr. Clinton's manifold legal troubles, none has a greater potential than the Jones case to complicate, even to discredit, his second term, which begins on Jan. 20.
Mr. Clinton's reputation as a womanizer is already an important element in the relatively poor showing he makes in the polls on "the character issue." Bob Dole's late surge in the 1996 campaign came when he switched his attacks on the President from economic policies to questions of personal probity.
But the Jones case has the potential to amplify whispers of scandal into shouts. In a media age, that would damage Mr. Clinton and the Presidency.
The whole issue is suffused with politics. On the advice of Cliff Jackson, a Little Rock political operative with a long history of hostility to the President, Ms. Jones first aired her charges in February 1994 at a Washington news conference sponsored by the Conservative Political Action Conference. One of her lawyers, Gilbert Davis, a former schoolteacher who will state Ms. Jones's case in court, plans to run for attorney general of Virginia, and indeed, he has already pledged to be "a fearless attorney who will fight anyone who does wrong, including the President of the United States."
Mr. Clinton's backers have worked feverishly to discredit Ms. Jones and her suit. James Carville, the President's former campaign consultant, told a reporter, "Drag a hundred dollars through a trailer park and there's no telling what you'll find."
Whatever the merits of Ms. Jones's case -- and an article in The American Lawyer and a cover story in Newsweek have argued that her charges deserve to be taken seriously -- the legal history of the case to date suggests that the Supreme Court could allow the case to go forward before 2001. Even if it does not allow the trial to take place while Mr. Clinton remains in the White House, it could allow pretrial examination now, with the trial postponed.
A Federal judge in Arkansas ruled in December 1994 that a trial, in which Ms. Jones seeks $700,000 in damages for what she says were violations of her civil rights, should be delayed until Mr. Clinton leaves office, but said pretrial testimony could begin sooner. Mr. Clinton appealed, and in January 1996, an appeals panel gave a ruling even more unfavorable to Mr. Clinton, saying the case could go to trial.
In a 1982 whistle-blowing case, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court ruled that no sitting President could ever be sued for official acts but said nothing about private acts.
Mr. Clinton's lawyers have argued that permitting any phase of the litigation to take place before he leaves office would not only disrupt his conduct of the Presidency but would also open the gates for a flood of frivolous civil suits against himself and his successors. Attorney General Janet Reno said recently, "The Justice Department's position is not that there be immunity, but considering the tremendous burdens on the Presidency, the matter should be delayed until after the service as President."
Susan Estrich, a professor at the University of Southern California Law School who managed the 1988 Presidential campaign of Michael S. Dukakis, said in a debate in the on-line magazine Slate, "This is just one more political assault on the President, politically motivated and politically pursued."
Ms. Estrich said she doubted that Ms. Jones had a case under the civil rights statutes, because by her own account Ms. Jones rejected Mr. Clinton's overtures and he backed off. But putting that aside, she argued as follows on the question that will go before the Court this week:
"A rule that says that if you want to sue the President, do it before he gets elected or wait till his term is done, is one that encourages valid claims to be brought before the election, when they can be considered by the electorate, not afterward."
Stuart Taylor Jr., who wrote the American Lawyer piece, said in the debate that a "day in court" delayed from 1994 until 2001 was not satisfactory. He argued that "while the President's time is a precious national resource," it would not take much of it for him to confirm or deny Ms. Jones's charges under oath, in a deposition his lawyer could prepare for his signature.
Mr. Clinton has two main lawyers in this case -- Robert B. Bennett, a $475-an-hour Washington lawyer with a penchant for public relations, who has represented such clients as Clark M. Clifford, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, former Representative Daniel Rostenkowski, and Walter Dellinger, the Solicitor General, a former Duke University law professor. Mr. Bennett represents Mr. Clinton, while Mr. Dellinger represents the Presidency.
Mr. Bennett came close to negotiating an out-of-court settlement with Ms. Jones in May 1994, just before she filed her suit. In it Mr. Clinton said he did not challenge Ms. Jones's claim that the two had met in "a hotel room." But the negotiations were torpedoed by leaks from the White House to the effect that Ms. Jones had no case.
On the other side are Mr. Davis and Joseph Cammarata, a pair of relatively inexperienced lawyers from the Virginia suburbs of Washington. They contend that Mr. Clinton seeks to be placed above the law.
"Do we have a nation of kings or a nation where there are truly public servants?" Mr. Cammarata asked. "Or do we have a nation where people are accountable for their own personal, private conduct, or where some, because of their positions of power, aren't accountable?"
Ms. Jones, now married with two children and living in California with her husband, Steve Jones, an airline-reservations clerk, does not plan to attend the Court session on Monday. She says she will give any damages ultimately awarded by the court to charity and has forsworn earlier plans to seek deals for book and movie rights.
Her suit contends that she was invited to the room of then-Governor Clinton at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock by Mr. Clinton's bodyguard, Daniel Ferguson. Her account was supported by Pamela Blackard, a co-worker of Ms. Jones in 1991, who told The New York Times in an interview in 1994 that she was at the hotel at the time.
In the interview, which has not previously been published, Ms. Blackard told Sara Rimer, a Times reporter, that Ms. Jones returned from the hotel room "in 10, 11, not even 15 minutes," and said: "He tried to come on to me. I'd push him away, say no. Pam, I'm so embarrassed. I should've known better."

HEADLINE: Landmark in Nantucket's Black History Restored

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NANTUCKET, Mass.

 BODY:
For the better part of this century, the one-room building at one of Nantucket's busier intersections had not looked like much. Its roof leaked. It badly needed reshingling. Its ceiling arched over nothing more historic than bicycles and vehicles that leaked oil.
But eight years ago, having learned that the building once had a central role in the life of the black community here, the Museum of Afro American History in Boston bought the structure for restoration. 
 That work is under way, and the building, once a meetinghouse, a church and a school for children barred from the public schools because of their race, is to be fully open to the public by next year.
Historians and people with ties to the island say what is now called the African Meeting House of Nantucket is more than another historic building in a place that is in its entirety a historic district. The building is a reminder that blacks are not insignificant in the history of this tiny predominantly white resort.
"It's one more tangible link to a past that has really been overlooked for so long on Nantucket," said Nat Philbrick, director of the Egan Institute of Maritime Studies here and a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association.
The meetinghouse was built in the 1820's in a flourishing black neighborhood of 274 residents, who constituted 4 percent of the population, compared with 151 blacks in 1990, who made up 2.5 percent of the population, according to the Census.
The construction date makes the house one of the oldest standing structures of its kind in the nation. At the time, Nantucket was a premier whaling port, and the blacks toiled in every aspect of the industry. Some prospered, and at least one whaling ship with a black captain and an all-black crew set sail from the island.
The meetinghouse was a hub for blacks. The daughter of a founder of the meetinghouse, for example, sued for admission to the public high school, and Nantucket, in 1846, became one of the first districts in the country to desegregate its schools.
The blacks were caught up in mainland conflicts over race, as well. Quaker traditions had long made Nantucket an abolitionist stronghold, and Frederick Douglass, the orator and former slave, gave his first public address before a mixed-race audience on the island.
Through such tidbits of history the African Meeting House has given people like Mary Fernandes a peek into unexplored and virtually unrecorded history. Her family, which originated in the Cape Verde Islands, has had ties to Nantucket for three generations. Her family continues to own a house on the island, and she vacations there.
"It's the only structure remaining on island that we believe was essential to the African-American community of the 18th and 19th centuries," Mrs. Fernandes said. "And preserving buildings is sort of like helping to preserve history."
The structure was last used as a meetinghouse at the turn of the century, when the economy shifted and the community that had built it gradually departed. As it fell into disrepair, its lone function was as a garage and a warehouse.
John James, the architect who is supervising the restoration, said when the first phase of the restoration was completed in May, the meetinghouse would look from the outside as it did in its heyday.
Restoring the interior, however, presents a tougher puzzle, as few original fixtures exist. A chandelier that once lighted the room is gone. But a pew door remains, as do the outlines of the pews along walls.
On Friday, a first public meeting was held to begin talking about the role of the meetinghouse. A fund-raising campaign has been started to cover the renovation costs and to provide money for operating expenses.
The executive director of the Museum of Afro American History, Sylvia Watts McKinney, said the only thing certain about the future of the building is that it will be open to the public as a place to learn, probably much as it was more than a century ago and much like a similar meetinghouse operated by the museum in Boston.
"We want to protect," Ms. McKinney said. "We want to restore and we want to tell the story. We want to open the eyes of the layperson who has never imagined that there were African-Americans who made contributions to the Nantucket economy. They built their community. Their community was self-sustaining, and they left something to us."

HEADLINE: Sharp Differences and Compromise Are Likely on Budget

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
With the Presidential campaign over, the economy stable and considerable progress already recorded in reducing the Federal deficit, the Clinton Administration and the Republican leaders in Congress agree that the coming months offer the best, and maybe last, opportunity for reaching agreement on balancing the budget.
But after years of battles over how to do it, Democrats and Republicans still have deep differences on a variety of politically explosive issues that they will have to address to reach their goal of eliminating the deficit by 2002. 
 Those differences are again coming into focus as President Clinton prepares to send his budget proposals for the next five years to Capitol Hill early next month. The Administration's budget -- effectively its opening position in what will be months of political posturing and negotiations -- will call for more spending on Medicare, welfare, education and other social programs than the Republican plan that will be introduced in March.
The Republicans will also continue to call for deeper tax cuts than the Administration. With the White House's plan likely to assume more optimistic figures for tax receipts and spending requirements than the Republican leadership is comfortable with, Republicans have already signaled that they will question whether the Administration's plan is built too much on gimmicks and not enough on fiscal austerity.
"I hope that it will be a real budget proposal," Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said last week of Mr. Clinton's coming plan. "I'm not convinced."
Early signs indicate that the two sides are working to accommodate each other. Administration officials said that their budget, the details of which have been tightly held so far, would go some way toward meeting one of Mr. Lott's specific concerns -- that the Administration not call for big spending increases in the first few years of its plan and then require deep spending cuts to be enacted by Congress and the next President after the turn of the century.
"People will find we will have a very smooth, sound path," said one senior Administration official. "It's not going to jig-jag around."
Mr. Clinton is planning to use his State of the Union Message on Feb. 4, to build support for his proposals, which will also fulfill campaign promises that included a $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit for the first two years of college. And Mr. Clinton's advisers are already arguing that the Administration's strong record on deficit reduction in the past four years means the Republicans will not be able to declare the new budget dead on arrival on Capitol Hill.
In the last four years, the deficit has fallen 63 percent, to $107 billion for the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30. That is far lower than the Administration, much less the Republicans, had forecast. The smaller deficit provides the Administration with an opportunity to argue that spending cuts will not have to be as deep as the Republicans have demanded over the past several years.
"It is clear that the budget will be a no-nonsense, clean budget moving towards balance in 2002," one Cabinet member said on Friday. "Our sustained and impressive record of economic growth along with increased discipline on the fiscal side gives you more flexibility, and also gives you more credibility."
The effort will be complicated by the need for Congress to reauthorize tens of billions of dollars in spending on subsidized housing and road-building, multiyear programs that must be accounted for in next year's budget. And both parties look warily at the possibility of saving money by changing the way the Government computes cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefits programs, a step that could go a long way toward solving the nation's fiscal problems but one that could generate a furious backlash from the elderly and other interest groups.
The first big battle of the season will not be over the President's specific plans, but over the Republican push to approve a constitutional amendment requiring that the Federal Government keep a balanced budget. The Administration is opposed to the amendment, arguing that it could exacerbate economic downturns by making it harder to use Government spending to stimulate a recovery. Lobbying by the White House helped defeat the amendment by one vote in the Senate last year. A two-thirds vote of both houses is needed to send an amendment to the states for ratification.
Proponents of the amendment believe they now have enough firm votes to approve it in both the House and the Senate when it comes to a vote, probably in the middle of next month. Republicans said a victory on the amendment would give them added political strength in budget negotiations with the White House.
As they pursue a balanced budget plan, the two sides will have to bridge differences on the following issues:
THE SIZE OF THE DEFICIT Because they use different assumptions about how fast the economy will grow and what future spending requirements and tax revenues will be, the Republicans see the deficit as being considerably bigger than the White House does.
The Republicans have relied for their numbers on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which has told Congressional staff members that its latest projections, to be released later this month, will forecast a deficit in 2002 of about $150 billion. The Administration's comparable number is about $50 billion lower. As a result, the Administration believes spending cuts will not need to be as deep as Republicans assert.
MEDICARE SPENDING Last year the White House proposed reducing planned expenditures on Medicare, the health insurance plan for the elderly, by $124 billion. The Republicans wanted a reduction of $158 billion. Neither plan is likely to change substantially in this year's proposals. While the differences are relatively small in the context of the overall budget, they represent one of the most incendiary of political flash points, and Republicans have not forgiven the Democrats for portraying them during the election as being heartless toward the elderly.
But some signs of compromise are emerging. The White House considered including in its budget an increase in Medicare premiums for wealthy retirees, a step that Republicans would have supported. White House officials decided not to include it, but sent signals to Capitol Hill that it might be willing to consider the increase as negotiations proceed.
TAX CUTS Mr. Lott said last week that he wants a package of tax cuts amounting to between $125 billion and $150 billion, and perhaps more, over the next five years. The Administration's tax cuts would amount to about $100 billion over the same period, an Administration official said, although some of the White House's tax-cutting proposals would be implemented only if the economy performed as well as its current plans assume.
The Republicans are also insisting that Mr. Clinton agree to a deep reduction in the capital gains tax. The Administration supports only a much narrower measure to exempt profits on the sale of most homes from the capital gains tax. But White House officials said they might be willing to discuss a broader capital gains tax cut if it were essential to getting an overall budget deal.
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING Mr. Clinton has already pledged to restore about $14 billion of the $55 billion in savings on welfare spending envisioned by the welfare overhaul legislation Mr. Clinton signed last summer. He has also made clear that he will seek increases or higher levels of financing than Republicans want for education, environmental protection and other social programs. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said he would fight for expansion of health coverage for uninsured children this year.
Some Republicans acknowledge privately that there is little political will for further deep cuts in domestic spending. But they said they would oppose any effort by President Clinton to increase spending for the next few years and push any deep cuts off into the future, for another Congress and perhaps another President to take responsibility for.
"We need no up and then down on discretionary spending," Mr. Lott said in a speech on Wednesday. "Do you think that if we allow discretionary spending to go up for the next two or three years before it starts back down, do you think it's actually going to be coming back down?"

Despite Interleague Play, the Traditional Statistical Jumble Will Continue

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In 1990, Eddie Murray had the highest batting average in the major leagues of any player who had enough plate appearances to qualify for the league batting championships. But Murray did not win a batting championship.
In 1992, David Cone struck out the most batters in the major leagues, but he was never recognized as a strikeout champion. 
 Rick Sutcliffe won 20 games in 1984, but it took three years for him to be recognized officially as a 20-game winner.
The problem behind these developments and others through the years has been the strict way in which the National and American leagues keep statistics. Maintaining their separate-but-equal stance, the leagues have followed the commandment: Thou Shalt Not Commingle Statistics.
Thus, Murray did not win a batting title despite his .330 average with Los Angeles because Willie McGee batted .335 before St. Louis traded him to Oakland Aug. 29, and his 31-for-113 (.274) performance with the Athletics did not reduce his season average to .324 because it happened in the other league.
And Cone did not lead in strikeouts despite his total of 261 (Randy Johnson was next with 241) because his 47 with Toronto were not added to his 214 with the Mets, and John Smoltz struck out 215 for Atlanta in the National League.
And even though Sutcliffe won 20 games in 1984, his feat was initially ignored because he won 4 of those games with Cleveland and 16 with the Chicago Cubs. It wasn't until the 1987 National League Green Book that he was included in the list of 20-game winners. (The American League Red Book still doesn't recognize him or Hank Borowy, who won 21 games with the Yankees and the Cubs in 1945.)
"Baseball has a rich history of league records," Steve Hirdt of the Elias Sports Bureau said, neither defending nor criticizing the system. "In no other sport would there be a National League record for home runs. It's a recognized record."
But the separate-but-equal, or head-in-the-sand, approach to record keeping is about to suffer the first inroad. Beginning with the 1997 season, American and National League teams will play each other, and those games will not create yet another separate set of statistics.
"Our agreement calls for all statistics achieved in an interleague game to be treated as if they were achieved in an intraleague game," Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said. "Every American League hitter who gets a hit will have a hit for the American League statistics and a National League pitcher who wins a game will receive credit for a victory in the National League statistics."
If a player has a 40-game hitting streak in the National League, Phyllis Merhige, an A.L. vice president, noted, then fails to get a hit in an interleague game, his streak will be considered stopped. If he resumes hitting when his team returns to N.L. games and he hits in 17 consecutive games, he will not receive credit for breaking Joe DiMaggio's record.
N.L. hitters, on the other hand, will be recognized separately in N.L. averages, of all places, for the statistics they achieve as designated hitters in interleague games played in A.L. parks.
Once the traditional record keeping begins to break down, it could lead to more enlightened positions.
"We expect some further discussions before the season," Orza said. He mentioned the possibility of creating a merged leaders' list, such as who has the highest batting average over all or the most home runs or the most victories.
With the advent of interleague play, Hirdt said, it's possible that the sense of league records will eventually be lost. "Over time, if interleague play stays, National League and American League records could become an anachronism," the senior statistician said.
League records could certainly become tainted. If Gary Sheffield hits 57 home runs next season, that will be one more than Hack Wilson's N.L. record. But what if Sheffield hits three of those home runs in Florida's games with the Yankees, the Red Sox and the Orioles?
But the statistics have always been tainted. When Milwaukee traded Greg Vaughn to San Diego last season, he took 31 home runs with him, but when he hit a home run against St. Louis Aug. 5, he was listed as having 1 home run.
In the official averages for the 1996 season, the leagues don't recognize what players did in the other league.
Mark Whiten, for example, played for three teams last season -- Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle. The official N.L. averages show Whiten's total record in that league (.243 batting average, 10 home runs, 38 runs batted in), then has a separate listing that breaks down his statistics with the Phillies (.236, 7, 21) and the Braves (.256, 3, 17). The A.L. averages show Whiten's record with the Mariners (.300, 12, 33).
Nowhere, however, can Whiten's entire 1996 performance be found. Someone seeking that information would have to compute it for himself and determine that Mark Whiten -- as an entity and not separate beings in different leagues -- batted .262, hit 22 home runs and drove in 71 runs.

 
 
A New Bid on Antitrust
 On the first day of the 105th Congress last week, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, honored Curt Flood by designating his baseball antitrust bill H.R. 21, after the uniform number Flood wore as a player.
Saluting the "courageous" center fielder for his 1972 challenge to baseball's reserve system, Conyers said, "We all owe a debt of gratitude for his willingness to challenge the baseball oligarchy."
Unfortunately, as Conyers introduced his bill, Flood lay in U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles gravely suffering from throat cancer.
The bill, based on legislation approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee during the last Congress, would remove baseball's exemption from antitrust laws as it pertains to players' rights in labor relations. It would not affect the minor leagues or permit franchises to relocate at will.
Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican, is expected to introduce a similar bill in the Senate later this month.
The likelihood of Congress adopting legislation is much greater than ever because the owners, as part of the new collective bargaining agreement, will join the players in lobbying Congress to pass a law removing part of the exemption.

 
 
Tartabull in Limbo
 When Danny Tartabull was a free agent five years ago, no team was offering him more than $15 million. Then the Yankees swooped in and offered $25.5 million. Tartabull could use an angel like that this year.
A free agent again, Tartabull remains unemployed while most other productive free agents are already spending their signing bonuses. His situation, however, is not as bleak as it might appear, his agent said.
"We're talking to three or four different teams," said Rick Thurman, an associate of Dennis Gilbert. "There's a tremendous amount of interest. He's the last outfielder available who can put up some power numbers. We're moving down the line and in the next week or so it'll be very definitive where he's going."
Thurman would identify only one of the teams he said he was talking to, saying the Philadelphia Phillies were "very interested."
How to define "very interested?"
"There is some interest; I don't know how much," said Lee Thomas, the Phillies' general manager, who is looking for a cleanup hitter. "We haven't got into any details. Nothing's hot. It's going to take a while. I'm trying to do some other things. If he's still out there down the road, which he might not be, we might be interested."

 
 
Boggs Happy With Yanks
 Wade Boggs has quietly offered evidence to support his public position that he is not unhappy with the Yankees' decision to extend Charlie Hayes's contract so that Hayes would withdraw his trade demand.
Ed Lynch, the Chicago Cubs' general manager, recently called Bob Watson to inquire about Boggs's availability. Watson told Lynch that the veteran third baseman has a no-trade clause in his contract. "It was just an inquiry," Watson said. "That's where it is right now." But Watson called Boggs's agent, Alan Nero, to let him know about Lynch's call.
"We have no intention of collaborating with anyone on a trade," Nero said. "We have no intention of doing anything. Wade loves New York. The idea of getting traded doesn't appeal to him. He's very happy. He can't wait for spring training to start."
Watson emphasized that the Yankees have no interest in trading Boggs. "We've got a pretty good left-right situation at third," he said.
The Cubs are seeking a veteran third baseman because they want to make sure their good-looking prospect Kevin Orie is ready, and they don't want to put pressure on him. Terry Pendleton, Mike Blowers, Chris Sabo and Dave Hansen are more likely candidates for the job.

HEADLINE: Pataki Offers a Plan to Reduce Property Taxes Paid to Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Calling on the state to assume a greater share of the cost of public education, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed today a five-year, $3.4 billion plan that would cut the property taxes paid by homeowners to their school districts while also increasing state assistance for local education, mostly to New York City.
In a sneak preview of the centerpiece to the 1997-98 budget he plans to release on Tuesday, Mr. Pataki said his school plan would gradually reduce homeowners' property taxes by a total of $1.7 billion by mid-2001, which he said would reduce the tax bill for an average homeowner by 27 percent a year. 
 The plan would also gradually increase state aid to public schools from the current level of $10.3 billion a year to just over $12 billion by 2002, an increase of $1.7 billion. He said New York City would receive a sizable portion of that additional aid, $680 million a year by 2002, which would redress the city's decades-old complaint that it educates 37 percent of the state's students but receives only 34 percent of state school aid.
Overall, Mr. Pataki said, his plan would shift more of the cost of public education onto the state's shoulders, relieving what he called the onerous burden of increasing school property taxes on middle-class homeowners. Renters and owners of cooperative apartments, commercial or industrial properties, would not benefit from the tax-cut program.
The Governor was clearly trying to balance regional politics in the plan, an essential strategy for budget negotiations with the Legislature, which is dominated by rivalries among rural, suburban and urban legislators. The plan's tax-cut portions heavily favor suburban areas where property taxes are highest. But the proposal also offers more school aid to urban areas, particulary New York City, which have consistently complained that they are shortchanged in educational spending.
"School taxes on average rose by twice the rate of inflation during the 1980's and early 1990's," Mr. Pataki said. "We have stopped this dangerous trend, which threatened our middle class and limited our ability to create jobs and opportunity."
Stealing a page from legislation that has been kicking around in both houses of the Legislature, Mr. Pataki also proposed setting a cap on local property tax increases. Under his plan, school boards could not increase property taxes by more than the inflation rate, or 4 percent, whichever was lower. School boards could raise taxes by more than that only if two-thirds of the voters in their districts supported them.
Mr. Pataki did not propose any new sources of revenue to finance the plan. Asked how he would pay for it at a time when the state is facing a projected $3 billion shortage in the $65 billion budget for the coming year, Mr. Pataki chuckled and said that continued economic growth combined with tight controls on state spending would provide all the money the state needed do his plan.
"There's no question we can do it, there's no question we are going to do it," he said. He added that he did not think the state would have to make drastic cuts in any programs or lay off any state workers to balance its budget, even with the new tax cuts.
Democrats greeted Mr. Pataki's plan cautiously, saying they supported the overall goal of reducing local property taxes but were concerned about how to pay for it without reducing state services, particularly if the economic recovery falters. "The Legislature remembers well the lesson we learned from the Wall Street experience of 1987, when the market collapsed and we were forced to cut state schools spending and delay tax cuts," said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. "For that reason, the Speaker is skeptical."
Republicans, who have advanced their own $2.1 billion proposal to reduce property and business taxes, were more effusive in their praise. "I applaud Governor Pataki for proposing a bold plan to reduce school property taxes and increase state aid to school districts," said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County.
Municipal bond analysts and state fiscal monitors raised questions about how the state could afford a new round of deep tax cuts, which would come on the heels of a three-year, $3.9 billion income-tax cut, one that Mr. Pataki pushed through the Legislature in 1995, and a host of smaller business tax cuts enacted since then. Many of those tax cuts are phased in, so their real impact will not be felt for several years. "While we all hope the economy continues unabated growth, there is no assurance that that will happen," said Robert Kurtter, vice president for state studies with Moody's Investors Service, which rates New York State's bonds. "If there is a downturn in the next couple of years it will make paying for the enacted tax cuts very difficult."
School board officials and teachers unions greeted the plan warmly, though they said they wanted to see more details. "It's far more dramatic and far-reaching than I thought it would be," said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "It takes major steps toward equity, mainly for New York City."
While they praised Mr. Pataki's plans to increase state aid to the city's schools, New York City officials also criticized the plan because it offered smaller benefits to city homeowners and nothing at all to its tenants and co-op owners.
"It fails to recognize the residential nature of New York City, where many people are renters or co-op owners," said Thomas McMahon, director of the City Council's finance division. Mr. McMahon said the city would receive only 9 percent of the $1.7 billion in property tax relief.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said: "I don't know if we are getting our fair share of that. I have to see the proposal."
Aides to Mr. Pataki said the plan provided less tax relief to New York City because the property tax burden there, as well as in the state's other major cities, is lower than in the suburbs or rural areas. They also noted that the Governor's plan would give more school aid to the city than to the suburbs.
The Governor's tax-cut plan would give homeowners a $30,000 tax exemption -- $50,000 for people age 65 or over -- that would be used to reduce the taxable value of their property. That exemption would be adjusted against a statewide median value of a home, which is $110,000. That would mean that homeowners in high property value regions like Westchester or Long Island would effectively receive more than a $30,000 exemption, while homeowners in lower value rural regions might receive somewhat less.
Under one scenario, the owner of a home worth $110,000 would use the exemption to reduce the tax burden to $80,000. The owner would pay school taxes on that $80,000, while the state would pay the district the equivalent of taxes on the remaining $30,000. That way, no district would lose any money from the program.
Because the plan would be phased in gradually, its impact would be relatively small in the coming fiscal year, which begins on April 1. Mr. Pataki said he would call for increasing school aid by $302 million in 1997-98 and for cutting property taxes by $110 million.
Under his plan, the Governor would also require local governments to reassess property values every four years, much more frequently than is now typically the case. He would have the state increase its payments to local governments in lieu of property taxes on state owned lands, which represent large chunks of many urban areas.
And he would establish a program worth $240 million by 2002 to encourage school districts to reduce their administrative costs and freeze their property taxes.
The Governor also said he will ask the Legislature to change the complex formula used to allocate state education aid. He said he wants the state to give more money to poor communities, New York City and suburban districts where residents have high property values but moderate to low incomes. Recognizing that the school aid formula is probably the single most contentious issue the Legislature deals with each year, Mr. Pataki said he would push for changes in the future, not in the coming year.
Following a tactic he used last year, Mr. Pataki will offer more glimpses into his budget proposal over the next two days, garnering, his aides hope, positive media coverage before he allows anyone to see the full parameters of his spending plan.

HEADLINE: Pragmatism Is Supreme at Cabinet Session

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Four years ago when President Clinton wanted to brainstorm with his new Cabinet on public policy he called the officials to the Presidential retreat of Camp David, where professional "facilitators" also led them through an evening group exercise in sharing confidences about major life experiences.
But today when Mr. Clinton held another retreat for the incoming and departing Cabinets, New Age human relations exercises were out and pragmatism was in as the group focused on what Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff-designate, called the President's vision of governing "with more limited resources while operating within a balanced budget." 
 This time the Cabinet gathered -- under tight security -- in Blair House, the President's official guest house, which is just across the street from the White House but was considered a somewhat more relaxed setting. And the only one facilitating was Mr. Clinton."The President's pretty good at that himself," Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said recently.
Most of Mr. Clinton's new Cabinet nominees and White House aides have already served in the Administration, although the group now includes a prominent Republican, William S. Cohen, the former Senator from Maine who is the nominee for Defense Secretary.
Mr. Clinton's aides, who briefed reporters at the end of the day, described the day-long private meeting as a set of discussion sessions intended to provoke thought about the challenges facing the Administration, particularly in the crucial next few months, in which the President has an opportunity to set the tone for his second term. The President emphasized that he wanted his Cabinet "to reach out, especially to the Republican leadership" of the Congress, Mr. McCurry said.
The President's inaugural festivities begin next weekend and will be followed in February by his State of the Union Message and his budget proposal for the 1998 fiscal year.
The discussions gave Cabinet members a chance to hear about Administration priorities throughout Government, not just in their arena.
The morning began with sessions on national security and the "new economic architecture of the post-cold-war era," White House officials said. Signaling an Administration push to win bipartisan Congressional support for more money for foreign aid and international diplomacy, aides said that Madeleine K. Albright, the nominee to be Secretary of State, told the group that currently less that 1 percent of the Federal budget will be used to write "50 percent of the history and legacy of our times."
But the discussions also concentrated on the need to reach agreement with Congress on erasing the Federal deficit by 2002. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said Mr. Clinton impressed on his Administration that balancing the budget is "critical to the Administration's credibility."
The Cabinet officials and senior White House aides next moved on to a working lunch with the President and Vice President Al Gore. Hillary Rodham Clinton sat in on all of the day's discussions and Tipper Gore, the Vice President's wife, joined the group for lunch.
The afternoon schedule included sessions on budget priorities and ways to promote rising incomes, better education, preservation of the environment and technology. Richard W. Riley, the Education Secretary, said that Mr. Clinton considered a drive for higher standards in education "one of his top priorities for the next four years." All of those issues were raised by Mr. Clinton in the Presidential campaign, in which he embraced the Republican precept of balancing the budget in seven years even while providing some tax relief. Yet he also provided Democratic grace notes through an emphasis on issues like education and the environment.
With his second term set to begin when he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, Mr. Clinton has recently held a series of White House events to highlight his campaign call for a $1,500 tuition tax credit to many families for the first two years of higher education and his pleas for corporations and churches to hire welfare recipients. But the first comprehensive look at his second-term program will not come until the budget is unveiled in February.
Today's Cabinet retreat was originally supposed to take place at Camp David and span the weekend, but the session was shortened so the President and staff members could watch the National Football League playoffs on Sunday.
Crandall Close Bowles, the wife of Mr. Clinton's new chief of staff, has an interest in two limited partnerships with investments in the Carolina Panthers. The team will play the Green Bay Packers for the National Football Conference championship.

HEADLINE: White House Plans to Aid Washington, Official Says

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Following President Clinton's pledge last month to help the struggling District of Columbia, his Administration is developing a plan for the Federal Government to assume responsibility for some of the governmental functions that have placed the District in a deep financial hole, a District official said today.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting representative in Congress, said the package would be part of the proposal the Administration will send to Congress next month. 
 Ms. Norton, who has taken part in discussions between the District government and the Office of Management and Budget, said in an interview that while "the pieces are still in play" and no final decisions have been made, the prospect was for "nothing less than a breakthrough" that could put the relationship between the Federal Government and the District on a new footing.
A major ingredient in the package, she said, would have the Federal Government assume all or part of the District's $5 billion in unfinanced liability for public employee pensions. Before Congress gave the District a limited form of home rule in the 1970's, workers for the District's public agencies were Federal employees, whose pensions were paid by the Treasury Department out of annual appropriations without any long-term financing arrangement. In transferring the employees, and the obligation for their pensions, to the District as part of the final arrangements for home rule in 1980, Congress required the District to assume what was then a $2 billion pension liability.
"The District's own political problems have obscured the largest case of unfairness that exists in this country," Ms. Norton said. The District, whose population and tax base has been shrinking, has responsibilities that are handled elsewhere by counties or states, including prisons and Medicaid. Federal assistance with these obligations is also part of the discussions, she said.
At a Dec. 13 news conference at which he pledged the Federal Government would make a "more serious effort" in helping the District, President Clinton referred to a source of the capital's economic problems when he called it "not quite a state, not quite a city, not quite dependent, not quite independent."

HEADLINE: Youth Gangs To Be Target, Clinton Vows

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that in a bid to "break the backs" of youth gangs, he would propose legislation early in his second term aimed at stopping gang members from intimidating crime witnesses.
"Too many people will not testify about gang crimes because they are afraid of violent reprisal," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "We must not allow the voice of justice to be frightened into silence by the violent threats of gangs." 
 In the Republican radio address, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said Republicans would press for "permanent tax relief" for Americans in the new session of Congress. He gave no details.
Mr. Lott said Republicans would also act quickly on a constitutional amendment that would require Congress to pass a balanced Federal budget each year. The amendment passed the House two years ago but failed by one vote in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton opposes such an amendment but has said that if it is enacted, it should include safeguards to protect the budget from recessions, when economic slumps would result in less tax money than had been anticipated.
The President's radio address coincided with the release of a Justice Department report that said witness intimidation in cases related to gangs and drugs was hampering the investigation and prosecution of crime throughout the United States.
The report said gang members and associates of defendants often appeared in court to frighten witnesses into not testifying. It said a few jurisdictions, like California, permit the removal of courtrooms spectators who intimidate witnesses.
Mr. Clinton called the battle against youth violence and illegal drugs a priority of his second term and said he would offer legislation in the coming weeks to fight them. "I am determined to break the backs of criminal gangs that have ruined too many lives and stolen too many futures by bringing the full force of the law against them," he said.

HEADLINE: The Laptop Colonialists

BYLINE: By Michael Paterniti; Michael Paterniti has written for Details and Outside. This is his first article for the Magazine.

 BODY:
Out of the sweltering chaos of a saturday night in saigon, david Case bursts into the air-conditioned oasis of the Q Bar, where I'm sitting with a few American expatriates, all in their 20's and 30's, all engaged in some aspect of business in the city. Breathless, dripping sweat, Case falls into a chair, orders a Pilsner Urquell and starts airing out his soaked T-shirt.
"It's like this," he says. "You're on your motorbike, and you have to get to the Q Bar where you're supposed to meet your girlfriend." He checks his watch and gestures to his French-Vietnamese girlfriend, offering her a sheepish hello. 
 "There are a million total maniacs driving out there, the military police are busting people for bribes. Cyclos everywhere and lorries spewing exhaust and beggars with stump arms. Accidents left and right. And, oh yeah, prostitutes and scam artists. Everyone wants a piece of you. It's, like, Saigon: The Video Game."
"Sounds familiar," says a banker named Hung.
"Sounds like a million-dollar joint venture," says Mike, an entrepreneur, laughing. "Write it up as a proposal, and I'll get it to my investors."
This draws an impish grin from Case, who punches his Oliver Peoples glasses back up the bridge of his nose. For many young Americans living in the new Vietnam -- a place that according to The Vietnam Business Journal has sustained an 8.2 percent annual economic growth over the last five years -- the promise of profits in an emerging market laces even the most frivolous conversations. Although Vietnam has spent the last two decades in staggering poverty and without any real infrastructure, and although the country more closely resembles Myanmar than South Korea or Singapore, every day in Saigon teems with new business proposals, meetings and lunches over spreadsheets. Case's imaginary video game, just a whimsical breath of exasperation in a country with one phone for every 100 people, could end up on the first two million computers that will be sold here in the next decade. Recently, in fact, his proposal for a multimedia company attracted a $500,000 offer from an American investor, but Case scrapped the venture, uneasy with the risks over the short run.
You soon discover that everything in Saigon these days is about the short run. Three, five, 10 years tops. Sometimes the future looms no further than a Saturday night.
"So, gentlemen, where are we committing our crimes of pleasure tonight?" asks Mike. After a six-day workweek, the expats are ready to party. The familiar names of wartime Saigon -- the Caravelle Hotel, the Continental, the Rex -- are considered the boring relics of a closed chapter of history. Instead, the millennial foot soldiers of free enterprise travel a network of trendy world-beat clubs, restaurants and brand new bars.
"Saigon is the hippest, most electric place I've ever been," says Case, who has lived in Tokyo, Bangkok and Jakarta, and traveled widely in Southeast Asia. "A lot of people in the States say, 'Wow, don't the Vietnamese hate you?' Or, they tell me they spent the better part of their youth trying to stay out of Vietnam. But Vietnam is not a war anymore, it's a country."
In fact, half of the seven million people who live in Saigon today were born after the war. While our Vietnam iconography still consists of whirring helicopters, carpet bombings and jungle recon missions, Saigon now finds itself in an act of utter re-creation, a proliferating Cubist jumble of neon signs and half-sculpted buildings that rise from the delta as an augury of what the next century could bring. And although the Communist Government has renamed it Ho Chi Minh City and extended its borders to cover a 780-square-mile area from the South China Sea to near the Cambodian border, the city center, one of the most densely populated areas on earth, is still habitually called Saigon by the expats. Just five years ago, the main boulevards had no street lights.
"We were the first place with a working toilet," says David Jacobson, manager of the Q Bar, which opened in 1991. A low-lighted bastion of hipness with velvet curtains and Caravaggio reproductions on the walls, the bar has single-malt Scotches lined up across glass shelves and Tanqueray martinis for $5. It might be any funky, upscale rathskeller anywhere. Which is the point. The Q Bar offers its patrons a familiar Western refuge, and so the faces tend to repeat here each night, mostly fresh-looking white ones smelling of after-shave, crowding the black-lacquer bar.
As a group, these expats are perhaps like none other in history. Raised in an age of global capitalism, they've parachuted into what has long been regarded as enemy territory to try their luck against a wary Communist Government that, after the cessation of Soviet aid in 1991, encourages limited free enterprise. They E-mail home regularly. They do business in Laos and Cambodia. They have their Lonely Planet guidebooks earmarked for boondoggles in Phuket or Bali or Borneo. They gossip about who sleeps with whom, who is stranded in Phnom Penh waiting to get his or her visa renewed and who is bribing the Government to do business here.
The literati of the 20's settled in Paris, the Beats of the 50's escaped to Mexico City and the wanderers of the early 90's overran Prague -- while waves of backpacking expats have set down everywhere from Tangier to Katmandu. Now Saigon has been captured by young capitalists, in the process of creating a corporate bohemia. They are children of the mainstream, graduates of schools like Yale and Stanford, Middlebury and Duke, often from wealthy suburbs. Many have advanced degrees. Many boast that they are here to make their first $1 million.
What Saigon offers in the meantime is a constant party, the prospects of an exotic girlfriend, an easy home base from which to travel and a life among the elite in a country where the average weekly wage is about $12. For the most part, expats make anywhere from $20,000 to $150,000 a year. And if Saigon was once haunted by war, it is now haunted by the paranoia of life in a Communist country. At the Q Bar, the foreigners trade stories of late-night visits from the police or of mail that arrives already opened, of being the victims of daring daylight muggings and having their P. J. Harvey tapes or Details magazines confiscated by cultural customs. Often told with relish, the stories seem to highlight a feeling among the expats that they live in a taboo place, lending their lives notoriety and danger.
"People tried to make something of Prague a few years ago, but there finally was no edge to it," says Bradford Edwards, a California artist who spends half the year in Vietnam. "Saigon is the edge. We're on the frontier. It's a place where state-sponsored Communism and capitalism are colliding head on, and that creates this amazing tension. People come here to try to surf it or see if it will swallow them."
Though precise numbers are difficult to come by, over the last two years about 400 American companies have begun doing business in Vietnam, and about 1,500 Americans have moved to a country where there were virtually none, joining a community of returnees and French, Australian, Chinese and Japanese transplants that number up to 30,000. Their presence, along with that of the British and Australians, has spurred a cottage industry of English-language publications and a slew of support services. Alarmed by the Western influx but wanting economic growth, the Government will soon require work permits for all expatriates.
Several drinks later, we pull up anchor. After stops at the Camargue, El Globo and Cafe Latin, after oysters, tapas and creme brulee, we make the post-midnight pilgrimage to the French-run bar Apocalypse Now. Sandbags are piled in the corners to conjure foxholes, drips of blood-red paint cover the white globe lights and frescoed helicopters buzz from the ceiling.
The room is wall-to-wall bodies: a predominantly Western crowd of investment bankers, young professionals and backpackers mashed together. Around the pool table an elaborate seduction takes place as the regular Vietnamese call girls wait for their chance to play against an eager bevy of men. Meanwhile, on the dance floor, powered by thumping bass lines and flashing lights, more women in hot pants and halter tops dance to Sheryl Crow, LL Cool J and the Fugees, jockeying beneath a single bright strobe light.
At the bar, I talk to Rachel Loeb, a 23-year-old American who surveys the circus with a dispassionate eye. "If you're an expat woman, you're not here to find a man. There are occasionally flings, but everyone, everything is so transitory it's hard. And have you seen these women?" She gestures at the dance floor. "They're beautiful."
"Work and drink, money and sex," is how an American trader later sums up his life with proud weariness. Although the evening is getting late, people continue to trickle in from other bars and clubs, ready to push the party to dawn. Propped against the counter with a vodka in hand, in chinos and a pressed shirt, my new American friend inspects a Vietnamese woman as she walks by, hesitates briefly and, to the remixed strains of "Killing Me Softly," dives into the boisterous crowd after her.
Early on a muggy monday morning, i find myself on the back of Rachel Loeb's motorbike. Loeb works as a specialist for the Central Trading and Development Group, a Taiwanese company with a $600 million plan to build the infrastructure for a new city center called Saigon South. If there are any traffic rules here, they're improvised on a case-by-case basis; Loeb barrels down the street, wafting perfume, her shock of red hair startling the slower drivers. She caroms through traffic circles, gunning her motorbike past cyclos (bicycle-driven rickshaws) and bicyclists with inches to spare. "If I don't get out of this city for a while once every month," she yells over her shoulder, "I start wanting to plow into people."
Loeb is ambitious, uncensored and, like the city itself, growing up fast. If Americans of similar age once landed here knowing virtually nothing of Vietnam, many of the new expats have taken college courses, seen movies or read books about the war, arriving with at least a cloudy impression of the country. Still, with no firsthand memory or experience of the war, it is nearly irrelevant to them, simply part of the mystique.
"Why go back to that hellhole?" one father recently asked his 22-year-old son before he flew to Saigon. "Aren't we still trying to escape it?" If an older generation of Americans failed in Vietnam, then a younger one, in J. Crew garb and armed with high-tech paraphernalia, is returning to master it. "I would say the future of this country lies in the new expat yuppies with their cell phones and laptops," says one Q Bar regular grandiloquently. "We're the ones who can bring them jobs."
As a student at Northwestern University, Rachel Loeb wrote her history thesis on women's roles in Vietnamese culture and spent a semester in the country in 1993. When she graduated, she found herself at a crossroads: "I couldn't think of anything to do in the States," she says. "Or, it was more like no one was going to give me a chance to do what I wanted to do. Sure, I could be living the fat life somewhere, but I wanted to do this on my own. Most of my friends say, 'What's a nice Jewish girl from Kansas City doing in Vietnam?' "
After a few miles on her motorbike, we arrive at a co-worker's house and pile into a van. Besides Loeb and a female American colleague, Ty, who is 24, our fellow carpoolers are older Taiwanese and Chinese men. "My buddies," says Loeb, beaming. Ty, who like many expats asks to be identified only by her first name, works as a teacher for Central Trading's as-yet-unopened international English-language school. "Before I can teach in it, I practically have to build it," she says.
Ty is a Viet Kieu (pronounced Viet Q), one of the more than one million Vietnamese who left the country as refugees during or after the war. She fled Saigon with her family in 1979 and eventually settled in a Miami suburb. Her return, she says, has been filled with moments of exhilaration and paranoia. While the Government generally lets these refugees back into the country, they watch the Viet Kieu closely, suspicious that they might be subversives. "When we left 17 years ago it was because of the Communists, and then suddenly we were coming back to their country," she says. "I was trembling when I came through customs with my mom and sister."
Sipping from cans of Lipton iced tea, battling hangovers from "a little dinner party last night," both Loeb and Ty admit that it has been hard adjusting to Saigon -- "to all these worlds ramming together," as Loeb puts it.
"There's so much randomly happening here it can make you dizzy," says Ty. "Everything plays out on the street. You can't fight it and you can't impose your Western standards on it. You just have to be. The hardest thing for me has been acclimatizing to the poverty." She tells a story about seeing a dead child in the gutter, realizing that it could have easily been her 20 years ago. "I don't know if you ever become immune to it."
While Vietnam remains one of the poorest countries in the world, it is also in a real revolution, albeit a confusing one. In the post-apocalyptic, pre-McDonald's rush of metastasizing Saigon, capitalism in fact already thrives. There are 2,000 international companies settled in the country, thus far mostly manufacturers of goods for export. Factories have grown up like mushrooms; in one cluster south of the city, 51 have been built in the last three years, with 81 more planned. Since 1995, office space has quadrupled, as has the number of taxi companies in the city. Honda sold more than half a million motorbikes last year, and 127 licensed English schools have cropped up where once there were only five. Saigon drives the country economically, responsible for up to 30 percent of its gross domestic product, as well as nearly 30 percent of its revenues.
Still, Saigon has never quite reflected the mostly agrarian culture and Confucian ideals of Vietnam. Greatly influenced by the French and Americans during their respective wars here, plagued by traffic problems and street crimes like mugging and pickpocketing, the city has always been regarded by Vietnamese as a wild cousin on the high wire. To the primly disciplined and more cultured northerners in Hanoi -- most important the country's leaders based there -- Saigon is riddled with corruption and worthy of suspicion, a kind of psychedelic Sodom. It's a place that is so caught up in the now that it creates, at times, the unsavory illusion that there never was a past or a great war to liberate the country from the "colonial powers."
"It's hard to have close Vietnamese friends," says Loeb. "A lot of people just won't let you in. While they're incredibly friendly, they don't necessarily trust you." Loeb's biggest frustration is her isolation, her inability to forge lasting relationships, even with other expats. "Eight of 10 in any group are men," Loeb says. "I miss having close female friends. When Ty and I hang out, we talk girl stuff clothes, boys, sex."
The van crawls through traffic, stopping at an office building, where about half the men disembark. "See you, Zhong," says Loeb brightly, waving. "O.K., bye now Fred, sorry I was late this morning. I'll be a good girl tomorrow. . . ."
Both Loeb and Ty acknowledge that they are anomalies: women in an overwhelmingly male corporate environment, 20-somethings with the opportunities of 40-somethings. And the package isn't bad for a first job: Loeb says she earns $24,000 a year, plus a $4,000 bonus, a plane ticket back to the States and 36 days of paid vacation.
As we pass out of the city center into a newly created district just south of Saigon, the paved roads give way to dirt, children play soccer on a dusty field and a man sells watermelon from his pushcart. There's nothing but flat, marshy delta with a few bamboo huts. Pointing across the wasteland to a clump of mangrove trees, Loeb says, "That's Saigon's future stock market."
Surveying these 6,400 acres, it's hard to imagine that a city has already begun to rise out of the land, a controlled environment of 35-story skyscrapers, retail boutiques, luxury apartment buildings, a civic center, international exhibition hall and a river walk. Even now the rice paddies are being filled, huge concrete sewage pipes litter the horizon and steamrollers have begun work on a grid of roads. Poles with pieces of wood nailed to them stick out of the dirt announcing future thoroughfares with names like Broadway and Market Street. Central Trading claims that, when finished, all of its development projects in the area, including its new $142 million power plant, will increase the industrial output of southern Vietnam by a third while providing housing for more than half a million people.
Central Trading's effort is part of a larger Taiwanese campaign begun five years ago that includes $4.1 billion of financing for 273 projects to date, making it the leading investor in Vietnam. In the nearly three years since America has normalized relations with Vietnam, U.S. companies like Coca-Cola, Ford and General Electric have pledged $1.3 billion for a total of 63 projects, ranking it first among Western investors, though sixth overall. And yet, of the $23 billion pledged, less than one-third has actually been spent, in large part because of the country's tangled bureaucracy and archaic legal system.
Loeb's job, meanwhile, is to lease the metropolis, still invisible. "We're creating a city here," she says, "and I'm selling it to the fund managers and C.E.O.'s of the world. I don't know many 23-year-olds who can say that."
After touring the Central Trading complex -- a warehouselike office building with an outdoor basketball court and pool that sits on the edge of the swamp -- we look out over Saigon South from a sixth-floor deck. Standing in the blistering heat, the wind rustling her hair, Loeb perspires slightly in her lamb's-wool dress. As she takes stock of her empty kingdom-to-be, her eyes come to rest on a ramshackle bamboo hut that lies in the shadow of the complex. "The family that lives there doesn't want to move," she says. "They know they've got something worth money. But, I think we'll work it out."
It's 10:30 on a tuesday night, and again we're at the Q Bar. Hung is telling the story of an American friend who works in finance in Saigon. A group of four neatly dressed Americans sit with us at an outdoor table, drinking beer, watching the traffic whiz by. The streets are clotted with Vietnamese teen-agers and 20-year-olds flirting with one another at high speed, the women in traditional ao dais or designer jeans, a few lucky men reckless on their $2,000 Honda Dream motorbikes, the status symbols of choice these days.
"He's spending hundreds of dollars on this woman," says Hung over the noise, "and he hasn't even kissed her yet." According to Hung, his friend visits what's known as a bia om, or "hugging bar," where for the price of a drink one is entitled to the hugs and whispered sweet nothings of a personal hostess and, depending on the hostess, the promise of sex-for-pay later. As it has happened, Hung's friend has found himself in a predicament out of "Miss Saigon."
"He's fallen in love with this Vietnamese woman at the bar," says Hung, lowering his voice a note. "I mean, he's a 22-year-old kid in love for the first time, and he's like a confused puppy dog. He's not sure if she's a prostitute, and he doesn't know whether he should ask to go with her. So he keeps bringing her gifts."
During the war, drugs were plentiful and brothels blossomed on almost every downtown street, with 100,000 Vietnamese women working as prostitutes. Today opium is outlawed and the brothels are much less conspicuous, but Saigon remains a decadent place. Shimmering with the sultry heat of the delta, the city is shot through with a palpable sense of desire, the sheer aspirations of a culture striving for more than it now possesses. Surrounded by beautiful women in a karaoke bar or nightclub -- where cupidity meets cupidity to the schmaltz rock of a Singaporean band playing cover versions of songs by the 70's soft-rock group Bread -- the expats accept desire at face value, as if the women are truly interested in them rather than in the baubles of their material success. "It's easy to get a big head here," boasts one American in his 20's. "I don't just have one girlfriend. Let's say I have several."
Hung's friend, however, may have more in common with Alden Pyle, the protagonist of Graham Greene's 1955 novel, "The Quiet American." Pyle, employed by a dark organization known as the Economic Aid Mission, arrives in Saigon overflowing with an eagerness to lend a colonial hand and falls hopelessly in love with a prostitute. Seeing him for the first time at the Continental Hotel, the narrator, a cynical British newspaper reporter who happens to live with the object of Pyle's desire, describes Pyle's "unmistakably young and unused face flung at us like a dart. With his gangly legs and his crew cut and his wide campus gaze he seemed incapable of harm."
Minus the crew cut, this is how I see Hung's friend. In the confused sexual milieu of modern Saigon -- one that includes child prostitution fueled by foreign sex-tour operators -- the expats seem to tiptoe around the word "prostitute." Still, it's often understood that a "girlfriend," while perhaps not being paid directly for sex, expects certain perks. Some carousing expats supplement their steady relationships, too, with visits to brothels or karaoke bars. Many don't. But either way, it's not uncommon to see Western men out with Vietnamese women who, speaking only limited English or French, sit silently in the shadow of their boyfriends, nibbling on tiramisu.
"Most of them aren't career women," observes Hung, who himself dates a Viet Kieu woman, an Ivy League graduate in her 20's. "They won't threaten your manhood. They just want to be with you."
"Most of these guys probably couldn't get a date in the States," says Ty, who, like a lot of expat women, tends to date Europeans rather than Vietnamese men. "They come here and buy these big motorcycles -- we call them testosterone cycles -- and they think they're hot, but they're suckers. It's worth it for these women to put their bodies up for a dream of getting out."
While the American men have the luxury of treating their relationships with Vietnamese women casually, the women face a larger set of problems within their culture, which does not look kindly on miscegenation. "If a Vietnamese girl is with you, she's no longer neutral," says Edwards, the artist from California. I don't care if she has a wedding ring and your three Amerasian kids, she's still a whore to her people."
Case recalls a Vietnamese woman who fell in love with an expat banker and spent two years as his girlfriend, expecting to marry him. When the man went home, he broke up with her. Already disowned by her family, she wasn't accepted back into her neighborhood. "She definitely wasn't a prostitute, but I used to see her around, half-trying to pick up Western guys because she had nowhere to go," he says.
There are women in Saigon who own Honda Dreams, have their own apartments, cell phones and a few thousand dollars in cash each month, all compliments of rich boyfriends. "I think I'd be doing the same thing if I hadn't been lucky enough to get out when I was young," says Mei-Lee Dozier, a 25-year-old Viet Kieu. "There's a saying that Vietnamese men are gold and women are cloth. If a man is tarnished, he can polish it off. If a woman is stained, she's ruined."
Often Vietnamese men spit or swear at women who are on the streets with Westerners; to them, mixed couples threaten to unravel the social fabric that has sustained the country through four wars. The Vietnamese Government is also unsettled by these relationships, broadly looking to keep the cultures separate by occasionally cracking down on those nightclubs and bars where expats consort with Vietnamese women.
At the table, Mike -- a 30-ish self-proclaimed "lifer" in Vietnam -- confesses that he's dating a 19-year-old Vietnamese woman. "She picked me up," he says, smiling, then turns suddenly serious. "Eastern morals are different. Look, the Japanese and the Koreans and the Singaporeans are keeping these prostitutes in business. We're not the ones ruining some Confucian dream here." When asked if his girlfriend is a prostitute, he rolls his eyes. "Do I look like I need to go out with prostitutes?" he says. "My girlfriend has a 9 P. M. curfew. But that doesn't mean I haven't discovered what afternoons are for."
The symbiosis between money and sex eventually insinuates itself. Shopping in the antique district one afternoon, I stop at a small gift shop, looking for a wooden bowl. After some difficulty understanding me, the shopkeeper, an attractive woman of about 20 with stylishly cut short hair, asks me to return in a few minutes. When I do, fully expecting that she has found someone to help translate, she has combed her hair, put on lipstick and closed the shop. She leads me to a nearby restaurant, orders fried rice and spring rolls and, after an awkward silence, pulls out a battered notebook, from which she reads faltering bits of conversational English.
Not understanding, I ask to see her book. Scribbled in pencil is a list of questions: What make car do you have? Do you have a stereo? How big is your house? Do you like your television set? And finally: Will you be the one to show me good loving? When I repeat that I'm looking for a wooden bowl, she seems unsure, searching the scrawled lines of her book again. She tries again, enunciating slowly, leaning across the table, half-embarrassed.
"Will you be the one," she says, "to buy me a Honda Dream?"
A day in the life of david case is, by his own admission, "pretty schizoid." Depending on the shuttlecock volley of his mind, the amount of caffeine in his body or the deadline du jour, he is an entrepreneur who works with young girls from the countryside making and selling blankets (partly in an effort to keep them from prostitution), a freelance writer for Reuters covering Vietnam's volatile economic scene, a studio musician in the midst of cutting 10 jazz-influenced pop tracks for the first Western CD ever recorded in Vietnam and a proofreader for the English-language Government newspaper, The Vietnam News.
Case, 31, lives with his French Viet Kieu girlfriend, Elizabeth Nguyen, on the top floor of a colonial house, five airy rooms with tiled floors and ornate shuttered windows, for which they pay $650 a month (average in a city that now ranks as the third most expensive in Southeast Asia). Nguyen, a 26-year-old financial controller who grew up in Paris after her family fled Saigon in the 60's, works for a trading company. Case says he makes somewhere between $15,000 and $40,000, depending on how he spends his time. Their apartment is furnished with wrought-iron couches and chairs with overstuffed white pillows, huge iron-framed mirrors and wood bookcases, all of which Nguyen designed herself and had built by a local craftsman, paying a third of what she might have in the United States.
On the white walls are hung wooden bowls from Hanoi and several Vietnamese abstract paintings, as well as rudimentary pencil portraits that they painstakingly rendered of each other in their "quest to draw," as Case puts it.
On their combined income, they eat about half of their meals out -- enjoying dinners of duck and Beaujolais at one of many French restaurants or lunches at a nearby vegetarian restaurant where, even after vermicelli spring rolls, heaping plates of tofu, beans and rice, a salad and fruit shakes, the bill is still less than $5. The rest of their meals are prepared by a maid, a cheerful Vietnamese woman they pay $100 a month -- about three times the average -- to clean, cook, iron and shop. They also travel often in Europe and Asia. On most Sunday afternoons, after working a 60-hour week, they swim at one of the local hotel pools, where the patrons tend to be visiting Westerners and expats.
Case is articulate, self-reflective and sometimes given to worry. After four years in Southeast Asia, he is conversant in French and Thai but speaks only "taxicab" Vietnamese, as he puts it. It also happens he's a friend of mine from college. When he returns home for the occasional wedding or holiday, he is confronted by the life he has eschewed for the moment, the life of many of his friends: spouses, children, homes, office jobs, budding golf habits, sport utility vehicles.
"A lot of people are paralyzed in the States," he says. "They sit around watching television and accept their situation whether they're happy or not. I'm determined to go out and see if another way of living will make me happy."
Like many foreigners here, Case feels an addictive freedom to try on and discard various identities. For instance, he readily admits that he wouldn't have had the chance to record music in the U.S. or cobble together a decent living with his mixed ventures. This, he says, may have something to do with the fact that there's "no ceiling of middle-aged white guys over your head demanding a resume," as another expat puts it. Given a blank page instead, young Americans are allowed to write their own story.
And yet, while Case, like many Americans in Saigon, seems mostly content, living what he sees as some version of the quixotic expat dream, he still regards himself as a temporary passenger. "I love Saigon, but there are definite downsides," says Case. "My girlfriend had her laptop stolen on the street by some thieves on motorbikes. They dragged her 50 yards before she let go. And then there's this feeling that you're always being watched. A Government official called me and started randomly talking about my yoga. How did he know unless he watched through the windows? Why was he watching me at all?"

HEADLINE: A Wonderful Place for A Murder

SERIES: This is the first in a series about the link between a city and its fictional detectives.

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO; MARILYN STASIO writes the Crime column for The Times Book Review.

 BODY:
THE first time I visited Edinburgh, during a season that the natives laughably refer to as "spring," I nearly perished from the cold and the damp and the icy drizzle that weeps incessantly down the stone walls and cobbled streets of that wind-swept city on the Firth of Forth. Without stopping to unpack the useless clothing I had brought, off I ran to Victoria Street to buy a cashmere turtleneck with a matching tam that came down to my eyebrows and over my ears. Ah, better. My second stop was an antiquarian bookshop on Princes Street, where I spent $10 on an original 1924 edition (eureka!) of "The Fatal Countess and Other Studies" by William Roughead.
That's just the sort of book you want to be reading on a visit to Edinburgh, a proud, lofty city that takes perverse satisfaction in its violent history. Down these cobblestoned streets trundled the burdened cart of those infamous body snatchers Burke and Hare. Through that insalubrious alley lies Tweeddale Court, where Begbie, a hapless bank clerk, lost his life and his purse. At the foot of the Royal Mile that bisects Old Town, in the stately Palace of Holyroodhouse, is the wood-paneled dining room where poor, handsome Rizzio, the luckless companion of Mary, Queen of Scots, was dragged away from his supper to his death. And somewhere beyond the city's gray stone turrets and spires, legend tells of a castle where Macbeth and his cruel lady called the King to come and be killed. 
 Roughead, a distinguished Edinburgh lawyer with an obsessive interest in criminal lore, presented his case studies in "The Fatal Countess" in so seductive a narrative voice that no less a stylist than Henry James became an ardent fan of his "excellent art and animation."
"Bishops, bravoes and panders, poison-mongers and magicians" all played their parts in the infamous case of Lady Frances Howard, the "beautiful and evil" countess who was banished to obscurity in 1616 for the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, a powerful court insider who was thwarting her ambitions to marry the King's Favorite. In his insinuating style, Roughead goes on to recount all the juicy details of a conspiracy that involved certain "parasitic, prodigal and rapacious" nobility in the "naughty court" of King James. Some said that the King himself was an accessory to the crime. "But as to this we have no certainty," cautions Roughead, who slyly adds, "and his Majesty, like lesser rogues, is entitled to the benefit of the doubt." Now, that's hot stuff.
 Roughead wasn't the only connoisseur of crime to discover in Edinburgh's forbidding architecture and bloody history the perfect setting for "a really good murder." Modern Scottish authors such as Ian Rankin and Quintin Jardine have also made the city their killing grounds and turned to its sinister past for literary inspiration.
 "This is a city," Mr. Rankin takes glum satisfaction in reminding us, "which flayed grave-robbers and made their skins into souvenirs, the capital of a country one of whose kings made a hobby of extracting teeth from his subjects. Nothing I could write about in such a context could ever be considered exaggeration."
 Mr. Rankin's novels take readers down the city's darkest, meanest streets. "Hide and Seek" slouches around the squalid haunts of derelicts and drug addicts. The teen-aged throwaways who hurl themselves off the Forth Road Bridge in "Let It Bleed" take a bleak route from youth shelter to jail to the morgue. And in "Mortal Causes," a torture chamber is discovered beneath Old Town streets, in a warren of stone buildings and passageways buried and forgotten in the 1600's when a plague swept the city.
 "I like to imagine that all my Edinburgh novels are modern reworkings of and critiques upon 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' " says Mr. Rankin, who calls his mordant style "tartan noir." Taking the classic horror story of his countryman, Robert Louis Stevenson, as his literary model suits his theory that Edinburgh has two faces: the stern public face of Calvinist probity trying to avert its eyes from the wild thing grinning from the mirror. To Mr. Rankin, these dual moral personalities suggest that "in writing about Scotland's twisted present, I might be saying something about its past psychoses, too."
 Quintin Jardine isn't as dour a writer or as remorseless a moralist as Mr. Rankin, but his high-tension police procedurals featuring Assistant Chief Constable Bob Skinner will raise your pulse rate. You won't run into Mr. Jardine's rude and vulgar coppers among the Georgian terraces, crescents and squares in the New Town, but they are great companions on a pub crawl. Designated "Best City in Britain for Pubs" by the Good Pub Guide, Edinburgh has more than 700 of these hospitable spots, from elegant Victorian lounges to dark, cozy taverns with fireplaces, so there are lots of book nooks to crawl into.
 My favorite Jardine mystery is "Skinner's Rules," which finds a savage killer preying on strollers on the Royal Mile. Sports enthusiasts might prefer "Skinner's Round," in which members of an exclusive new golf club are being murdered right before an important tournament. Given that Scotland is acknowledged to be the ancestral home of golf, the arbiters of the sport at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews are understandably put out.
 Spicing the police investigation is the rumor that the killings are the curse of a local witch burned at the stake in the 16th century -- a notion that no superstitious Scot would dismiss lightly. Even Skinner, who is a hard guy, gives the witch-burnings some thought. "The tourist people are happy to sell this country on the back of its golf, beaches and sailing," he notes, "but they keep quiet about the bloodshed and persecution for which it was famous before then."
 If it doesn't stop raining in Edinburgh, you might be ready for side trips. You'll want a couple of bodyguards -- uh, tour guides -- in Glasgow, Scotland's largest, grittiest city. William McIlvanney and Peter Turnbull write uncommonly unsentimental procedurals set on their rugged turf. Mr. Turnbull's cops have a streak of cynical humor ("The reputation for violence and aggression among the Scots is based wholly on the behavior of small men from Glasgow and Edinburgh") and Mr. McIlvanney's detective, Jack Laidlaw, has the voice of a poet and the eyes of a hangman. I leave you in their capable hands, and recommend you begin with Mr. McIlvanney's "Laidlaw" and Mr. Turnbull's "Long Day Monday."
 And should you be bound for the Scottish Highlands (the home of "gentle people," Mr. Turnbull assures us), dump the tough guys and stock up on M. C. Beaton's enchanting series of cottage mysteries set in Lochdubh. The crime rate in this fictional village is so low that Hamish Macbeth, a young constable who "seemed part of an older, cleaner world," spends most of his time salmon fishing. No wonder Ms. Beaton's books sell so well in Edinburgh.
Nonetheless, even if Clinton is wrong in this, he cannot be accused of inconsistency. It's one matter on which he hasn't flip-flopped. He campaigned with a promise to end "welfare as we know it." His D.N.C. and "inventing government" friends had long been advocates of moving people from welfare to work, and so had he. He knows the difficulties involved and granted waivers to 43 states to experiment with different approaches even while they were receiving all the guarantees of the old system. The policy wonk in Clinton loves to test and compare such plans. The states themselves were clamoring for control of their own welfare problems -- even though early experiments showed that it will cost far more money to get work for people than to keep them on the dole.
Welfare, as its opponents paint it, is simply a matter of laziness, unwillingness to work or a culture of dependency. Actually, it is the byproduct of multiple factors not working in synch -- of demography, family breakdown, technology, outmoded or absent training and world trade. Welfare recipients are mainly the dependents of people unequipped for the jobs available (if any), and they are falling even further behind in their preparedness for the kinds of jobs that will soon become available. Welfare was a comparatively cheap way of avoiding confrontation with such issues. Every year makes the problem more complex. Even if we can find work for the unemployed, and fit them to it, it is most often subsistence-level labor with few or no benefits. The states have taken on the task of providing training for jobs, then finding (or creating) the jobs; handling day care for the children left at home when single mothers go to work, and underwriting medical costs not provided to transient workers. If worker training does not succeed, all the old costs of the dole will continue, with the new failed outlays added. It is a daunting prospect for the states, and one they could try to solve by creating far greater problems: cutting off welfare at the end of the time limit even if no jobs have been achieved, bidding each other down to make "undesirables" leave their jurisdiction, leaving the problem to overstrained private charities -- all of which can lead to greater homelessness and crime, to resentment in the poor and repression by the better-off.
The reason Clinton delayed welfare reform in his first two years was precisely the cost, the fact that it is more expensive to end welfare, even under the best circumstances (which may not be present), than to continue it, endlessly deferring the problem. But the priority of deficit reduction made him continue the deferring for three years, and his signature on the Republican bill deferred it by devolving it -- to the states. He promised to "fix" the bill later. It will be the ultimate flip if he fails to make good on that promise -- and he may very well be unable to. In that case, his whole case for government flops.
The bill cannot be fixed just by restoring some of the Federal funds cut by it -- more money for food stamps and aid to legal immigrants are the ones most often mentioned. The bill is about jobs, and unless the Federal Government leads in the effort to achieve this, the bill's central but most difficult mandate, complaints about inequities in the states will mount -- just as complaints about unregulated H.M.O.'s have. Yet the thing that recommended the plan to some -- the ability to use states as laboratories for experiment -- will make it harder, perhaps impossible, for the Federal Government to prioritize the different states' problems and to respond appropriately to the specific failures in widely varying schemes.
Other government problems have run up against the time-consuming and costly problem of adjudicating different claims on their individual merits -- industrial safety cases and civil rights violations are prominent examples. To cut through the complexities of case-by-case investigation, probabilities based on numbers were used in these areas, an anti-bureaucratic measure attacked as using "quotas." But the problem of dozens of different statewide systems of welfare will be far more complex than the issue of safety in one plant or the hiring provisions in one institution. The new plan may be inefficient and still not create the necessary jobs! The probability is that the states will call for more intervention by Washington as their problems mount.
But when they "call the cops," will the cops come? In an ideal world, Clinton could use the states' difficulties to advance programs he is fond of and has promised. National service could be diverted into job training. Work projects to create new jobs could rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure of bridges and roads.
But fiscal restraints promise to be as strict in Clinton's second term as in his first -- not because they are needed as much, with the deficit more than halved, but because they worked so well for him. As Steven Rattner of Lazard Freres wrote last July on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, the Clinton tax increase to cut the deficit gave him the steady economic progress that was the basis for his re-election. Even with the collapse of the radical Gingrich revolution, a moderate Dole anti-tax campaign could have defeated Clinton but for the rise of employment and our current low inflation, creating the lowest "misery index" (combined unemployment and inflation) since 1968. James Carville and his colleagues, who attacked Clinton's reliance on market advisers like Robert Rubin, were unwittingly fighting against their own earlier slogan: It was "the economy, stupid" that re-elected Clinton in 1996.
The reappointment of Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury indicates that Clinton is not going to bite the hand that fed him -- which severely contracts his ability to feed the poor left at the mercy of the states by the welfare bill. In the case of great suffering, will Clinton live up to his own basic belief in the need for a government solution? I think there is reason to hope for that. Though he is dithering and professorial when facing problems in the abstract or the future, he is a counterpuncher of nerve and concentration when set back, as he has proved over and over, and the personal commitment to solving pressing problems is there. The means may be lacking, but -- one hopes -- not the will.
 IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED that Presidents in their second term look to their "place in history" by turning to foreign affairs. That may have been true in the cold war, though it is doubtful even there. Truman and Nixon made their historic foreign policy moves (the Marshall Plan and the China opening) in their first terms. Only Reagan turned to arms talks in the second term after neglecting diplomacy in his first four years.
Clinton has been no promise breaker in this area, since he kept his foreign policy promises vague and infrequent. He has been a foreign policy minimalist, doing as little as possible as late as possible in place after place -- in Haiti, in Bosnia, with China. There is much to be said for some degree of disengagement at this point -- which is not the same as isolationism. As Representative Barney Frank has argued, our troops in Europe serve little purpose but to boost economies there and drain ours here. After half a century of cold war, when the whole world's freedom seemed to be at stake in every trouble spot, the impulse to have America keep proving it is "a great power" (the hallowed phrase) by responding to any challenge is, at the very least, wasteful. For one thing, we shall never get our defense spending wrestled back under control if the Pentagon is able to use mission after mission to create new demands on a compliant Congress. Humanitarian aid should be clearly identified as such, and we should cooperate with multilateral peace-keeping instead of tearing down the basis for it at the United Nations. For these purposes the appointment of Madeleine Albright may be misguided -- for the very reasons given by those who praise her toughness. She seems to yearn back toward cold-war certitudes and swagger.
The thing that seems to interest Clinton most in foreign dealings is world trade, and a good thing, too. As the government's basic credibility had to be restored at home by deficit reduction, the basis for stable influence in the world will, of necessity, be economic influence rather than military power. The problem with Clinton's policy is not its aims but his desultory or inadequate explanation of its potential and perils. He fought through GATT and Nafta but did not defend them by recognizing the need for measures to counter their domestic impact, which diminishes or dislocates local industries. A vision of the benefits of trade has not been formulated for the American people. Perhaps Clinton should read "Worldly Goods," by Lisa Jardine, which explains how trade ties reached across ideological and ethnic ties in the Renaissance, creating some elements of a common culture at odds with divisive local causes. The historian William McNeill has pointed to this Renaissance parallel for our post-cold-war world.
Perhaps Clinton will have little leisure for reading, or even policy, if investigations continue to nag at and discredit him -- not least because of his evasive and feckless resistance to demands for information. It would be fitting, perhaps, but tragic if the man who believes so deeply in government is undone by the cops coming for him. But apart from the entirely unproved allegations of illegality, Republicans will gravely miscalculate if they think their path to power lies in the personal vilification of the President and his wife. That has been tried and failed.
Many people wonder why it has failed. Why, despite the public's recognition of grave character flaws, did it not reject Clinton in its ballots for 1992 or 1996? William Powers, in a long article in The New Republic, blames the national press for not building fires of ardent indignation. But, even if that were the task of the media, why should they have succeeded where Senator Alfonse D'Amato failed in his Congressional hearings and talk radio has failed despite its drumbeat of heated, even hysterical accusations?
Martin Walker, the British journalist, answers with an argument that Clinton is "the President we deserve" precisely because he typifies (when he does not anticipate) the hesitations, ambiguities and still undisclosed purpose of his own generation. It is hard for the rest of us to get indignant about his tries at marijuana when few of us can say our families have no members who have experimented with drugs. Newt Gingrich is a lame excoriator of Clinton's lack of military service.
Nor is it easy to dismiss Clinton as an unfaithful husband, as Senator Dole realized when he pointedly declined to exploit that charge (knowing that an account of his own adultery during his first marriage hung over him like the sword of Damocles, to be dropped if he dared bring up the subject). Changed mores, and changed attitudes toward candor about those mores, give the censorious little ground to stand on. This is not the fault of coverage by the political media. Things formally hushed up are now regularly brought to light in areas far away from electoral politics -- in churches, universities, the business and entertainment worlds.
When I was a college student, it was considered scandalous for a faculty member to divorce. Now everyone knows who is sleeping with whom. In fact, Clinton, with his obvious affection and support for Chelsea and his wife, is to be commended for the effort he has given to making a troubled marriage work. A recent cartoon playing on the popular movie "First Wives Club" had a circle of political first wives looking fierce -- the first Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Gingrich, Mrs. Limbaugh, Mrs. Gramm, Mrs. Armey. A long list could be compiled of our prominent wife-dumpers' dumpees -- the first Mrs. Kasich et al.
Clinton's attitude toward marriage is very like his attitude toward government. Both institutions are strained and under assault. Rather than give up on either, Clinton has tried, however imperfectly, to keep them both working. Perhaps that is as much as we can expect in a time of shifting moral winds and divided opinion about the basic values of our society. Does he believe in anything? There is more coherence than may at first appear, both in his private and his public life. Joe Klein's qualified private-public spectrum -- false in one, false in the other -- may even be read backward, as it were, and with similar qualification: True in one, true in the other.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 23, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an essay on Jan. 12 about crime books set in Edinburgh referred incorrectly to a comment by Henry James about a work by William Roughead. A reader's letter received Jan. 23 points out that James died in 1916, before the appearance of Roughead's 1924 book, "The Fatal Countess and Other Studies." James expressed his admiration of Roughead in an exchange of letters between 1913 and 1915. (This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.)
Because of a production error, a picture on Jan. 19 showing Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton in 1982 was printed in mirror image. Hillary Clinton should appear at the left.

HEADLINE: Paying Our Dues Won't Fix the U.N. Staff

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your lament in the Jan. 6 editorial "America's Obligation to the U.N." that "an early retirement program for a few hundred U.N. staff members considered less productive was stalled by a lack of funds" leaves the impression that if the United States would simply pay its dues, then funds would be available to implement this worthwhile initiative. 
 In fact, the early separation program exemplifies what is wrong with the United States-led approach to United Nations reform. Who took advantage of this "golden handshake"? For the most part not the "dead wood," but rather people who had grown disenchanted with the system and saw an opportunity to move on. Those international civil servants accustomed to long lunches and comfortable in the knowledge that harder-working colleagues will take up their slack have little incentive to leave.
Young, dedicated and hard-working staff members are also leaving in droves as a result of the United States-imposed financial crisis. It is now routine for valuable non-permanent staff to be offered contracts whose duration is one month. This is not the way to run a corner candy store, let alone the "World Organization." But whose fault is it? United Nations reform needs to be viewed in ways other than the "bottom line." Reducing staff and costs will not necessarily result in a strengthened and more efficient United Nations -- just a smaller and less expensive one.

HEADLINE: A Gold Rush From Software Reinvigorates Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Awash in new, high-paying technology jobs, Silicon Valley is in the midst of its most remarkable economic boom in two decades.
And thanks in part to the rise of the Internet and the scramble to exploit it commercially, the area's growth has been accompanied by a shift in new jobs from computer and semiconductor manufacturing to software development. 
 That change has led some economists to argue that the region south of San Francisco may finally find some stability, escaping the economic roller coaster that has led in the past to seemingly inevitable collapses after good times.
Silicon Valley, which has become the center for much of the innovation underlying the semiconductor, personal computer and now the Internet industries, added roughly 50,000 jobs in 1996, while average real wages grew 5.1 percent after accounting for inflation -- more than five times the national average.
This striking growth, fueled in part by a 73 percent spurt in venture-capital spending, is part of an exceptionally positive portrait painted by an annual review of the region's economy and its quality of life, to be issued on Monday.
"The good news is that in the last four years we have created 125,000 new jobs," said Becky Morgan, president of Joint Venture Silicon Valley, the business and community group that publishes the economic report.
By Joint Venture's parameters, the valley is centered between San Jose and Palo Alto in Santa Clara County. It runs northwest from Santa Clara County into San Mateo County and into southern Alameda County, on the eastern side of the bay, and includes part of Santa Cruz County to the south.
Particularly evident in 1996 was the imprint that the rise of the Internet has left on Silicon Valley. The area is headquarters for the leading companies in the computer-networking business. The 30 largest such companies more than doubled their employment from 1991 to 1996.
For example, Cisco Systems, the San Jose maker of computers that route data over the Internet, hired about 50 employees a week throughout 1996. The company has continued to expand and now has 800 to 1,000 job openings -- the same number as early in 1996.
Still, it is the growth of software companies like Netscape Communications and Oracle that suggests the region's new structure. Traditionally a manufacturing center, it is being transformed.
"The structure of the economy has changed," said Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, a Palo Alto consulting firm, which prepared the report. "There is much more software, which suggests that the dependence of the hardware industries on the capital-spending cycle may be broken."
Several economists, while remaining cautious, pointed out that because software was less sensitive than computers and chips to corporations' purchasing cycles, the current structural shift might leave the valley far more insulated from the nation's economic ups and downs than heretofore.
"There are indications that the good times will keep rolling for a while," said Stephen Roach, chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Company. But, he cautioned, "I worry about a potential financial bust on the Internet, or a culmination of a software product cycle."
The rise in the software business has brought sharply higher pay in the high-cost region. In 1996, the average wage totaled $43,510 (measured in 1995 dollars), compared with $28,040 nationally. Average annual earnings among software companies, the highest-ranked category, came to $78,400 in 1995. That compared with $74,300 in the semiconductor industry.
The only time the region had added more jobs was in 1978-79, when Santa Clara County alone gained 53,000 positions. That was the period when the modern semiconductor industry became a global force.
The current period of economic strength is all the more remarkable because only four years ago, before the emergence of the Internet, Silicon Valley faced what some described as a midlife crisis, losing factory jobs and venture capital.
Last year, almost all doubts about the area's future seemed to have dissipated, partly because of the explosive growth of "gazelle companies" -- businesses with more than $1 million in revenue and an annual compound growth rate of 20 percent for four straight years. In 1996, the number of these gazelle companies rose to 73; it had been near 40 for the four previous years.
This strong growth has also created a gold rush atmosphere for companies seeking the best talent.
"It's been a firestorm for us," said Stephen Combs, managing partner at Juntunen Combs Poirier, a San Francisco-based executive recruiting firm. "Companies are making what can only be called obscene offers for the best people."
As might be expected, the new growth has also renewed anxiety about its consequences. "1997 is going to be the year that growth concerns re-emerge as a pivotal issue," said Steve Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, an economic research center in Palo Alto. "The rental rates have gone up, and the physical and social limits to growth will be debated anew."
Rental rates increased 23 percent from 1992 to 1996. Median income were up 14 percent in that period.
Since 1992, Silicon Valley has added 125,000 jobs, but only 26,000 new housing units.
To be sure, this has all happened there before, and those who have studied the matter predict that the region's growth will continue to be strong.
"I'm very cautious about saying there are any fundamental limits," said Anno Saxenian, professor of regional planning at the University of California at Berkeley. "If quality of life was all that mattered, everyone would be living in Portland right now."

HEADLINE: The Shift Toward Self-Reliance in the Welfare System

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
During the Depression, when so many people felt vulnerable to poverty, America developed a "one for all, all for one" economic system. New government safety nets like Social Security and welfare came into existence, and corporations took on new responsibilties for the well-being of their workers.
But now this communal system is giving way to a do-it-yourself approach that increasingly requires Americans to make their own way. The proposals last week to revamp Social Security, so that workers finance their own retirements rather than those of their elders, are the latest manifestation of this shift in the American ethic toward greater self-reliance, even for those who don't make ends meet. 
 Other signs are the proliferation of 401(K) savings plans as a replacement for guaranteed corporate pensions, the pressure on American workers to pay health insurance premiums once covered by companies, the rise of special schools and other alternatives to public school education, and the new hurdles to staying on welfare, with the message that the poor can and should lift themselves from poverty.
"We are growing up and we are getting out of the European mode, which is more the welfare state," said Dale Jorgensen, a Harvard economist who applauds the trend. "People are becoming more and more affluent and better educated, and as they do they move toward a more traditional American position of self-sufficiency."
For Mr. Jorgensen and other advocates, a set of propositions has emerged to justify the new system they welcome. The United States in the 1990's is prospering and outdistancing its industrial competitors, particularly Japan and Germany, with their more communal systems, they say. That is largely because so many Americans, less and less certain that the system will protect them, are being forced to rely on themselves. That self-reliance results in "maximum incentives to work," which produce maximum economic growth.
But others say this line of reasoning is a rationalization offered by people who no longer want to share what they have with the growing number of Americans whose incomes are falling behind. The many Americans who have prospered, said Frank Levy, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, "have caught onto the fact that they can do better if there is no redistribution of income, and since power correlates with income, they are in a position to push the argument."
During the Depression, he recalled, many feared falling into poverty, even if they never did, so they were willing to accept legislation creating benefits that they might someday need for themselves. Now the many Americans who are prospering are less willing to share their prosperity with those who are not as well off, even as income inequality widens, Mr. Levy said.
That worries Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics who, as a young man, witnessed the communal approach take shape in the Depression years. "What I am sad about," he said, "is that just when the marketplace is creating more and more income inequality and we need an efficient, limited welfare state, we are dismantling it."
When Americans are asked about these issues, they tend to give conflicting answers, said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of DYG Inc., a polling organization. "People feel no one should get something for nothing," he said, "but they also support entitlement programs" that give them back more in benefits than they pay out in taxes. "They are holding two opposing views, without being aware of it," he said. "They have not yet been forced to make a connection."
The opposing views, many experts say, are rooted in very different philosophies. One holds that people can control their own well-being, and through education, training and hard work, can prosper. If they do not, it is their own fault. "We grant adults more dignity when we grant them the right and the obligation to be responsible for their own actions," said David G. Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute.
The other view holds that free markets take unpredictable turns, sometimes plunging even the educated and affluent into hardship beyond their control, not to mention the less skilled and the poor. "When times are relatively good and the world is at peace, there is a tendency to say, 'I can do it on my own,' " said Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "But when the next Soviet Union arises, or a huge problem develops in how advanced medical technology can be afforded by the average person, then expect a communal response."
Meanwhile, self-responsibility takes hold. The signposts are numerous. The Social Security system, until now, has required each generation of workers to finance, through payroll taxes, the retirement years of their elders. The new proposals would shunt at least some of this tax money into individual accounts that workers would then use to help pay for their own retirements.
In this spirit, the proliferating 401(K) savings plans are gradually replacing corporate pension systems that obligated companies to guarantee workers a certain level of retirement income. Under the rubric of tightening up to survive intense competition, only about 35 percent of the nation's companies pay for all their employees' health insurance, down from 75 percent in 1980.
And companies, withdrawing job security, regularly tell their employees they must take responsibility to train and retrain themselves so they can jump to other jobs elsewhere, if the ones they hold disappear. The proliferation of new jobs in smaller companies, rather than in the Fortune 500 corporations that once were the source of most of the job security and rich benefit plans, accentuates this trend.
Even the proposals to revamp the Consumer Price Index are a step in the direction of self-reliance. A commission of economists appointed by a Senate committee concluded last month that the index overstated actual inflation. If that view is embraced by Congress, then Social Security benefits would no longer rise as much as they do now under a system that links annual increases in these benefits to increases in the C.P.I. Retirees would have to cover the new shortfall with their own money.
But the shift to self-reliance tends to separate the affluent from the less affluent, the educated and skilled from those who are less so, the healthy who are less expensive to insure from the sick. Congress, for example, recently approved an experiment in medical savings accounts that permit people to put aside money in tax-deductible accounts to pay some health care bills, and then pocket the money free of taxes, if it is not spent on care. That encourages people who are healthy and wealthy to pay less into the common pool for health insurance, said Paul Starr, a Princeton sociologist.
Similarly, the rise of charter schools, now legalized in 25 states, and of other alternative school arrangements supported with taxpayer dollars, tends to draw the most gifted, least difficult students away from the public school system. "What we are witnessing in the shift to taking care of yourself," Mr. Starr said, "is the secession of the people who are the best risks and the most advantaged from the rest of the population."

HEADLINE: Turning to the Property Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Since before he was elected in 1994, Gov. George E. Pataki has studied with more than a little interest the successes of his Republican colleague to the south, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, whose tax-cutting fervor catapulted her from obscurity to an upset victory in 1993 and national political prominence.
But in proposing on Saturday to use billions of state dollars to reduce local property taxes over the coming four years, Mr. Pataki also seems to have viewed Mrs. Whitman's experience as a cautionary tale. 
 From almost the moment in 1993 when Mrs. Whitman called for cutting New Jersey's income taxes by 30 percent, Democrats have charged that she was setting in motion a dangerous dynamic where the state would be forced to reduce assistance to local governments, putting pressure on them to increase property taxes to maintain essential services, mainly education.
The reality has been somewhat more complex. Late last year, Mrs. Whitman released figures showing that property tax collections had actually slowed somewhat in 1996 from previous years. But what Mrs. Whitman did not mention was that in many towns, tax collections had increased more than in previous years, and 43 had double-digit increases. So the debate has raged on, with Democrats continuing to accuse her of shifting costs onto the backs of property owners.
New York Democrats have leveled those same charges against Mr. Pataki ever since he proposed in 1994, and pushed through the Legislature in 1995, a plan to reduce state income taxes an average of 25 percent. Like Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Pataki released statistics suggesting that such dire predictions were unfounded, noting that property taxes increased in 1995 at the slowest rates in over a decade.
But Democrats say Mr. Pataki has forced the state to freeze or reduce its assistance to local governments and services. A result, they say, has been higher tuition at public colleges, higher transit fares and higher property taxes. While the first two problems might affect mainly urban residents who have traditionally voted Democratic, high property taxes strike at the core of the Governor's political base: suburban homeowners.
"There has been a tax shift," said Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan. "He's vulnerable on real property taxes because the suburbs are his base." She said the Assembly was developing its own figures to bolster its contention.
Mr. Pataki contends, and many economists agree, that cuts in state income tax rates have had little effect on local property taxes. But with the plan he released on Saturday, the Governor can now also argue that even if there have been any unhealthy effects from his income tax cut, he has the antidote.
Under his plan, which will be part of his 1997-98 budget, Mr. Pataki would give homeowners a $30,000 tax exemption -- $50,000 for people over 65 -- that would be used to reduce the taxable value of their homes. Local governments would calculate school taxes on the discounted value of the home and send that bill to the homeowner. Then it would calculate the taxes on the home before the exemption was applied. It would then send a bill to the state to make up the difference. That way, school districts would not lose any money from the program.
The plan would be phased in over four years, costing the state only $110 million in the coming fiscal year, but growing to $1.7 billion by 2001. When fully in place, the plan would reduce the average homeowner's property tax bill by 27 percent, or $450 a year, the Governor said. Mr. Pataki has not made clear how he would pay for this plan other than by relying on an improving economy.
The plan would provide less tax relief to New York City homeowners than to homeowners in other parts of the state, largely because the city's residential property tax rate is lower than in many suburbs or rural towns; the city relies more heavily on other taxes, like those on commercial and industrial properties, to pay for schools. The tax exemption would be available only for homes and condominiums and not for commercial or industrial property or cooperative apartments.
Mr. Pataki said there were no political calculations behind his latest tax-cut plan. But he clearly seems sensitive to the Democrats' charges of tax shifting, as was evidenced in a news conference on Saturday. Without having been asked a question, he testily told reporters, "A lot of you have been printing the nonsensical rhetoric of the Assembly about how the income taxes have shifted the burden to the property tax."
"There has not," he continued, "been a shift of the tax burden, as we have led the nation in cutting income taxes."
The property tax, most of which is used to finance education, is probably the most vilified tax in the state. Though Mr. Pataki and other Republicans often rail against high state taxes, New Yorkers pay close to the national average in state taxes, as calculated as a percentage of income. But when local property taxes are factored in, New York shoots to the top of the list. Indeed, during the last decade, local property taxes rose about 6 percent a year on average, nearly double the rate of inflation.
In many towns, taxpayers have begun to revolt, rejecting more and more local school budgets in recent years, said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. Such taxpayer anger has pressured school districts to keep the lid on expenses, which has resulted in significantly smaller property tax increases than in the 1980's, he said.
The anger has registered in Albany. Though not as visceral as the taxpayer revolt in California during the 1970's that resulted in Proposition 13, taxpayer protests in New York have led to a host of bills sponsored by lawmakers from both parties. Some of those bills even resemble Proposition 13, which placed tight restrictions on the taxation powers of local school boards.
One of Mr. Pataki's proposals would prohibit school districts from raising property taxes by more than the inflation rate, or 4 percent, whichever is lower. School districts could circumvent the cap only if two-thirds of the voters supported them in raising taxes.
With so many property tax plans now in play, and with the Governor having elevated the issue to the top of the legislative agenda, leaders in both houses of the Legislature now predict that some form of property tax relief seems inevitable this year -- even though no one has explained yet how the state will pay for it.
"It's just a question of how much and in what specific areas," said the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer. "It's where the public is."

HEADLINE: U.S. Machine Tool Orders Fell in November

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
United States manufacturers decreased orders for machine tools in November for the second month in a row, while demand from abroad rebounded, industry figures show.
United States orders for machine tools dropped 22.8 percent during the month to an estimated $647.0 million, the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said today. In October, machine tool orders totaled an estimated $838 million. Demand fell in four of the five regions the industry groups use to chart United States machine tool orders, everywhere except the South. 
 For 1996 to date, estimated consumption totaled $7.7 billion. No comparison with 1995 year-to-date figures is possible because the industry groups switched their method of calculating orders in August 1996.
Machine tools are used to shape and assemble metal in products ranging from diesel engines to dishwashers, and orders tend to decline during November.
The industry estimates are extrapolated from actual orders placed by American manufacturers with United States and foreign companies. They are intended to give a more complete outlook than actual orders, which are lower because not all companies report their transactions.
Actual machine tool orders declined 6.9 percent to $420.79 million in November from a revised $451.95 million in October, the industry groups said. Total units ordered fell 7 percent to 3,108 during the month from 3,342 in October.
Demand for machine tools from abroad, counted separately from domestic orders, rose 4.8 percent to $41.7 million in November from $41.2 million during October.

HEADLINE: Look to Weather for Clues to Malaria Comeback

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Malaria Makes a Comeback, and Is More Deadly Than Ever" (front page, Jan. 8) captures the multiple factors -- population movements, chemical resistance, lapsed public health vigilance and environmental change -- influencing the resurgence of malaria. Mosquitoes, the transmitters of the disease, are indeed quintessential opportunists and adapt readily in disturbed environments. 
 As co-author of the World Health Organization report discussed in your article, I offer several recent findings. Consistent with model projections that global warming could hasten the geographic spread of malaria and dengue fever, these devastating diseases are now occurring at high altitudes in Latin America, central Africa and Asia. Cerebral malaria has occurred in Nairobi, Kenya, while dengue fever is found in the mountains around San Jose, Costa Rica.
Moreover, highland malaria and dengue fever are occurring in the context of upward migration of plants on many continents and summit glacial retreat in Latin America, Europe, central Africa and Asia. A recent study in the journal Nature confirmed that the freezing levels in the mountains have indeed shifted upward about 500 feet since 1970, representing a warming of close to 2 degrees Fahrenheit.
As we enter a year of debate concerning climate change (the convention will be held in Kyoto, Japan, in December), it is prudent to examine the potential consequences associated with continued warming and climate instability. Your article says that malaria "hinders economic development"; epidemics are growing ever more costly in terms of health, development, trade and tourism.
While the resurgence of infectious disease has multiple social, biological and environmental roots, meteorological factors may play an increasing role in the future. We may be vastly underestimating the social and economic damages associated with epidemics and extreme weather events as well as the potential benefits to society as a whole of changing our environmental and energy policies.

HEADLINE: In Trying to Get Into Cuba, CNN Hits Snags at Home

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 12

 BODY:
As president of CNN, Tom Johnson has been through his share of tough negotiations with governments before. But nothing, not even dealing with China's Stalinist bureaucracy when he sought to set up a news office in Beijing, prepared him for the difficulties of getting permission to open a bureau in Havana.
 
 This time, though, the problem is not a recalcitrant Communist dictatorship: Cuba granted the network permission to begin operations in Havana more than two months ago. Instead, it is the Clinton Administration that is hemming and hawing as it debates the wisdom of allowing American news organizations to establish a permanent foothold in Cuba, the object of an American economic embargo for 34 years.
 "This has been a very long and difficult process, and of course we are somewhat concerned, to put it mildly," Mr. Johnson said in an interview here Friday. "That the United States Government would resist in any way the opening of an independent news bureau by an independent news organization seems to us to run counter to all that this Government represents."
 Administration officials, however, say they are responding in part to what they describe as concerns expressed by "constituencies" interested in Cuban affairs. That, they said, includes rival news organizations worried that CNN will gain a competitive advantage and distressed that Fidel Castro will have the right to grant or withhold access to Cuba to American news organizations.
 That issue came to a crossroads Friday, when Mr. Johnson flew here from Atlanta to meet with David Lawrence Jr., publisher of The Miami Herald. The meeting came about after Mr. Johnson sent a letter to Mr. Lawrence on Tuesday, criticizing him for conducting what he called a "campaigning to convince the U.S. Government to block" CNN's request to open a Havana bureau.
 "I am astounded and dismayed that for purely competitive reasons you would call upon the U.S. Government to hinder CNN's legitimate news coverage efforts," Mr. Johnson wrote. "Your stance is contrary to your long record of support for a free press and the First Amendment."
 CNN says it is required to obtain a United States Government "license" to open operations in Cuba because the economic embargo, which was codified and extended last year by the Helms-Burton Act, strictly limits, and in many cases prohibits altogether, the sums American citizens and corporations can spend in Cuba. The network's bid to open a Havana bureau has been endorsed by press groups like the American Society of Newspaper Editors and the Committee to Protect Journalists.
 If successful, CNN would be the first American news organization to have a bureau in Havana since the Cuban Government expelled the last resident Associated Press correspondent in 1969. Under the present system, American news agencies, newspapers, magazines and television networks must apply for short-term visas to cover Cuban news events case by case.
 In a telephone interview after the meeting with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lawrence said that The Miami Herald had never opposed CNN's effort to open an office in Cuba and that "I think he understands that now." CNN executives were under that impression, Mr. Lawrence said, because "they misheard or misunderstood some things in Washington" arising from The Herald's own efforts to open a Havana bureau. CNN is owned by Time Warner.
 "My concern for several years now is the Fidel Castro will ultimately 'choose' whom he will let cover Cuba, who will get a news bureau," Mr. Lawrence said, reading from a letter he wrote in November to James Dobbins, the National Security Council director for Latin America. "If we were shut out while other U.S. media outlets emerge in Cuba, that would run deeply counter to my sense of democracy and fairness."
 The Herald, which is owned by Knight-Ridder, has long sought increased access to Cuba, but has often been thwarted because Cuban officials object tot he substance and tone of the newspaper's coverage. More than half of all Cuban-Americans live in South Florida, and coverage of Cuban affairs is a major part of The Herald's news coverage and the backbone of El Nuevo Herald, its daily Spanish-language edition.
 "We think the news media ought to be able to report from Cuba, and we think the newspaper that for decades has covered Cuba more closely than anyone else and with more resources ought to be there as early as possible," Mr. Lawrence said. But, he added, "we never opposed CNN and we stand as tall as anyone for the freest access to covering anything anywhere in the world."
 Of CNN's competitors, ABC said it had no comment on the issue, and a spokesman for NBC was not available for comment. But Lane Venardos, CBS's vice president for news and special events, said he supported the CNN bid and hoped it would help open the door for other American news organizations. "We want to be in there, too, and our interest goes beyond CBS News to include our cable network in Spanish," CBS TeleNoticias, Mr. Venardos said.
 Most Cuban exile leaders here has insisted Cuba must grant access to radio and TV Marti - Spanish-language outlets owned and operated by the United States Government - as part of any arrangement in which private media organizations would open offices in Havana.
 Cuban exile groups have been especially critical of CNN's coverage of Cuba, in part because of the friendship between Ted Turner, the network's founder, and Mr. Castro. Mr. Johnson dismissed accusations that CNN is soft on Cuba as "offensive personally and professionally," saying "we are not pulling any punches in our coverage."
 Even if all this opposition is overcome, there still remains the task of winning over the White House. "The issue remains as it was," an Administration official said late Friday. "CNN made an application and it is under consideration. There's no requirement to make a decision."
 Mr. Johnson said he had already talked to Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his designated successor, Madeleine Albright, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
What Bibi Got

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Benjamin Netanyahu spent most of the last few months trying to show the world that he was negotiating with the Palestinians in good faith. Now he faces the job for which he was elected: either show Israelis that he can give them a peace with security for themselves and their country, or in decent time tell them that it cannot be done, not now and probably not for many years to come.
Mr. Netanyahu said before he was elected he would work within the framework of the Oslo agreement signed by the defeated Labor Government, and which he mistrusted. That meant giving up major West Bank towns, including Hebron. He got somewhat more security for those 400 Hebron Jews who believe it is not a crime for Jews to live in one of Judaism's holy cities. 
 But to make future talks worth holding, he needed conditions on how to go on from Hebron -- specific and internationally publicized steps of reciprocity from the Palestinians. To get that he paid a price.
Assuming the agreement is approved by Yasir Arafat, who has been walking away from it for about two months, Mr. Netanyahu agrees to a final deployment from the West Bank by September 1998 -- almost a year before he wanted.
There is nothing approaching agreement on how much of the West Bank the Israelis will leave. Eventually that and Jerusalem will be the make-or-break issues.
Mr. Netanyahu and his supporters see territorial negotiation as a matter of survival -- time to spot and mobilize against attack. He is likely to insist on military control of at least 40 percent of the West Bank outside the towns -- much high ground and almost all the Jordan Valley. Labor would have settled for lots less -- how much it never said.
Still, if Likud signs any territorial agreement it is in effect consenting to creation of an independent Palestinian state. Mr. Netanyahu can call it an "entity" if he wishes. He can call it gefilte fish. It will be a state.
But he got what he needed to continue talking peace and keep good faith -- with his own people. That is the conditions of reciprocity that would make the talks believable to the 56 percent of Israeli Jews who voted for him.
They are set down in a "note for the record" by the U.S. team led by Dennis Ross. They commit the Palestinians to do things they promised at Oslo but have never carried out, nor been under any world pressure to do so.
Israeli sources say that as of late yesterday they were:
* The dismantling of the terrorist superstructure in Palestinian-controlled territory. That either means disarming Hamas, Islamic Jihad and similar groups or means nothing.
* Really, truly, at last scrapping the death-to-Israel covenant of the Palestinian movement.
* Reducing Palestinian armed forces to the one police organization of 18,000 allowed by Oslo -- not the half-dozen military groups that Mr. Arafat created with 45,000 men.
* Extraditing terrorists in Palestinian custody. Twelve of the 27 terrorists on Israel's wanted list are wearing Mr. Arafat's police uniforms now and most of the others walking free.
* Closing offices outside Palestinian-controlled territory. Most important: no longer using Orient House in Jerusalem as a foreign office.
* Stopping the constant verbal incitements against Israel by Palestinian officials, Mr. Arafat on down.
If Mr. Netanyahu gives up any of these conditions he may kill chances of majority support in his Cabinet.
For its part, Israel commits itself to a preliminary redeployment and the beginning of final-round talks, both within two months. It agrees to consider these steps: stopping closure of its borders against Palestinians as an economic punishment, release of current "security" prisoners, free passage between Gaza and other Palestinian-controlled territory, and a Gaza international airport.
Egypt and other Arab states will have fascinating fits if Mr. Arafat lives up to reciprocity conditions. They know that it would remove Palestinians from the constant state of political warfare against Israel that has been basic Arab strategy for a half-century.
So I doubt Mr. Arafat will live up to reciprocity conditions for long. But whatever he decides, ending the anti-Israeli political war will remain an underlying condition for ever turning peace talks into peace reality. That has been written in blood, so long.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Touches High vs. Mark After U.S. Support Is Affirmed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar touched a 28-month high against the German mark and rose in most other currency trading yesterday after Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin reaffirmed his support for a strong dollar.
It was the first time this year that a Clinton Administration official has reiterated the longstanding United States position on the dollar, and came against a backdrop of growing global demand for the currency. 
 The dollar was also helped by Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of the Group of 10 central bank governors group, who said current exchange rate levels between the dollar and European currencies were not any cause for concern. His comments in Basel, Switzerland, were interpreted as a signal to buy dollars.
Both Mr. Rubin's and Mr. Tietmeyer's remarks helped the dollar build on gains made on Friday, when the Labor Department reported a healthy growth in jobs last month and bolstered a view that the United States economy was vibrant while Japan, Germany and much of Europe look relatively vulnerable.
The dollar is now at the strongest level against the mark and Swiss franc in more than two years and hovering near a 45-month high against the yen.
"There's a growing realization that the economy here in the United States is being managed awfully well, combined with greater degrees of disappointment elsewhere in the industrialized world," said Kevin Raphael, manager of foreign exchange at the New York branch of Rabobank Nederland, a large Dutch bank. "Money keeps finding its way to the United States."
The dollar traded as high as 1.5925 marks in intraday dealings, the highest since August 1994, before it settled in late New York trading at 1.5886 marks, up from 1.5855 marks on Friday. The dollar rose to 116.44 Japanese yen from 116.06 yen and was unchanged at 1.3765 Swiss francs. The British pound slipped to $1.6739 from $1.6807.
Mr. Rubin's remarks at a conference in Washington became the main focus of the day. Asked by reporters to comment on the dollar's strength, he said: "Our comment is the same that it's always been. We believe a strong dollar is in our economic interest."

HEADLINE: Bonds Fall In Advance Of New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday, as investors awaited reports on consumer prices and retail sales.
Signs that the economy continues to be robust have weighed on the market recently. On Friday, bond prices tumbled by more than one and a half points following a report that twice as many jobs as expected were added to the nation's payrolls last month. Bonds later recovered more than a third of their losses. 
 Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the market was more cautious. "People are playing the market from a more defensive posture than they were two weeks ago," he said.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32, to 95 20/32; the bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.85 percent, from 6.84 percent on Friday.
There was some short-covering and some portfolio shuffling, but the potential for gains was limited as investors used any rise in price to sell before the release today of data on consumer prices and retail sales.
"A lot of investors who are watching things would like to reduce their exposure, because signals of a strong economy are starting to stack up," said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at the New York office of I.D.E.A., a British financial consulting firm.
Investors fear that such signals -- which could suggest a revival of inflation -- make it more likely that Federal Reserve policy makers will raise short-term interest rates when they meet early next month.
Bond prices fell yesterday even as the dollar continued to climb. The strength of the dollar had bolstered hopes in the bond market that foreign investors would continue to buy Treasury securities. But some are now growing skeptical.
"We are at a crossroads," Mr. Regan, the Josephthal strategist, said, "in that continued foreign investment in the Treasury market may not be as significant as we saw last year.
"With so much much certainty swirling, few people are willing to step up to the plate," Mr. Regan added.
Given the negative mood of the market, heavy issuance of new corporate debt is also expected to weigh upon Treasury prices. Some $5 billion of corporate debt is expected to be priced this week, led by a $2 billion to $3 billion offering from U S West; $1.3 billion offered by Tenet Healthcare and $1 billion by Tokyo Electric.
Elsewhere in the market, interest rates at yesterday's Treasury auction were mixed, with the results about average and with a slightly positive tone.
The average discount rate for a three-month bill was 5.04 percent, up a couple of basis points from the previous week's results, while the average rate for the six-month bill remained unchanged at 5.11 percent. Traders said demand was a bit softer than last week, but still healthy.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Income Up at Morgan and Nationsbank

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Several of the largest American banks, including J. P. Morgan & Company and the Nationsbank Corporation, said yesterday that their earnings rose strongly in the fourth quarter.
Nationsbank, the fourth-largest bank in the country, said its profits surged 24 percent, while J. P. Morgan, the fifth-largest, said its earnings rose 14.5 percent. Earnings at the National City Corporation rose 48 percent, while those at Barnett Banks Inc. increased 8.3 percent. 
 "They were all at least as good as expected," said Moshe Orenbuch, a bank analyst at Sanford Bernstein Inc. "Revenue growth has slowed, but remained healthy, and expenses were pretty much under control."
Analysts said they expected American banks to continue their five years of record earnings, benefiting from a steadily rising economy, a bull market in stocks and cost controls.
Even losses on consumer loans, which have been a drain on earnings in recent quarters, may show signs of improving as banks tighten underwriting standards, they said.
The results at J. P. Morgan, which reported strong earnings in nonlending activities like securities underwriting and trading, suggest that other banks with big securities operations, like Citicorp and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, are set to report healthy profits. J. P. Morgan, said net income rose to $419 million, or $2.04 a share, from $366 million, or $1.80, in the last three months of 1995. That beat analysts' estimates of $1.69 a share, according to a survey of 17 analysts by I.B.E.S. International Inc.
In the last few years, Morgan, which is based in New York, has become one of the top 10 players in securities underwriting, advising companies on mergers and other businesses once reserved for securities firms like Merrill Lynch & Company.
Securities trading revenue surged 39 percent in the quarter, to $512 million. Revenue from proprietary trading -- in which the bank bets its own money -- jumped threefold, to $76 million. Equities trading revenue jumped 77 percent, to $69 million. Investment banking fees jumped 75 percent, to $277 million. Net interest revenue from loans and other investments, by contrast, fell to $484 million from $488 million.
J. P. Morgan shares rose $2.75, to $102.50 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Nationsbank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C, said its earnings gains were driven by increased lending and fee-based businesses and by cost cuts. Nationsbank said net income rose to $632 million, or $2.19 a share, from $510 million, or $1.87 a share, in the corresponding period last year.
Wall Street expected $2.13 a share, based on the average estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
The bank said net interest income, or income from lending, rose 12 percent, to $1.61 billion. Noninterest income -- including revenue from fees for mortgages, investment banking and other services -- increased 13 percent, to $958 million.
Nationsbank shares fell 37.5 cents, to $102.875 yesterday on the Big Board.
National City, which is based in Cleveland, said net income rose to $191 million, or 85 cents a share, from $129 million, or 58 cents, in the last three months of 1995. Analysts had predicted earnings of 84 cents a share, according to a Zacks survey. Barnett, which is based in Jacksonville, Fla., said net income rose to $149.8 million, or 77 cents a share, from $138.3 million, or 69 cents, in the last three months of 1995. That exceeded the average analyst expectation of 74 cents a share, according to a Zacks survey.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
1996 changed the way Americans think about stock funds.

BYLINE: By Edward Wyatt 

 BODY:
IT might not have been the biggest year ever for the mutual fund industry, but 1996 certainly transformed how Americans think about mutual funds that invest in the stock market.
Including $13.5 billion of net inflows to equity funds in December, as estimated yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, mutual funds that invest in stocks received $223 billion in new cash from investors in 1996. 
 That surpassed by more than 70 percent both the previous record for annual equity cash flows, set in 1993 at $129.6 billion, and 1995's net inflows of $128.1 billion. For stock and bond funds combined, last year's inflow was $237 billion; the record was $243 billion in 1993.
Most surprising was the degree to which the level of fund flows held up in the second half of the year, even after several bouts of short-term stock market volatility caused net inflows to drop considerably from the first half pace.
In each of the year's first five months, monthly net inflows exceeded $20 billion, a level never reached before this year. By comparison, December's estimated $13.5 billion of cash inflows seemed relatively small. But while December's total was the second lowest of the year, it nevertheless ranked in the top 20 months of all time.
"In the first half of the year, there was an enormous amount of money chasing performance," said Jessica Bibliowicz, an executive vice president at Smith Barney and head of its mutual funds group. After the best-performing funds of 1995 -- those investing in small-cap stocks -- tumbled in the market downturn of June and July, some investors got spooked, Ms. Bibliowicz said. "But cash flows from other types of investors, like those in 401(k) plans, gained strength through the year."
Bond funds, too, seemed to gain a bit of strength throughout the year. Although monthly flows wavered between positive and negative for much of the second half of 1996, the total flows for each of the last two quarters were positive, with the December's flows alone more than four times those of the third quarter.
In December, bond funds took in an estimated $3.5 billion, the most since January of last year. Last month's flows included sizable conversions of bank trust assets to mutual funds, the institute said. But excluding the conversions, the estimated flow to bond funds in December was nevertheless in line with November's inflows of $1.3 billion.
For the entire year, net cash flow to bond funds totaled $13.9 billion. That was higher than in 1995, when bond funds suffered net outflows of $4.7 billion, but was far short of the record for annual inflows, set in 1993 at $113.8 billion.
"It strikes me that much of what we saw last year was reflective of relative returns," with the stock market greatly outperforming bonds, said John Rea, chief economist of the Investment Company Institute.
Ms. Bibliowicz agreed. "Cash flows in the second half reflect a broader diversity of funds," she said. "More people are interested in asset allocation funds" and other, more conservative products.
Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter published in Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates that so far in January, that trend has continued, with more conservative growth and income funds getting the largest share of new cash. So far in January, cash has flowed into equity funds at a monthly rate of about $20 billion.
But Charles Biderman, president of Trim Tabs Financial Services, which publishes the newsletter, said he still wondered about the continued sustainability of cash flows. "I think by the end of the month, flows will fall off again," he said.
Some analysts think even December's estimates of cash flow are overstated. AMG Data Services had been estimating that equity funds took in no net new cash in December and might have suffered outflows of up to $2 billion. Robert Adler, president of AMG, said yesterday that he stood by that estimate and questioned whether the I.C.I.'s report accurately reflected the effect of fund company distributions.
Both AMG Data and the I.C.I. say their estimates exclude the effects of dividends and capital gains distributions that are paid to investors near the end of the year and often reinvested.
Mr. Adler -- while he is still awaiting reports from three large fund groups, Merrill Lynch, Franklin/ Templeton and American Funds -- said, "I am very confident of our numbers." The I.C.I will report its final report on December cash flows near the end of the month.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Academy's Role In Renewal of Downtown

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
For many years after its revival in the 1970's, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's hulking neo-Renaissance opera house floated like a cultural and financial island on the outskirts of Downtown Brooklyn.
Even as it forged an international reputation as an incubator of the avant-garde, featuring works by Robert Wilson and Peter Brook, critics and supporters both agreed that its success did little for the blighted area around it, scarred with shuttered stores and graffiti. 
 William Murray, a spokesman for the academy, remembered that as recently as a few years ago, "you couldn't even get a decent cup of coffee around here."
But in the last decade, millions of development dollars have begun to transform the area. With the changes has come a debate over what role BAM, or other urban cultural centers like the one being built in Newark, can play in improving their surroundings and attracting commercial growth.
At best, the relationship is indirect, experts say. "I think it has been a catalyst in the area," said Ron Schiffman, a former New York City Planning Commissioner and director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development. "But it's kind of a chicken-and-egg thing. At one time, both the neighborhood and the academy flourished. When the area decayed, it decayed. It's back now, and the neighborhood around it is starting to change."
Even critics agree that in the last decade, the academy's president and executive producer, Harvey Lichtenstein, has directed more of its programming and its business toward Brooklyn, drawing on the large number of professional jazz musicians in nearby Fort Greene and spending more in the borough.
The academy is now undergoing a $20 million city-financed reconstruction project to put in a cafe, a bookstore and movie theaters, which Mr. Lichtenstein hopes will make it more of a community gathering place or, in his words, "a hangout center."
Business owners in the area, like Michael Ayoub, who runs Cucina restaurant on Fifth Avenue, are waiting to see if those hanging out also stay to eat and spend money in Brooklyn.
"Already, when there's a big BAM performance, my restaurant is packed at 5:30 in the afternoon," Mr. Ayoub said. "It makes me feel like an ambassador for Brooklyn, in a gastronomical sense."

HEADLINE: Prime Lot Near Times Sq. Is to Be Site of a New Hotel

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a deal to develop the largest remaining parcel of land in the Times Square redevelopment area, private developers will build a 35-story budget-rate hotel on what is now a parking lot on Eighth Avenue opposite the Port Authority bus terminal, state officials said yesterday.
The agreement, between government development agencies and Milstein Properties, a family-owned development company that bought the site in 1983 for $5 million -- a fraction of its present value -- would end a long and litigious battle in which the Milsteins had held out for the kinds of property tax breaks that others on the same block had received. 
 It would also resolve longstanding questions over what should be built on the site. Previous proposals have been for a merchandise mart, which some officials hoped would be built by the Kennedy family, and an apartment building.
"This is really the final piece of the 42d Street puzzle," said Charles A. Gargano, the chief economic adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki.
Mr. Gargano said the agreement, which remains at a preliminary stage with some financial conditions still to be worked out, would help anchor the revitalization of the western part of 42d Street and encourage developers to move farther west.
The prospects of expanding investment in the blocks west of Times Square were underscored in a separate announcement yesterday by the New Second Stage Theater, a production company, which said it planned to renovate the second floor of a 70-year-old Art Deco building at the northwest corner of 43d Street and Eighth Avenue. The groups said the space would be used for musicals and other productions.
Still, the agreement with the Milstein family seemed likely to provoke criticism from officials who think the city and state have already reached too far into the public treasury to lure developers to Times Square, and maintain that no more tax breaks are needed now that the neighborhood has become a magnet for large private investment.
"This property is owned by the Milsteins, who could develop it in accordance with normal land-use procedures," said State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat who has long criticized public subsidies for Times Square development. "My question is why any incentives are necessary."
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that the scale and type of subsidies had not been agreed to in final form, but that they were likely to include real estate tax abatements. The subsidies would come from the city, he said.
Mr. Gargano said the tax breaks would be smaller than other Times Square developers have received because the Milsteins will be building long after 42d Street turned the corner from its days as a symbol of urban decline.
"It will add up to some little incentives," Mr. Gargano said. "Nothing more than we have to give."
He said the agreement would contain financial incentives to encourage the Milsteins to begin construction quickly, probably by the end of the year.
"What the Giuliani administration wants is to see this project happen sooner rather than later," he said.
The Milsteins' hotel project differs from other large-scale Times Square projects -- like the office building under construction for Conde Nast, and the Disney Company's renovation of the New Amsterdam theater -- because those projects involve land and buildings that have long been owned by New York State through its powers of condemnation.
For more than a decade, the Milsteins fought in court to stave off condemnation of their site. In the process, they held title to an otherwise derelict parking lot during a time when its value skyrocketed because of the improvements and real estate investments taking place around it. In recent interviews, real estate analysts have estimated that the state would have to pay over $35 million if it sought to condemn it.
Instead, according to the officials involved in the negotiations, the Milsteins have agreed to a form of friendly takeover of their 42d Street property by the state in exchange for tax breaks and other public subsidies that will increase the profitability of its hotel once it is built. Mr. Gargano said the state would pay "a token amount" to take title to the land, and in turn the Milsteins would retain control of the property and their new building through a long-term lease with the state.
The Milstein family, headed by Paul Milstein, 74, and Seymour Milstein, 76, declined to comment through a spokeswoman yesterday. But their agreement seemed likely to bring them a highly profitable victory in their long battle.
The developers, while fighting the state's efforts to condemn their property, have repeatedly been rebuffed in their attempts to play a major role in the Times Square renewal project.
In the early 1980's, they were rejected in their bid to develop four office towers at the intersection of 42d Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue. Then, in 1995, they were passed over by the state in their bid to combine the development of their site across the Port Authority with the construction of a hotel at the northeast corner of 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
Now that they have apparently won a place in the Times Square project, Mr. Gargano said the Milsteins would be required to build a hotel that conforms to the style and business mix of the area.

HEADLINE: Serbian City Said to Rebuff Opposition On Election

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 13

 BODY:
 The local electoral commission in Serbia's second-largest city has balked at fulfilling a Government promise to honor election results and give an opposition coalition control of the city, opposition leaders said today.
The electoral commission's rebuff in Nis was symptomatic of the internal squabbling that has spread throughout Serbia's Government, Western diplomats said. 
 Several diplomats cautioned that the refusal did not necessarily mark a reversal of the Government's position. They suggested that it might signal instead a weakening of control from Belgrade and a continued rejection by hard-liners for a peaceful solution to the two-month-old political crisis in Serbia.
The decision by President Slobodan Milosevic to annul opposition victories in 14 of Serbia's largest 19 cities, including this capital, set off eight weeks of daily street protests. In the largest demonstration yet, more than 300,000 protesters filled the center of Belgrade tonight, gathering partly to celebrate the Serbian New Year.
The pressure on the Government, both internally and from Europe and the United States, has increased in recent days. Even Greece, which stood by Serbia during the Balkan war and is considered its closest ally, has called on Mr. Milosevic to honor the November vote. The economy also continues to crumble, with the Serbian currency, the dinar, steadily losing ground on the black market and most of the huge government factories working at 10 or 20 percent capacity.
"I think Serbia is on the border of financial disaster," Carl Bildt, the top international envoy in Bosnia, said today in Sarajevo.
The local electoral commission in Nis has called for a rerun of the local elections in nine Nis districts. The opposition coalition says it won 41 seats in the 70-seat city council. Serbia's Government says the coalition holds 38 seats, and the local electoral commission said today that the coalition had only 32 seats.
"There is no logic in this," said Zoran Zivkovic, leader of the opposition coalition in Nis.
The opposition today also called on the army and the police to support the protests, after reports in the independent media that hard-liners were campaigning in the Government for a crackdown.
"Top officials of the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Yugoslav United Left are demanding that the police use force to crush demonstrations in Serbia," the Zajedno coalition said in a statement, referring to the two-party alignment that runs the country.
The statement said the two parties were seeking to provoke conflicts and impose an official state of emergency in Serbia.
"The coalition therefore demands that the General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia and the Serbian Interior Ministry protect the citizens and state interests of Serbia," which it said were being "openly attacked and jeopardized" by the two governing parties, the statement said.

HEADLINE: Downtown Newark Gambles on the Arts;
A New Center Is Almost Ready, But Will Patrons Fear to Use It?

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 13

 BODY:
It is barely past sunset on a clear winter evening, when about the only thing moving in the vicinity of Newark's Military Park is a go-go dancer in a turquoise string bikini and black spikes, grinding through her desultory routine inside the Dubonnet Cocktail Lounge.
The streets are barren. The stores and coffee shops clinging to life during the day rattled down their iron cages an hour or two earlier. Traffic is sparse. 
 Inside the bar, a dozen customers sit, intent on their drinks. No one tips the dancer, prompting her to sashay off for a break muttering, "I'm wasting my time." The Dubonnet will be shuttered by 10:30.
This is the bleak nighttime face of downtown Newark, but just 300 yards down the block rises a colossus conceived in the hope of transforming the city day and night. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center, nearly completed at a cost of $165 million, is being touted as both the engine of the city's rebirth and the monument that will finally endow the Garden State with some cultural cachet outside the shadow of New York City or Philadelphia.
State officials are so enamored of the project that they were inspired to build a status symbol for it: a new, $7 million highway exit ramp off Interstate 280 to the 12-acre site. Talk to anyone involved with the Performing Arts Center and the superlatives swirl endlessly through each sentence like confetti:
It will be the last great performing center built in this millennium. Luciano and Whitney and Bruce will perform regularly. Newark will resemble Paris.
"Our aspiration is to grow into an institution that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Lincoln Center and the Kennedy Center," said Lawrence P. Goldman, president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a private, nonprofit development company. "Our architecture and acoustics reflect that goal, the scale of what we are doing reflects that goal and our programming reflects that goal."
But detractors tend to favor a different sort of description: white elephant. They believe that the government and corporate love affair with the arts center has all but dried up financing for other worthy public art projects, and that Newark's problems are too entrenched to pin its cultural and commercial rejuvenation on one building.
"You still have a very unsafe city," said Raymond M. Codey, director of development for the New Community Corporation, a nonprofit organization that has helped rebuild pieces of Newark, including the first modern supermarket near the city center. "They need better schools, better health care and better police force, and then the changes will flow from there."
There is also concern that programs and ticket prices promised for impoverished Newark residents will get lost in the rush to attract wealthy suburban theater patrons.
"It is being built by nonresidents for nonresidents," Mr. Codey said. "They will come in and get dumped off at the front, see the show and then leave without having any impact on the community. I see it like those practice landings at the airport where they put their wheels on the ground and then take straight off again."
Built with heavy infusions of government cash, the center is to open in October. The full schedule of performances is to be announced in February, and the center hopes to attract more than 10,000 subscribers for the first year.
The center will be a permanent home to the itinerant New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which should add luster to both its performances and the level of musicians it attracts, Mr. Goldman said.
Other groups who have announced they will appear include the American Ballet Theater, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Isaac Stern, Wynton Marsalis, the Israeli Philharmonic and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
Ask who will show up and the builders spew demographics. Within a 35-mile radius of Newark is a densely populated region of 4.9 million people on the Jersey side of the Hudson River alone, in some of the highest-educated, highest-earning communities in the country. The center practically straddles the state's four largest highway arteries, and is a 15-minute walk from Newark's Pennsylvania Station. There are 90,000 office workers and students in the city daily.
One question is whether the arts center will be enough of a draw in a downtown area that sets records for carjackings and inspires fear even among those accustomed to it.
"It is kind of spooky walking to the train from here," said Maita Negron, a bartender at the Dubonnet. "I am paranoid about being the only one walking through the streets."
The center is trying to overcome that by confecting itself as something of an all-in-one destination. The building, designed by the architect Barton Myers, has the look of a massive stage, with soaring glass windows and catwalks where the theatergoers can stare down at the mingling crowds.
When construction ends in August, the center will have its own restaurant and will front on a landscaped plaza. A renovated garage and other parking should provide roughly one space for every two audience members in both the main 2,750-seat concert hall and a more intimate 500-seat theater.
Despite unconfirmed rumors of celebrity restaurateurs setting up shop nearby, the builders have been disappointed by the lack of private development in tandem with the arts center construction, especially since the entire complex is supposed to be connected one day to an esplanade along the Passaic River.
Doubters tend to point to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, saying that despite years of selling out with modernistic performances like those by the German choreographer Pina Bausch, it has yet to inspire a parallel neighborhood development.
The New Jersey Performing Arts Center does not aspire to draw audiences out of Manhattan in any great numbers. But it would not mind diverting suburban theatergoers, and Mr. Goldman puts a certain gusto into his descriptions of Lincoln Tunnel traffic jams leaving New Jersey.
He is toying with the idea of hiring official greeters to welcome people at the doors, distinguishing his center from what he views as the somewhat surly atmosphere of performance palaces across the river.
For their part, New York theater impresarios say they welcome the added choice, while dismissing any impact on their audience size. "The number of people who are likely to find Newark geographically more convenient is relatively small, let alone what is offered there, and is not of concern to me," said Nathan Leventhal, president of the Lincoln Center of the Performing Arts.
He estimated that 15 percent of the five million visitors a year to Lincoln Center come from New Jersey. Troupes that have committed themselves to Newark are retaining their seasons in places like City Center.
"For people in Manhattan to cross the river, they think they are going to a different country," said Judith E. Daykin, president of City Center. "I was at BAM for 15 years and people acted like they needed a visa to come to Brooklyn."
Sometimes, the gamble of placing a castle of culture in the midst of an urban desert bubbles up into the conversation with the developers. Before yet another of his riffs about sidewalks and restaurants and cafes oozing life, Mr. Goldman sighed, "It is very hard for me to get people to imagine this."
Aside from the majesty of the building itself, he said he thinks the center will succeed by featuring the best New Jersey has to offer, by scheduling performances that appeal to a variety of ethnic groups (Portugal is featured the first year to woo residents from the Ironbound district) and by extensive workshops for children, which have already been running in schools.
Newark residents were taken aback by the $150 cost of one eight-week theater and dance workshop, although the center ultimately reduced the fee for some students.
Chase M. Jackson, the arts manager for New Community Corporation, applauded the idea of developing more local talent.
"The musicians and artists are in New Jersey, living in New Jersey, but we don't really promote our own," she said. "We are not a cultural wasteland, but people don't think of us, because we are so close to New York."

Japan Stocks Calmer After A Statement

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Japan's Finance Minister seemed to reassure the stock market today and said that the ministry would watch the stock market with serious concern after stocks plunged in early morning trading and sent the main market index down sharply.
The fall of about 3 percent in the main index had initially erased more than half the overwhelming gains from Monday, when the benchmark Nikkei Average 225 recovered from staggering losses last week. But the market recovered on Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka's remarks, and the Nikkei index closed today at 18,093.13, down 25.66 points, or one-tenth of 1 percent from Monday's close. 
 On Monday, the Nikkei index soared 815.14 points to close at 18,118.79, up 4.7 percent from Friday. Those gains fizzled in early morning trading, however, partly after an Economic Planning Agency official acknowledged the economic risks of a market decline, saying it would have a "bad effect on banks."
He added: "However, at this current moment, I am optimistic and think the effects of a stock decline will be limited."
Though Monday's gains offered some hope that the market was settling, it was clear this morning that the same conditions that helped bring about last week's plunge, which pushed the Nikkei index down 10.6 percent, still exist.
Japan's economic outlook for 1997 remains dim, a rise in the national sales tax is expected to crimp consumption, and budget tightening by the Government will curb fiscal spending. The "Big Bang" plan to deregulate financial markets by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who returns from a state visit to Southeast Asia today, has also raised concern about the financial industry's ability to withstand new competition.
Moreover, highly risky Japanese investment funds seem to have influenced the wild market swings of recent days. Thus, analysts said, the market could see more such volatility in coming weeks.
"Tokyo has always been a volatile market," said Giles F. Ockenden, an equity strategist at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. "Sentiment is so powerful in the market, and it's not that connected to valuation."
Investors have always had difficulty evaluating the financial conditions of Japanese banks and brokerage firms, which have traditionally disclosed much less financial information than their American counterparts. Japan's thinly capitalized banks are still burdened by several hundred billion dollars in bad real estate loans, and it was those banks that bore the brunt of the market selloff last week.
Some investment analysts said that one significant factor moving the market in recent days seemed to have been the trading by large, leveraged Japanese investment trusts, called bull and bear funds.
Since their introduction two years ago, these funds have expanded to control more than 400 billion yen, or about $3.5 billion, and influence even more because of the big bets they take on the market. The largest of these aggressive bull funds, operated by Daiwa Securities Inc., has about $2 billion in funds.
"The bull funds exacerbated the selling" on Friday, said Kathy M. Matsui, equity strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd. "If the market is holding up, they do relatively well. If the market declines, there's a negative spiral."
Much more money is invested in the bull funds, and some of these offer individual investors double the return on the Nikkei index by trading in index futures. Fund managers adjust their positions daily, carrying out their huge trades toward the end of the day.
On both Friday and Monday, the Nikkei index saw large moves toward the end of trading. When the market starts dropping, bull funds must aggressively sell futures to reduce their exposure to the contracts. Bear funds do the opposite, so there is some offsetting in trading activity.
In a rising market, bull funds must aggressively buy back the futures.
Hiroshi Masuda, deputy general manager in the equity department at Yamaichi Securities, which also offers the funds, called it a significant factor in last week's drop. "The funds may have helped push up the market today," he said on Monday. "It is a factor that accelerates the upward or downward movement."

HEADLINE: Budget Equity in New York

 BODY:
By pledging to increase school aid for New York City and lower property taxes, largely for upstate and the suburbs, Gov. George Pataki has outlined some worthy goals. But the early numbers churned out by the Governor's budget office raise doubts about whether the city will end up worse off under the latest proposals. The Legislature also needs to resist locking in expensive new spending increases or tax reductions that later balloon in size. New York State's habit of launching programs with no thought about how to pay for them in the future has created chaos in its finances for years.
Only through a combination of good fortune and dubious fiscal gimmickry has the state been able to absorb the $5 billion in tax cuts enacted in the last two years. The luck came as a boom in the economy, particularly on Wall Street, yielded an estimated $1 billion in unexpected revenues for the state. It would be a mistake to assume that these resources will be there in the future to finance new programs. 
 Beyond that, the $1.7 billion in property tax relief proposed by Mr. Pataki is notable because it has been geared to voters upstate and in the suburbs surrounding New York City. Only 9 percent of the tax cut would accrue to homeowners in the city, where about 40 percent of the population lives. In political terms, the suburbs have become perhaps the biggest battleground for elections both locally and nationally. But that is no reason to favor one segment of the state over another.
The mechanics of the bias in the Governor's proposal are worth explaining. The areas outside New York City have higher property tax rates because, unlike the city, they do not impose high sales or income taxes to pay for government services. A home assessed at $100,000 in Queens pays a lower tax than a home assessed for the same amount in Nassau County. Mr. Pataki's proposal would give homeowners, on average, a $30,000 tax exemption on the assessed value of their homes, or $50,000 for people 65 years old or more, a benefit of much greater value if a homeowner is paying a higher tax rate.
To make his entire proposal more palatable to the city, Mr. Pataki proposes to increase state education aid by a separate $1.7 billion over the next five years, and to weight that increase in favor of the city as opposed to the suburbs. That is only fair because New York City, with 37 percent of the state's school population, receives only 34 percent of the state aid for schools.
But the numbers given out by the Governor's office only show what he would spend in the next year, and there is no sign that the state will even begin to address the equity issue then. By some measures it appears that the city will get even less of a portion of overall state aid than it has been receiving, since Mr. Pataki is proposing to cut funding for programs vital to the city school system, like special education and dropout prevention.
The overriding principles that the Legislature should apply are equity and practicability. New York City schools must get their fair share of state assistance, all New Yorkers should get their fair share of tax cuts and the state must do more than guess that the money will be there to pay for both.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT WANTS CURB ON MEDICAID

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Over the objections of senior members of his own party, President Clinton is drafting a budget that would set firm limits on Federal Medicaid spending as a way to help balance the Federal budget by 2002.
While the effort at fiscal discipline may please Republicans, many Democrats view the limits as undermining the open-ended nature of the Federal-state health program for the poor. Furthermore, they say they see no need for such limits because the program's growth fell last year to its lowest level in two decades. 
 Mr. Clinton's proposal says, in effect, that per-capita Medicaid spending may grow no faster than the nation's per-capita economic output, before adjusting for inflation. In practice, such a formula would allow Medicaid to grow 4 percent to 5 percent a year. At present, Medicaid benefits are available to anyone who meets eligibility criteria set by Federal and state law, and the costs have been unpredictable.
The President's budget request, which is to be submitted to Congress on Feb. 6, will be the opening move in months of arduous negotiations. The outcome is uncertain.
Federal Medicaid spending rose an average of 15 percent a year from 1985 to 1995, but the growth has slowed, averaging 7.9 percent a year from 1992 to 1996. And in the last year, Federal Medicaid outlays increased just 3.3 percent, to $92 billion, which is $3 billion less than Mr. Clinton predicted in the budget that he sent to Congress last February.
Reasons for the slowdown include greater use of managed care, a drop in medical price inflation, a decline in the growth of Medicaid enrollment and a Federal crackdown on ploys used by states to shift costs to the Federal Government.
In his new budget, Mr. Clinton assumes that, with no change in current law, Medicaid will grow roughly 7.5 percent a year for the next five years, so that Federal Medicaid spending in that period will be $55 billion less than he was projecting just 11 months ago.
But the Administration wants to make sure there is no return to the explosive growth of the late 1980's and early 1990's. (Medicaid outlays grew more than 27 percent a year in 1991 and 1992). So, Administration officials said, Mr. Clinton will ask Congress to squeeze at least $11 billion -- and perhaps twice that amount -- from Medicaid over the next five years, by imposing annual limits on spending and by cutting special payments to hospitals with large numbers of indigent patients.
A cap on Medicaid spending could directly affect the people who depend on the program for health insurance. For if a state reached its limit, it would have two choices. It could cut back the amount or scope of its Medicaid benefits, or it could curb payments to doctors, nursing homes and other health care providers, reducing the incentive for them to serve Medicaid patients.
The budget proposal has alienated some members of Mr. Clinton's party, a risk he runs throughout this year's budget negotiations.
Many Democrats, like Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California and Senator Bob Graham of Florida, are urging the White House to drop the idea of a cap on Medicaid spending. It was understandable, they say, that Mr. Clinton offered such a proposal in 1995 as an alternative to a Republican plan to dismantle Medicaid and give each state a lump sum of Federal money to finance health care for the poor, with no Federal guarantee or entitlement.
But Republican governors and Republicans in Congress are no longer making a serious push for the block grant. So, the Democrats say, there is no reason for Mr. Clinton to persist in his efforts to set a "per-capita cap" on Medicaid spending.
Moreover, Democrats say, a cap would save much less money now that the growth of Medicaid has slowed. If, for example, Congress had set a cap limiting Medicaid growth to 4.5 percent a year, it would not have saved any money last year because spending rose only 3.3 percent.
Finally, the Democrats say, Mr. Clinton should wait to see the effects of welfare and immigration laws passed in the last six months. Health policy experts predict that those laws will further slow the growth of Medicaid by removing people from the rolls or making it more difficult for them to get on.
A newsletter that follows Federal spending for public health said today that Mr. Clinton would seek additional money for treating people with AIDS, for Head Start and for the Indian Health Service. But the newsletter, Community Health Funding Report, said many other requests from the Department of Health and Human Services had been "shot down" as the White House struggled to eliminate the deficit.
Budget documents provide these details of the Administration's preliminary decisions:
*The White House initially proposed a small cut in the budget for the National Institutes of Health, but then relented after an appeal from Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Mr. Clinton is now expected to request a total of $13 billion, or slightly less than would be needed to keep pace with inflation.
*Healthy Start, a Federal program to cut infant mortality by increasing the use of prenatal care, would be merged with other maternal and child health programs. Money for the combined programs would be reduced by 9 percent, to $719 million in 1998.
*The budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be cut slightly, to $2.2 billion. But spending on AIDS prevention would be increased $20 million, to $637 million, and the White House ordered Federal health officials to use the extra money to prevent H.I.V. infection among drug abusers.
*Mr. Clinton is seeking $5 million to enforce a new regulation that curbs the advertising and sale of tobacco products to children. He is requesting $26 million for other activities to combat tobacco use.
*Mr. Clinton will ask Congress to expand Head Start, so it serves 836,000 children next year, up from 750,000 in 1996, and he wants to have one million children enrolled in the program by 2002. The budget, $4 billion this year, would rise to $4.3 billion in 1998 and to more than $5 billion in 2002.
*For the immunization of children, Mr. Clinton requests $400 million. The amount is less than Congress provided this year, but would supposedly allow the Government to buy just as much vaccine. White House budget officials said immunization levels were approaching the President's goals, so no more money was needed.
The White House decided not to seek money for a giant nationwide computer system that was to pay all Medicare bills. In announcing the new system in 1994, Dr. Shalala said it would move Medicare "to the era of the super electronic highway." But the White House raised questions about the technical complexity of the project, the "management capacity" of Medicare officials and "the likelihood of cost overruns." Medicare finances health care for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled.

HEADLINE: Confusion Arrives Ahead of a Week of Tax-Free Clothing

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Beginning Saturday, New York State will eliminate sales tax for a week on clothing and related items that cost under $500, in a plan aimed at stopping the flow of shoppers out of the city and into surrounding states that do not tax clothing purchases.
The tax-free plan is intended to test its proponents' belief that revenues lost can be made up in increases in related sales, like the food shoppers eat and the transportation they take. 
 That would be good for the coffers of New York, but would it be good for bowlers?
That question arises because in its execution, the tax-free week is riddled with confusing details, as retailers try to figure out exactly which items are tax-exempt and which are not.
For example, under the plan, bowling shirts will be tax-exempt, but bowling shoes will not. Barrettes and hair bows will not be taxed, but head scarves will be.
Precipitation problems? A new pair of galoshes will solve them tax free, but if you opt for ski boots and waders, prepare to ante up to the government.
Ostensibly, the clothing exempt under the guidelines of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is worn every day. But the state agency, which used other state tax policies as its yardstick for what is everyday wear, did make some odd calls. Bridal wear, for example, is tax free. Ditto for flip-flops (but not other athletic shoes).
"Flip-flops are worn every day in the summer," said an agency spokeswoman, Christine Golden. But the bridal costume? "That's a new one on me," she admitted.
Many retailers said yesterday that they had not yet really figured out what was exempt and what was not, and some smaller retailers said they were unaware of the program at all. Of six managers of sporting goods stores in three boroughs called yesterday, not one knew exactly what to tax. "It is going to be absolutely confusing," said Mark Guran, who owns Island Sports Inc. in Manhattan. "I have not received anything in detail. I don't know much about it."
Ms. Golden said she believed that all businesses that collect retail sales tax were sent a memo that listed exempt items, and that anyone with questions could call (800) CALL-TAX, or refer to the web site at http://www.tax.state.ny.us.
The plan for a week of tax abeyance was part of the budget package that the State Legislature approved and Gov. George E. Pataki signed last summer, with the blessing of the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a supporter of a permanent reduction in the retail sales tax. Local retailers have long lamented that shoppers use New Jersey and other surrounding states, which do not tax clothing, as a sort of giant duty-free shop.
New York City agreed to match the 4 percent state tax break with a 4 percent break of its own. The one-quarter of 1 percent Metropolitan Transportation Authority sales tax will also be eliminated between Saturday and Jan. 24.
This tax break, proponents argued, will stimulate retail sales during a usually lackluster sales week when shoppers are tapped out from holiday shopping and after-Christmas sales are winding down. Further, they say, it will prove that state and local government should adopt some permanent sales tax reduction.
In a news conference last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani reiterated his position. "I believe very strongly that New York City needs lower sales tax on vital purchases like clothing, shoes and other things," he said.
The Mayor has already included in his proposed 1998 budget $70 million in cuts in the sales tax, which would require approval by Albany. He is seeking to cut, at minimum, 2 percent from the city's retail sales tax on clothing under $500.
"There is no tax that is more regressive than the sales tax," the Mayor added. "Poor people have to pay exactly the same sales tax as rich people have to pay. And when you consider how much business that we are losing to Nassau and Suffolk and Westchester, and Staten Island is losing to New Jersey, this is particularly important to us."
Indeed, retailers in Staten Island, an important political base for the Mayor, have complained the loudest about losing business to New Jersey.
"I would say about 10 to 15 percent of my business" is lost to New Jersey, said Bill Praschil, the general manager of the Sears, Roebuck store in Staten Island. "As far as Sears is concerned, a Sears is a Sears. But we wonder what this does to slow the growth rate out here."
The City Council has estimated that $7 million of city tax revenues will be lost for the week, and state officials have estimated the loss for the state at $10 million to $20 million for the week.
But things that may make up for the lost revenue, proponents have argued, could include improved corporate profits if sales indeed beef up during the tax-free week. Also, they say, losses from permanently eliminating the sales tax would be offset by long-term retail sales growth and additional spending on related businesses like restaurants and transportation.
"The city can do a billion dollars more in sales that they are losing to other states," Mr. Silver said in an interview. "That billion dollars represents corporate profits, jobs and employees in New York State who will pay income taxes here, who will make up for revenues lost in sales tax. It would be a win-win for New York."
State and local governments will do a cost-benefit analysis of the week to help them determine the usefulness of a permanent cut in the retail sales tax. While some economists applaud such a plan, others warn that a weeklong shop-a-thon in the dead of winter may not provide enough evidence to justify a cut.
"If I were to make a comparable analogy it would be the 10-day car sales for the nation, which are very erratic," said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "It is very hard to look at the demand of something for a week and try to generalize."
Ms. Rosen added: "All things being equal, we should recapture some of the sales that are being lost to New Jersey. I just haven't seen any rule of thumb that tells me that for sure."
So far, the advertising for the program has been scant but big retailers like Macy's are expected to push the idea later this week. Meanwhile, word has begun to trickle out to customers, and yesterday most of those interviewed had heard at least a little about the program.
A half-dozen people interviewed in front of Macy's Herald Square said that they were shopped out for now, but liked the idea of a reduced retail sales tax. "Now that I know about it, I'll definitely wait until then to do some shopping," Erin Kehoe, 30, an interior designer, said.

HEADLINE: Albert Wohlstetter, 83, Expert On U.S. Nuclear Strategy, Dies

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Albert Wohlstetter, an influential innovator in strategic nuclear doctrine who advised Democratic and Republican Administrations on military strategy, died on Friday in his home in the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles. He was 83.
Mr. Wohlstetter's career as a strategic analyst was guided by certain key principles, including his conviction that the United States should be able to control its military forces in such a way as to permit varying the American response to foreign aggression according to the circumstances. The goal of such control, he felt, was to insure that the United States would not be obliged to mount an initial nuclear attack on the Soviet Union -- known to military analysts as a "first strike" -- but would have a variety of options instead. 
 Writing in Commentary in the early 1980's -- when nuclear doctrine was seen as being about how to deter nuclear attack and what to do should deterrence fail -- Mr. Wohlstetter contended that the President must be perceived as having choices in order to deter an attack, and that the President could not be left without choices should deterrence fail.
Mr. Wohlstetter and his wife, Roberta Wohlstetter, also an expert on national security, were awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan for their "great contributions to the security of the United States." Mr. Reagan said Mr. Wohlstetter had been "influential in helping to design and employ our strategic forces."
Mr. Wohlstetter was a senior policy analyst on the staff of the Rand Corporation, the California-based think tank, from 1951 to 1963 and a consultant to Rand for decades afterward. He also taught at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1960's and at the University of Chicago from 1964 to 1980. And he was a longtime executive of Pan Heuristics Services, Inc., a California-based consulting firm dealing in security policy whose clients included the departments of State and Defense as well as private corporations.
A native New Yorker, Mr. Wohlstetter grew up in Manhattan and attended public schools. He earned a bachelor's degree and, in 1938, a master's degree, in mathematical logic from Columbia University. In the 1940's he worked for the War Production Board, and later went on to work in the aviation industry and as a Government housing executive.
He later became a member of Rand's research council and chairman of Rand's research program on conflict in allied, neutral and satellite countries. The studies that he carried out at Rand in the 1950's were all done for one client, the United States Defense Department, and were for the most part highly secret.
Soon after he joined Rand, a colleague there, Charles Hitch -- who later became an Assistant Secretary of Defense under Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara in the 1960's -- suggested that Mr. Wohlstetter carry out a research project about the selection and use of strategic air bases -- that is, air bases for nuclear bombers. There were no nuclear missiles until the mid-1950's.
James Digby, a friend of Mr. Wohlstetter who worked with him at Rand, recalled yesterday that Mr. Wohlstetter's paper "resulted in a change of Strategic Air Command's basing policy so that bombers were based far from the Soviet Union, and their bases, highly protected. This in turn led to the ability to strike back even after receiving a first attack by the Soviets."
In the 1970's, after Mr. Wohlstetter had left Rand, he and his wife performed studies on the Persian Gulf on behalf of Rand and with the Department of Defense as the client. These studies affirmed that the United States' European allies were highly susceptible to having important oil supplies blocked.
Also in the 1970's, Mr. and Mrs. Wohlstetter increased their analyses of the ramifications of the spread of nuclear weapons, and by some accounts that work led to changes in American law concerning the export of nuclear material, notably plutonium, and of nuclear technology.
In addition to his wife, the former Roberta Morgan, whom he married in 1939, Mr. Wohlstetter is survived by a daughter, Joan Wohlstetter Hall of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Russia Vows to Remove Georgia Nuclear Fuel

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Responding to repeated American appeals, Russia promised today to remove a cache of nuclear material from Georgia by March.
The supply of highly enriched uranium and spent nuclear fuel at a research reactor outside Tbilisi in the Caucasus has been a major worry for American officials, who fear that it could fall into the hands of aspiring nuclear powers or terrorists. 
 For much of the past year, senior Clinton Administration officials have tried without success to arrange the transport of the material to Russia for safekeeping.
Today, however, Viktor N. Mikhailov, the head of Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, publicly pledged that the transfer would be carried out in the next two months. He spoke at a news conference in which he declared Russia's intention to increase its exports of nuclear power plants to nations like China, India and Iran.
On the issue of the nuclear material in Georgia, Mr. Mikhailov said: "During the past four months, we have been solving this question on what I would describe as the bureaucratic level. We are preparing for this operation. I think we will be able to withdraw this fuel in February or March."
Mr. Mikhailov privately gave American officials similar assurances last year, promising the material would be removed in August. Moscow then delayed the operation, and Mr. Mikhailov cautioned today that the final bureaucratic obstacles have not yet been surmounted.
"There must be an intergovernmental agreement," he said. "Dozens of ministries are involved. We must clear all these operations with them."
Additionally, Mr. Mikhailov did not say whether Moscow has abandoned its earlier plan to reprocess the spent fuel and return the nuclear waste to Georgia. Georgia says that it cannot accept the waste because it has no place to safely store nuclear debris. The Russian plan to return the waste has been a major sticking point.
According to Georgian officials, the research reactor houses 9.5 pounds of highly enriched uranium and 2 pounds of spent fuel.
Some American officials say that the nuclear material, while substantial, is not enough for a nuclear bomb. But some nongovernmental experts say it could be used to make a weapon with a small yield of about 1,000 tons of TNT.
American specialists have installed a security system at the Georgia reactor, but officials say the only long-term solution is to remove the nuclear material.
At the news conference, Mr. Mikhailov painted a grim picture of a Russian nuclear industry.
The Minister said that the delay in paying back wages to nuclear workers had been reduced to one-and-a-half months from three to four months. But that was accomplished, in part, by taking large loans from commercial banks at interest rates that reached as much as 70 percent a year. Those loans must be repaid next year, he said, adding to the nuclear industry's budget crunch.
The Minister said he hoped to deal with the financial crunch by expanding nuclear exports. He said that such exports exceed more than $2 billion a year and had increased by 10 percent last year.
He said that Russia hopes to build nuclear plants in China and India, as well as in Iran. The Iranian project has drawn strong protests from the United States, which says it will help Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons.
Mr. Mikhailov is also seeking sales in Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Brazil and Vietnam.
But many developing nations have budget problems, too, putting a cloud over the ministry's plans. While 150 Russians specialists are working on a project to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, the project is being hampered by financial concerns.
"Now some questions arose over cash flow -- how the payments will be made, through what banks and so on," Mr. Mikhailov said. "Iran is being a little choosy."
Mr. Mikhailov also blamed money problems for delaying the plan to remove the Georgia nuclear material, not mentioning that the United States has offered to advance $1 million in funds.
"We had no money to pay wages and we had to pay $500,000 for transportation to take out this amount of material," he said.
Another hitch, he acknowledged, has been Russian laws concerning the importing of nuclear waste.
"We have a law whereby waste fuel can only be taken out under an intergovernment agreement," he said. "And so, this bureaucratic red tape began. And it is still in progress."

HEADLINE: Cape Cod, Worried About Fresh Water Supplies, Seeks to Rein In Growth

BYLINE: By SETH KING 

DATELINE: BARNSTABLE VILLAGE, Mass., Jan. 10

 BODY:
With the number of permanent, year-round residents increasing steadily and putting new pressures on the limited supply of fresh water, Cape Cod is now wrestling with the question of how many more people can be permitted to move here.
For the past decade, the number of people living on the Cape year round has been increasing by about 5 percent annually. But the water supply will permit this growth rate to continue for no more than a decade, local planners say. 
 More than 200,000 permanent residents, or "year-rounders," as they call themselves, live on the Cape. About 300,000 more people come for the summer, so that on any given day in tourist season there may be 500,000 people on the 75 miles of glacial sand and rock that begins just north of the Cape Cod Canal and ends at Provincetown.
The fresh water that spouts from every faucet and shower head on Cape Cod must come from municipal and private wells supplied by an aquifer, which must be replenished by the approximately 45 inches of rain that falls on the Cape each year.
Virtually all of the Cape's waste water and sewage goes back into the aquifer after being treated in private underground septic systems that are on the property of houses and businesses. If the water is not properly treated, it can pollute the wells. The aquifer itself cannot be drawn down too low or sea water will flow in, ruining it.
The only way the Cape can assure an adequate water supply, planners say, is for town governments to buy open land and prohibit major construction on it. Keeping that land undeveloped insures that enough rainfall will soak into the aquifer; it also reduces the amount of waste water and sewage that must be treated to prevent pollution of the aquifer.
Last month, the Cape Cod Commission, which was created in 1990 to coordinate town development plans and help control growth, published the first regional plan for development. It shows that about one-third of the Cape is already protected from development, being owned by the 15 towns; another third is developed, and the remaining third, about 89,000 acres scattered over the Cape, is open land.
"The regional plan calls for the towns to buy up nearly half of this open land, about 35,000 acres," Armando J. Carbonell, the commission's executive director, said in a recent interview. "Most of this newly acquired land would be held as replenishment areas. The rest would remain in private hands and would be available for new houses on commercial buildings, with development controlled by town zoning rules."
In November, Cape Cod voters approved a resolution asking the Massachusetts Legislature for the authority to create a fund, known as a land bank, to buy the open areas. The fund, to be financed by a 1 percent tax on any property sale after the first $100,000, would raise at least $5 million annually that could be used by local governments to buy the 35,000 acres.
The proposed legislation would also give the towns the right to acquire the land under eminent domain.
If fully implemented, the plan would allow a maximum increase of 50,000 to 100,000 in the year-round population, Mr. Carbonell said.
"This is all the growth the permanent residents on the Cape want," he said. "They've made this clear, first in supporting the Cape Cod Commission's efforts to control development and second in their solid support of a land bank."
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket already have similar land banks.
Commercial establishments opposed to the land-bank concept contend that it would curb commercial growth and increase property taxes.
Dick Neitz, a real estate agent who is chairman of the Cape Cod Economic Development Council, a local government agency that promotes development, said: "When you add a 1 percent land-bank tax, you add a new, unfair burden on property buyers and sellers, which makes Cape real estate much less competitive.
"This could curtail our commercial growth because we would be making Cape property too expensive and driving off people who would like to locate here."
While Mr. Neitz and other opponents of the land bank say they are not against the public purchase of undeveloped land to protect it, they contend that when land is removed from the tax rolls, towns are forced to increase property taxes to balance their budgets.
Legislation to create the land bank has been introduced by State Representative Eric Turkington, a Democrat who represents Falmouth, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.
Supporters of the measure express confidence in having support for passage in the legislature's current session.

HEADLINE: Social Security Funds Don't Belong in Stocks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Advisory Council on Social Security's report urging investment of Social Security revenues to insure the solvency of the program purports to solve a crisis that does not exist (front page, Jan. 7). Social Security benefits will be paid on time regardless of the trust fund's status. They are Government obligations and are paid out of current revenues, like the defense budget. A real trust fund does not exist -- and never has. 
 The panel ignores options that could restore the balance between intake and outflow. These include raising the early retirement age of 62, when most people begin receiving benefits, and correcting the overstated annual inflation adjustment.
The panel waves the magic wand of privatization without noting serious drawbacks. If Social Security is no longer a captive buyer of Government bonds, those bonds will be forced to offer higher interest rates to attract new buyers, which will raise borrowing costs. They will also depress stock market returns.
If Social Security buys stocks, which stocks? Risky upstart companies or "safe" enterprises like Philip Morris? If the latter, will the Government protect public health when it is a major stockholder in tobacco companies?

Search Party Is Sought To Find a Commissioner

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Four years and four months after Major League Baseball last had a commissioner without the word "acting" or "interim" before it, the owners will embark this week on yet another search for the right man for the job. How long it will take or where it will end nobody knows.
Bud Selig, who has served as acting commissioner since Fay Vincent resigned under pressure Sept. 7, 1992, and the executive council will appoint a search committee at the owners' meetings here this week. The committee will most likely be the executive council itself. 
 "We'll finalize that Tuesday night," Selig said today of the executive council meeting. "There are still some different variations on how to do it. But we'll get it done this week and move on."
The owners will also vote on placement of the two expansion teams. The Arizona Diamondbacks will join the National League in 1998 and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays will join the American League, creating two 15-team leagues, an uneven number for the first time, and requiring that interleague play become a permanent format after its two-year experiment in 1997-98.
Not everyone in baseball is convinced that the search for a commissioner will lead anywhere but to Selig himself. But Selig steadfastly says that he does not want the job, and another major league official said the committee would conduct a "serious search."
Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' managing partner, said, "I understand there's been speculation of late that maybe it's Bud Selig, but he continues to deny that he wants that to take place."
Not everyone believes that spoken stance. "I still believe Bud will wind up as commissioner," one official said.
Not everyone is convinced that the last search was serious. That one ended three years ago this week with the committee making no recommendation to the executive council.
It was evident at the time that those owners preferred leaving Selig in charge. With the exception of some critics in the National League, in fact, the owners generally have liked having Selig as commissioner -- for their purposes -- and many would like to see him take the job permanently. But in recent remarks, Peter O'Malley of the Los Angeles Dodgers, one of Selig's harshest critics, expressed another view that some owners hold.
"The best thing for baseball today," O'Malley said, "would be to identify someone from outside the game, totally fresh, who could bring to baseball a marketing background, high credibility, and lead baseball into the next century."
For a time a couple of years ago, George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader, was considered the top candidate for the job. The man from Maine presumably remains available. He currently is special adviser to the president of Ireland.
No new names have jumped to the forefront. But one name certain to come up is Peter Goldmark Jr., who last month announced he was resigning sometime this year as president of the Rockefeller Foundation.
Goldmark, 56, who said he had not decided what he wanted to do next, often colors his comments with baseball analogies and served as a management-appointed member of baseball's economic study committee in the early 1990's. A person in Goldmark's office said he would be out of the country until next week and was not available for comment.
Whatever candidates surface during the committee's search, the owners may have difficulty agreeing on one person or even the type of person he should be. Election requires a three-fourths majority (23) of the 30 clubs with at least five votes coming from each league. Some owners believe the next commissioner should be a chief executive officer; others object to that idea. Some don't want an outsider because they feel that people who don't have experience within baseball don't understand the way it functions.
"Do you need someone who is politically correct or someone who rolls up his sleeves and knows how to get the job done as it relates to the sports industry?" Colangelo said.

HEADLINE: City Spending Less Per Pupil, Report Shows

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
The Board of Education is spending less money per student now than at any time in the last decade, a new budget analysis shows, even as the reading scores of third and sixth graders in New York City have fallen to their lowest point in nine years.
The study, conducted by the New York City Independent Budget Office, shows that while overall spending on the schools has gone up, it has not kept pace with the much faster increase in student enrollment, which has risen by an average of 13,000 students a year since 1988. 
 Though there is no proven connection between spending and student performance, reading scores and spending have each fallen by about 13 percent from their peaks.
Over the last 10 years, average spending per student has risen and fallen based on spending decisions by mayors, chancellors and school board members. The total spent by the Board of Education on each student reached a peak in 1990, then fell somewhat in the middle part of the decade.
But after the significant cuts in the growth of spending by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1994 and 1995, the amounts fell to their lowest level since 1988, adjusting for inflation -- $6,952 spent per student this year, compared with $7,892 in 1990.
About 60 percent of the board's resources come from state and Federal budgets. While those amounts have also fluctuated over the last 10 years, per-student spending from those sources is roughly the same this year as it was in 1988, when adjusted for inflation. But the study shows that city aid per student -- spent at the discretion of the Mayor and the City Council -- has declined faster than total board spending. Though the Mayor recently spent $70 million for new textbooks, the total board spending for this year declined by about $70 per pupil.
The spending figures were calculated by the Independent Budget Office using simple arithmetic: dividing the amounts spent on education by the number of students enrolled each year. Then, to remove the effects of inflation, each year's dollar was made equal by applying the Consumer Price Index. Pension and debt-service costs were not included; like the rest of the city budget, they are calculated separately.
School spending has become a potent political issue this year because several candidates challenging the Mayor in his run for re-election have decided to make his spending cuts in education their primary issue. Last week, several of them blamed him for the decline in reading scores that began in 1994, saying the cuts were responsible for harming student performance.
The Mayor said on Friday that calculating the average amount spent on each student was meaningless in New York, because programs like special education siphon money away from regular classrooms.
"For the New York City school system, an average per student number is totally useless and means nothing, except for people who want to pander," he said on his weekly radio program after he was told of the study. He argued that the amount being spent is less important than how the money is spent, which he said has improved under Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
In fact, spending on special education has increased in recent years. And since special education is more costly than regular classroom instruction, to include the special education spending in the overall calculations -- as the budget office did -- actually has the effect of raising the per-pupil spending figure.
Dr. Crew said in a statement that he could not comment on past spending but that in 1996 the Mayor cut the school budget proportionately less than he cut budgets of other city agencies, and added the textbook money in this year's budget.
Per-pupil spending is a standard measure of education budgets, used by the Federal Government and national education groups to compare one school system's spending to another's. Douglas A. Criscitello, director of the newly formed Independent Budget Office, said it is the only measure that shows whether policy makers are keeping pace with changing enrollments.
"We think it's the most reliable indicator of spending in the classroom," said Mr. Criscitello, whose agency, mandated by the City Charter, began operations last year as a nonpartisan source of budgetary information. "It's not surprising that it's declined given the tremendous influx of additional students into the system." He added: "At some point, reduced spending per pupil will have an impact on the education being provided."
Education experts have long said there is no direct, clear-cut connection between spending and student performance. The two urban school districts with the highest rates of per-student spending around the country -- Washington and Newark -- have among the lowest rates of performance. And even with the cuts, New York City still has one of the highest urban rates of per-student spending in the country, though suburban areas tend to spend more.
The Mayor and other critics of the Board of Education have argued that a good deal of school spending has been wasted by a needlessly large bureaucracy, and administration officials say that his cuts have forced the board to trim its nonteaching staff. They also note that the percentage of the budget spent on education is larger under Mr. Giuliani than in the past, although the Mayor cut $1.2 billion from the board's spending requests in his first two years in office.
"It's a trap to think that one can evaluate the system simply because of dollars or dollars per student, and that's not the way one should evaluate it," said Randy M. Mastro, the deputy mayor for operations.
Mr. Mastro and school officials also raised questions about the methodology of the study, though no one disputed the basic calculations. Mr. Mastro expressed doubts about the manner in which the Independent Budget Office had adjusted the amounts for inflation, suggesting the organization was political because some former officials of the Dinkins administration work there. He did not explain what he believed was wrong with the calculations.
Mr. Criscitello, who was chosen by Democratic city officials not including the Mayor's office, is former chief financial officer for the Small Business Administration in Washington.
Report cards issued by the state earlier this month show that the number of third-grade students meeting the state minimum standards for reading has fallen by 9 percent in the three years that Mr. Giuliani has been Mayor. Sixth-grade reading levels have also fallen, although math scores are up for the same period.
In 1988 and 1989, when per-student spending was about 13 percent higher than it is today, reading levels in both the third and the sixth grades were also about 13 percent higher, according to scores compiled by the State Department of Education.
"When resources are used well, they can effectively change achievement scores," said Robert Berne, the vice president for academic development at New York University. "Clearly the Mayor and the Chancellor argue they have not been used well in the past," he said. "But my view is, over the long term, large amounts of resources taken out of the educational system can make a difference, and they have been removed."
Several of the mayoral candidates also tried to link the declines in spending to those in reading scores, and indicated they would do so in the coming mayoral campaign. Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said there was a clear correlation between the two, and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, said parents could tell the difference in priorities.
 A picture in some editions, showing Ms. Messinger at St. Lucy's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx, carried an incorrect credit. It was by Chang W. Lee.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 1997, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article and a picture caption yesterday about Ruth W. Messinger's candidacy for mayor of New York referred incorrectly to the history of women in that race. Diane McGrath was the Republican-Conservative nominee in 1985, running against Mayor Edward I. Koch; Ms. Messinger, seeking the Democratic nomination, would not be the first woman nominated by a major party.

Expanding and consolidating, Golden Books takes six floors at Seventh Ave. and 57th St.

BYLINE: By Mervyn Rothstein 

 BODY:
THE Lone Ranger, Lassie and Felix the Cat are moving to 888 Seventh Avenue.
Golden Books Family Entertainment Inc., which owns the rights to the characters -- among many others -- has leased 112,500 square feet on six floors at the 45-floor, 866,000-square-foot office building at 57th Street. The 15-year lease is for the 38th through 43d floors. Financial details were not disclosed, but asking annual rents in the building are in the mid-$30's a square foot. 
 Golden Books is the largest publisher of children's books in the country and also creates and markets family entertainment. It will be moving from 35,000 square feet at 850 Third Avenue, at 51st Street, and 20,000 square feet of temporary space at 560 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street.
Tracey Riese, senior vice president for corporate marketing and communications at Golden Books, said the move came about because of recent consolidations and acquisitions. "We found we were out of space," Ms. Riese said.
Last May, an investor group that included Richard E. Snyder, the former chief executive of the Simon & Schuster unit of Viacom; Barry Diller, the head of Home Shopping Network Inc., and a fund managed by E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company acquired a controlling interest in Golden Books, which was previously the Western Publishing Group.
Ms. Riese said that when Mr. Snyder became chairman, much of the publishing business, including sales and marketing, was run from Racine, Wis., and that many of those operations had recently been consolidated in New York. In addition, she said, Golden Books had acquired the family video library of Broadway Video Entertainment, as well as "a significant proportion of its management."
The Georgetown Company advised Golden Books on the transaction; Arthur Lerner of Newmark & Company Real Estate Inc. was the tenant's broker, and Paramount Group Inc. represented the building.
 
Urban League's New Home
The National Urban League has leased almost 49,000 square feet on two floors at 120 Wall Street, a 34-story, 600,000-square-foot building at South Street.
Two-thirds of the building -- 400,000 square feet -- is designated the Association Center, created in 1992 in cooperation with the city's Economic Development Corporation to help keep nonprofit organizations from leaving the city because of high rents. Nonprofit tenants in the center are exempt from real estate taxes.
The National Urban League's lease, for 20 years, was valued in excess of $22 million. With the league, which will be the largest nonprofit tenant, the center will have 31 nonprofit organizations, occupying 300,000 square feet. David Lebenstein of Time Equities Inc. and Arlene Wysong of Newmark & Company Real Estate Inc. represented the tenant.
The league will be moving its headquarters from 500 East 62d Street, a 21-story, 123,000-square-foot building it owned and occupied with the United Negro College Fund for 23 years. The College Fund moved its headquarters to Fairfax, Va., in 1994, and the sale of the 62d Street building, to an undisclosed buyer, is expected to close next month.
 
First Boston Expands
Credit Suisse First Boston -- the corporate and investment banking firm combining Credit Suisse and CS First Boston that began life on Jan. 1 -- has leased an additional 286,000 square feet at 11 Madison Avenue, an office tower at 24th Street owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Credit Suisse First Boston, part of the CS Group of Switzerland, has now leased more than 1.6 million square feet of the 2.2-million-square-foot building.
CS First Boston had leased 1.1 million square feet on 15 floors in the then-vacant building in a 20-year, $500 million deal in July 1995 and later took additional space, bringing its total to 16 floors and 1.2 million square feet. Last October, Credit Suisse signed a 20-year lease for 140,000 square feet on the 19th and 20th floors; the Swiss bank's new space comprises the 8th, 9th and 11th floors.
Luther Terry, a managing director in corporate services at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that Credit Suisse would be transferring its finance, administrative and operations divisions from 1 Liberty Plaza and 5 World Trade Center and also moving some employees from Princeton, N.J. Financial details of the new deal were not disclosed. Cushman & Wakefield represented Met Life; the Edward S. Gordon Company represented Credit Suisse First Boston.
 
Around Manhattan
Fresco, a Tuscan restaurant at 34 East 52d Street, has leased 14,410 square feet on two levels at the Lombardy Hotel, 111 East 56th Street, for its second Manhattan location. The site was once home to the French restaurant Laurent, which closed in 1991. Faith Hope Consolo of Garrick-Aug Associates, who with her colleagues Ferne Glanzrock and Joseph Aquino represented both the tenant and the hotel, said the 15-year lease was valued at $4 million. . . . Wm. H. McGee & Company, an insurance underwriting concern, has leased 65,000 square feet, the 47th and part of the 48th floor, at 2 World Trade Center. The company will be moving from about 50,000 square feet at 4 World Trade Center and the 29th floor of 2 World Trade Center. The 15-year lease was valued at about $25 million. John Cefaly and Augustus Field of Cushman & Wakefield represented the tenant.

HEADLINE: A New Optimism Grows at Howard University

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
When H. Patrick Swygert was named president of Howard University in April 1995, the historically black university faced immediate problems. Morale was low. Enrollment had fallen. Finances were tight. And the House Budget Committee had voted to end the $200 million annual subsidy to the university, about 40 percent of Howard's operating budget.
Mr. Swygert did not officially take office until that August. But even before he moved in, he persuaded Congress to reinstate the subsidy and give him a year to come up with a plan to revitalize the university. Howard, which is north of downtown Washington, is the only comprehensive research university among the nation's historically black colleges and, with Gallaudet University, is one of only two federally chartered universities. 
 Now, Mr. Swygert has not only drawn up a strategic plan and set new priorities, but he is also bringing energy, excitement and top students to the campus.
And in a victory that Mr. Swygert holds particularly dear, he announced on Jan. 8 that Howard had attracted 79 National Achievement Scholars, more than any other college in the country. Harvard University, which does not offer automatic scholarships to these students as Howard does, was second, with 69. (The National Merit Scholarship Corporation runs the achievement program for outstanding black students parallel to its regular merit program; it designated 850 Achievement Scholars among this year's college freshmen.)
"Attracting the largest number of Achievement Scholars is a real kudo for President Swygert," said William H. Gray 3d, president of the United Negro College Fund, which raises money for black colleges.
"There's a new optimism about Howard when you talk to alumni, trustees and others," Mr. Gray said. "The alumni feel good about the university. You pick up that sort of positive response, and a lot is due to Pat's leadership."
Howard, which has more than 10,000 students and 1,100 faculty members, once attracted many of the nation's best black students. But as the Ivy League and other prestigious colleges opened their doors wider, and other historically black colleges became more competitive, Howard saw many of its potential recruits heading elsewhere.
In recent years Howard drew unwanted attention, first from anti-Semitic speeches on campus by a former spokesman for the Nation of Islam, and then for the subsequent discouragement of a lecture by a Jewish professor from Yale. It also drew criticism for handing out large amounts of money and other compensation as severance pay to administrators even as it was laying off workers and suspending raises to faculty members to avoid deficits.
As Mr. Swygert has tried to revitalize Howard, bringing in top students, and especially the Achievement Scholars, was a high priority.
"To say I'm excited -- that sound you hear is my foot tapping," he said in a telephone interview. "These are the strongest African-American youngsters, and they are highly sought after. They are very bright kids and they lend a lot to any environment they are in."
He attributed the university"s success to a more efficient recruiting strategy and to "Howard's being back as a hot school." He said he talked with virtually every Achievement Scholar candidate who visited the campus.
Frank Turner, a freshman finance major from Mobile, Ala., who was a National Merit Scholarship finalist as well as a National Achievement Scholar, said about 10 colleges offered him full scholarships. But he chose Howard, Mr. Turner said, after he got "a couple of nice phone calls," as well as the promise of a laptop computer and full tuition, room and board. "It was one of the better deals," he said. "And I felt there would basically be more opportunities in Washington for economics and political science work."
But even as he brings students like Mr. Turner to campus, Mr. Swygert has more to do. He must contain expenses, especially those at Howard's hospital, which faces many of the problems of hospitals that give care to inner-city residents.
Mr. Swygert's strategic plan calls for a consolidation of Howard's 16 schools into a more focused and manageable 11 by next fall. The university has already cut the number of employees by about a third over the last seven years, to 5,067 from 6,800, and is likely to squeeze further, he said.
He has spent $7 million on improving buildings and services on campus, catching up on deferred maintenance and installing computer links in faculty offices and dormitories.
He also plans a new center for the study of African-American heritage and culture in an effort to regain Howard's luster as a center of black intellectual thought. Howard lost ground even as Harvard and other universities continued to strengthen their black studies programs.
"Howard has a very good faculty, but it doesn't have the names that are getting the attention," said Frank Matthews, a senior scholar at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and publisher of the journal, Black Issues in Higher Education.
"Howard has not been able to keep the best and the brightest faculty," Mr. Matthews added. "Working at a black college has often been regarded as a hardship, because of the heavy teaching loads and the low salaries."
Mr. Swygert hopes to bring in additional private money to help attract faculty members and pay for programs. He is laying the groundwork for a major fund-raising drive to start later this year in an effort to bolster the university's $200 million endowment. Only 5 percent of Howard's 65,000 alumni donate money to the university. Mr. Swygert's goal is to raise that to 30 percent by 2001.
"When I came to Howard, I didn't find very much in the way of fund raising," he said, recalling that he had gone through a similar process when he was president of the State University of New York at Albany, which recently completed a $55 million fund-raising campaign that he initiated. "If I know one thing, I know how to raise money, and we'll be getting at it."
Mr. Matthews said that among black colleges, Howard had the best potential for alumni contributions, because with professional schools and other graduate programs, it had doctors, lawyers and other alumni who should be in a position to give. But he added that Howard alumni have been somewhat disgruntled in recent years, "bitter about their experiences at Howard, which has not enjoyed a reputation as a caring institution in the last two or three decades."
Some alumni, however, say that Mr. Swygert's progress is already making them feel more charitable.
Houston A. Baker, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania who graduated from Howard in 1965, said he and his wife, also a Howard graduate, now plan to raise their gifts to the university.
"I have given to Howard in the past," he said. "But until this point I never felt encouraged enough or felt that -- restricted or unrestricted -- the gifts would be managed well enough to make a difference. Now I do, and we will be giving significantly."
Howard's trustees express satisfaction, too.
"He has done exactly what we asked him to do," Harry J. Pearce, vice chairman of General Motors and a Howard trustee, said of Mr. Swygert.
Mr. Pearce, who headed the search committee that chose Mr. Swygert, said the committee wanted "a visionary, but one who also had an established track record" of running a university. "I couldn't be more pleased," he added.
Of course, not everything is fixed yet. But Mr. Swygert is upbeat.
"We've at least begun to address all these issues," he said. "I did it not because I'm a glutton for challenge, but because the board reached out to me with the hope that I really could get this place moving again. And I had been very, very fortunate. I've come home. I was raised at this university."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Inflation Data Add New Fuel As Dollar's Rally Continues

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar posted its fifth consecutive gain against the German mark yesterday and rose to a 45-month peak versus the Japanese yen after economic data in the United States soothed fears about inflation.
The dollar surged as high as 1.5973 marks, its highest level since July 1994, following the reports of subdued increases in consumer prices and retail sales in December. 
 "I think the dollar continues to benefit from strong economic growth and the perception of moderate to weak inflation in the United States," said John Nelson, a vice president at ABN-AMRO Bank in New York.
Comments from members of the German central bank council and from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin of the United States aided the dollar.
A Bundesbank council member, Helmut Hess, warned yesterday that the mark could weaken in the period leading up to European monetary union if investors switch their funds into other currencies.
Traders interpreted Mr. Hess's remark as an effort to mute speculation that the European central banks will intervene to support the mark.
His colleague Olaf Sievert also brightened the dollar's prospects. He said Germany's central bank would have no ground to raise interest rates in the near term and might even lower credit costs later.
In the United States, Mr. Rubin, for a second consecutive day, spoke in support of a strong dollar. But his remarks had little impact after giving the dollar a big lift on Monday.
The dollar rose to 1.5943 marks in late New York trading from 1.5886 late Monday. The dollar inched lower to 1.3761 Swiss francs from 1.3765 late Monday.
As the dollar staged its broad advance, the British pound fell to $1.6711 from $1.6739.
Against the yen, the dollar closed just shy of the psychologically important 117 level, ending at 116.93. The dollar ended Monday's session at 116.44 yen.
"A lot of people are very cautious about breaking above the 117 level, fearing Bank of Japan or Ministry of Finance intervention," said Jeffrey Yu, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New York.
The Canadian dollar fell to 74.030 United States cents, from 74.156 cents at Monday's close.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
U.S. public pension investors are eager pilgrims in Shanghai.

BYLINE: By Seth Faison 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
FOR a bunch of money managers with $234 billion to invest, China can look awfully tempting.
Shanghai is alive with entrepreneurial dynamism, and almost any visitor will be struck by the sheer abundance of building -- there are more than 22,000 construction sites here -- a visible symbol of the nation's locomotive-like economic growth. 
 A troupe of American pension-fund managers, including the huge California Public Employees Retirement System, or Calpers, popped into town yesterday to look for places to park some of their cash. By the end of the day, they were pretty taken with the place, but had no illusions about the challenges even the savviest investors face in China.
"Rarely have I been as excited as I was today," said Thomas E. Flanigan, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers Retirement System, which manages $65 billion. "This is where the growth is; this is where the future is. I've been in the investment arena 25 years, and I've never seen the kind of growth Shanghai has."
It is high time, Mr. Flanigan and other fund managers agreed, to allocate a greater share of assets to Asia generally and China specifically.
Calpers, America's largest pension fund, with $105 billion in assets, has $25 billion invested outside the United States, but mostly in Europe. Of the $7.7 billion it has invested in Asia, $5 billion is in Japan, and smaller amounts are in Hong Kong and Singapore.
"China is a place we feel we really have to be," said William D. Crist, president of Calpers. "We want to be here."
And yet it's difficult for responsible investors to be here. Even for fund managers willing to stretch the boundaries of their normal investing precautions, China offers precious few public places to park their cash. As many others eager to capitalize on China's economic boom have discovered, financial reporting is often unreliable at Chinese companies still mired in old-fashioned systems of management.
China's stock markets, though they have come alive in recent months, are still composed of companies that are opaque in how they divvy up profit. And the markets are small by American standards.
"The B shares are still so illiquid," said Patricia A. Small, treasurer of the Regents of the University of California, referring to the dollar-denominated shares available to non-Chinese investors. "When you have a large public fund, you need liquidity."
Matt Fong, the California State Treasurer, who is leading the group of two dozen public-sector money managers on a 12-day trip through Asia, said the solution in China might be private equity deals. Even then, relying on a partner to find direct investments in small- and medium-sized companies is a challenge.
Mr. Crist said Calpers made its first direct investment in China last year, agreeing to sink $100 million into a partnership with a Taiwan-based investment company called the China Development Corporation, to look for cash-hungry enterprises in southern China. Yet so far, he said, only $1 million had actually been placed in a local company, because it was harder than expected to find financially responsible takers.
That reality didn't seem to dampen the enthusiasm of other pension-fund managers.
"I am absolutely overwhelmed by the degree of activity going on in Shanghai," said Rich Rose, chief investment officer for the San Diego County Employees Retirement Association. "We don't want to wait for the listed markets to provide the kind of assurances we need; we want to get in now."

HEADLINE: What Crisis?

BYLINE: By Richard C. Leone; Richard C. Leone is president of the Twentieth Century Fund.

 BODY:
Critics of Social Security claim that the system is near collapse. Privatizing the system, they argue, will give everybody better protection in old age. But without a complete understanding of what Social Security already provides to Americans, how can we know whether to junk it in favor of something else?
First, despite what its critics claim, Social Security is not similar to a savings or investment program whose purpose is to yield the biggest return. Social Security is more like a disability and life insurance policy that provides vital protections to virtually every member of our society. Currently, seven million survivors of deceased workers and four million disabled Americans receive income support. 
 The Social Security Administration calculates the value of the disability insurance as the equivalent of a $203,000 policy in the private sector; for a 27-year-old average-wage worker with two children, Social Security provides the equivalent of a $295,000 life insurance policy. The total value of these two policies nationally is about $12.1 trillion, more than all the private life insurance currently in force.
Second, Social Security provides a lifetime retirement annuity whose benefits rise with inflation. Many corporate pensions run out after 20 years, and most are not adjusted for inflation. While there is a lot of loose talk about greedy geezers living luxuriously on the backs of their impoverished children, the facts tell a quite different story. Without Social Security, approximately half the elderly in America would fall below the poverty line.
The notion that these basic protections would be unnecessary if we all saved more money is simply false. The truth is that neither of these protections is available in the private market at a price that the vast majority of Americans can afford.
Social Security works because virtually all of us belong to it and pay into it. Social Security, after all, does not consist of a bunch of piggy banks with our names on them. Our pooled contributions insure that almost every senior citizen receives a minimum income.
Although some of us need the protection more than others, all of us get some benefits. It is the nature of such pooled plans that both the most fortunate among us (the wealthy) and the least fortunate (those who die young and without a family) get the least from the program.
It is a fallacy that everyone can do better than average if we take control away from the Government. Averages exist because some of us do worse and some of us better. In the brave new world of individual accounts, each winner would be matched by a loser. The only way we can insure that every citizen has a minimal retirement benefit is by requiring that we all participate in the Social Security system.
Though the search continues, there is no free lunch. Advocates of privatizing Social Security dangle the prospect of riches in front of impressionable young workers, but hide from them its high costs and risks.
The privatization plans proposed by two minority factions of the Advisory Council on Social Security come with an enormous transition cost. One plan would require increased taxes amounting to $6.5 trillion during the next 72 years; the other would raise payroll taxes by 1.6 percent, costing American families $13 billion each year.
Social Security has some minor problems, but faces no life and death crisis. In fact, without any changes at all, the system will be able to pay full benefits for the next 30 years and more than 70 percent of those benefits for 75 years.
Moreover, the entire Advisory Council agreed that modest changes -- such as including state and local government workers in the system -- could eliminate a fair share of the projected gap between revenues and benefits.
Thus, as this debate continues, let us agree that we cannot all be above average, and that when it comes to benefits we should compare apples to apples. We shouldn't give up a critical universal insurance program for no insurance at all. And we should not compare a guaranteed lifetime inflation-adjusted annuity to a 401(k) plan or brokerage account.

HEADLINE: Car Dealerships Are Facing Consolidation And Change

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Auto dealerships are rapidly beginning to issue stock or to be bought by publicly traded companies, a trend that could transform one of the last bastions of mom-and-pop businesses in American retailing.
Republic Industries said today that it would pay $200 million in stock for seven dealerships in Florida and New York, a day after it had agreed to pay $100 million for seven other dealerships in the Southwest. Three chains of dealerships -- Cross-Continent Auto Retailers Inc., United Auto Group Inc. and Lithia Motors Inc. -- have gone public in the last several months, and several more chains are said by investment bankers to be considering similar moves. And in the last month, the Ford Motor Company has largely abandoned its opposition to public ownership of its dealerships, the last big auto maker do so. 
 "I don't think there's any question you're going to see more dealerships traded on markets," John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, said in an interview last week.
The chains that have issued stock are using part of the proceeds to buy more dealerships, in what could be the early stages of a consolidation of the nation's 21,000 dealerships.
Defenders of corporate ownership say that car buyers will soon find more professional managers, more consistent customer service standards and slightly lower price markups. Family-owned dealerships have long had trouble recruiting professional managers, who tend to see promotions inevitably going to family members. And corporations can borrow money at considerably lower interest rates than can most car dealers, a saving that might result in lower markups on cars, more investment in showrooms or both.
"We do have some economies of size," said Carl Spielvogel, the chairman and chief executive of United Auto, which runs 40 dealerships. "We will attempt to pass that on to customers in terms of better value."
But many traditional dealers are concerned by the arrival of big companies in their cozy industry. They warn that corporations could buy several dealerships in a city, for example, and use their greater market share to charge larger markups. And dealers question whether corporate managers will be able to provide personal service.
"I think a private dealer like myself has to provide better service; he can't compete with the deep pockets of the big organizations," said Christopher E. Smith, a Ford dealer in Platte City, Mo.
Several trends are driving the move to corporate ownership. The growth of Internet buying services has forced dealers to compete on price with dealerships in other cities, a competition that gives an advantage to well-financed corporations. Big companies can buy advertising in bulk at considerable discounts. And with the owners of thousands of dealerships close to retirement, many dealerships are for sale.
The ability of most corporations to borrow money at lower interest rates than independent dealers is important. Dealerships basically operate by borrowing millions of dollars to buy cars from the auto makers, and then repay their loans with the money they collect from selling cars. Corporations that borrow money in commercial paper markets end up paying interest rates that can be 3 percentage points lower than the rates charged to dealers by the financing arms of the auto makers, which now dominate this business.
But perhaps the most important development is that the auto makers themselves, after years of preferring to deal with many tiny dealerships scattered across the country, are beginning to accept big corporations as their franchisees.
The Chrysler Corporation began the trend a year ago when it granted a new-car dealership to Carmax, the used-car arm of Circuit City Stores Inc., and when it set rules last autumn allowing public ownership of its dealerships, provided that no company buys more than 10. G.M. quietly amended its franchise agreements last summer to accommodate corporate ownership. Foreign auto makers have been moving in the same direction.
And Ford, long the most reluctant auto maker to accept public ownership of dealerships, began overhauling its policies last month. Because many chains of dealerships include at least one Ford outlet, Ford's hostility to initial public offerings of dealerships and corporate ownership had previously made them difficult. Ford announced on Dec. 20 that it had reached a general agreement for Republic to begin buying its dealerships.
Ford executives said they were impressed by Republic's plans to try to improve customer satisfaction through better staff training and other steps. Beginning with a deal in Ohio right after Christmas, Republic has now announced five deals to buy a total of 22 new-car dealerships. John Ochs, a spokesman for Ford, said today that the auto maker had also given Republic its permission to buy two more dealerships in Florida.
Buying new-car dealerships is only part of Republic's strategy. The company is also developing a network of used-car lots. By adding new-car dealerships, which receive a lot of used cars as trade-ins, Republic can help fill its used-car operations with inventory, said Thomas A. Gruber, a senior vice president of Republic's auto retailing arm, Autonation. Republic has also bought Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. and has an agreement to buy National Car Rental System Inc., which will give it an additional source of used cars. Based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Republic is publicly traded but is controlled by H. Wayne Huizenga, the billionaire who built Blockbuster Video.
Detroit's Big Three auto makers want to see a consolidation of their dealerships. The duplication of staffs and other expenses at dealerships -- there are 60 Ford and 24 Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in the Los Angeles area, for example -- has driven up the cost of distributing cars.
But the rise of corporate ownership could also hurt profits at the auto makers' financing subsidiaries, which do a good business lending money to dealerships. And if a single company wound up with 150 or so dealerships, it could offer a complete sales network to companies like Fiat that are not currently in the American auto market.
"That to me is the greatest potential downside" for the American auto makers, said Nicholas Colas, an analyst at CS First Boston.

Gold Prices Sink $5 on Fear Of Selling by Central Banks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Gold prices posted their biggest one-day loss in 10 months in New York yesterday, reaching the lowest point in more than three years, because of renewed fears that European central banks would sell gold and because of more evidence that inflation remained tame.
Gold for February delivery tumbled $5 an ounce, to $357.70, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex division, the lowest price since Oct. 4, 1993, and the biggest daily drop since last March. The March silver contract fell 4.2 cents, to $4.675 an ounce. 
 The central bank of the Netherlands said yesterday that it had sold 300 tons of gold last year, a fifth of its reserves. Traders are concerned that European central banks will sell gold as part of a push to meet entry requirements for economic and monetary union in 1999.
The sales can be used to help reduce government debt to bring it into line with requirements.
"The Netherlands news is the important thing; that explains why the price is low," said Marty McNeill, a trader at Sinclair Group in New York. "The question is, who's the next one."
Gold also fell after further signs that inflation was under control. Some investors buy gold when inflation threatens to erode the value of other assets, like bonds.
The Labor Department said that American consumer prices, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.6 percent last year. That tied the gain in 1994 as the smallest in the so-called core inflation rate since 1965.
Coffee prices jumped after exchange inventories posted a surprisingly large drop, renewing concern that supplies would stay tight.
Coffee stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange fell by 9,070 132-pound bags, to 23,388 bags, last week, the exchange said on Monday.
Coffee for March delivery surged 3.75 cents, to $1.222 a pound.
Orange juice rose for a second day on speculation that freezing weather could reach Florida's orange groves , damaging the fruit and cutting output.
March orange juice rose 2.8 cents, to 82.35 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange, the highest price since Dec. 26.

After a War, a New Normalcy: Parking in Manhattan

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Taking a break from his job parking cars in a midtown Manhattan garage, Amir Behic drew slashes with a black pen across the weather map of his Croatian newspaper, circling cities and sketching new borders as he explained in halting English how the Yugoslav army surrounded his town four years ago.
It was in the early stages of conflict in the Balkans. Mr. Behic, 30, a Muslim from Bihac, an economic center in northwestern Bosnia minutes from the Croatian border, remembers the details. "The grenades started July 6, 1992," he said. "You couldn't go outside the city." 
 Now an assistant manager of the Edison parking garage under the Grace building on West 43d Street, Mr. Behic often finds himself talking about his war-torn native land. "When I say I'm from Bosnia, everybody wants to talk, to hear about the experience," he said.
In Bosnia, Mr. Behic worked as a producer at the local television station. He also produced records in a small studio at his parents' home, where he lived and kept a collection of professional-quality recording equipment.
"I was very satisfied before the war, really I can say I was happy," Mr. Behic said. "But war changed everything."
Before the conflict, the town of Bihac had an ethnically mixed population. With the fighting came ethnic mistrust. Many of the Serbs moved away from the town. Power lines were cut. There were shortages of food and other necessities.
A local army formed to fight the invaders. "That's not a professional army," Mr. Behic explained. "That was people who come from the street, like people who come every day here in the garage."
Mr. Behic continued to work at the television station. "When something happened on the front line, we would go and make pictures," he said. He also worked with local musicians, recording music and videos about their war experiences.
Death became commonplace. "Everything that is normal in normal life, it is not normal in war," Mr. Behic said. "I lost so many friends in the war." His best friend was killed by a land mine.
By the fall of 1995, Croatian forces had liberated the town of Bihac. But in December, Mr. Behic decided to join his aunt and uncle who had come to New York in 1994 and had just moved to Houston. He arrived as a refugee through an international rescue operation.
Mr. Behic, who could not speak English, got a job carrying groceries to customers' cars in the parking lot of a Houston supermarket. He said he was paid very little, and when his aunt and uncle moved back to New York, he joined them.
"Here it's better," he said. "You have more opportunities."
Shortly after the move, opportunity came his way. His uncle, a gynecologist, had helped a Bosnian woman in New York with her pregnancy and the woman introduced Mr. Behic to FEGS, an affiliate of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The association paid for a three-month course to train him as a garage attendant. It taught basic English and how to recognize the makes and models of cars driven in the United States. He graduated last spring and now works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week.
He is responsible for adding up the day's receipts. "I do all the paperwork, balancing the reports," he said. "The balance must be zero -- if you have minus or plus, something is wrong."
He lives with his aunt and uncle in an apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, but he misses his homeland, especially his favorite food, cevapi, spicy minced meat stuffed in a special bread, which he cannot find in New York.
He is grateful for the job and thrilled to be working, but sometimes his green eyes grow red-rimmed with frustration. "I didn't come to spend my time for nothing," he said. "I didn't use welfare. I don't like to take money if I don't work. I am satisfied over here but I am not happy. This job is good. But I want to do something more."

HEADLINE: THE WHITMAN AGENDA: THE SPEECH;
Whitman Vows to Cut Car Insurance Rates by Curbing Suits

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said today that New Jersey drivers have for too long paid the nation's highest automobile insurance rates and proposed legislation that would allow insurers to offer limited coverage for lower premiums.
In her third annual address to the State Legislature, Governor Whitman praised her administration for a range of accomplishments from cutting income taxes to imposing statewide school curriculum standards, but she acknowledged that bringing down auto insurance rates remained one of her biggest challenges. 
 By vowing to lower auto insurance premiums, Mrs. Whitman sought to address a problem that her Democratic opponents promised to make a campaign issue in this year's gubernatorial race. In her 50-minute speech, the Governor also struck several other themes to appeal to voters, from the environment to education to crime.
The auto insurance proposal would require insurers to offer four options to drivers, all of which would continue to provide them with $250,000 of coverage for medical expenses and some lost wages. To varying degrees under the plans, drivers would be able to reduce their premiums by abandoning or restricting their ability to seek damages in court for pain and suffering.
Mrs. Whitman said she would also seek to eliminate surcharges that insurance companies impose on bad drivers and on new drivers. And she said she would eliminate automatic annual rate increases now given insurance companies by the state.
In the most recent survey of auto insurance rates, in 1994, the average premium in New Jersey was $964 -- $314 above the national average, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. In New York, the average premium was $870, the fifth highest in the country, while Connecticut's $863 was the sixth highest.
According to Whitman aides, a motorist who now pays the average of $536 for the minimum mandatory policy would save up to $187 under the Governor's proposal by choosing the least expensive option.
Noting that various special interest groups have been successful in curbing efforts to bring down auto insurance rates in the past, Governor Whitman conceded that she faced an uphill fight in winning legislative approval for the plan.
But the Governor said she is ready. "Make no mistake," she said in her address, "enacting true auto insurance reform will not be easy. Powerful special interests are already mobilizing to preserve the status quo. But if they want a fight, we'll give it to them."
Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, said that the Legislature would take a close look at the proposal. While Mr. Collins said he did not anticipate objections from lawmakers over the Governor's plan to eliminate surcharges and curb fraud and abuse, he said that restricting coverage would not win easy approval.
"I don't know if that is the best way to solve it," he said. "I think that we have to be very careful. I am always concerned when you deny people the right to sue. But I understand that in some cases, it is for the betterment of society."
Democratic lawmakers attacked the plan, saying that auto insurance rates were high because the Whitman administration approved rate increases for 10 insurance companies, in addition to the automatic annual increases that range from three percent to five percent.
"We have higher rates because the Governor allowed the insurance rates to increase," said Joseph V. Doria, a Democrat from Hudson County and the Assembly Minority Leader.
Mr. Doria said that he was concerned that drivers would choose the least expensive option without fully understanding the impact of having less coverage and waiving their right to sue. "You will get the $1.98 policy that covers nothing," Mr. Doria said. "You will find yourself in a desperate situation. People will take the lowest policy and God forbid they would get hurt."
But Governor Whitman said that New Jersey had the highest auto insurance rates in the nation because "of years of control from Trenton."
And John K. Tiene, executive director of the New Jersey Insurance News Service, a lobbying organization sponsored by 21 auto insurance companies, called the Whitman proposal a "bold attempt" to address significant problems facing the auto insurance system. "We have advocated for many years that motorists should have more direct control over how they spend their insurance dollars," he said.
But the reasons for the high rates are more complex than the Democrats or Governor Whitman suggest. New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country, and it also is the most litigious. Robert Hunter, insurance director of the Consumer Federation of America, said that the high density of traffic on the state's roadways also contribute to high rates.
Governor Whitman is the latest in a long line of governors who have tried to bring down New Jersey's auto insurance premiums. Former Gov. Jim Florio took perhaps one of the boldest steps when he eliminated the $222 surcharge imposed on all drivers to pay for a bad-driver insurance pool. He ordered the insurance companies to pick up the costs of the pool, known as the Joint Underwriting Association, whose debt burden had exceeded $1 billion. Several insurance companies balked at the plan, and challenged it in court.
Harrison J. Gordon, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, said that the Governor's plan would create two classes of motorists and force some residents to pay for access to the court system.
"The Governor's plan shuts the courthouse door for poor, working class and middle class New Jerseyans who, in an effort to reduce their insurance premiums, could choose policies that do not offer adequate protection in the event of an accident," Mr. Gordon said.
All four of Governor Whitman's proposed options would retain a central feature of the state's existing no-fault insurance system -- the $250,000 in so-called "personal injury protection" for medical costs, some lost wages and other services. That coverage is the nation's second highest, behind only Michigan's unlimited protection for a policy holder's medical bills and lost wages.
The main variant in Mrs. Whitman's plan deals with a motorist's right to sue beyond the $250,000 for medical bills and lost wages. These are the key provisions in each plan:
*Option 1 -- No right to sue the other driver for pain and suffering. The policy holder can sue for at least $15,000 in lost income and unreimbursed medical expenses. Projected premium saving: 20 to 25 percent.
*Option 2 -- No right to sue for pain and suffering. But policy holders could collect a pre-set pain-and-suffering benefit, depending on the injury. The policy holder could sue for economic losses. Projected premium saving: 5 to 10 percent.
*Option 3 -- Similar to existing policies of 88 percent of New Jersey drivers. But it narrows the types of injuries eligible for pain and suffering suits to those causing death, serious impairment of a bodily function or permanent and serious disfigurement. This restriction on pain and suffering suit is modeled after insurance laws in Michigan. Projected premium savings: 5 to 10 percent.
*Option 4 -- Unlimited right to sue for pain and suffering, regardless of the severity of the injury. Premiums will increase, except for motorists who currently have no restrictions on their right to sue. Premiums might decrease because of the new plan's crackdown on fraud, the end of surcharges and other cost-control proposals.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI AGENDA: THE SPEECH;
With a Nod to Oprah, Mayor Addresses Council

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
With a wireless microphone on his tie and an 83-minute speech firmly embedded in his memory, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday took the City Council on a lengthy tour of his first three years in office and promised a set of appealing spending plans that clearly signaled the beginning of an election year.
"I think we've effected more changes than any administration in the history of New York City in three years," he said. "But I can assure you there's a lot more to be done. There's a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for doing it. And if you think that we've made a lot of changes in the last three years, just hang on." 
 The annual address to the Council, known as the State of the City address, was one of the longest of his political life, and it touched on most of the Mayor's favorite topics: crime reduction, welfare reform, the value of immigration, the protection of children, the revival of the city's spirit. It also ventured into some new areas, from a freight tunnel under New York Harbor to tens of millions of dollars for new reading and computer programs in the schools.
Much of the text of the speech was familiar, but the wireless microphone gave an intentionally bravura feeling to the Mayor's performance, allowing him to roam freely through the front of the Council chamber in the style of Oprah Winfrey.
Though the lack of a teleprompter made the speech seem almost off the cuff, it was actually carefully choreographed and discussed at great length with the Mayor's political aides. It did not contain the one big new idea of the kind that marked last year's speech, in which he announced a dramatic reorganization of the city's child welfare system. Rather, it was a collection of smaller, easily digestible proposals that either the Mayor or other officials have discussed in the past, many of which seemed intended to shore up potential political weaknesses and to appeal to voting groups that he will need for his re-election bid this year.
After leaving the lectern to embrace the families of two slain police officers and a woman who found a job after leaving the city's workfare program, the Mayor focused most of his attention on education and economic development.
He said, for instance, that he would spend about $4 million to study the best location for a freight rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey, a familiar and complicated concept, as well as an associated deepwater port somewhere in New York Harbor. The city has estimated that a large new port and tunnel could create more than 40,000 new jobs.
He asked the Municipal Assistance Corporation to make available $125 million in city money to provide six hours of additional reading instruction a week to grade-school students, just a week after his political opponents attacked him over declining reading scores in the city schools. The city will also spend up to $150 million to buy 40,000 personal computers for the schools, and Mr. Giuliani committed himself to restoring arts education programs.
Finally, in effect acknowledging that many nonwhite neighborhoods remain suspicious of police officers, he vowed that the Police Department would seek an increased level of respect and courtesy across the city.
"The Police Commissioner is making respect, ending brutality, violence, disrespect, as important a part of the evaluation of a police officer as reducing crime," he said, "and I know that will make a significant difference."
The list of programs drew praise even from some of the Mayor's usual critics.
Mark Green, the city's Public Advocate, said, "Who can possibly be against reducing police brutality, growing jobs and increasing reading scores for kids?"
Gail B. Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens Committee for Children, said that some of the education proposals were "terrific" but that she wanted to make certain that they would be backed up with a long-term financial commitment.
His challengers, of course, derided the speech as opportunism flavored with show biz.
"He needed to appear to be a softer, warmer more sensitive Rudy Giuliani, given the fact that most people think he's mean-spirited, and accurately so," said Councilman Sal F. Albanese, a Democratic contender for mayor. "This talk-show atmosphere -- this touchy-feely kind of demeanor -- plays into the image he's trying to convey."
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President and another mayoral candidate, criticized the Republican Mayor for stealing Democratic ideas on education and for not addressing such issues as AIDS, homelessness and public health in the speech.
By mayoral standards, however, the speech was unusually expansive, attacking only the Port Authority and criticizing Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to reduce property taxes. Mr. Giuliani liberally dispensed credit to unions and the Council for such programs as workfare and school construction. In the education centerpiece of the speech, he renewed his call for police control over school security but devoted some unusually soaring oratory to the restoration of programs in the arts, saying students "need to be opened up to beauty."
The more strongly he committed himself personally to improving the schools, in fact, the harder it seemed to become for him to say he has no control over the education system.
"Just like we've become a national leader and model for the country and some of the rest of the world in reducing crime and improving quality of life," he said, "we have to do the same thing for education."
Much of the speech was laced with elevating metaphors involving the rising sun of a new century shining on New York. But at one point he made it clear that such earthbound matters as his re-election are not that far from mind.
"On the morning of Jan. 1, 2000," he observed, "when I wake up in Gracie Mansion . . . " Then, he corrected himself: "I slipped," he said. "Let me go back to the text."

HEADLINE: THE WHITMAN AGENDA: REACTION;
Democrats Hear an Address And See Only a Candidate

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
If there was any question about how closely Gov. Christine Todd Whitman analyzed last November's election results -- in which a strong turnout in urban areas helped cause her party's candidates for the White House and the United States Senate to lose by wide margins -- the answer came today.
Mrs. Whitman made no mention of her upcoming re-election bid, nor did she make any reference to the election last November. But with 10 months to go before voters decide whether to return the Republican Governor to the State House for a second term, Mrs. Whitman used her annual address to the Legislature today to lay the foundation for her campaign, citing her record on the economy, taxes, job growth and education, as she outlined what she called "three years of activity and accomplishment." 
 And one of the most striking aspects of Mrs. Whitman's unofficial campaign kick-off was the amount of time she devoted to urban initiatives, as well as the number of people from racial and ethnic minority groups whom she singled out in her speech.
In addition to outlining an expanded housing program and an effort to revitalize depressed cities, Mrs. Whitman called on a black former welfare recipient, a Hispanic educator and a black minister to stand up inside the Assembly chambers, as she recognized their individual achievements and the role that her programs had played in their lives.
Noting the Governor's apparent appeals to urban-based voters, Representative Robert E. Andrews, a likely candidate for the Democratic nomination, said, "She read the election results, didn't she?"
Mr. Andrews, of Camden, was also talking very much like a candidate today, although he said he would not make it official until next month. He asserted that voters in urban areas are much more concerned about jobs, health care and the quality of their local schools than the rosy picture painted by the Governor.
"She seems not to be living in the world that we're living in," Mr. Andrews said.
But even the Democratic politicians who attended the speech conceded that Mrs. Whitman was as smooth as ever in delivering her third annual address on the status of the state, and they acknowledged that she will be difficult to beat on Election Day.
"She's well-positioned going into the election," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli. Lower income taxes "are certainly a serious development," Mr. Torricelli said. "But the critical problems of rising property taxes and the aging infrastructure are still not being addressed."
As could have been expected, Democrats criticized the highlights of the Governor's address, as State Senator John H. Adler called her pledge to lower the state's high auto insurance rates "a bare-bones policy," and State Senator Richard J. Codey referred to it as "the equivalent of changing one spark plug when the engine needs an overhaul."
Throughout the day, as they conducted interviews just outside the Assembly chambers and issued statements around the State House, it was clear that the Democrats who are likely to run for governor are planning to attack Mrs. Whitman on issues related to job creation, education and property taxes.
"Today is her day," said Thomas Byrne, chairman of the state's Democratic party. However, he said, "As the campaign get's going, it will be a more level playing field."
Although the Governor has repeatedly pointed out that the average property tax increase in the state has been low under her watch, James E. McGreevey, a State Senator and the Mayor of Woodbridge, echoed other Democrats when he called the state's property tax rates a "crisis." Mr. McGreevey, who is also expected to announce his candidacy for governor sometime next month, called Mrs. Whitman "a gracious woman" who has exhibited "a fundamental refusal to tackle the tough issues of New Jersey."
Another potential Democratic candidate, George Zoffinger, a former State Commerce Commissioner, issued a statement criticizing the Governor for failing to create 450,000 new jobs in the state, as she earlier promised. In her address today, Mrs. Whitman noted that state has 150,000 new jobs since she took office.
Though the Democrats are facing an uphill battle in the governor's race and are also the minority party in the State Senate and the Assembly, they did not carry themselves like underdogs here today. Democratic officials packed into the Assembly gallery, sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with their Republican counterparts, and for the most part they appeared distinctly happy.
But most of the good humor did not come from talk about the Governor's address and the gubernatorial race, it came from plans for the big party that most of them will attend next week in Washington, when President Clinton is sworn in again.

The Rise and Fall of the Brooklyn Waterfront

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:

EARLY 1800's -- Brooklyn is incorporated as a village in 1816 and construction begins on the Brooklyn Navy Yard in Wallabout Bay. After the Erie Canal opens in 1825, waterfront warehouses and factories begin to appear along the East River.
 
 MID-1800's -- Ports in Manhattan become overcrowded and more companies move to Brooklyn. 

1922 -- A Port Authority plan calls for a rail-freight bridge from Bay Ridge in Brooklyn to Bayonne, N.J.
 
 1950's -- After World War II, waterfront businesses begin to leave Brooklyn as traditional cargo shipping gives way to giant container ships. Because Brooklyn lacks inexpensive land for container storage, much of the region's shipping moves to New Jersey.
 
 1966 -- The Brooklyn Navy Yard, which at its height in World War II employed 70,000 people, closes and is sold to the city two years later.
 
 1981 -- In a move toward reviving the waterfront, the Red Hook Marine Terminal is dedicated, becoming the only port in the city where cargo containers are unloaded from ships. But after initial success, the volume of cargo traffic plummets and subsidies are used to generate new business.
 
 1988 -- Trying to revive the moribund Erie Basin south of Red Hook, the Port Authority opens the $25 million Fishport to attract fishing boats, buyers and fish-processing businesses. But little business materializes and the project is abandoned.
 
 1989 -- New York sets up a cocoa port on the 39th Street wharf in the Sunset Park waterfront area.
 
 1990's -- Representative Jerrold L. Nadler urges that silt clogging New York Harbor be deposited behind concrete dikes between piers on the Brooklyn waterfront to create a major new container port.
 
 1996 -- The city's Economic Development Corporation announces a stopgap deal to provide two shipping companies with incentives to prevent them from moving from Brooklyn to New Jersey.

HEADLINE: White House Offers New Ties to District

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The White House today unveiled a sweeping plan to rescue the nation's capital by transferring to the Federal Government many responsibilities that the city government proved unable to perform.
After two years of efforts by Federal lawmakers and local leaders to solve the problems, the Administration's proposals would fundamentally change the Federal Government's relationship with the city for the first time since the District won home rule almost 25 years ago. 
 The changes, which White House officials said would be included in the 1998 budget President Clinton sends to Congress next month, would include relieving the city of an assortment of responsibilities, including operating prisons, collecting taxes and improving roads. The Federal Government would also assume an unfunded pension liability of $4.3 billion for city workers and would increase the Government's share of Medicaid expenses.
The Administration plan is the latest in a series of efforts to save the capital from virtual insolvency and to reconstruct its shattered public services. Since 1995, the District has operated under a Federal control board created to oversee all aspects of the local government. So far, it has reined in spending of all city agencies, stripped the school board of most powers, pushed aside senior administrators and reduced the size of city government by thousands of workers. But like many of the city's elected officials, the control board members argued for a greater role for the Federal Government to relieve the city of responsibilities that are normally assumed by state government. The plan announced today, Administration officials said, was the first step.
Overall, the Administration plan would cost the Federal Government $3.9 billion over five years, or about $339 million more than it would pay the District under the existing arrangement of annual payments to the city, largely for land that cannot be taxed.
"This is without a doubt the bold est plan for the District that any President has ever proposed," Franklin Raines, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at a news conference at the White House. "We want to revitalize the city as the nation's capital, and we want to improve prospects for home rule to succeed."
Local officials, including Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., agreed that the White House plan would strengthen home rule, by making city government more efficient, polishing the city's image to Wall Street investors and perhaps ending the need for Congressional subcommittees to approve the city budget each year.
Mr. Barry called the plan "a good first step." But he tempered his appreciation of Mr. Clinton's efforts by criticizing him for waiting so long to act. "In the last four years he has not done very much to help the District," Mr. Barry said of the President at his own news conference. "This is a beginning to make up for that lack of action."
Further, the White House initiative was immediately attacked by Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, who was recently named chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee for the District. Calling the plan a "great rip-off," he said that any proposal that increases the Federal deficit "is a nonstarter with me."
A spokesman for Newt Gingrich said that the Speaker generally favored increasing Federal support for the District but that he had not been consulted by White House officials who formulated the plan presented today and thus had no knowledge of the details. Like many Federal lawmakers, Mr. Gingrich has criticized local leaders, saying their policies have contributed to the city's problems.
While the White House proposals would take over some of the responsibilities that are draining the city of almost $1 billion each year, they did not address other issues that have contributed to the decline of the city, like high crime rates and poorly managed schools.
Foremost among the neglected issues is a strategy to stem the exodus of residents and businesses to the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, a steady migration that continues to shrink the city's tax base. Washington's current population of 543,000 residents is its lowest since 1933.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who appeared with Mr. Raines, said officials were working on "a set of proposals with respect to tax incentives" that would reflect the Administration's general policies of aid to urban areas, which include programs like community development banks and empowerment zones.
Mr. Raines said the Administration plan gives the District "a very major opportunity to be able to get its house in order and begin to stem the flow of people leaving."
Nor does the plan introduce any mechanism that would enable the city to broaden its limited taxing powers, a common complaint of city officials who cite the fact that two-thirds of the city's work force, about 300,000 people, work in Washington but live outside its borders, paying taxes to other jurisdictions.
Mr. Barry said he would "never stop fighting" for a commuter tax, and the District's lone delegate to Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton, said she would press ahead with legislation to cap the Federal income tax for District residents at 15 percent.
It was not clear how the new arrangement would affect efforts by some city officials to achive statehood for the District. Over the years, Mr. Barry and other elected leaders fought for the right to perform such functions as operating prisons and maintaining courts as a way to convince Federal lawmakers that the city should become the 51st state of New Columbia. And President Clinton recently expressed his support, albeit mildly, for District statehood.
But by stripping the city of the very functions it sought, the Administration plan would appear to push the idea far into the future.
Mr. Barry, who has served as mayor for all but four years since 1978, disagreed. He said the Administration plan "enhances" the possibility of statehood, insisting, "Part of the argument against it was, can you afford it? This makes it affordable."
As outlined, the five-year plan includes $917 million to increase the Federal Government's share of Medicaid payments to 70 percent, from 50 percent; $891 million to operate prisons, $885 million for prison renovations and construction, $681 million to operate the District court system, $125 million for roads and bridges and $117 million to take over income tax collecting.
But Administration officials cautioned that the plan would proceed only if District leaders, under the guidance of the two-year-old financial control board, continue to press for management reforms and spending cuts throughout the city government. Mr. Raines said that the plan includes "tough covenants" to keep pressure on the city to act wisely.
"We view this plan as a plan of tough love," Mr. Raines said. "We want to help the District, but we will insist that the District take specific steps to help itself."

HEADLINE: THE PATAKI AGENDA: THE OVERVIEW;
Pataki Budget Tries New Tack

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a $66.1 billion budget today that relies heavily on strong economic growth and cuts to higher education and health care programs to finance additional spending on public schools and prison construction as well as a new round of tax cuts.
At the start of a year in which he will begin work on his 1998 re-election campaign, Mr. Pataki unveiled a plan that offers a clear blueprint of his political and fiscal priorities -- mainly reducing taxes, fighting crime and helping local school districts. 
 Under the plan, he would provide additional money for public schools, for 7,000 new prison cells and begin a multiyear plan to cut taxes on property, inheritances and certain businesses. He would pay for it all with new revenues from a buoyant economy, a $1.3 billion surplus from the current year and deep cuts to Medicaid, the state and Federal health care program for the poor and middle class, as well as to the State University and City University of New York systems.
But in a departure from his first two budget proposals, which called for deep reductions in a broad array of state programs, the Governor's newest fiscal plan would maintain spending on many services at or slightly above current levels.
Indeed, having successfully pushed the Legislature to reduce the portion of the budget financed by state taxes during his first two years in office, Mr. Pataki conceded today that his third budget would probably result in an increase in this spending.
He called for cutting spending from state taxes by $56 million to $32.8 billion, or a cut of just two-tenths of 1 percent. The Legislature almost invariably adds spending to governors' budgets, and Mr. Pataki said it was likely that that would happen again with this budget, meaning that the total spending would probably go up.
But even as Mr. Pataki called for his largest spending budget yet, his plan came under sharp attack. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani called the plan to cut property taxes unfair to the city. Health care industry officials said the Medicaid cuts would drive urban hospitals to the brink of insolvency, and educators argued that the higher education cuts would prevent poor students from attending public colleges.
These attacks presage a fierce battle over the plan in the Legislature in the coming months. Last year, the Legislature enacted the latest state budget in the nation's history after making substantial changes to the Governor's original proposal. With several other contentious issues facing the legislators, including changes in welfare and rent-control regulations, most legislators are predicting that this year's fight could be every bit as protracted. The deadline for passing the budget is April 1, which the Legislature has missed for 12 years running.
As a sign of just how bitter the process may be, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat who will be Mr. Pataki's major adversary in the budget talks, did not even attend his budget speech today, though a front-row seat was reserved for him. His aides said Mr. Silver had a previously scheduled meeting to attend.
In a 35-minute speech that echoed the major themes of his third address to the Legislature last week, Mr. Pataki said the tightfisted spending policies and tax cuts he ushered into policy beginning in the tightfisted spending policies and tax cuts he ushered into policy beginning in 1994 have brought the state back from the brink of fiscal disaster and made it possible to expand select programs.
"Over the last two years, New York State has changed course," he said. "This new course had placed us in the midst of a great comeback, and placed us on the path to returning our state to its proper role as leader among the states."
But groups that monitor the state's spending said the Governor's proposal relies too heavily on optimistic economic projections, particularly for Wall Street, and does not do enough to solve the state's longstanding habit of spending more than it collects. They charged that the plan's tax cut provisions, which would reduce state revenues by more than $2 billion over four years, could create huge fiscal problems if the economy stalled.
"It's fiscally irresponsible," said Cynthia B. Green, vice president for state studies with the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that monitors government spending. "He spoke of a balanced budget. That's not the case at all."
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, said: "I'm concerned about the long-term implications. Historically, Wall Street has not had continued long-term growth at such a strong rate."
But Mr. Pataki said his plan was not based solely on a booming stock market, which he said provided a relatively small part of total state spending. Even without this year's record market performance, Mr. Pataki said, the state would have ended the year with a surplus.
Under the Governor's plan, spending from all state funds would increase by $1.4 billion to $66.1 billion, a 2.2 percent increase.
The Governor's deepest cuts would be to Medicaid, which he would reduce by $913 million through reductions in reimbursement rates for hospitals, nursing homes and home health care agencies, among other proposals. The Governor proposed many of the same initiatives last year, only to see them blocked in the Legislature.
New York has by far the highest Medicaid costs in the nation, and Mr. Pataki said his proposed cuts were necessary to restrain soaring health care costs. But health care industry officials predicted that the reductions would force the closing of many urban hospitals and nursing homes, which are already being squeezed by new competition in the industry and Medicaid cuts from last year.
Because Medicaid is financed jointly by the Federal, state, and local governments, the Governor's plan would actually drain a total of $2.1 billion from the health care system, according to the administration and health-care industry officials. "It looks like the health-care community is being asked to do more than any other community in terms of deficit reductions," said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.
Reviving a proposal he made last year, Mr. Pataki called for building 7,000 new maximum-security prison cells over the next three years at a cost of $635 million. He said the new cells are needed to relieve current prison overcrowding as well as to provide space for prisoners who serve longer sentences under existing and proposed laws pushed by Mr. Pataki. Today, the Governor also renewed his call for ending parole for all violent offenders.
The Governor called for cutting state spending on public colleges by $175 million in the coming academic year. However, to offset that reduction, he called on both systems to increase tuition by $400 a year, which would bring annual tuition at the State University to $3,800 and at the City University to $3,600. Both systems raised tuition by $750 during Mr. Pataki's first year in office to make up for state budget cuts.
Mr. Pataki's plan includes $120 million for the first phase of a four-year plan to reduce property taxes by $1.7 billion and a three-year plan to cut gift and estate taxes by $400 million. But the proposal also includes $75 million in increased fees, including for vehicle registration.

HEADLINE: THE GIULIANI AGENDA: THE PLAN;
Giuliani Proposes Rail Tunnel To Carry Freight Past Hudson

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday proposed building a tunnel beneath New York Harbor to carry rail freight efficiently between the water-fringed city and the rest of the country, and said the city would study transforming the weed-strewn waterfronts of Brooklyn and Staten Island into a port for a new generation of deep-hulled ships.
In his State of the City speech yesterday, the Mayor did not mention how the $800 million to $900 million freight tunnel would be paid for, nor did he indicate how much a new port would cost. 
 The tunnel proposal has been around for more than 70 years, and a host of obstacles stand in its way: not only its cost, but the political difficulties of building anything so big in New York City, where projects like Westway and the Second Avenue subway were proposed but never built.
But Mayor Giuliani said that an analysis of the economics of both the tunnel and port showed that the benefits would outweigh costs by as much as $1.6 billion.
He said that the tunnel and revival of the city's waterfront would create 53,000 jobs in the region, sharply cut truck traffic and pollution, reduce prices of consumer goods and insure that New York Harbor remains the dominant seaport on the East Coast. New York Harbor stands to lose its primacy because new, larger ships cannot negotiate the shallow channels leading to the New Jersey piers that are now the heart of harbor commerce.
Mr. Giuliani made the tunnel proposal in a freewheeling 83-minute speech that reviewed many of his administration's efforts during the last three years and that offered several spending plans that signaled the onset of an election year. [Page B3.]
New York City is the only major American city where goods are shipped in almost exclusively by trucks, clogging roads and fouling the air, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who has fought for a tunnel since 1979. The tunnel would make the city more accessible to rail traffic, since freight trains now must go almost to Albany to cross the Hudson.
The first move toward the tunnel and a new port would be a pair of $2 million studies that could clear the way for partial Federal financing for the projects, Mr. Giuliani said.
The announcement was hailed on many fronts as the first significant commitment of a New York City mayor since 1923 to the building of a freight tunnel under the harbor, which urban planners have said is an essential component of any plan to return some of the area's shipping trade to the New York side of the harbor it shares with New Jersey.
More than a generation ago, 90 percent of maritime commerce shifted from Brooklyn to New Jersey, where ample rail links and acres of open space accommodated huge cranes and other gear needed to handle a new generation of shipping containers. But the newest ships are too big for the New Jersey ports, while Brooklyn's channels can be dug deeply enough to handle them.
Mr. Nadler said he was confident that up to 80 percent of the cost of the tunnel could come from Federal grants for projects to improve transportation and cut pollution. "I've been going at this for 18 years and nothing's happened," Mr. Nadler said. "But I feel jubilant today."
He said that previous studies by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had rejected the idea without any real analysis.
Michael C. Finnegan, counsel to Gov. George E. Pataki, said Mr. Pataki had not yet seen the study upon which Mayor Giuliani was basing plans for the tunnel. But, Mr. Finnegan said, "The Governor has long been interested in any plans that would revitalize the waterfronts in Brooklyn and Staten Island."
Support from Mr. Pataki would be crucial because the Federal transportation money for such projects is given in blocks to states, with the states determining how it is spent.
A freight tunnel linking Brooklyn with New Jersey was first proposed in 1920, and it became the basis for the creation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 1921. But the project became bogged down, and in 1923, New York City began building a tunnel to Staten Island instead.
That project died in political wrangling between the city and Gov. Alfred E. Smith, Mr. Nadler said. The concept was literally buried in the 1960's, Mr. Nadler added, when Robert Moses, who preferred roads to rails, used fill from the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to seal one of the shafts leading to the stillborn tunnel project.
From the 1960's on, as Federal money flowed into the Interstate System of highways, rail transport became less and less competitive. But now, the city's air is fouled and its roads and bridges crumbling under the endless assault of 50,000 trucks a day, and truck traffic is only expected to increase because of the absence of new rail links, Mr. Nadler said.
Mr. Giuliani's enthusiasm for the tunnel grew out of a two-year study of ways to improve the shipment of goods to and from New York City, said Charles Millard, president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation. The study showed that the tunnel, without any improvement of the city's piers, would pay for itself in many ways, Mr. Millard said.
He said that only 3 percent of the 146 million tons of goods that move around New York City comes by rail, while the average for other American cities is around 30 percent and has been showing signs of increasing. Just in terms of wear and tear on roads and bridges, the shift of much of that commerce to rails would remove 870,000 truck trips a year from city roads by 2020, he said.
The new studies show that the tunnel, together with reviving Brooklyn's piers, makes sense for the port as a whole, Mr. Millard said. He said that it could cost $3.3 billion to deepen the channels leading to New Jersey and add several hundred acres of land there. But shifting deeper ships to Brooklyn and building the tunnel would cost $2.5 billion, he said.
Mr. Giuliani and his aides criticized the Port Authority yesterday for failing to give the tunnel serious consideration. Mr. Millard said, among other things, "A tunnel would take away from their tolls. Eighty percent of the truck traffic through the city goes over the George Washington Bridge."
Mr. Millard said the tunnel would run from a rail yard at 65th Street in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, either to St. George, S.I., or Greenville, N.J., both of which have rail lines. The link through Staten Island would appear to make more sense, he said, because it would link up with any new port development there as well as in Brooklyn. It would also raise the possibility that the project could be done without the involvement of the Port Authority or New Jersey.
Putting together financing for the tunnel alone will entail substantial challenges at the Federal, state and local level, said urban planners.
"We couldn't be more supportive of the tunnel, but the biggest problem is who's going to pay for it," said Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a private group that examines economic and environmental issues affecting New York City and the region.
"The problem is, the beneficiaries, businesses and air and roads, don't contribute directly to bonds that could pay for a tunnel," he said.

Harbor Freight Tunnel Proposal
In his State of the City speech, Mayor Giuliani proposed building a tunnel beneath New York Harbor to carry rail freight between the water-fringed city and the rest of the country, and said the city would study transforming the weed-strewn waterfronts of Brooklyn and Staten Island into a hub port for a new generation of deep-hulled ships.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A headline yesterday about a legal challenge to a New York State law that bans the on-line transmission of certain material to minors misstated the scope of the law. As the article stated, it prohibits transmission of indecent material, not just obscenity. (The courts have ruled that obscene material, which appeals to prurient interest and has no redeeming value, does not have First Amendment protection; the state's power to ban obscenity is not at issue. Indecent material does have some First Amendment protection, though the courts have ruled that it can be regulated to protect minors.)

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up 0.3%; Retail Sales Post Small Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Inflation remained under control in December, and consumer prices rose a total of 3.3 percent in 1996 spurred by food and energy prices, the Labor Department said today.
In another economic report today, the Commerce Department's monthly survey of retail sales confirmed what merchants had suggested for weeks: the 1996 holiday season produced meager gains. 
 Retail sales climbed six-tenths of 1 percent last month to a level 4.4 percent above that of December 1995, far less an improvement than merchants had generally expected given solid economic expansion and a roaring stock market.
"It's like a complete replay" of last year, said Susan M. Sterne, who specializes in consumer behavior as president of Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich, Conn. "It's very difficult to entice consumers to purchase things."
This 4.4 percent increase looks particularly unimpressive when adjusted for inflation, which the Labor Department said rose 3.3 percent for the year as the cost of food and energy stopped acting as a moderating force on inflation and aggravated it instead. Prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Securities markets greeted the two reports favorably, however, apparently viewing them as evidence that the economy would continue to expand without inflationary pressures that would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.
Despite the disappointing holiday sales, said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, consumer spending "is in the midst of a recovery from a weak third quarter" and, because retailers are increasingly discounting prices, may be a bit stronger than the figures imply.
Spending on personal consumption grew just five-tenths of 1 percent in the July-September quarter, but Robert T. McGee, economist at the Tokai Bank in New York, and others expect a 3 percent rate of expansion when the fourth quarter is reported Jan. 31.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, about evenly split between retailers and such recipients as doctors, utilities and insurance companies.
Today's inflation report was open to wide interpretation, with the markets seemingly most impressed by the fact that the Consumer Price Index edged up just one-tenth of 1 percent last month when the volatile food and energy components were excluded and rose only 2.6 percent on this basis for the full year. Along with an increase of the same size in 1994, this is the lowest core inflation since 1965.
On the other hand, analysts noted that food and energy accounted for nearly one-quarter of the price index and should not be entirely disregarded by inflation watchers just because their movements are often governed by temporary events like the weather and are outside the control of policy makers.
"There are some storm clouds brewing," Mr. Schlossberg said, pointing to continued tight labor markets and high oil prices, the latter becoming embedded to at least some extent in the economic fabric.
He and others are predicting that the Fed will decide to raise short-term interest rates, probably in late March but possibly as soon as the policy meeting in early February.
Although inflation is regarded as a lagging indicator -- and core inflation lags behind the economy even more than the full Consumer Price Index -- some found it unsettling that in 1996 overall consumer inflation rose to 3.3 percent from 2.5 percent in 1995.
Indeed, the 3.3 percent increase was the fastest since 1990, when inflation was 6.1 percent; since then inflation had eased every year except for 1994, when it was unchanged.
While the price of energy jumped 1.6 percent in December -- and 8.6 percent for the year -- the food and beverage index slowed to a one-tenth of 1 percent increase and grocery store food prices, reflecting lower dairy and fruit and vegetable costs, actually fell by that amount, the first decline in 13 months.
Airline fares jumped 3.9 percent last month to lift the 1996 increase to 14.7 percent while auto finance charges and used cars fell in price for the third consecutive month.
Medical costs, up two-tenths of 1 percent last month, rose 3 percent for all of 1996; this was down from 3.9 percent in 1995 and represented the slimmest annual increase since 1965.
In the New York metropolitan area, consumer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent in December and 2.9 percent for the full year, the Labor Department said.

HEADLINE: Ecuador's President Stands on His Record

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 11 news article "Ecuador Chief, the Populist, Is Anything but Popular" fails to point out the difficult economic situation in which President Abdala Bucaram, the youngest chief executive in South America, received the country, and the hard and unpopular decisions he has made in order to place Ecuador back on the path of growth and development. 
 In the five months since assuming office, Mr. Bucaram has renegotiated important oil contracts, substantially reduced the usurious bank loan rates, initiated the construction of 200,000 houses for low-income families and implemented social programs to provide free medical attention, school breakfasts and textbooks. All of this within the utmost respect to democratic freedom. There is not a single political detainee in Ecuador.
To help poor children, President Bucaram has recorded songs and raised millions of dollars in telethons. He has also refused to embark on a regional arms race and has committed to advance a peaceful integration process, especially with neighboring countries. Just today Mr. Bucaram arrived in Lima, Peru, to meet with President Alberto Fujimori to seek a joint and peaceful solution to the long standing territorial dispute between the two countries.
President Bucaram's administration should be judged only by the results of his policies. The road to social reform and steady development in Latin America is long and difficult.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases Broadly on Signs Of Profit Taking After Run-Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower against leading currencies yesterday for the first time in more than a week, hurt by profit taking after it reached a 29-month high against the German mark and a 45-month high against the Japanese yen.
"The market was just getting a little bit ahead of itself," said Jim Powers, vice president for foreign-exchange sales at Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York. "We really haven't had any down day on this recent move up, so it was a bit of a correction." 
 Fear that Japan's central bank might take steps to strengthen the yen today also contributed to the retreat in the dollar. Japanese financial markets were closed yesterday for a national holiday, Adult Day.
The dollar was further held back by a new rise in the British pound, on unexpectedly strong employment data in Britain. The news was seen as a further reason for Britain to raise interest rates.
The dollar rose as high as 117.20 yen in Asian trading, the highest since March 1993, before falling back to 116.88 yen late yesterday in New York, down from 116.93 yen on Tuesday.
In Europe the dollar reached 1.6000 marks, the highest since July 1994, before retreating to 1.5877 late in New York trading, down from 1.5943. The pound settled in New York at $1.6827, up from $1.6711.
The dollar had risen since Jan. 8, largely on a mixture of strong American economic news and signs of more weakness in Japan and Germany.
Traders said the momentum of the dollar's rise drove it higher in early dealings. News that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia would remain hospitalized at least until next week also undermined the mark, which often falls on signs of political instability in Russia. But large sell orders hit the dollar when it reached 1.6000 mark.
"We made such a rapid move up; I think clearly some consolidation was in order," said Tom Hoge, vice president for corporate foreign-exchange trading at the Bank of New York. Some dealers attributed the dollar's weakness in part to a surge in the Canadian dollar, which reached the highest level since November after an article in The Financial Times said that economists had become very positive about Canada's economy. Indeed, the Canadian dollar settled yesterday at 74.53 cents, up from 74.03 cents on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Heavy Supply Of Debt Hurts Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday as investors grew concerned about an abundance of new debt coming to market.
In addition to new corporate and municipal issues, the Treasury announced yesterday the sale of $30 billion in two-year and five-year notes next week. 
 By the close of the New York market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32, to 96 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.79 percent, from 6.77 percent on Tuesday.
With no data of consequence and low average participation in the Treasury market, activity was dominated by corporate bond issues, said Ken Logan, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data. More than $5 billion in corporate debt is expected to be priced over the next couple of days.
U S West Capital Funding, a unit of U S West Inc., which plans to price $3.5 billion of debt today, leads the corporate and municipal issuers that are expected over the next few days.
"Investor appetite for spread products, like corporate paper, is very strong at this time," Mr. Logan said.
Still, dealers were uncertain about the eventual success in placing all the corporate paper, and they decided to hedge some of their exposure. "This hedging moved prices lower early on," Mr. Logan said. The market was able to recover and closed mixed as corporate supply went well and hedges were bought back.
The size of the U S West offering expected today is up from $2 billion, and will match in size the Lockheed Martin Corporation's offering last May, as the biggest sale ever of investment grade corporate bonds in the United States.
In the municipal market, New York City priced $805.3 million of general obligation bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The bonds are priced to yield a maximum 6.32 percent for an issue due in 2025 , while serial bonds with short maturities are priced to yield from 5.35 percent in 2003 to 6.27 percent in 2015.
The bonds are rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by Standard & Poor's, with the exception of maturities that are due in 2007 to 2009 and whose principal and interest payments are insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Corporation. Those securities are rated triple-A as a result.
The city also sold $300 million in floating-rate notes to foreign investors at a price to yield 25 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, set at 5.562 percent. The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, is the basic short-term lending rate in the Eurodollar market.
It is the first sale of a floating-rate issue by a United States municipality to foreign investors and the city's second foray into Europe.
Shorter maturities seemed to benefit yesterday from the uneasiness in the market over supply, reinvestment and coming economic data, as investors move from the longer maturities to the shorter end of the market to minimize exposure in the event of a downturn.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it planned to issue $17.5 billion of two-year notes on Wednesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Thursday. The size of the two-year note auction was reduced by $750 million.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 5.99 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.30 percent.

HEADLINE: Jesse Jackson Sets Up Office To Monitor Corporate Action

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
As if Wall Street has not been frenetic enough in recent weeks, it will soon have a new tenant who plans to shake it up even more: the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
Mr. Jackson yesterday announced plans to open an office on Wall Street next month that will bring his brand of capitalism to the epicenter of the world's financial system. 
 Mr. Jackson said his new office would seek to cajole, persuade and pressure American companies to hire and promote more blacks and members of other minorities, name more of them to corporate boards and award more business to companies owned by members of minorities.
Speaking to an enthusiastic group of black executives at the World Trade Center in Manhattan, Mr. Jackson said, "Open up the walls on Wall Street."
To put pressure on corporate America, Mr. Jackson said he would publish details on how well 100 of the nation's largest corporations treat minorities. As further pressure, he pledged to form a group of a million consumers -- 20,000 in each of the nation's 50 largest cities -- and provide them with monthly updates on the records of specific companies' dealings with minorities.
Donald J. Trump received an ovation when he announced that he would donate office space to Mr. Jackson's civil rights group, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, in 40 Wall Street, a 72-story building he is renovating.
"He's out there pushing for a lot of good things," said Mr. Trump, who noted that he and Mr. Jackson had become good friends over the years.
The office will be run by the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which was formed by the merger of Mr. Jackson's civil rights and economic development groups, the Rainbow Coalition and Operation PUSH. He said the office would focus on the automobile, food and telecommunications industries.
"We insist that corporations stop the formula of targeting us for consumption and then boycotting us," Mr. Jackson said. "We don't want to be boycott partners. We want to be trading partners."
Not everyone in New York welcomed Mr. Jackson's arrival. Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization, said, "He'll make a lot of companies nervous."
"The instant Jackson suggest that companies might not be meeting his standards on affirmative action hiring or racial sensitivity, companies will immediately start chewing their nails," she said. "It's a very intimidating message."

HEADLINE: Christopher Sees Threat Of Isolation Via U.S. Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned today of "a new isolationism" emerging in Congress and said the State Department could not sustain more budget cuts without seriously undercutting American foreign policy around the world.
In a speech that was part valedictory and part call to action as he prepares to step down next week, Mr. Christopher said a steady decline in foreign-affairs spending had already forced the United States to close consulates and even embassies and to shortchange efforts in some parts of the world in order to address immediate crises in others. 
 Mr. Christopher warned that continued budget cuts could force the United States to reduce aid to countries considered essential to American interests, including Israel, Egypt and Jordan.
"The biggest crisis we're facing in our foreign policy today is whether we will spend what we must to have an effective American foreign policy," Mr. Christopher said in a speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
Mr. Christopher's speech echoed warnings he has made in recent months, as well as remarks made by his designated successor, Madeleine K. Albright, at her confirmation hearings last week. But it came as the State Department and the President's budget office continue to haggle over the size of the foreign-affairs budget that President Clinton will submit to Congress early next month.
After four years of steady decline, officials at the State Department now express confidence that Mr. Clinton will fight vigorously to prevent further reductions by Congress.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the President's budget for the fiscal year that begins in October would include $19.3 billion in spending on the array of agencies and programs grouped under the rubric of foreign affairs. That would represent a 5 percent increase over the $18.3 billion allocated by Congress for the current year, but it is also more than $1 billion less than the State Department had requested.
The officials said Mr. Clinton's budget would also include a plan to repay the United States' debt to the United Nations -- something Mr. Christopher, in today's speech, called overdue. The officials said the President proposed repaying the outstanding dues over two years, with $100 million in the coming year and $900 million in the year after, provided the new Secretary General, Kofi Annan, showed a commitment to reforming the United Nations.
Many of the President's budget proposals are likely to encounter resistance from Republicans in Congress as the budget is debated over the months to come. And some Republicans took exception to Mr. Christopher's criticisms, dismissing the accusation of isolationism.
"The biggest crisis, with all due respect to the Secretary of State, is the fact we have a budget deficit," said Jo R. Bonner, chief of staff to Representative Sonny Callahan of Alabama, who is the Republican chairman of the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign affairs. "There's not a money tree to do all the things we would like to do here at home, much less in other parts of the world."
But other Republicans have made the case for an increase in spending. Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, who has advocated forcefully on the issue recently, agreed with Mr. Christopher's warnings. In an interview today, he said the President would have to make a strong case to win approval for his budget proposals, but that the chances this year appeared brighter.
"It seems to me the groundwork is a little firmer than has been the case in the last few years," he said.
In his speech today, Mr. Christopher said the United States needed to maintain spending on foreign affairs to advance American leadership around the world. But he noted that the foreign-affairs budget, when adjusted for inflation, had fallen by nearly half since 1985.
"Just as we need to preserve our military readiness by maintaining forces and bases around the world, we need to preserve our diplomatic readiness by supporting the people and the programs that help to keep our soldiers out of war," he said.
At one point, Mr. Christopher pointed to today's agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians on control of Hebron as an example of the need to continue to devote adequate resources. He also noted that half of all foreign aid went to nations involved in the peace effort, and warned that such aid "will inevitably come under pressure, possibly irresistible pressure" if budget cuts continue.
Aid to Israel and Egypt, which total about $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively, has been a bedrock of American policy in the Middle East for years, and it is highly unlikely the Administration would propose or Congress would pass reductions in it.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Japan is in a mess, but there's optimism that the worst is past.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THERE'S nothing like a few hundred billion dollars in losses in the stock market -- in just a few hours last week, no less -- to stir interest in an economy's failings. The economy (knock on wood) is Japan, where near panic in the stock market has drawn attention to the surprisingly fragile machinery driving what was long seen as an unstoppable industrial juggernaut.
The new attention, though, is about three years late. For after years of going nowhere, the Japanese economy may finally be poised for a modest recovery. Indeed, Japanese housing starts, motor vehicle sales and payroll employment are all on the upswing. "There's light at the end of this tunnel -- really," argues Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan. 
 Like its American counterpart, the Japanese economy staggered into the 1990's trying to shake off the effects of a global recession. But unlike America, Japan never bounced back: since 1992 the American economy, adjusted for inflation, has grown 22 percent, while Japan's output is up an anemic 6 percent.
After the fact, Japan's tepid economic performance seems no great surprise. A strong yen made Japanese products far less competitive in world markets, while the Government bureaucracy's Pollyanna forecasts sapped business confidence. Perhaps most important, Japan has ducked a resolution of its banking crisis. "There's never been a comprehensive program, complete with bailout money, to put the problems of the financial system behind them," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The timing of this stock market wobble is harder to explain. John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, sees it as a reaction to the dawning perception that the Government really is determined to go through with plans to raise both income and sales taxes in April -- a move that would cut consumer purchasing power at a less-than-opportune moment. Mr. Saxonhouse links the stock market's jitters to a Government forecast of 1.9 percent growth in output in 1997, the lowest official prediction ever.
Whatever the reason, conventional wisdom says that the stock market's troubles will compound the problem of getting back to the 3 to 4 percent economic growth rate of the recent past. For one thing, falling securities prices feed expectations of general price deflation, which make even the current low, low nominal interest rates seem high.
For another, there's the issue of the banks' balance sheets. Lacking active bond or short-term commercial paper markets, Japan depends on banks for credit creation. But now that stock losses have further depressed their net worth, the banks -- reeling from real estate debts -- may be even pickier about where they lend money.
Why, then, the cautious optimism that the worst is in the past? The Economist magazine offers the novel argument that the party hacks now in power will be forced to take bold action to deregulate the economy because traditional means of recession-fighting -- fiscal and monetary stimulus -- have lost their punch. And while the long overdue deregulation of everything from retailing to land use hardly seems a substitute for Keynesian-style macroeconomic policies, it just might increase confidence and lead to an upswing in investment.
The more tangible basis for optimism, suggests Roger Kubarych, general manager at the firm of Henry Kaufman Associates, is exports. Japanese goods that were virtually frozen out of world markets when it took a dollar to buy 90 yen, look far more competitive at 116 yen to the dollar. And while companies in America -- notably in Detroit -- will no doubt howl about unfair competition, it will take time for Washington to work up righteous anger over sneaky Japanese attempts to sell high- quality goods to Americans at low prices.
The biggest puzzle is how the Japanese, so long admired for their adaptability as well as their industry and thrift, managed to snare themselves in the slow-growth syndrome one associates with, say, Britain in the 1960's and 1970's. One reason must be that very high savings rates and a superbly disciplined work force are no longer enough to cover a multitude of sins ranging from corruption to obsessive conformity. Few other democracies, one suspects, would allow an organization as blemished by scandal and incompetence as the Liberal Democratic Party to control its destiny.
Another reason, though, is more benign. In America, six years of economic stagnation would have generated great suffering. In Japan, unemployment remains below 4 percent and outrageous social problems like homelessness and childhood poverty are nonexistent, or at least disguised.
Consider, too, that the price deflation that has hobbled monetary policy and choked off investment creates winners as well as losers. "If you're working and not too worried about the future of your job," Mr. Kubarych notes, "you've enjoyed tremendous income growth in the last few years."

HEADLINE: Mexico Repays Bailout by U.S. Ahead of Time

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that Mexico had repaid all of the $12.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to stave off a financial collapse two years ago, ending one of Mr. Clinton's riskiest overseas ventures and releasing Mexico from tight economic controls imposed by Washington.
The repayment of the loan -- three years ahead of schedule -- was marked by a celebration at the White House today presided over by Mr. Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who had warned that a default by Mexico could bring down economies around the world. 
 "Two years ago helping our friend and neighbor in a time of need was quite controversial," Mr. Clinton said today, a reference to his decision to do an end run around Congress, which refused to act on an emergency package for Mexico, and to lend the cash from funds under the President's control.
"Some said that we should not get involved, that the money would never be repaid, that Mexico should fend for itself," Mr. Clinton said. "They were wrong." He stopped short of naming those opponents, who included Ross Perot, Patrick J. Buchanan and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican.
Mr. D'Amato made several attempts to stop the transfer of funds to Mexico, declaring in March 1995 that "the Mexican bailout is a failure" and that the Administration had made the economic climate in Mexico "far worse than it needed to become."
Today, Mr. D'Amato issued a terse statement saying that he was "pleased" and attributed the quick repayment to "vigilant Congressional oversight."
In the end, Mr. Clinton said, the United States ran a profit of more than half a billion dollars on the loans.
That money, which American officials said would go toward deficit reduction in the United States, is above the interest the cash would have earned had it remained in the Federal Reserve's emergency stabilization fund, which was originally designed to steady the dollar rather than the currencies of allies.
In Mexico City, the news prompted a rally in the stock and bond markets -- in part because paying off the loans meant that the country no longer needed to put up its oil production revenues as collateral. The Mexican stock market rose 2.66 percent today and is up more than 12 percent this year.
President Ernesto Zedillo declared that the Government had made a "bold step toward the economic recovery of Mexico."
In fact, what Mr. Zedillo did today was what most prudent homeowners do when interest rates dip: he refinanced. In the seven months that followed the collapse of the peso in December 1994, and the ensuing dance with national bankruptcy, private lenders refused to go near Mexico, only worsening its troubles.
For that reason, Mexico secured a credit line from the United States of $20 billion, but only needed to borrowed 60 percent of that. But now, with renewed confidence in the Government's reforms -- confidence that some economists warn is premature -- investors around the world are once again rushing to lend Mexico all that it needs.
So Mr. Zedillo's Government is exchanging high interest loans from Washington with new bonds issued by Mexico. While those bonds carry relatively high interest rates, Mexican officials said today that they would save Mexico about $100 million a year in payments.
"Some predicted that our country would collapse, that the foreign aid would be unpayable and infringe our sovereignty, and that in the short term we'd be in a worse crisis," Mr. Zedillo said in a morning speech in Mexico City. But the early retirement of the debt to the United States Treasury demonstrates, Mr. Zedillo said, "the coherence and responsibility the Mexican people and Government have shown in these tough times."
The Mexican debt crisis produced some of Mr. Rubin's tensest days at the Treasury, and in private he hinted that he worried throughout the spring of 1995 that it could fail. "This was Bob Rubin's Bosnia," one of his top aides said today. "And today he got the troops out."
The usually understated former investment banker was clearly reveling in the success of the bailout today.
In the Roosevelt Room at the White House, Mr. Clinton sidestepped a question about a recent decline in the value of the peso and deferred to Mr. Rubin, explaining "you've made so much more money than I have."
"There is a point to that!" said Mr. Rubin, who usually makes no references -- even in jest -- to his huge fortune.
Back at the Treasury later in the day Mr. Rubin raised an eyebrow when his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers -- who was the first to recognize the possible ripple effects of the crisis in emerging markets and who organized much of the loan effort -- joked that he would settle for just 1 percent of the Treasury's $580 million profit on the deal.
"Larry, anything you can negotiate, I'm happy to split with you," Mr. Rubin shot back.
While the Administration was eager to describe Mexico today as a patient in recovery, the cost was high for Mexican workers who lost their jobs during the austerity program imposed as a condition of the loans, for homeowners who were unable to pay their mortgages and for businesses that suddenly found themselves caught in a severe recession.
Crime has soared in Mexico City, the pay of Mexican workers is still badly depressed, and the peso has stabilized but failed to return to its earlier values. While Mr. Clinton made much of the fact that American exports to Mexico were higher today than they were in 1994, before the crisis struck, he failed to mention that the trade deficit with Mexico had surged by nearly $18 billion.
Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, said in an interview today that Mexico had assembled the funds for its final payment to the United States -- previously it had paid off about 70 percent of its debt -- by selling bonds denominated mostly in foreign currencies in European, Asian and American markets.
The most recent bonds, which had terms of five to 10 years, generally longer than Mexico had on the United States debt, had yields of 3.35 percent more than United States Treasury securities.
"That's a lot lower than we were paying a year ago," Mr. Ortiz said. The rates, which are also generally lower than those Mexico was paying to the United States, reflect the recovery of international confidence in Mexico's solvency made possible by Mexico's tough economic program and the American bailout, he said.
"Obviously the crisis took a toll in terms of economic welfare, and incomes are still down from their 1994 level," Mr. Ortiz added. "Consumption has not completely recovered yet. But had we not had the support of the international financial community and of the United States, the consequences would have been much worse."
Nonetheless, average Mexicans will still have difficulty understanding today's debt-retirement celebrations, said Rafael Fernandez, a professor at the Autonomous Technical Institute in Mexico. "The left will argue that in order to pay off these debts so quickly, Zedillo has had to impose tough austerity, and those that are suffering are the poor," he said.
One of the byproducts of the Mexican crisis was a move by the United States to press for far more extensive disclosure of critical financial information by countries around the world -- data that had they been published by the Mexican Government in 1994 would have made it clear that the country's foreign exchange reserves had dwindled to dangerously low levels. That meant Mexico was unable to pay $29 billion in short-term debt that was denominated in dollars.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers worried during the bailout that they were creating a "moral hazard" -- that other countries around the world might see the United States as a lender of last resort in financial crises.
"I'm not as concerned about that today," Mr. Rubin said this afternoon. "This experience has been enormously painful for the Mexican people. Countries are unlikely to decide that if worse comes to worse, we'll do what Mexico did."
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers have also worked to set up international emergency funds, to which all nations would contribute, to handle further Mexican-style crises.
Today Representative James A. Leach of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, praised the success of the bailout but warned that "great caution is going to have to be exercised in assuming that this is the only or best way to proceed." American taxpayers, he said, cannot be "placed disproportionately in jeopardy."

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
Artists Bring New Color To a Gray City

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
"THE greatest thing about Peekskill," Ralph DiBart was saying with barely restrained pride, "is the mix. The mix is the whole key to our renaissance."
Exhilarated by the prospect of making his point, he scooted up Main Street from City Hall, his trench coat flapping against the wind. At the corner, he halted at a stone building with the words "Evening Star" etched above the door. Across the street stood the buildings of the projects. On the side was a playground. 
 "When Gannett took over the Star, they had no use for this building," Mr. DiBart said, relishing the surprise in store. He scurried to the side of the building and knocked on an unmarked door.
Voila! Inside was a big, airy artist's loft with a working artist, Andrew Lattimore, waiting to sing its praises.
"This has been the ultimate studio environment for me," said Mr. Lattimore. A painter, he moved here from White Plains two and a half years ago, when Peekskill was in the throes of marketing its poor downtrodden downtown as SoHo North. His 2,400-square-foot studio is one of three rental lofts in the old Evening Star building. "I've lived in New York, I've lived in Europe," he said. "I've never lived in a place as supportive as Peekskill."
MR. DiBART, a planning consultant hired by Peekskill to bring new life to the city's decrepit business district, was beaming. He had suggested a downtown artist district as Peekskill's best chance for survival. The reality has outpaced the dream. Nearly 100 artists now live or work here, and the city has received calls from as far away as Florida.
Ten years ago, this would have been impossible to believe. Peekskill, hometown of Gov. George E. Pataki, has always been Westchester County's sad little city to the north. Bordered by antiquesvilles like Cold Spring and fancy exurbs like Garrison, where the Governor now lives, Peekskill seemed to have more in common with the aging post-industrial cities farther upstate, like Schenectady or Utica.
But while Schenectady and Utica are in such dire straits that their leaders want to shut their governments down, Peekskill (pop.: 20,000) is realizing one big project after another. Last week, it announced plans for a boat launch and expansion of a walking trail, using a $100,000 state grant. Recently, it received approval for a $3.7 million state grant to construct 25 to 30 subsidized artists' condominiums on what is now a parking lot.
Dwight Douglas, the city's director of planning, also likes to talk up a project to develop Peekskill's industrial section, Charles Point. The city received a $98,000 state grant to help develop a waterfront park, which is being expanded with some of the $100,000 in state money.
"We have so many projects in the works," Mr. Douglas said. "It's not just the artists' district." Some of the ideas, he said, go back to the days when Governor Pataki was the part-time Mayor of Peekskill, from 1982 to 1984.
Mr. DiBart, a native of Peekskill whose father was mayor in the 1960's, seems most excited about the businesses that artists in Peekskill have attracted. Three years ago, Westchester Community College opened an annex that offers computer graphics and multimedia courses. Several computer graphics firms and multimedia businesses have since moved here.
WE knew that all we needed was a critical mass of artists to spur growth," Mr. DiBart said. "Now we have a critical mass."
It is not so obvious. On a walking tour of the district, Mr. DiBart kept pointing out artists' lofts. To the untrained eye, they looked like the vacant upper floors of old three-story brick buildings with stores at ground level, the kind you see in aging downtowns from here to Niagara Falls.
"It's true that you can't tell where they are," Mr. DiBart said. "We have to work on that. But the artists are forming a community by word of mouth. It has become the engine that drives development."
And it can't hurt that the Governor is a hometown boy. The Governor's family farm is still in Peekskill (though some of the 11-acre spread has been parceled for development). Mr. Pataki still commutes to Albany from Garrison, and he drops into Peekskill quite often.
Frances Gibbs, the Mayor, has lunch with Governor Pataki on a regular basis. "The Governor is interested in what's going on here," she said. But, she added, "We haven't received any special treatment. Peekskill has a long history of getting the funds it needs for development."

HEADLINE: Cutting Car Insurance Cost Poses Challenge for Whitman

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Jan. 15

 BODY:
Auto insurance reform has bedeviled New Jersey's last two Governors. Both of them, Thomas H. Kean and Jim Florio, proclaimed themselves champions of change and lower premiums. Ultimately, neither succeeded, and residents still pay the nation's highest premiums and grumble about it.
Now, as she prepares her run for re-election, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has weighed in with a new plan to reduce premiums anywhere from 5 to 25 percent by combating fraud and offering motorists a choice of policies that link savings to reduced coverage. 
 In the early sparring, the industry seems pleased with the plan. John Tiene, executive director of the New Jersey Insurance News Service, whose member companies write 70 percent of the state's car insurance policies, termed the Whitman plan "bold and dynamic." He said the industry was willing to accept Mrs. Whitman's abolition of its annual automatic cost-of-living premium increases and her proposed ban on the current practice of refusing to renew some policies without explanation.
Steven Goldstein, a vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association, praised her commitment to fewer "pain and suffering" lawsuits as an obvious way to reduce premiums.
But the president of the state's chapter of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, Harrison J. Gordon, dismissed the Whitman plan as "Draconian," asserting that it would benefit only the wealthiest policyholders.
Although the Whitman administration has approved some higher premiums, most of the issues that drive the state's insurance rates so high began long before Mrs. Whitman became Governor. Here are some of the factors:
*New Jersey has more traffic per highway mile than any other state, and plenty of nonfatal crashes; it trailed only Texas and Wisconsin in 1994, the last year with such figures available.
*Negligence lawsuits for "pain and suffering" are bountiful. Generous policies, with among the highest benefits in the country, produce high medical awards by juries and payments to policyholders.
*Controls against insurance fraud, both the state's and the industry's, are weak, critics contend.
*The insurance industry grumbles about state limits on profits, mandates that all motorists be offered insurance and limits on premium charges for the highest-risk drivers in urban areas. Costly policy surcharges persist to pay off billions in debt run up by insurance pools that existed for high-risk, bad drivers in the Kean and Florio years.
*Compounding everything have been years of sour relations between the industry in New Jersey and the state's trial lawyers. The lawyers have consistently fought any limit on drivers' right to file negligence suits for injuries caused by other motorists. Curtailing such suits for pain and suffering is now the centerpiece of Mrs. Whitman's insurance plan, to the delight of the industry and the consternation of the trial lawyers.
Many familiar with the state's insurance troubles say that the lawyers have the stronger lobbying voice in Trenton and that the fate of Mrs. Whitman's package in the Legislature will hinge in large measure on the two sides' willingness to compromise.
Today, the president of the State Bar Association, Cynthia M. Jacob, toughened her initial mild response to the Whitman plan. On Tuesday, Ms. Jacob offered the association's assistance in seeking reform. She said today that she had "great concerns" about Ms. Whitman's plan to curb lawsuits and said any restrictions on them would produce "nominal" reductions in premiums.
J. Robert Hunter, insurance director of the Consumer Federation of America, offered today a quick and simple solution to New Jersey's auto insurance woes and what appears now to be a lengthy struggle in the Legislature: simply adopt Michigan's "no fault" auto insurance law.
Only 11 states in the country have no-fault systems, including New Jersey and New York. Mr. Hunter said he considered Michigan's law the nation's best no-fault law because it provides motorists injured in crashes unlimited payments for their medical expenses and lost wages, and allows pain-and-suffering lawsuits only for death, serious impairment of a bodily function, and permanent and serious disfigurement.
Mr. Hunter said adoption of a single Michigan-type law in New Jersey for everyone would probably cut premiums 10 percent across the board and make an almost incomprehensible system far more understandable for the state's auto owners.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A CLOSER LOOK -- Car Insurance: The Whitman Plan"
Here is how Gov. Christie Todd Whitman wants to cut the high cost of car insurance in New Jersey.
 
HOW SHE WOULD CHANGE THE SYSTEM
 
-- Eliminate automatic cost-of-living increases in premiums.
-- Eliminate "bad driver" surcharges for drivers who have just one accident or ticket.
-- Make it harder for accident victims to sue for pain and suffering.
-- Crack down of repair-shop and medical fraud.
 
HOW SHE WOULD CHANGE INSURANCE COVERAGE
 
A typical two-car family -- in this case, a 30-to-40-year-old couple with a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am and a 1990 Chevrolet Astro Van -- now pays $2,019 for the following coverage:
 
$100,000 -- Liability for injuries, including pain and suffering
$25,000 -- Property damage liability
$250,000 -- Medical costs and lost wages
$100,000 -- Compensation for an accident with an uninsured motorist. Damage, theft and collision with a $500 deductible. Right to sue for pain and suffering, but only if injuries are severe.
 
OPTION 1
PREMIUM: $1,556
SAVING: $463
DIFFERENCES: Policyholder can sue or by sued for economic losses, like lost wages, but not for pain and suffering.
 
OPTION 2
PREMIUM: $1,886
SAVING: $133
DIFFERENCES: Similar to Option 1, but compensation for pain and suffering is determind by a schedule of what various injuries are worth.
 
OPTION 3
PREMIUM: $1,820
SAVING: $199
DIFFERENCES: Similar to the current coverage, with savings to come from system-wide changes.
 
OPTION 4
PREMIUM: $2,350
DIFFERENCES: Policyholder can sue for pain and suffering for any injury.

HEADLINE: Beyond the Liberal Label;
Messinger Tries to Define Herself Before Giuliani Does It for Her

SERIES: OPENING STEPS: The Mayoral Race

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
"I know who you are! I know who you are!"
Carol Zappala, the manager of a lingerie shop in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx, looked up over her glasses and her telephone, greeting the vaguely familiar presence standing at the counter. Then she paused, locking eyes with her visitor, trying to raise the memory. "Refresh my recollection," Mrs. Zappala finally said. 
 Ruth W. Messinger -- a New York City Council member for 12 years, the Manhattan Borough President for 7 years, and now a Democratic candidate for Mayor of New York -- gamely refreshed her recollection, and Carol Zappala turned back to her telephone conversation:
"You know who I'm talking to? Ruth Messinger. Ruth Messinger!" At that, Mrs. Zappala looked past Ms. Messinger to the newspaper photographer behind her. "Let me take off my glasses," she said. 'They're taking my picture!' "
It was a cold Saturday afternoon in the Bronx, and Ms. Messinger -- a single aide at her side as she plodded up and down White Plains Road under the rumble of the IRT -- had just endured, in a humorous if slightly embarrassing moment, a reminder of the kind of political difficulties she faces in trying to become the next mayor of New York.
In Manhattan, Ms. Messinger is known as the earnest if slightly stern career legislator from the Upper West Side: the very portrait of government activism, always wrestling an outsize stack of papers under her arm as she leads battles for the city's downtrodden, fighting a huge project one day and City Hall the next.
But in much of the rest of the city, Ms. Messinger is, more often, a vaguely familiar face from the edges of politics and local television. What she is remembered for is not always helpful to someone running for citywide office, and it poses a central challenge to her candidacy.
She is the fiery woman who fenced so famously with the popular Mayor Edward I. Koch in the 1980's. And she is the Upper West Side legislator who came to be identified -- imprecisely, she now says -- as one of the faces of the kind of New York liberalism from which many politicians are distancing themselves with the rise of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Of all the candidates who are preparing to challenge Mr. Giuliani, none has worked longer, raised more money, is as well versed about municipal issues and seems as serious about her candidacy as Ms. Messinger. Even her critics, among them Mr. Koch, remark admiringly at her energy and persistence.
"Every time you see her and say hello, she sends you a letter saying it was nice to see you," Mr. Koch said the other day. "I believe that she has the dedication, the fire in the belly, to a greater extent then these other people."
It is that single-mindedness that leads Mr. Koch, and other political professionals, to suggest that Ms. Messinger has the strongest chance of winning her party's nomination.
Still, her candidacy remains somewhat unformed, facing even now a series of hurdles -- some of her making, and some not.
She, like the other Democrats, has the difficult task of making the case against Mr. Giuliani as he celebrates the city's declining crime rate and improving economy.
Perhaps just as problematic, she is in a quiet struggle to prevent Mr. Giuliani and her other opponents from encouraging potentially damaging preconceptions about her: that she is a captive of Manhattan; that she is a stiff campaigner who is more comfortable in front of a community board than before a television camera.
Most of all, though, it is that she is too liberal -- the "radical left," as Mr. Koch put it, or "extreme," as Mr. Giuliani said on the WCBS-TV program "Sunday Edition," signaling his intention to use against Ms. Messinger the strategy that has worked against such Democrats as Mario M. Cuomo, the former Governor.
"Once a word begins to be used pejoratively, you'd just as soon not have it attached to you," Ms. Messinger said over a steaming platter of pasta fagioli at Frankie n Johnnies, an Italian restaurant near Pelham Parkway, as dusk fell outside. She then offered this response to the characterization:
"If what people mean when they use the term pejoratively is that you don't take government's responsibility to spend its tax money seriously, then they've got the wrong person. If what people mean when they use the term pejoratively is that it's somebody who will not be attentive to the issues that define people's quality of life in New York, they've got the wrong person."
That criticism, she suggested, came from the reputation she built as a member of the Council, advocating a neighborhood that was particularly deluged by development.
"That was representing the West Side of Manhattan in the 80's," she said. "Now I'm representing the borough of Manhattan in the 90's. Not only have I evolved over 20 years in public life but times and issues in the city have changed."
In many ways, the story of Ms. Messinger's candidacy is about more than the candidate herself. Her attempt to adjust to changing times reflects how New York's political landscape has changed: It is, for example, no longer necessarily an advantage to be Jewish, or liberal, or from Manhattan.
If she won the nomination for mayor, she would be the first woman to be a major-party nominee for the post. While this is not exactly a groundbreaking event in American municipal politics, it is in New York, and it has already manifested itself in Ms. Messinger's campaign in a number of ways.
Ms. Messinger herself has acknowledged it in the way she presents herself to the public. As a candidate in the 1980's, she seemed more interested in what she was saying than in how she appeared.
Now, she is rarely seen without a string of pearls -- a standard accouterment for female candidates seeking to soften their public appearances -- and she tends to anchor her outfits with a bright dash of red, which looks good on television.
Along those lines, Ms. Messinger makes frequent note of her three grown children, who went through public schools, and how she rides the subway, does her own shopping and bakes what she asserts are the best chocolate desserts in New York. Ms. Messinger's makeover has been the subject of the kind of newspaper stories that normally do not appear about male candidates. Ms. Messinger seems a little uncomfortable, if resigned, to more such attention as the campaign progresses.
But there are indications, as well, that Ms. Messinger pays a substantive price for being a woman. She has been criticized, by newspaper columnists and some of her colleagues, as being overly aggressive in seeking public attention.
Her friends suggest that she is being held to a double standard because she is a woman, and in truth she is little different from many male politicians in this city, who are also renowned for their ability to elbow their way into a photograph.
More substantively, though, the prospect of Ms. Messinger as the first female major-party nominee for mayor seems certain to put to the test the question of whether this city is prepared to choose a woman for a post that is known, even outside New York, as the second-toughest job in the country. Women made up 57 percent of the electorate in the 1993 mayoral election, which presumably would bode well for Ms. Messinger.
But there are more than a few people who believe that Ms. Messinger's sex will hurt her, more than help her.
"In New York City, it would be a problem," said Rhoda Nadler, owner of a music store on Pelham Parkway. "You have a lot of male chauvinist -- I don't want to say its."
For her part, Ms. Messinger resists getting drawn into discussions on such questions. She even declines, following the unwritten book of rules that the Democrats have followed so far, to critique her primary opponents. "Not doing it," she said.
Mr. Giuliani is another story. She has spent much of the last few months exploring different ways of making a case against him, within the confines of her own long and detailed record of positions on the issues and Mr. Giuliani's political strengths, particularly on the issue of crime.
"Rape statistics are not going down," Ms. Messinger said the other night, speaking at the storefront headquarters of the New Democratic Committee in Harlem. "Too many people -- probably in this room -- know that statistics have gotten better, but don't feel safer in their own neighborhood."
"I'm glad the crime statistics are going down," she said. "But it worries me that when you call 911, it's going to take a minute longer than it did a few years ago for a police car to get there."
Similarly, Ms. Messinger, like the other major Democratic candidates -- Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn; Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, and the Rev. Al Sharpton -- point to the sliding reading scores in public schools as evidence that Mr. Giuliani has allowed his interest in fighting crime to overshadow any effort to improve public schools.
"This is an area in which this Mayor has let us all down," she said. "This is a Mayor who in three years has taken more than a billion dollars out of the education budget. You know what? You do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand that there will then be less money per child. There is a connection between dollars lost and why buildings are crumbling and why so many classrooms are overcrowded."
All that said, Ms. Messinger tends, as often as not, to speak in fairly general terms. She said that would change as she moves into the spring, but now, she is more apt to criticize Mr. Giuliani than to suggest what she would do instead. Thus, even as she assails the Mayor for cutting money for mass transit support and education, she declines to follow up her criticism with any promises.
"To say cuts should not have been made the way they were made," she said, "is not the same thing as saying put the money back."

Stocks of unsold goods barely rose in November as companies prepared warily for Christmas sales, the Commerce Department said today.
Total business inventories climbed one-tenth of 1 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted $1.01 trillion, after an increase of one-half of 1 percent in October, the department said. 
 Analysts said the lean inventories and record low stock-to-sales ratios near the end of 1996 might clear the way for stronger production in the first quarter as businesses rebuild stocks.
The most significant change during November occurred at retailers, where inventories shrank four-tenths of 1 percent, to $314.05 billion, after an increase of eight-tenths of 1 percent in October.
"Inventories did not expand robustly," said Kevin Harris, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York. "There was some caution ahead of Christmas, obviously."
That caution was apparently warranted. On Tuesday, the department reported that retail sales in December increased six-tenths of 1 percent. For all of 1996, they were up just 5.3 percent from 1995.
Merchants previously said Christmas sales, though stronger than a year earlier, had not met predictions. Expectations had been high because of a strong stock market, plentiful jobs and incomes that grew throughout most of 1996.
Business sales in November were up six-tenths of 1 percent, to $729.83 billion, a third consecutive monthly increase.
That left the stock-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to clear out inventories at the current sales pace, at 1.39 months in November, the same as in September and October. That is the lowest ratio since the Commerce Department began keeping records in 1982.
The small drop in November retail inventories was the first decline in eight months, since they fell nine-tenths of 1 percent in March. Most of the drop occurred at automobile dealers and furniture stores.
By contrast, manufacturers' inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in November, to $439.89 billion, after a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in October. Wholesale inventories edged up one-tenth of 1 percent, to $285.02 billion, after a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Pataki Wary on Financing Of a Hudson Freight Tunnel

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday that he was not ready to support Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's plan to build a $900 million freight-rail tunnel under New York Harbor.
While indicating support for improving transportation around New York City and spurring the economy, the Governor said there might be preferable uses for the money. "I can't commit to financing" the project, he said in response to a question from a reporter during a forum sponsored by Crain's New York Business and the New York City Partnership. 
 Mr. Pataki said he looked forward to seeing a city study, now being prepared, that would spell out financing options and provide more detail on what would be the first new crossing of the Hudson River in 33 years.
Mr. Pataki's support is crucial because the Mayor is hoping that up to 80 percent of the cost of the tunnel would be paid with Federal transportation money. The Governor and the Legislature decide how New York's portion of that money is spent.
The main goals of the Mayor's plan are to speed the flow of goods in and around the city and to cut traffic, pollution and the wear on roadways caused by the vast fleets of trucks that crisscross the region. Because of a lack of direct access to rail lines, New York City is far more dependent on trucks than any other large American city. The tunnel, which would run from Brooklyn to either Staten Island or Jersey City, could also help draw shipping back to the city's piers by providing a link to the nation's rail system, Mr. Giuliani said.
In deciding to take on the tunnel project as he prepares for a re-election run, Mr. Giuliani is widely seen as taking a significant gamble in an arena, the realm of the mega-project, that is littered with past mayor's failures. But his administration and supporters at environmental and transportation groups say the gamble is critical if the city is to compete, clean its air and clear clogged roads.
"Without the Mayor's vision all we're going to have is a hodgepodge Band-Aid approach to a major regional problem," said Charles Millard, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and an architect of the plan.
Most consumer goods bound for New York City, whether radios or potatoes, come by rail or truck to warehouses in New Jersey. The freight is then packed onto smaller trucks, which clog the George Washington Bridge and other roadways as they fan out to the five boroughs and surrounding communities.
If the tunnel was built, the same merchandise could travel nonstop by rail from New Jersey and points west under the Hudson River directly to Brooklyn. The merchandise would still get to stores or city warehouses in small trucks, so local truck traffic in the city would not change substantially. But the tunnel could dramatically cut truck traffic on bridges and overburdened routes like the Cross-Bronx Expressway.
Besides cutting costs for shipping goods to Brooklyn, the tunnel could help revive manufacturing in the city, and on Long Island. Problems with transportation helped drive many manufacturers out of the area in the last 20 years, said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan, who supports a tunnel.
Even if Mr. Giuliani succeeds in finding the money for the tunnel, it will likely take as long as a decade for environmental and engineering studies and then construction to be completed, according to projections by the city and the Tristate Transportation Campaign, a private group that studies transportation issues.
That means that other simple measures must be taken to avoid more choking pollution and continuing gridlock from trucks, said James T. B. Tripp, chairman of the transportation campaign and a lawyer at the Environmental Defense Fund.
"Congestion is going to continue to increase," he said. His group has urged the use of high tolls during rush hours and discounts at night to encourage truckers to move goods when the roads are clear. The city is planning to increase the use of rail barges to take train cars from New Jersey to the city, Mr. Millard said.

HEADLINE: When High Fliers Become Frequent Fliers;
Authorities Can Track Fugitive Financiers, but They Can't Bring Them In

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Giancarlo Parretti, the flamboyant former Hollywood mogul, could well be visiting his aging parents these days at the family olive farm just outside Orvieto, a medieval hilltop city some 70 miles north of Rome, his American lawyers say. They are not sure, though, since they communicate with him solely by fax.
Mr. Parretti, who mounted a $1.3 billion takeover of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. in 1990 only to lose control of the studio a year later amid allegations of financial mismanagement, is, after all, a man on the run. 
 The financier jumped bail and fled to his native Italy shortly before a Jan. 6 sentencing hearing in Delaware, his lawyers said early this month. At the hearing, he faced as much as 10 years in prison on perjury and evidence-tampering convictions growing out of the legal battle for control of the studio.
Exactly how and when the 55-year-old Mr. Parretti left the United States is a mystery. But by skipping the country, he has become the latest addition to the band of rogue financiers who have put off their date with American justice. And in joining the likes of Marc D. Rich and Robert Vesco, he has entered the shadowy -- and shifting -- world of the high-powered fugitive.
Because of technological advances in international police work -- chiefly the explosive growth in computer data bases and the lightning-fast transmission of photos -- those fugitives are finding that they can hide, but not run, at least not easily after the initial flight. Those who last the longest find a safe haven and hunker down, law enforcement officials say, avoiding high profiles and unnecessary movement.
The authorities say that no fugitive is ever really safe in an age when the next-door neighbor or the kid down the block can be the kind of vigilant citizen who regularly checks out the Justice Department's wanted list on the World Wide Web. Tracking down fugitives "is getting a little bit easier using these sophisticated programs," said James Carney, an inspector with the United States Marshals Service, the agency that brings them back.
But for all that, the wheels of justice can still turn awfully slowly. The United States has had little success in persuading even friendly nations to tighten laws that provide safe harbors for financial fugitives. And often there are serious questions about how hard anyone tries to find these international scofflaws.
In Mr. Parretti's case, for instance, an arrest warrant has been issued by Delaware authorities and a bail-forfeiture hearing has been set for Jan. 24, according to Paul R. Wallace, the state prosecutor handling the case. But no American officials have been dispatched to Orvieto or anywhere else abroad to find Mr. Parretti, Mr. Wallace said, explaining that such bilateral matters take time to work out.
Even if he is found, it may be some time before he returns to the United States, if ever. One measure of how hard it can be to win extradition is that in fleeing the United States, Mr. Parretti left behind another legal battle in Los Angeles, where he had been fighting an arrest warrant issued by the French Government for other MGM-related charges.
The United States has been trying to get its hands on some fugitives for years, even decades. For example, Mr. Rich, a suave international commodities trader, has lived openly in Zug, Switzerland, since 1982 after fleeing the United States to avoid prosecution in a tax case. Mr. Vesco left the country in 1972, when he fled Federal charges that he defrauded mutual fund investors of $224 million. He is now serving 13 years in a Cuban jail for other matters.
Ghaith R. Pharaon, the former front man for the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its illegal purchases of financial institutions in the United States, was indicted on fraud and racketeering charges in 1991. He now flits between his native Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, former associates say.
The number of fugitive financiers is growing, said an official at the Office of International Affairs in the Department of Justice's criminal division, though the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide specific figures. It is simply easier now than it was some years ago to get on a plane and disappear, at least at first, the official said, particularly since English has been increasingly adopted as the international language.
Meanwhile, the number of extraditions, relating to financial crimes and otherwise, has remained relatively flat. During the 12-month period ended Sept. 30, 160 people were extradited in all categories of crime, according to the Marshals Service. There were 191 extraditions for the period ending Sept. 30, 1995, and 177 for the year before that.
What hurts the "recovery" rate, Federal officials say, is that some countries, like Cuba, have no extradition treaty with the United States, while others, like Switzerland, make distinctions among forms of financial skulduggery that provide a safe haven to some.
"When you talk of financial crimes, you have to be careful," said Erwin Jenni, head of the extradition service at the Swiss Justice Department in Bern. In Switzerland, he explained, financial crimes involve fraud or embezzlement. Then there are so-called fiscal offenses, he said, which cover tax matters. "We don't extradite for fiscal and customs offenses," Mr. Jenni said, a policy that allows Mr. Rich, who has been indicted in the United States on charges of evading $48 million in income taxes, to live in Alpine comfort in Zug.
Another problem, said Mr. Carney of the Marshals Service, occurs when a fugitive successfully applies for citizenship in a foreign country. "Only some countries will extradite their own citizens," he explained.
To improve the Justice Department's record for capturing big-time fugitives, Attorney General Janet Reno last month started an interagency fugitive alert service, in conjunction with the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America. The effort includes a site on the World Wide Web (http:// www.usdoj.gov/criminal/oiafug/fugitives.htm) showing pictures of the most wanted fugitives.
In August, the Justice Department and the Voice of America began a radio broadcast, "International Crime Alert," that highlights a different fugitive each week. The program is heard in more than 50 countries.
While the new efforts have yet to bring in any well-known fugitive financiers, they did lead to the recent arrest in Guatemala of Leslie I. Rogge, a convicted bank robber who escaped from an Iowa prison, F.B.I. officials said. An American teen-ager living in Guatemala recognized Mr. Rogge from a picture on the F.B.I. web site, they said. Mr. Rogge had been working in the teen-ager's neighborhood as a handyman.
Most big-time fugitives have been a lot luckier than that. The anecdotal evidence suggests that those fugitives who have substantial reserves of money, like Mr. Rich, have a good chance of remaining at large. Mr. Rich even formed a new commodities trading firm in Zug. The firm, now run by others, has been a huge success -- and a galling symbol of frustration to American authorities.
A fistful of passports also seems to help. Most of the long-term financial fugitives on the Justice Department's list appear to hold at least two. Mr. Rich, for example, has American, Israeli and Spanish citizenship, sometimes visiting Spain and Israel on secret sojourns out of Switzerland. Mr. Pharaon, of the B.C.C.I. case, is believed to have both Saudi and Pakistani passports.
It is not that the American authorities give up trying to recapture those fleeing overseas. There have, for example, been occasional negotiations through intermediaries between Mr. Rich's lawyers and American law enforcement agencies to see if his return could be arranged. A variety of elaborate ruses to catch Mr. Rich outside Switzerland have also been considered and sometimes tried. In one such attempt, the American authorities staged a complicated commodities deal in an unsuccessful effort to lure Mr. Rich either to Kazakstan or Monte Carlo.
Some famous fugitives find it hard to stay out of trouble. Mr. Vesco is now languishing in jail following his conviction in Havana in August on charges of "fraud and illicit economic activity."
Others raise their public profile too high. David Friedland, a former New Jersey state senator who masterminded a plot to defraud $20 million from a local teamsters pension fund, found that out. After faking a fatal diving accident in 1985 in the Bahamas, Mr. Friedland moved to the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean. Using an alias, he bought and ran a number of scuba-diving schools there and even had his picture printed on a postcard. Such showmanship helped American authorities track him down in 1987. Mr. Friedland, who pleaded guilty to racketeering charges, was extradited and sentenced to 15 years in jail.
Eddie Antar, a fugitive from fraud charges for two years after the collapse of the Crazy Eddie electronics discount chain he co-founded, also has himself to blame for getting caught. The authorities got on his trail after he went to the police in Switzerland in 1992 and demanded help in gaining access to a $32 million bank account he kept under an alias.
Mr. Antar was arrested a short time later in Israel and extradited to the United States, where he faced charges that he defrauded shareholders of more than $74 million. After Federal convictions were overturned, Mr. Antar pleaded guilty last year to one racketeering count. Mr. Antar, who has already served four years in prison, is expected to receive three to five years more at a hearing next month.
The failure of Mr. Friedland and Mr. Antar to stay hidden highlights a key problem for a fleeing financier. Often, the flamboyance and egotism that helped bring riches in the first place cannot be repressed. The fugitive finds it hard to keep out of the public eye, let alone out of trouble.
Mr. Parretti, who began his career as a hotel waiter, has a history of high living and may find it tough to avoid the limelight now. When he took over MGM, he bought a Rolls-Royce, a jet and a $9 million mansion even as the studio bounced checks to stars like Dustin Hoffman and missed interest payments on bonds.
But for the moment, Mr. Parretti seems to be lying low. Manlio Morcella, his lawyer in Orvieto, did not reply to questions sent to his office, though he has given short interviews in Italy to say that Mr. Parretti had returned to face separate charges there relating to criminal bankruptcy and tax fraud.
Getting in trouble in a number of jurisdictions generally bodes ill for a fugitive, making it that much harder to remain at large.
In addition to his Delaware convictions and the charges in Italy, Mr. Parretti is accused of fraud in France relating to the hundreds of millions of dollars he borrowed from Credit Lyonnais, the large Government-owned bank, to finance the acquisition of MGM. Credit Lyonnais took over the studio after accusing Mr. Parretti of defaulting on the loans and of gross mismanagement. It recently sold the studio to a group that includes Kirk Kerkorian, the investor who originally sold MGM to Mr. Parretti.
With all the legal swords hanging over his head, Mr. Parretti may find a much-needed sense of sanctuary in Orvieto. The city is famed for its soft white wine. It is also known for a fresco-filled marble cathedral, where many come to pray.

 Better communications networks are making it easier for law enforcement agencies in the United States to find people who have been charged with financial crimes and then flee to escape punishment. But even friendly nations sometimes resist American efforts to extradite financial criminals, and thsoe fugitives with the most resources seem able to stay a step ahead of the law.

HEADLINE: Pacific Telesis and 2 Other Bells In Dispute Over a TV Venture

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
In another digital-age relationship gone sour, the Pacific Telesis Group is clashing with its corporate partners over the future of Tele-TV, their ambitious but troubled phone company venture into television.
Executives familiar with Tele-TV said the other two partners, the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the Nynex Corporation, want to shut down the company and fold its operations into Bell Atlantic. But Pacific Telesis, which plans to introduce wireless cable television service in Los Angeles this spring, is insisting that the partners continue to finance Tele-TV, at least through its introduction. 
 Pacific Telesis needs Tele-TV to supply the digital set-top converter boxes and billing systems for its cable service, according to people familiar with the company. Bell Atlantic and Nynex have shelved their own plans for wireless cable service on the East Coast. And people familiar with the companies said they do not want to pay for another company's wireless cable service on the West Coast.
"Pacific Telesis is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build a television business in California," one executive at Tele-TV, who declined to be identified, said. "They don't want to see Tele-TV blow up just before they launch the service."
The fractures in the Tele-TV partnership illustrate what can happen when major companies unite behind a high-tech vision -- only to diverge later when the technology or the economics shifts. Tele-TV's partners pledged to spend $100 million to create a digital television company. But after spiraling costs and doubts about the technology, only Pacific Telesis is committed to entering television anytime soon.
Raymond W. Smith, the chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic, acknowledged that Pacific Telesis disagreed with his company and Nynex over how quickly to scale back the Tele-TV partnership.
Mr. Smith said the companies were negotiating about how to restructure the partnership in the wake of mammoth deals involving all three of the partners. Pacific Telesis is being acquired by SBC Communications Inc., while Bell Atlantic and Nynex are close to completing their $22 billion merger.
"We're working out how much we should pay for things and how much they should pay for things," Mr. Smith said in an interview yesterday. "There's no animosity whatsoever between the companies."
Mr. Smith said Bell Atlantic and Nynex expected to complete the Tele-TV talks within a month -- which is also when the two companies are expected to clear the last big regulatory hurdles to their merger.
Susan Petoletti, a spokeswoman for Pacific Telesis, declined to comment on the talks. A spokesman for SBC Communications, Larry Solomon, said any decisions involving Tele-TV would continue to be made by Pacific Telesis until SBC's acquisition closes, probably in March.
At the heart of the dispute is whether Bell Atlantic and Nynex should pay two-thirds of the cost of offering wireless cable service in Los Angeles. Under the terms of Tele-TV's partnership deal, the three Bell companies agreed to help finance the introduction of television service in each of their regions.
But Mr. Smith said the mergers involving the three partners invalidated the contract. For one, Pacific Telesis' new owner, SBC Communications, is a partner with three other phone companies and the Walt Disney Company in a rival programming venture, Americast. So even if Tele-TV continued on its present course, SBC would have to determine whether to back Tele-TV or shift Pacific Telesis into Americast.
People familiar with Pacific Telesis said the company was trying to hold Bell Atlantic and Nynex to the contract on two grounds: that the mergers have not closed, and that Pacific Telesis paid its share for television market tests in Bell Atlantic's region. Some people familiar with the companies predicted Bell Atlantic and Nynex might offer to pay a lump sum to Pacific Telesis in return for the ending of the venture.
Complicating matters further, Pacific Telesis has invested more heavily in wireless cable than its East Coast counterparts. It acquired licenses to offer wireless cable in much of the Los Angeles area through a $175 million acquisition of Cross Country Wireless in 1995.
One executive close to Pacific Telesis estimated that the company's total investment in wireless cable was $300 million. Moreover, on two other occasions, the company has retreated from television ventures, including plans for wireless cable in San Francisco.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex acquired licenses on the East Coast by agreeing to invest as much as $100 million in CAI Wireless Systems in 1995. But the companies became disenchanted with the technology when it became apparent that hills and buildings can block wireless cable signals. The companies and CAI recently agreed to suspend their deal.
While Mr. Smith said Bell Atlantic and Nynex might still draw on Tele-TV's programming and technical expertise for some market trials of video services in Philadelphia, he acknowledged that Bell Atlantic would not have a significant number of customers before next year.
Pacific Telesis, by contrast, hopes to have several hundred thousand subscribers within a couple of years, according to people familiar with the company. The company has relied on Tele-TV to design a visual style for the service and to line up more than 50 cable channels. It has also ordered 200,000 digital set-top converter boxes designed by Tele-TV.
Diverging strategies have undone other technology partnerships, including the $2 billion investment by the MCI Communications Corporation in Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and U S West Inc.'s $2.5 billion stake in Time Warner Inc. These companies are also busy trying to unravel their alliances.
After Bell Atlantic and Nynex signaled their retreat in December, Pacific Telesis was nervous that Tele-TV's top programming and technical experts would flee before Pacific Telesis introduced its service in Los Angeles, people familiar with the company said.
Already, Sanford Grushow, the president of Tele-TV's programming arm in Los Angeles, has resigned to become the president of 20th Century Fox's television unit. Howard Stringer, the chairman of Tele-TV and the former president of the CBS Broadcast Group, is also negotiating to sever his contract, people familiar with the situation said. Neither Mr. Grushow nor Mr. Stringer would comment on the dispute.

HEADLINE: The Governor's Divisive Cuts

 BODY:
The $66 billion budget proposed by Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday is tailored for his familiar theme that New York State is "roaring" back toward fiscal health. But his proposed cuts in higher education and health programs for the disabled, elderly and poor are certain to yank the Legislature right back into the bitter wrangling that has paralyzed the budget process for two years in a row. Despite the Governor's claim, the budget also relies too heavily on the kinds of gimmicks that have given New York the worst credit rating of any state in the country.
Mr. Pataki has proposed some welcome new spending initiatives, particularly increases for children's services and welfare recipients. There were a few more details in the budget about how the state plans to mobilize job training, counseling and day care to help get families off welfare, and to provide vouchers for food and shelter for those thrown off the rolls because of the new Federal welfare law. The Legislature will have no higher priority than guaranteeing that the state use its resources to protect those hurt by the new law. 
Because the state economy is doing better and providing more tax revenue, Mr. Pataki's budget achieves balance without the harsh cuts he has urged in years past. Even so, nursing homes, hospitals, community health centers and home care for the elderly are being hit by significant cuts to help pay for the Governor's proposed property tax relief and other programs. Such huge reductions will inevitably impair health services for the neediest recipients. There are also ambitious schemes to introduce managed care and competition into the delivery of health services for the mentally ill, disabled and elderly that remain untested.
Also unwise are Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts for both the City University and State University systems. These would be offset by increasing tuition by $400 for students at both systems, making them less affordable for the poor and working class.
Mr. Pataki has brought some badly needed restraint to state spending. Like New York City's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, he argues that his policies have led to declines in crime and the welfare rolls and higher tax revenues resulting from an improved economy. But the Governor undercuts his own record by repeatedly relying on dubious bookkeeping to balance the budget. His own numbers show that if the latest fiscal plan were subjected to generally accepted accounting standards -- which bar gimmicks like deferring the paying of bills or assuming revenues that are not really available -- it would be $768 million out of balance, and would increase the accumulated state deficit to nearly $2.8 billion.
In the coming year, moreover, Mr. Pataki wants to roll over a $1 billion revenue surplus from the current year and use it to pay for ongoing expenses -- a dangerous practice because the money may not recur even though the expenses will. In addition, his proposal for $3.4 billion in increased school aid and property tax relief is funded only in part for the next year. There are no details on how it is to be funded later, only projections of growing deficits in the years ahead.
With Mr. Pataki's re-election campaign less than two years away, the budget fighting is likely to be more fierce than ever this year. The Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, who leads the Democratic opposition, only made tensions worse by leaving the room before the Governor began his budget speech. Whatever his motives, Mr. Silver's snub was a provocative and juvenile gesture incompatible with the Speaker's responsibility to work constructively on legislative issues.

Apple Reports a Loss Of $120 Million in Quarter
Apple Computer posted a loss of $120 million for its first quarter and said that it did not expect to return to profitability as quickly as it had predicted.
But Sun Microsystems, which a year ago entertained the prospect of acquiring Apple, reported record revenue and earnings for its second quarter. [Page D9.]
 
Mexico Pays Back Rest of U.S. Loan
Mexico has repaid -- three years ahead of schedule -- all of the $12.5 billion it borrowed from Washington to stave off a financial collapse two years ago, ending one of President Clinton's riskiest overseas ventures and releasing Mexico from tight economic controls imposed by Washington. [A1.]
 
Rudder Changes Set for 737's
The F.A.A. said it planned to require changes in the rudder controls of all 1,100 Boeing 737 aircraft in the United States, to preclude a sudden rudder movement that is suspected of having played a role in two crashes in the last six years. [A1.]
 
The airlines' robust financial recovery continued as AMR, parent of American Airlines, reported fourth-quarter net income of $284 million after a loss a year earlier. [D4.]
 
Uncertainty in Conrail Struggle
In most proxy fights, by the time of the shareholder meeting it is clear who will win. But tomorrow's meeting on the Conrail takeover struggle, at which shareholders will vote whether to accept less from the CSX Corporation or to hold on and hope that the Norfolk Southern will be able to pay more, is an exception. Neither side seems very confident. Floyd Norris: Market Place. [D12.]
 
Stocks Lower in Heavy Trading
The stock market fell for only the third time this year as investors unloaded technology stocks in heavy trading. The Dow industrials lost 35.41 points to close at 6,726.88. [D12.]
 
Treasury prices fell as investors grew concerned about an abundance of new debt coming to market. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.79 percent from 6.77. [D19.]
 
Dissident Tandy Director Quits
Tandy's longest-sitting board member resigned, disappointing many shareholders who had looked to him as a voice of dissent on a board that has backed the company's embattled chief executive. [D4.]
 
Earnings Rise at Big Banks
BankAmerica and First Chicago NBD posted higher profits for the fourth quarter despite problems with credit card loans. And H. F. Ahmanson, the parent of the nation's largest savings and loan association, reported 50 percent higher profits. [D8.]
 
Inventories Up Only Marginally
Business inventories rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in November as companies prepared warily for Christmas sales. Analysts said the lean inventories and low stock-to-sales ratios near the end of 1996 might clear the way for stronger production in the first quarter. [D2.]
 
Jackson Ends Mitsubishi Boycott
The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the civil rights leader, called for an end to the boycott of Mitsubishi cars and trucks because the company agreed to improve job opportunities for women and minorities at its factory in Normal, Ill., and at its contractors and auto dealerships. [D4.]
 
Mr. Jackson plans to open a Wall Street office to pressure companies to hire and promote more members of minorities. [D4.]
 
Historian Sought Paper Destruction
A historian working for Union Bank of Switzerland ordered the destruction of hundreds of pounds of archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with Nazi Germany, investigators said. [A3.]
 
Movies for Time Warner Channels
Time Warner said that its movie companies would license the rights to 12 feature films to two of its cable services, continuing a trend in which media companies are increasing the value of their distribution businesses by putting their own programming on TV networks or cable services they own. [D10.]

HEADLINE: Foes of Affirmative Action Form a National Group

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 15

 BODY:
The opponents of affirmative action who persuaded California voters to pass Proposition 209 last November announced today that they had formed the American Civil Rights Institute to argue "aggressively" that the rest of the states, as well as Congress, should abolish all race and sex preferences in hiring, contracting and college admissions.
The founders of the institute, which is to be financed by individuals and foundations, said the new national organization would have a "strong presence" in Washington and in every state where opponents of preferences ask for help. 
 But they were careful not to predict quick victories, given recent reports of race and sex discrimination in some major American corporations and also given that supporters of affirmative action, particularly women's groups, have vowed to fight back on the hustings and in the courts.
Still, Ward Connerly, the black Sacramento businessman who led the Proposition 209 fight and now leads the new institute, reported today that groups in a dozen or so states, among them Colorado, Florida, Oregon and Washington, had indicated they might like help in putting anti-affirmative action propositions on the ballot or pressuring legislatures to pass anti-affirmative-action laws.
Proposition 209 has been put on hold by a Federal judge, pending a review of its constitutionality, but Mr. Connerly said that had not deterred opponents of affirmative action in other states.
As for the outlook for Congressional action, Mr. Connerly opined that it was better now than in 1996, an election year in which many Capitol Hill legislators chose not to grapple seriously with the touchy issue.
Polls indicate that a large number of Americans oppose affirmative action programs. But many others, among them President Clinton, take a mend-it-don't-end-it approach, arguing that although there are shortcomings and excesses, such as quotas, the concept is worth saving.
"There is no public policy which has greater potential to rip the fabric of American democracy than affirmative action, as it has evolved," Mr. Connerly said in a statement. "Every citizen should have an equal chance at the starting line of life's race. But there should not be a guaranteed outcome in the race. If you discriminate for someone, you discriminate against someone else."
Among the institute's leading founders and advisers are Thomas L. Rhodes, the president of the National Review, the conservative magazine; Clint Bolick, director of litigation for the Institute for Justice, and Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, both organizations that push conservative causes; and State Senator Quentin Kopp of San Francisco, an independent who is one of Sacramento's most outspoken legislative mavericks.
Mr. Connerly predicted that his announcement today would draw sharp criticism, saying that "some people in this country think they have a lock on what is right and that all the rest of us are morally wrong." And, in fact, the criticism was not long in coming.
First to attack was State Assemblyman Kevin Murray of Los Angeles, the chairman of the California Legislative Black Caucus, who called Mr. Connerly "despicable" and "indecent." Then, noting that the announcement of the institute's founding had been purposely scheduled, by Mr. Connerly's admission, for the Jan. 15 birthdate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Murray asserted:
"To announce on Dr. King's birthday that he is setting out to destroy the civil rights advances Dr. King fought and died for is callous and utterly disrespectful of Dr. King's memory and accomplishments."
In Washington, Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a major civil rights group, said that the new institute should not hold out much hope for success beyond California, especially on Capitol Hill.
"That group won't get very high priority here," he said, "particularly after the discrimination that has recently been turned up at places like Texaco and the like."
Elizabeth Toledo, the president of the California branch of the National Organization for Women and a former member of that group's national board, offered a similar judgment.
"It won't work," she said. "Women are determined to push back."
Mr. Connerly said he chose King's birthdate for the announcement because the practice of extending preferences on the basis of race and sex constituted reverse discrimination and was a direct affront to King's dream of a color-blind America.
Then he speculated on whether King would support preferences, were he alive today.
"He very well might," Mr. Connerly concluded. "But if he did and were sitting here in front of me, I'd go right up to him and ask him why and how he could justify that support given his earlier statements about a color-blind America. We'd have a dialogue. I don't shy away."
Mr. Connerly said the institute would seek money from individuals and foundations but expects few contributions from businesses and other organizations.
"They say they oppose preferences, but they turn to jelly when they come face-to-face with having to choose up sides on such a hot topic," he said. "But we expect to have enough money to go national in any case."
Mr. Connerly conceded in his announcement and in a news conference and interviews afterward that race and sex discrimination was still very much a problem in the United States. But he argued that preferences were not the right solution.
Rather, he said, the nation should enforce existing anti-discrimination laws and adopt programs and policies that reach out to people, all people, who are economically and socially disadvantaged.
"Yes, we at the institute are against solving the nation's discrimination problems with race and sex preferences," he said. "But at the same time we are nevertheless solution-oriented and favor steps that would reach out to every individual in need of help, not just a particular class or classes. Our Constitution protects every individual, not every group. It's a difficult position that we take, but it's the right position."

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Cannot Identify Papers in Cache It Shredded

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Jan. 15

 BODY:
A historian working for the Union Bank of Switzerland ordered the destruction of hundreds of pounds of archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with Nazi Germany, investigators said today.
The investigators said the material, which was shredded last week, filled three large packing crates, each roughly three feet square and two feet deep, and two plastic garbage bags four to five feet high. The papers destroyed may have accounted for as much as two-thirds of the cache, the investigators added. 
 The historian kept no inventory of what was destroyed, which will make it difficult to determine whether the bank broke a month-old Swiss law that prohibits companies from destroying material that may shed light on Switzerland's role as banker to Hitler's Germany.
"Our main problem is knowing exactly what was destroyed," said Peter Cosandey, Zurich's District Attorney, who is leading the investigation. "There were files in there that dated back to the 1870's, and they are obviously not relevant. But there are also documents from the 1930's and 1940's, and the time frame is such that they could at least theoretically have been useful."
The new details surrounding the destruction of documents came as the Swiss Government sought to mend its strained ties with Jewish groups worldwide.
Jean-Pascale Delamuraz, the Minister of Economics, apologized today for his comment last month that Jewish groups had engaged in "blackmail" when they demanded that the Swiss set up a fund for Holocaust survivors. Mr. Delamuraz, who was President last month under Switzerland's rotating cabinet system, said in a letter to the World Jewish Congress that he was "very sorry" and that he had been misinformed about what Jewish organizations were requesting.
The Union Bank of Switzerland flatly denied today that any "interesting" documents had been destroyed, saying the historian was "100 percent confident that none of the materials are related to the Holocaust." The company also said that the bank's management had known nothing about the shredding and that the action had nothing to do with the broader controversy over Nazi money.
But bank executives were at a loss to explain how the historian, who has not been publicly identified, could have taken the action, particularly given the new law. "The historian made his judgment that these documents had nothing to do with the present discussion about the Holocaust -- nothing, and that is the point," Gertrude Erismann-Peyer, the bank's senior spokeswoman, said in an interview today.
Jewish groups here and in the United States asked a series of questions today:
Why had the bank begun destroying potentially relevant documents precisely when Swiss banks are under intense pressure worldwide to provide information about their dealings during the Nazi era?
Why had the bank chosen this moment to uncover a cache of documents that had laid untouched in a vault ever since 1945?
How could the historian have possibly been unaware of the implications of destroying documents?
"The material now under investigation might be of historical interest or it might not, but that is not the point," said Werner Rom, head of the Israeli Cultural Center of Zurich. "The issue is that we have a law that became effective Dec. 13 that prohibits shredding of material that might be relevant. From a moral point of view it is absolutely not understandable that something like this has happened."
Switzerland's banking industry has been under siege for months now from Jewish groups and from the United States, where Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, has held hearings that publicized embarrassing information from American Government archives about Swiss dealings during World War II with Jews and with the Nazi Government.
Two commissions have been trying to answer questions surrounding money, gold and other items that belonged to Holocaust victims and may have been put in Swiss banks either by the victims themselves or by Germans during the Third Reich.
One commission, headed by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is trying to find dormant bank accounts that belong to Holocaust victims. The other commission has been set up by the Swiss Government to analyze relations between Swiss banks, the Government and Hitler's Germany.
The law adopted on Dec. 13 is intended to protect documents that might be relevant to those inquiries.
The shredding at the Union Bank of Switzerland might never have come to light had not a night watchman named Cristoph Meili become curious about documents he saw being destroyed while he was making his rounds.
The guard took a number of documents from the bank last week and turned them over to the Israeli Cultural Center of Zurich, which is usually occupied with providing day care for Jewish children.
Today Mr. Meili, 20 years old and the father of two, is himself the target of a criminal investigation into whether he violated bank secrecy laws. He has been suspended from his job with the security company that served Union Bank.
Marcel Bosonnet, Mr. Meili's attorney, said the night watchman had been grilled for hours by Zurich authorities last weekend, and was repeatedly asked if he had demanded money or accepted money in exchange for documents he had taken.
Mr. Meili adamantly denied that money had been a motive. Rather, he said at a news conference on Monday with the Israeli Cultural Center, he became convinced that the documents might be of great historic importance and were being improperly destroyed.
"When God put these documents into my hands, I had to act on them," he said repeatedly on Monday.
Mr. Cosandey, the Zurich Dsitrict Attorney, said he had not yet decided whether Mr. Meili had violated bank secrecy laws because he did not work directly for the bank.
Mr. Bosonnet argued that his client had not violated secrecy laws, "but even if he were found to have violated bank secrecy laws, my answer would be that there was an overriding right that supersedes the law because there was such an important interest at stake."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weakens Versus Yen As Japanese Raise Red Flags

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday but fell against the yen after Japanese leaders expressed fears about the yen's weakness and rumors swept the market that Japan's central bank was selling dollars.
Market disappointment over Britain's decision not to raise interest rates also helped the dollar, as traders who had bought pounds sold them for dollars. 
 But many traders were more focused on the possibility of intervention by the Bank of Japan. Some said they had heard that the central bank was inquiring about exchange rates.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was at 116.44 yen, down from 116.88 yen on Wednesday, and 1.5943 German marks, up from 1.5877. The pound cost $1.6798, down from $1.6827.
Japanese monetary officials have been intermittently warning about the dangers of a weakening yen since the dollar began hitting a series of 45-month highs against the Japanese currency two weeks ago, climbing past 116 yen and 117 yen before retreating a bit on Wednesday.
"I can't imagine they're really happy with it above 115 yen," Jan Alvarez, head of foreign exchange trading at Corestates Bank in Philadelphia, said. "They're trying to soft-pedal it down to where they think it should belong."
The weaker yen has contributed to an outflow of capital from Japan and played a role in a sharp retreat in the Japanese stock market in recent weeks. Against other currencies, the dollar resumed its climb after a one-day pullback on Wednesday, largely on further evidence that the United States economy is having solid growth and low inflation.
The dollar also derived strength from weakness in the mark on talk that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may reduce interest rates at its policy-making council meeting next Thursday.
The pound's retreat came after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, said he had decided to leave interest rates unchanged after his regular meeting on Wednesday with Edward George, the governor of the Bank of England. Mr. Clarke said the pound's recent strength had a large role in his decision.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates on Wednesday, included: 1.3796 Swiss francs, up from 1.3715; 5.3790 French francs, up from 5.3585, and 1,550.00 Italian lire, up from 1,545.50.

Ford Plans Cutbacks at British Assembly Plant

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
In the first big step toward turning its unprofitable European operations around, the Ford Motor Company announced today that it would reduce employment by a third, or 1,300 workers, at its Halewood assembly plant near Liverpool, which makes its European Escort models.
Ford said it would produce fewer Escorts at the plant in northwest England through 1999, and then held out the possibility that it might begin building a new multipurpose vehicle there in 2000. But it warned that any future production would depend on its success in controlling costs. 
 The company's move is meant to stem losses in European operations caused by excess production capacity and weak sales. Some of the plant's output, now 800 Escorts daily, will be shifted to factories in Germany and Spain. Ford said it would offer early retirement and other compensation packages to workers and would try to make as many of the job cuts as possible through attrition.
The decision, which had been widely rumored since Ford reported a $472 million third-quarter loss in Europe, angered workers. The auto maker had presented the Halewood plant a global quality award last year and the plant had been cited as an example of modern British industrial efficiency. Analysts said the weakening sales of the Escort, a midsized model by European standards, rather than work practices at the plant were to blame for Ford's disappointing results in Europe.
The analysts said similar models, like the Volkswagen Golf and Opel Astra, were selling better. "People just didn't like the Escort," Charles Young, director of automotive research at the consulting firm J. D. Power-LMC Automotive Forecasting, said. "It was not as exciting as the competition, and Ford kept on having to revamp it."
"The actions we have announced today at Halewood assembly operations give the plant a realistic future, with an exciting new vehicle in the medium term, subject to approval and performance objectives being achieved," David Gorman, Ford's European vehicle operations manager, said.
Last week, Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive, said the European operations have "a cost problem which we are addressing very aggressively." In an interview, he added that Ford had "too much fixed cost in terms of capacity utilization. In short," he said, "we have more capacity than we need."
The United States company, which operates 12 plants in Britain, said the Halewood plant, which now employs 4,500, would operate on a single shift beginning in April "for the foreseeable future."
Speaking in Parliament this morning, Prime Minister John Major described the development as a "very surprising decision," coming at a time when British job rolls continue to grow and unemployment is the lowest among European Union countries.
Mr. Major, whose Conservative Government prides itself on facilitating foreign investments in Britain, said the move "flies in the face of most investment decisions which are moving to the U.K."
Labor union leaders at Ford asserted they "totally reject" the move, which they attributed to lax labor compensation laws in Britain that make it less costly to dismiss workers there than in other European countries. Britain has opted out of the so-called Social Chapter of the European Union, which offers strong protection to workers.
"A good plant with good people has been let down," Tony Woodley, the Transport and General Workers Union's national secretary for the motor industry in Britain, said, adding that the union was "very, very angry" and that a protest strike would be considered as a response.
The union officials said they would seek urgent talks with management to try to persuade it to reverse the decision.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Good Year for Manhattan Or Perhaps Not So Good

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Two of New York City's largest real estate companies, the Corcoran Group and the Halstead Property Company, have issued year-end reports, which -- surprisingly -- come to differing conclusions on the overall health of the residential market.
"High End of Manhattan Residential Real Estate Market Again Breaks All Price Records" trumpets the Halstead report. "One East Side, One West Side Neighborhood Top 20 Percent Gains for the Year; Only East End/Gracie See Prices Fall," another headline reads. 
 The report concluded that prices for the broad market in Manhattan below 96th Street for 1996 "rose a respectable 8.1 percent on average."
A competing annual survey, the Corcoran Report, however, reported that compared with 1995, average prices in Manhattan were down.
While the report maintained a cheery tone -- "One-bedroom sales take off for the first time in five years; Town house sales hit an all-time high; Expensive co-ops are in demand and hard to find" -- its first chart showed an average apartment price for 1996 of $398,000, compared with $416,000 for 1995, a 4.3 percent decrease. Corcoran's statistics are based on 20,051 deals -- its own and those gathered by a Mitchell, Maxwell & Jackson, an appraisal firm.
The two companies are large brokerage concerns that handle a broad range of properties in Manhattan, from moderately priced small apartments in Greenwich Village to multimillion-dollar Park Avenue palazzos.
At Douglas Elliman, a company that reported Manhattan sales last year of over $1 billion and will issue its report next month, Alan Rogers, chief executive, said he was not surprised the two reports differed.
"Most of these reports that are produced, frankly, reflect poorly on the industry," he said. "They're just marketing pieces for the individual agencies. They're not a detailed review and analysis of the activity, which ours is." Mr. Rogers said his preliminary figures for 1996 showed prices rising "but not dramatically; more than inflation, but much of that is catch-up with the 20 to 30 percent drop of the beginning of the decade."
Yesterday, Clark P. Halstead, who heads Halstead, said his figures were "a legitimate statistical attempt," based on more than 2,000 of his company's sales, taken together with the projected sales prices of an additional 7,000 apartments currently for sale. He said he could not explain the difference between his and his competitors' market assessments.
Barbara Corcoran, head of the Corcoran Group, responding to Mr. Rogers's comments, said that her firm's report was not seen as a marketing tool, but as "an analytical tool for the real estate community."
At Brown, Harris, Stevens, which will issue its report in February, Lawrence Sicular, the chief statistician, said he had surveyed an area similar to the one the Halstead Report called "the Silk Stocking District," which both define roughly as Fifth and Park Avenues, Central Park West and Riverside Drive.
While Halstead's figures for average apartment sales showed a 13 percent rise over those of 1995 for apartments in the Silk Stocking area, Mr. Sicular's latest statistics, which cut off at the end of September 1996, found a negligible rise in the average apartment price: from $884,032 to $895,000. Since Brown Harris does not gather statistics from the broad-based market, the company did not offer an overall Manhattan average.
The Real Estate Board of New York, another organization that issues a quarterly report, is preparing its year-end analysis. Warren Wechsler, a vice president, said a quick look at the new figures indicated that 1996 prices were "pretty much the same as last year."
In his latest analysis of last year's data, Mr. Sicular found that while average prices over all had not changed much over the last year, the prices of smaller apartments -- and some larger apartments -- had risen significantly. (Nevertheless, Mr. Sicular found that prices of apartments with seven to eight rooms had decreased: from $1.4 million in 1995 to $1.1 million in 1996.)
For the Brown Harris report -- culled from sales by Brown Harris sales agents, sales of properties managed by Brown Harris and sales from other management companies -- Mr. Sicular found that the average one-bedroom sale for nine months of 1996 averaged $243,039, compared with $215,435 in 1995.
Mr. Sicular joined the rest of the real estate professionals in reporting that volume was up significantly. Joyce West, executive vice president of Charles H. Greenthal Residential, reported a 20 percent rise in volume from last year.
"Yet despite all the activity, the inflation-adjusted prices are still down," Mr. Sicular said. "They were down 1 percent in 1996 and 5 percent in 1995. The increases in the stock market are infinitely stronger than in the real estate market."
Mr. Halstead disagreed. "The residential market, both for sales and rentals, is astonishingly hot," he wrote. "I don't remember a year in which the price changes were so uniformly up. Averages can mask fluctuations, but this year the market has been very consistent. I believe it will stay in step with the stock market."

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXXI;
In Green Bay, No Turmoil at the Top

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

DATELINE: GREEN BAY, Wis., Jan. 15

 BODY:
Dan Reeves left the Giants after he and General Manager George Young split over who would have authority on personnel matters. Bobby Ross fled from San Diego to Detroit because he and Chargers General Manager Bobby Beathard couldn't see eye to eye.
Perhaps no other relationship in professional football creates more sparks than that of the head coach and the general manager. Big egos, strong opinions and obstinate personalties exist on both sides. Friction is the constant result, even with successful teams like the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots. 
 Patriots Coach Bill Parcells had been given complete authority over the team's football operation, but the New England owner, Robert Kraft, took away some of that power this past off season, giving more control to Bobby Grier, the director of player personnel. As a result, Parcells may be doing his coaching somewhere else next season.
The team the Patriots will be facing in New Orleans has what is widely seen as an ideal relationship between general manager and coach. Unlike the Patriots, no one is writing stories about problems between Packers General Manager Ron Wolf and Coach Mike Holmgren.
"Both Ron and I work hard on our relationship," Holmgren said. "I think we both have big egos, but he made it very clear early on that he didn't want to coach the football team and I appreciated that. He also said he'd never give me a player I didn't want and I appreciated that.
"He does everything for me that I could possibly ask for and he's good at what he does. That's not to say we don't disagree on things, but we manage to communicate with one another and we respect each other. That's absolutely necessary to make the whole thing work in the National Football League."
Wolf, in turn, said that Holmgren "probably wins more than he should" when they disagree on personnel matters. But he said his first responsibility is to find players who will fit into Holmgren's system and make the team successful. And together they have taken a chance on players other teams have given up on, like Desmond Howard and Andre Rison, and made them valuable members of the team.
One player that they both agreed on was quarterback Brett Favre, the back-to-back N.F.L. most valuable player who has become the linchpin of the team's success.
Wolf, who is a protege of the Raiders' owner, Al Davis, was working as the Jets' director of player personnel in 1990 when he identified Favre as the best player in the draft that year.
The Jets did not have a first-round pick that year, having lost it by taking receiver Rob Moore in the supplemental draft the year before. By the time the Jets got to select in the second round, Favre had been chosen by Atlanta. But the second thing that Wolf did when he arrived in Green Bay in November 1991 -- the first thing he did was to hire Holmgren -- was to work out a trade with the Falcons for Favre.
Even though Holmgren and Favre got off to a rocky start, the coach did not blow up at Wolf for getting him a quarterback with a wild streak. Holmgren patiently worked with Favre to curtail his gunslinger tendencies on the field and now the Packers have one of the best quarterbacks in the N.F.L.
Under the 58-year-old Wolf, the Packers have selectively used free agency. They made a big splash by signing Reggie White to a $19 million contract in 1993, but they haven't done anything like that since then. Wolf is working to get Favre signed to a new contract. That's the Packers' next major deal.
"We decided to use free agency to shore us up and give us some identification," Wolf said. "But after that first year we saw the way it was going and we said, 'Oh no.' We knew that we had to keep our own players, our own good players. That's been our approach the last three years and that will be our approach this year."
That approach seems to be fine with Holmgren. And Wolf knows why he and Holmgren get along together.
"I think it's because Mike Holmgren is interested in one thing and one thing only, and that's winning football games," Wolf said. "I think he has an ego like most of the people in this game, but he realizes what he's very special at. He's very special at teaching players how to play and communicating with players."
Wolf added: "Coaches play a much more important role in the game than they ever have before. And it's from this standpoint -- they now have to take players and train them to play at a level they've never had to play before. They have to bring in new players and they have to play right away. Before, you never had that. You could season them for four or five years, play four preseason games and showcase some guys, and get some guys to play. You can't do that anymore, because those guys are gone. Somebody else is going to take them if they're any good. So, it's tremendous pressure on coaches, and they're the guys who have to function."
Wolf also admires Parcells and he considers the Patriots' coach a very good friend. In fact, he wanted to hire Parcells for the Packers' job.
"It never really got close, because he stopped it -- he had surgery," Wolf said, referring to one of two angioplasty procedures Parcells underwent to clear blocked arteries.
Wolf said he was not sure how he and Parcells got to be such good friends, but when he talks about him it's easy to tell he's quite fond of the coach standing between Green Bay and a Super Bowl title.
"We both respected and liked the game of pro football," said Wolf, who grew up in New Freedom, Pa., as a Baltimore Colts fan. "That's what we spent a large amount of our time talking about -- the game, the integrity of the game, players who play the game."
Wolf doesn't know if their relationship would have remained as close if he had hired Parcells and become his boss. Their philosophies on players are very different, Wolf said.
"He's a little more smashmouth than I am," he said. "Also a difference, and he'll probably object, but he's always looking for the sleeper. Always. I'm not. I'm looking for football players. Let somebody else be the genius. Through our friendship I've discovered how people in his position react to certain things. It's helped me. No question."
A couple of months ago there was speculation that Wolf would leave Green Bay and return to the Jets to be their general manager. He doesn't want to discuss it.
However, in talking about how ideal his working situation is in Green Bay, Wolf seemed to leave the window slightly open.
"This is the best situation a person can have in my capacity," Wolf said. "I don't know why a person would want to go anywhere else, other than economics."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
Looking Ahead: Two U.S. Documents

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Following are the texts of American documents related to the Israel-Palestinian agreement on the redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron. The Note for the Record is an official addendum. The Letter to Netanyahu, Secretary of State Warren Christopher's letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is not officially part of the deal. Mr. Christopher also wrote to Yasir Arafat, the president of the Palestinian Authority, but that letter has not been made public.
 
Note for the Record
The two leaders met on Jan. 15, 1997, in the presence of the U.S. Special Middle East Coordinator. They requested him to prepare this Note for the Record to summarize what they agreed upon in their meeting. 

Mutual Understandings
The two leaders agreed that the Oslo peace process must move forward and succeed. Both parties to the Interim Agreement have concerns and obligations. Accordingly, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to implement the Interim Agreement on the basis of reciprocity and, in this context, conveyed the following undertakings to each other:

Israeli Responsibilities
The Israeli side reaffirms its commitments to the following measures and principles in accordance with the Interim Agreement:

Issues for Implementation
1. FURTHER REDEPLOYMENT PHASES The first phase of redeployment will be carried out during the first week of March.
2. PRISONER RELEASE ISSUES Prisoner release issues will be dealt with in accordance with the Interim Agreement's provisions and procedures, including Annex VII.
3. OUTSTANDING INTERIM AGREEMENT ISSUES Negotiations on the following outstanding issues from the Interim Agreement will be immediately resumed. Negotiations on these issues will be conducted in parallel:
a. Safe Passage
b. Gaza Airport
c. Gaza Port
d. Passages
e. Economic, financial, civilian and security issues
f. People-to-people
4. PERMANENT STATUS NEGOTIATIONS Permanent status negotiations will be resumed within two months after implementation of the Hebron protocol.

Palestinian Responsibilities
The Palestinian side reaffirms its commitment to the following measures and principles in accordance with the Interim agreement:
1. Complete the process of revising the Palestinian National Charter.
2. Fighting terror and preventing violence.
a. Strengthening security cooperation.
b. Preventing incitement and hostile propaganda, as specified in Article XXII of the Interim Agreement.
c. Combat systematically and effectively terrorist organizations and infrastructure.
d. Apprehension, prosecution and punishment of terrorists.
e. Requests for transfer of suspects and defendants will be acted upon in accordance with Article II (7)(f) of Annex IV to the Interim Agreement.
f. Confiscating of illegal firearms.
3. Size of Palestinian Police will be pursuant to the Interim Agreement.
4. Exercise of Palestinian governmental activities, and location of Palestinian governmental offices, will be as specified in the Interim Agreement.
The aforementioned commitments will be dealt with immediately and in the parallel.

Other Issues
Either party is free to raise issues not specified above related to implementation of the Interim Agreement and obligations of both sides arising from the Interim Agreement.
Prepared by Ambassador Dennis Ross at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Rais Yasir Arafat.

Letter to Netanyahu
Dear Mr. Prime Minister,
I wanted personally to congratulate you on the successful conclusion of the "Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron." It represents an important step forward in the Oslo peace process and reaffirms my conviction that a just and lasting peace will be established between Israelis and Palestinians in the very near future.
In this connection, I can assure you that it remains the policy of the United States to support and promote full implementation of the Interim Agreement in all of its parts. We intend to continue our efforts to help ensure that all outstanding commitments are carried out by both parties in a cooperative spirit and on the basis of reciprocity.
As part of this process, I have impressed upon Chairman Arafat the imperative need for the Palestinian Authority to make every effort to ensure public order and internal security within the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I have stressed to him that effectively carrying out this major responsibility will be a critical foundation for completing implementation of the Interim Agreement, as well as the peace process as a whole.
I wanted you to know that, in this context, I have advised Chairman Arafat of U.S. views on Israel's process of redeploying its forces, designating specified military locations and transferring additional powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority. In this regard, I have conveyed our belief that the first phase of further redeployments should take place as soon as possible, and that all three phases of further redeployments should be completed within 12 months from the implementation of the first phase of the further redeployments but no later than mid-1998.
Mr. Prime Minister, you can be assured that the United States' commitment to Israel's security is ironclad and constitutes the fundamental cornerstone of our special relationship. The key element in our approach to peace, including the negotiations and implementation of agreements between Israel and its Arab partners, has always been a recognition of Israel's security requirements. Moreover, a hallmark of U.S. policy remains our commitment to work cooperatively to seek to meet the security needs that Israel identifies. Finally, I would like to reiterate our position that Israel is entitled to secure and defensible borders, which should be directly negotiated and agreed with its neighbors.
Sincerely,
WARREN CHRISTOPHER

HEADLINE: Medicaid Costs Are Seen Rising At Slower Rate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office radically reduced its estimate of future Medicaid costs today, relieving pressure on President Clinton and Congress to cut benefits for the poor. But the financial outlook for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, improved only slightly.
The estimate of total Federal spending on Medicaid from 1997 to 2002 dropped by $86 billion -- more than all the Medicaid savings that Republicans proposed in their long, bitter struggle with Mr. Clinton over the budget in 1995 and 1996. 
 With no change in current law, the budget office said, Federal spending on Medicaid will rise an average of 7.8 percent a year, to $144 billion in 2002 from $92 billion in 1996. In contrast, the agency was predicting just six months ago that Medicaid would grow 9.7 percent a year.
The budget office's estimate assumes that greater use of managed care will help control Medicaid costs, as it has in the last few years. With permission from the Clinton Administration, many states are requiring the poor to join health maintenance organizations as a condition of Medicaid coverage.
But for the elderly, H.M.O.'s are purely optional: the Federal Government does not require any Medicare beneficiaries to join.
The Congressional Budget Office said today that it foresaw continued rapid growth in Medicare spending. And on the question of most interest to politicians, it said that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would run out of money in 2001 if Congress took no action to shore up the finances of the program. That prediction coincides with a forecast offered last June by the Administration.
The trust fund pays hospital bills for Medicare beneficiaries, who are elderly or disabled, and Republicans often cite it as a symbol of the need to slow Medicare growth.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said: "This new report from the Congressional Budget Office is disappointing and unfortunately dashes any hopes that Medicare's financial condition was significantly improving, or that Medicare would go bankrupt later than expected. It underscores the need for Congress and the President to forge a bipartisan agreement to save Medicare, without resorting to accounting gimmicks or tax increases."
The budget office said Medicare payments to doctors would increase more slowly than it predicted last year. But the savings in that part of the program do not help the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.
Over all, the budget office said, Medicare spending will grow 8.6 percent a year -- to $314 billion in 2002 from $191 billion in 1996 -- a very modest decline from the 8.9 percent growth that the agency predicted in August.
The report today increases pressure on Mr. Clinton and Congress to take action to slow the growth of Medicare. But it may reduce the pressure to make major changes in Medicaid.
The White House said earlier this week that Mr. Clinton would propose firm limits on Medicaid spending as a way to help balance the Federal budget by 2002. Many Democrats in Congress contend that such limits are unnecessary and would undermine the program's ability to meet an increased need for assistance in times of economic recession.
The budget office's report predicted that increasing numbers of Medicare beneficiaries would voluntarily join H.M.O.'s, so that enrollment in them would rise from the current level of 5 million to 9.8 million in 2002 and then 14 million in 2006.
The budget office estimated that the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in H.M.O.'s, now about 12 percent, would rise to 25 percent in 2003 and 32 percent in 2006, even if Congress took no action to encourage such enrollment.
The budget office sees annual Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s soaring from $26 billion this year to $73 billion in 2002 and $141 billion in 2006. The White House contends that H.M.O.'s are being overpaid, and Mr. Clinton plans to propose cutbacks in reimbursement as part of his budget proposal, scheduled for submission to Congress on Feb. 6.
The Congressional Budget Office sees only modest increases in the premiums that Medicare beneficiaries pay for physician and outpatient services. Under current law, it said, the monthly premium, now $43.80, will rise to $45.60 next year and to $47.10 in 1999.
But, it said, premiums will pay for a declining share of Medicare costs, and general revenue for a growing share.
Without waiting to hear from Mr. Clinton, Senate Democrats said today that one of their top legislative priorities was to provide health insurance for the 10 million American children who have none.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said they would pursue this goal as tenaciously as they fought last year to make health insurance more readily available to workers who change jobs or lose their jobs.
These two Democrats are pursuing somewhat different approaches. Mr. Daschle said he would offer tax credits for the purchase of private insurance, while Mr. Kennedy would offer vouchers to families to subsidize premiums.
Mr. Daschle said he hoped Republicans would join him and Mr. Kennedy in supporting such proposals.
But Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who has worked with much success in the last 15 years to extend Medicaid coverage to more children, said, "A new program is always very difficult in this atmosphere," when Congress is trying to balance the budget.
The uninsured children who would be helped by the Daschle and Kennedy bills are generally not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
Nine of 10 uninsured children live in families with working parents, and about two-thirds of such children live in two-parent families.

HEADLINE: Protests Erupt Across Haiti As Leaders Push Austerity

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Protesters burned tires and threw stones in towns and cities across Haiti today, calling for Prime Minister Rosny Smarth to resign and for President Rene Preval to suspend negotiations with international lending institutions and end austerity measures.
A young man was reported killed when security guards fired on a mob that stormed a food warehouse in the northern city of Cap-Haitien. 
 In Port-au-Prince, the capital, demonstrators set piles of tires ablaze, blocking intersections with the smoking barricades. Shops stayed shut, parents kept their children from school and no buses were running in the largest of a series of anti-Government strikes.
The strike was called by the Anti-International Monetary Fund Committee one day after a man lost his right hand to an exploding tear-gas canister fired by the police who halted a peaceful street demonstration.
More than 160 grass-roots groups joined the strike. The organizations, backed by many legislators, attribute inflation and unemployment to the Government's efforts to collect unpaid taxes, cut spending, privatize state-run enterprises and streamline the bloated bureaucracy -- prerequisites to receiving the foreign loans that have kept the Government afloat.
About 7,000 of 43,000 government workers are expected to lose their jobs over the next 18 months as a result of the austerity measures.
International donors finance more than 60 percent of Haiti's budget.
Officials from foreign lending institutions who arrived Monday to analyze the Government's economic performance said the strike would not affect their discussions.
"I don't think that our mission will be disturbed," Axel Porker, a representative of the World Bank, said on Radio Signal F.M.
The Government sent school buses to collect people trying to walk to work, but some were turned back by stone-throwing strikers in Cite Soleil, a seaside slum in Port-au-Prince.
Streets in the three main cities -- Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitien and Gonaives -- were practically empty of traffic as many people appeared to stay home for fear of violence. Radio Haiti-Inter, another private station, said the strike was respected in most towns except Port-de-Paix, in the northwest.
"The strike was a total success," said Yves Sanon, a strike organizer. "The population has rejected the Government and its economic policy."
Rene Civil, another spokesman for the strikers, said at a news conference, "We warn anyone who does not respect the call that we'll force him to respect it."
Haiti's economy deteriorated under a corrupt dictatorship in the 1980's and was nearly ruined by international sanctions against a repressive military regime from 1991 to 1994. The United States sent troops to force out the military and restore the country's ousted President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
There are 1,600 United Nations peacekeepers in Haiti, including 300 civilian police officers who supervise and train the Haitian police. The peacekeepers are concentrated in Port-au-Prince, where they patrol but have no mandate to intervene in Haitian affairs.
There are no American combat troops left in Haiti, though a support unit of 300 to 500 troops builds bridges, repairs schools and digs wells.
The United States intervention force was replaced by United Nations peacekeepers in March 1995.
In February 1996, Mr. Preval succeeded President Aristide, who was opposed to taking stringent economic measures. Mr. Preval has refused to make concessions to grass-roots movements and Mr. Smarth has refused to resign.
"We have not made our economic policy choices lightly," Mr. Preval said in a State of the Nation address on Monday. "We have to take this road if we want a better future."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Fall In Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities fell yesterday, as a heavy calendar of new corporate and municipal debt inhibited buyers. A Federal Reserve official's warnings on inflation contributed to the selloff.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 15/32 , to 9528/32 , to yield 6.83 percent, up from 6.79 percent on Wednesday. 
 Treasury prices have been held down this week by concerns over the market's ability to absorb a number of large debt offerings coming, in particular an offering by U S West Capital Funding Inc., which grew yesterday to $4.1 billion.
Prices fell further yesterday, when Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor, suggested in a speech in Charlotte, N.C. that if the unemployment rate fell much further, the Fed would move to raise short-term interest rates. His comments revived speculation that the central bank was about to embark on a series of rate increases.
Mr. Meyer's comments seemed more explicit than usual from a Federal Reserve official, analysts said.
"This bombshell came from Mr. Meyer when the market was already on the defensive from heavy corporate supply," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "And now some of the traders may be looking ahead to tomorrow's industrial production and trade deficit figures, bracing for possible negative news for bonds."
But Mr. Sohn also noted that Mr. Meyer had previously offered different views of the economy.
"In the past, he has always been balancing economic growth and inflation, implying that there is no need for the Fed to hike interest rates," Mr. Sohn said. "Today, however, he implied that the econony is already on the mountaintop, and that both inflation and economic growth could get worse and not better. And that while 1996 was an ideal year, inflation is likely to accelerate."
Adding that he agreed with Mr. Meyer, Mr. Sohn said, " While I don't expect a spike in inflation, the Fed nevertheless should purchase an insurance policy to make sure that inflation does not become a problem later on."
Mr. Sohn said Treasury prices were somewhat bolstered yesterday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's regional survey for January. The survey's prices-paid index, which fell to 2.1 this month from 14.4 in December, pointing to controlled inflation.
In the corporate market, strong investor demand for U S West Capital Funding Inc.'s debt offering allowed the company to increase the size of its offering for the second time in two days.
The company initially planned to sell $2 billion of debt to repay debt related to its purchase of Continental Cablevision Inc. last year, but yesterday priced $4.1 billion of debt in six parts through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
Underwriters priced $600 million of noncallable notes due in 2002 at a spread of 55 basis points -- or hundreds of a percentage point -- above the when-issued yield of the five-year Treasury issue that will be auctioned next week, and $600 million of notes due in 2037 which were priced to yield 56 basis points more than the 5.875 percent Treasury note due Feb. 15, 2004. These notes can be sold back to the issuer in seven-years.
In the third part, the company priced $1.1 billlion of noncallable notes due 2007 to yield 80 basis points more than a comparable Treasury, and another $1.1 billion of noncallable debentures due 2027 that were priced to yield 107 basis points more than a comparable Treasury. For $500 milllion of noncallable debt due in 2097 the yield after pricing was 120 basis points more than a comparable Treasury, and for $200 million of callable debt due in 2032 the yield was 132 basis points above a Treasury. This security, however, is callable in 10 years.
The deal ranks as the largest investment-grade deal ever, although short of the RJR Nabisco Holding Corporation's $4.11 billion junk bond sale in 1989. Yesterday's sale was rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Duff & Phelps and Standard & Poor's.
Securities firms that arrange corporate sales often sell Treasury securities to hedge against losses. While the robust demand for U S West debt limited some of that hedging, the prospect of additional corporate debt combined with next week's Treasury auctions of new two-year and five-year notes continued to weigh down Treasury prices.
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.03 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.33 percent.

HEADLINE: No Longer Flying in Formation;
Labor Rifts Return to Employee-Owned United Airlines

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Perhaps old habits do die hard, but optimism was widespread in July 1994 that United Airlines was going to mend its fractious ways.
When the pilots of United led an effort to create one of the nation's largest employee-owned companies, the buyout was cheered by the Clinton Administration as a way to preserve jobs. And from a distance, the experiment, two and a half years later, seemed to be working. The pilots got want they wanted -- a seat on the board, a big ownership stake and the power to hand-pick top managers. Adjusted for a 4-for-1 split, shares in the UAL Corporation, the parent of United, have jumped from $22 to nearly $60, rewarding outside investors as well as employees. 
 But rather than establish a new model for working together, labor and management at United have reverted to a familiar groove.
Yesterday, United's pilots voted down by a 4-to-1 margin a tentative agreement that called for a cumulative wage increase of 10 percent over four years. The two sides will now enter binding arbitration, with no possibility of a strike because the pilots' contract extends until the year 2000.
The pilots' vote has put the managers of employee-owned United in roughly the same position as their counterparts at the conventionally managed American Airlines. Last week, American's pilots, too, voted down a contract offer in hopes of winning a bigger share of the record profits earned by the AMR Corporation, American's parent company.
In the cases of both airlines, the unions appear to be ignoring management's warning that letting labor costs creep too high will undo hard-won gains and damage the carriers' standing on Wall Street.
In fact, United is falling into a familiar pattern. Employee ownership arrangements are often struck during a financial crisis at a corporation. The elation over such rescue deals can mask vague and conflicting assumptions by management and employees. And, once the crucible of crisis gives way to recovery, the parties sometimes regret concessions they made under pressure.
Indeed, other big corporations that once embraced employee ownership, like Weirton Steel and Northwestern Steel, have since retreated to more traditional labor-management schisms, with the workers giving up their majority control.
"The initial financial transaction did its job in most cases, but no new corporate model emerged," said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor of management-labor relations at Rutgers University who has written several books on employee ownership. "Management and labor never really changed their fundamental points of view."
United is exceptional in the speed of its recovery. The consensus estimate of its profits last year -- they have yet to be reported -- is $1 billion, up from the $662 million the company made in 1995. But for the moment, it looks like another experiment in employee ownership that is falling short of creating a new formula for running a business.
However the contract vote came out, leaders of the Air Line Pilots Association at United had warned that pilots would no longer try to foster a spirit of cooperation at the airline. In announcing the vote yesterday, union leaders, in a message on a telephone hot line, said that the results "sent a clear message of dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction transcends a mere wage dispute. It is also a vote against a business-as-usual attitude that has no place in an employee-owned company."
In a statement by the company yesterday, Gerald Greenwald, the chairman and chief executive who was selected with the backing of the pilots, said he was "very sorry" to report the results of the vote. "If we, as an employee-owned company, have failed," he added, "I think it has been in the area of underestimating the time it is going to take to complete the journey from the United of the past to realizing the company we all want United to be.
"For that, I take responsibility. Employee ownership has not overnight erased past suspicions and mistrust. They persist today, on all sides and on virtually all levels."
The pilots' resentments are fueled by contrary perceptions about the reasons for United's rebound, with the pilots attributing the record profits mostly to the hard work of employees, and managers giving more weight to macroeconomic factors.
Members of the pilots' union and the International Association of Machinists took deep pay cuts in exchange for their 45.8 percent ownership stake in the company. Now, leaders of the employee groups say that with the airline doing so well, they should get big raises sooner. The run-up in the price of their shares, they add, is not enough because they cannot cash them in until they retire.
"The employees put their effort forth first, and no one ever anticipated the performance we've had," Michael H. Glawe, chairman of the pilots' union at United and a director of UAL, said before the vote.
"Like a great coach with a team, there is a big difference between mere ordering and leading to get the respect and motivation of people," Mr. Glawe said. "You can invest 20 cents in an employee and make one dollar, or you can try to save 20 cents and lose a dollar. We're missing the potential for the airline."
On the contrary, Mr. Greenwald said in an interview before the vote, the six-year contract that the pilots signed as part of the buyout put a cap of 10 percent on any midterm pay increase. Skirting the intent of the agreement, he said, would be ethically wrong and could frighten away outside investors and creditors, depressing the value of United's stock and raising borrowing costs.
"They're having trouble acknowledging, in a sense, that a deal is a deal," Mr. Greenwald said of the pilot leaders. "You signed a contract. It's legally binding. It's morally binding."
Certainly, the investment community sides with management. Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that any increases beyond the 10 percent cap "would incur cynicism about whether employee ownership works as a concept for outside shareholders and creditors."
The harshness of the recent exchanges marks a reversal from the early days of the buyout agreement. Then, arcane work rules were discarded and employees were given more freedom to make decisions. Pilots were given leeway to set air speed to improve the airline's on-time performance, for example. Even many flight attendants, whose union elected to stay out of the buyout, warmed to the new management team after it eliminated weight restrictions and rules such as those prohibiting them from wearing shoes that revealed a glimpse of their toes.
Before that agreement, labor-management feuding at United was commonplace. After a strike in 1985, the pilots tried on several occasions to acquire United. The most recent effort started in 1992, when the former chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, approached the union and reiterated his concern about United's high labor costs and the need for wage and productivity concessions. Without them, he said, United would have to sell assets and pull out of unprofitable routes.
Ultimately, the pilots agreed, figuring that the big ownership stake and seat on the board that they won would give them a greater say over strategy. And it was the pilots and the machinists who picked Mr. Greenwald, a former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, in part for his concern about labor relations dating back to a summer job he'd had as a teen-ager organizing for the garment workers' union.
The honeymoon lasted about 18 months. Then, last January, managers started hearing criticism from employees about bonuses -- based on the company's profit -- being given to UAL's top 600 managers and officers. The incentives were part of the 1994 contract that created the employee stock ownership plan.
Employee mistrust of management deepened last summer when, even before the new round of wage negotiations had begun, United's managers decided to hold a practice run-through arbitration. In a memorandum to employees, the company said it was only doing its job for shareholders, gaining a reference point for the approaching talks. But Mr. Glawe, the union leader, said his members viewed it as a sign of bad faith. "I don't feel the pilots have been accepted as equal partners, as opposed to merely being tolerated by management," he said.
With the industry ending a year of record profits, employees of other airlines are also pushing for higher pay. In voting down American's offer of a 5 percent cumulative raise through 2000, members of the Allied Pilots Association indicated that they want a greater share of American's record earnings of $854 million last year. American says it cannot afford to give a bigger raise to workers if the company hopes to grow and remain competitive.
At United, the frustration is even more palpable because the buyout was intended to give the pilots more control over the company.
But with their current contract in effect through 2000, the pilots' influence has dwindled. Before the vote, Mr. Greenwald acknowledged being surprised by the strength of the feelings held by the pilots -- and others. Last week, mechanics rejected an agreement similar to the one offered the pilots. Workers in another United division of the machinists' union, though, approved a deal.
The problem, Mr. Greenwald said in an interview in Washington, is straightforward: "No one thought we would do this well this quickly."
The appreciation of United's stock alone has made the average pilot $137,000 richer in less than three years, he noted. And, Mr. Greenwald said, he believed that stock was more important to pilots than they let on. He sometimes teases them with an offer to buy it from them, and they always refuse, he said.
While Mr. Greenwald said he would like to see Federal law changed to make the stock more liquid for employees, he believed when he took the job that the stock price would be the main measure of his success. In an interview published in Airline Business, a trade magazine, in March 1995, Mr. Greenwald said: "If the stock is high, people will like me. If it is low, they won't."
Mr. Greenwald recalled this week that when he was being interviewed for the job, he told the pilots over and over that he would represent the interest of all shareholders.
"These are the folks that hired me, they are my partners, but they did hire me to lead, not to follow," he said. "If they wanted to call the shots themselves, they should have bought 100 percent of the company, I guess."
To keep everyone focused on the long term, Mr. Greenwald said he would have to talk to employees even more than in the past.
"I thought we would be able to communicate a common goal more easily than we have," he said.

Chart: "Frayed Alliance"
After United Airlines' employees bought 55 percent of the company in 1994, the new employee owners were featured on the cover of the company's annual report. Now, however, labor relations at United have many of the same stresses as at conventionally managed companies. Here is where key employee groups at the airline stand.

WHERE THINGS STAND: Large bonuses last year for 600 top managers inflamed relations with other employee groups.
 
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
22,000 members
 
CONCESSIONS: Nothing; the union did not join the buyout. But some attendants bought stock outside the deal.
WHAT THEY GOT: Elimination of some arcane work rules, including weight restrictions.
WHERE THINGS STAND: Negotiating a new contract.
 
MACHINIST
23,000 members
 
CONCESSIONS: 9.7 percent pay cut; paid lunches.
WHAT THEY GOT: A board seat; 20.4 percent of the company's stock; increases in pension plan contributions; job security.
WHERE THINGS STAND: Part of the union recently accepted a pay increase within the buyout's terms, but another rejected a similar proposal last week.
 
PILOTS
8,000 members
 
CONCESSIONS: 15.7 percent pay cut; reduction in pension plan contributions; reduction in vacation time for some pilots; lower starting salaries.
WHAT THEY GOT: A board seat; 25.4 percent of the company's stock; job security.
WHERE THINGS STAND: The pilots rejected a new contract yesterday because they want bigger pay raises.

HEADLINE: High Treasury Official to Join Salomon

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Jeffrey R. Shafer, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, will resign on Feb. 1 to join Salomon Brothers as a managing director and vice chairman of the Wall Street firm's international division.
"I have an excellent opportunity to pursue my interest in international finance in the private sector," Mr. Shafer said in a letter of resignation to Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin, himself former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, a Salomon rival. 
 Mr. Rubin accepted the resignation "with deep regret."
Mr. Shafer, 52, was sworn in on Dec. 27, 1995, replacing Lawrence H. Summers, who was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.
The holder of a doctorate in economics from Yale, Mr. Shafer joined the Treasury as an assistant secretary in May 1993. From 1984 to 1993, he worked at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and before that in the Federal Reserve System.

HEADLINE: After the Last Picture Show;
The Politics of Nostalgia Grows Bitter Over a Movie Palace in Flushing

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
As the elevated No. 7 IRT train slowed to its last stop in Queens some years ago, John P. Watts used to look outside fondly toward the northern end of Main Street. Against the nighttime sky, above the low rooftops of downtown Flushing where tall buildings with Chinese and Korean signs have since risen, he would pick out the red light of the RKO Keith's.
"The light told us there was something exciting down Main Street," said Mr. Watts, 41, the chief of staff for City Councilwoman Julia Harrison. "It was a fixture for so long. And then, when it wasn't there anymore, you missed it, and the excitement went away." 
 When the lights went out at the RKO Keith's on Labor Day in 1986, no one could have guessed that the closing of a movie palace, whose popularity had begun to ebb in the 1970's, would give rise to one of the longest and fiercest neighborhood battles in the borough. But a fight over a place where many Queens old-timers saw their first movies or stole their first kiss grew into a fight over memories, real or enhanced, of a Flushing that the newcomers had yet to change.
On one side was Thomas J. Huang, a Taiwanese-born developer, now 44, who bought and closed the theater in 1986 in the hope of reopening it as a combination shopping center, movie multiplex and hotel. In less than a decade in this country, Mr. Huang had brashly assumed the quintessentially New York City role of empire builder, a small-scale Donald Trump. The more than 100 residential and commercial buildings he erected in his corner of Queens allowed him to stand next to Reagan, Bush and D'Amato in photographs that now hang on his office walls.
On the other side stood some of Flushing's old-timers, most of them white, who contended that despite the $3.4 million Mr. Huang had paid, the RKO Keith's belonged, in some sense, to them, too. The fact that the theater's lobby and grand foyer had been awarded national landmark status in 1984 buttressed their belief.
So while shops and offices have mushroomed all over Flushing, one of its most prominent spots, the end of Main Street on Northern Boulevard, has remained lifeless. If the redevelopment of a landmark requires economic and political cooperation, the sight of the boarded-up building is perhaps a reminder of something unique about Flushing: the stark division between those with the money and those with the votes.
"They're really not helping Asian people," Mr Huang said of local politicians. "You can see this neighborhood, the Asian people put down money, work very hard. You have a lot of stores opened by Asian people, working 24 hours. And they bring money. What can they do? That's the most they can do." The Asian immigrants, few of whom are registered voters, have "zero" political pull, Mr. Huang added.
The RKO Keith's also suggests the political role nostalgia plays in Queens in a way it no longer can in Brooklyn or the Bronx. Those who remember the heyday of the Loew's Paradise or the Loew's Kings, two other movie palaces that have been closed for several years and whose future is uncertain, moved away from the Grand Concourse and Flatbush Avenue, respectively, long ago. But in Queens, a younger borough whose population grew partly by drawing people from the older boroughs, old-timers and newcomers are on the same blocks. And nostalgia can be used to conjure up an enchanted past or to label someone as hopelessly out of touch.
In Flushing, the politics of nostalgia, with the RKO Keith's as its touchstone, will be played out this year in the Democratic primary race for City Council. Mrs. Harrison, 76, the longtime incumbent who once had Asian-American backers, has lost most of that support because they say she has not stood up for their interests. Mrs. Harrison, who has described Asian immigrants as "colonizers" and last year likened their arrival to an "invasion," is being challenged by Ethel Chen, 58, a Taiwanese-American who is a Democratic district leader at large and who failed in her bid to unseat Mrs. Harrison in 1993.
In the meantime memories abound. Mr. Watts remembers that on hot summer days in the 1960's he would hang around the theater entrance, trying to cool himself in the wafts of air-conditioning. On the hottest days, clutching the few dimes his tolerant mother had slipped him, the boy was allowed into the lobby, past the grand foyer where plump goldfish swam below a marble cherub in a three-tiered fountain, and into the auditorium where he sat in one of the 3,000 seats and whiled away afternoons under a twilight blue ceiling.
"The Keith's was taken away from us," he said. Speaking of Mr. Huang, he said, "He ripped the heart out of Flushing."
Fred Borneman, 63, who works as a doorman in Greenwich Village and has lived in Flushing for 52 years, recalled as he walked toward the RKO Keith's the other day how he would run to it after school to get the 5 P.M. discount. But by the 1970's, movie palaces had fallen victim to high costs and declining attendance. The RKO Keith's, like the others, was carved into a triplex.
Back then, community organizers and elected officials did nothing, said Mrs. Chen.
"If they wanted to save this place, why didn't they do anything then?" Mrs. Chen said. "Now that an Asian has taken it over, they just criticize. They just bring negative views. They never have any proposals. They don't want change. But the reality is, we have changed."
Mrs. Chen and others said that Flushing's heart had already been ripped out by the time Mr. Huang came from Taiwan in 1973 and started studying at Queens College. As many of the baby boomers who grew up in Queens left the borough, downtown Flushing suffered from a high vacancy rate, and in the mid-1970's, there was talk of blight.
Mr. Huang became one of the first to invest in Flushing, which quickly began drawing more and more Taiwanese and Korean businessmen. Flushing was on the road to recovery and Mr. Huang was a prominent builder by the time he bought the RKO Keith's in 1986.
In 1987, the Landmarks Commission revoked his construction permit after $160,000 in damage to the landmarked foyer was found. Since then, Mr. Huang said, elected officials and overzealous members of a local group, the Committee to Save the RKO Keith's, have consistently impeded his attempts to revise his renovation plans according to city requirements. His critics, he said, had not helped with any proposals.
"In America, talk is cheap," Mr. Huang said. "People can point at you and say, 'You don't do that, you don't do this,' and keep talking. But doing is different."
In his office overlooking Northern Boulevard and the RKO Keith's, Mr. Huang held what he said was a list of tenants he had had to turn away because of the empty building. He said he never considered selling the site. "That location is gold!" he said.
Over the years, local elected officials and members of Save the RKO Keith's have accused Mr. Huang of trying to renege on his obligation by letting the building deteriorate. According to preservation laws, he must restore the landmarked portions before he can start building.
In recent months, relations have worsened. Inspectors were called and found asbestos and oil, and barred anyone from entering the premises.
According to Mr. Huang's lawyer, Jeffrey Chester, the city said early this week that it would consider Mr. Huang's application to repair the unsafe conditions if both sides agreed on an independent architect or engineer who would monitor the work and who would be paid by Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang agreed.
This week, though, the Keith's doors remained padlocked, with a notice from the Department of Buildings prohibiting entry. A handwritten message of scribbled anti-Asian epithets on the notice suggested that some people's anger toward Mr. Huang was only the tip.
Mrs. Harrison said that Mr. Huang's critics are angered by his conduct and not motivated by anti-Asian sentiments, but she added that such sentiments had probably increased because of him.
"Unfortunately he doesn't represent the best," she said. "And it's unfortunate, but he may have contributed to a feeling of hostility."
A current leader in Save the RKO Keith's, Jerry Rotondi, 55, whose phone number Mr. Watts punches in by heart on his office phone, said of the owner: "He's a greedy, unimaginative -- I don't want to call him a developer."
Asked what should be done with the building, Mr. Rotondi said he wanted a study done on possible uses. Other opponents say the site should become an entertainment center.
Although Mr. Huang was derelict, Mrs. Chen said, in not maintaining the building, she added that his critics were too envious to acknowledge his pivotal role in Flushing's rebirth.
Peter Casini, an architect who has long worked for Mr. Huang, said that politicians pleaded for Asian investments in the 1970's. But Asian-American success has caused resentment among old-timers, he said, and officials were using Mr. Huang as an easy target to shore up votes.
As for memories, Mrs. Chen's are different. A Queens resident for 33 years, she recalled that in 1977 she finally yielded to the pleading of her two young sons and took them to the RKO Keith's to see "Star Wars." It was her first time there, and she was appalled, she said, by the stench of urine in the ticket lobby and by the flagrant sales of drugs inside and outside the theater. She phoned her brother who sat with her children to watch the film while she waited in her car.
"People talk about the good old days," Mrs. Chen said. "But sometimes the good old days are not as good as nowadays."

Earnings Rise at Kodak, And It Plans Job Cuts
Eastman Kodak said operating profits in the fourth quarter rose by 21.5 percent. Wall Street was pleased, and Kodak stock rose 5 percent. 
 The company said that on an operating basis it earned $395 million, or $1.19 a share, up from $325 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Kodak also said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs, mostly in Europe, and the earnings report included a $256 million charge to cover the costs of the cuts. [Page D3.]

Digital Equipment Shows Profit
Digital Equipment regained profitability in its fiscal second quarter but is still suffering from slow sales of its Alpha computer systems. Digital reported net income of $31.9 million, or 15 cents a share, after posting a loss of $66 million, or 48 cents a share, for its first quarter. [D3.]
 
G.E.'s Quarterly Results Gain
General Electric said its earnings rose 10.8 percent in the fourth quarter, to $2.07 billion, from $1.87 billion a year earlier. [D3.]
 
Strong Profits Lift Stocks
Buoyed by the strong earnings reports, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.49 points, to close at 6,765.37, its seventh record in two weeks. Broader indexes also rose. [D7.]

The prices of Treasuries fell, with the long bond yield up to 6.83 percent from 6.79. [D13.]
 
Ford to Cut 1,300 Jobs in Britain
Ford Motor, which has been losing money in Europe because of excess capacity and weak sales, said it would cut 1,300 jobs at a plant near Liverpool, England. [D4.]
 
Mercedes-Benz Head Resigns
Daimler-Benz said that Helmut Werner, the head of its Mercedes-Benz unit, had resigned because he saw no appropriate role for himself after the planned merger of his unit into the parent company. [D4.]
 
Chief to Quit
At Federated Stores
Allen I. Questrom, who took Federated Department Stores out of bankruptcy and made it into the parent of many of America's best-known stores, said he would step down as chairman and chief executive in May. Mr. Questrom, who had hinted that he might depart, will be succeeded by James M. Zimmerman, left, the company's president and chief operating officer. The executives have worked closely together for years. [D3.]
 
Condos From the St. Moritz?
Faced with declining profit, the Australian company that owns the St. Moritz Hotel in Manhattan has decided to transfer the hotel's fate to Donald Trump. He plans to turn the St. Moritz into luxury condominiums, people in the real estate industry said. [A1.]
 
Paradoxical Prosperity for Koreans
Over the last few years, living standards have risen dramatically for South Korean workers. But a new law intended to let companies compete better with lower-wage nations is also increasing anxiety about job security. The immediate aim of the widespread strikes there is a repeal of that law, but more broadly the workers are taking a stand against the economic forces that brought prosperity but now threaten to take it elsewhere. [A1.]
 
Old Air-Traffic Computer Replaced
A 25-year-old computer at the Chicago air-traffic control center, probably the frailest major piece of equipment in the F.A.A.'s creaky system, was retired. The computer's replacement was declared operational, a step the agency says will make air travel faster and more reliable. [A16.]

HEADLINE: Thriving, South Koreans Strike to Keep It That Way

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: ULSAN, South Korea, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Until four years ago, Lee Soo Chun, an equipment repairman at Hyundai Heavy Industries, lived a threadbare existence with his wife and son in a single rented room.
Now he owns a two-bedroom apartment. Over the years he has also acquired a television, a VCR, a stereo, a car, a personal computer for his son and enough leisure time to indulge his passion for hiking. 
 The upward mobility of Mr. Lee and his fellow tenants of the Ten Thousand Apartments can be glimpsed mornings in the building's parking lot, where people push cars back and forth by hand in what looks like some kind of ritual.
So many residents have bought their first cars in recent years that there is now a severe shortage of parking spaces. People double-park, leaving the brakes off and the gears disengaged to allow others to shove their cars out of the way.
But Mr. Lee, 41, whose $20,000 salary is nearly triple what he was earning when he joined the company 15 years ago, feels far from secure. Last month the Government enacted a labor law that makes it easier for companies to dismiss workers, in an effort to compete with newly industrializing nations, where wages are still comparatively low. There are reports, Mr. Lee said, that Hyundai may lay off 3,000 workers.
And so he is on strike, joining a violent and bitter labor protest now entering its fourth week. His immediate aim is repeal of the new law. But in a deeper sense, he and his co-workers are taking a stand against the global economic forces that brought investment and prosperity to low-wage Korea and now threaten to take it elsewhere.
This is reflected in Mr. Lee's ambivalence toward the strike. Workers' animus, he says, is not really directed against Hyundai, the company that has brought his family and others solidly into the middle class. "We are not angry at the company," he said, "just at the Government. It's not about money, it's politics."
The strike differs from the labor unrest that has convulsed South Korea in past years. It is not so much about gains in wages and working conditions as about protecting them. It signals a shift in emphasis, similar to those felt in the United States and other developed countries, from higher pay to job security.
The complex dynamics can best be seen in this city of one million on the southeastern coast, which has long been the hotbed of labor unrest and is a focus of the current strike.
Here in Ulsan, South Korea's blue-collar capital, walking off the job over a perceived injustice is a matter of honor. Although he had misgivings about harming Hyundai, Mr. Lee felt compelled to strike.
"I'm afraid of what my son will think about me if I don't strike," he said. "My son will think I'm a chicken."
This city was practically built by the Hyundai Group, one of the largest of the giant family-controlled conglomerates, known as chaebol, that dominate the economy.
About 80,000 workers here are employed by the six Hyundai subsidiaries that stretch in a chain along the city's waterfront: the Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea's largest car manufacturer; Hyundai Heavy Industries, the largest shipbuilding yard in the world; Hyundai Precision; Hyundai Pipe; Hyundai Wood Industries, and a Hyundai ship-repair facility.
Although the strike is large by Korean standards, it is concentrated among relatively few companies, and Hyundai, particularly its automobile subsidiary, is one. Some other chaebol, like the Samsung and LG groups, have experienced little or no unrest.
This has to do in part with Hyundai's history of poor labor relations. In a nation of endemic strikes, no company has had more problems than Hyundai. As a result, its unions are militant and primed for conflict.
"We are well organized and we have experience over the last 10 years," Lee Young Hee, the leader of the association of Hyundai unions, said proudly when asked why these unions were at the center of this strike. As he spoke, thousands of Hyundai workers rallied on the banks of the Taehwa River, singing protest songs with synchronized arm movements as if they were a well-rehearsed drill team.
Hyundai says its labor problems stem from the fact that so many blue-collar workers are concentrated in Ulsan, which makes them easy to organize. But labor officials say it has to do with the company's attempts to fight the unions.
In the interest of rapid economic growth, unions were suppressed by South Korea's authoritarian leaders until 1987, when democracy started to take root. At that point, workers began organizing and striking for a bigger share of the nation's growing wealth.
But Hyundai fought off unionization attempts. In the late 1980's, there were cases of hired thugs attacking labor leaders, and at least one case in which a union organizer was kidnapped and held for a few days, according to "Korean Dynasty," a 1994 history of Hyundai by Donald Kirk, a journalist. Workers, for their part, also resorted to violence at times.
In the last few years, the number of strikes for higher wages at Hyundai has diminished, but a bitter legacy remains.
In June 1995, for instance, a Hyundai Motor union activist, Yang Bong Soo, who had been dismissed for protesting company work practices, died from injuries he had suffered a month earlier setting himself on fire. In his honor workers walked out; after about a week the strike was broken up, its union leaders arrested.
A week ago, in a chilling replay, another Hyundai Motor worker, Chung Jae Sung, who had been a friend of Mr. Yang, set himself on fire. He remains hospitalized in serious condition.
Because of this history, the right to organize is very important to the Hyundai unions, and that is one of the issues in the current strike. The new labor law will make it easier for companies to replace striking workers.
And the law delays for three years the legal recognition of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, an umbrella group that is orchestrating the strikes and to which the Hyundai union belongs.
But the wealth now evident among workers in Ulsan has in some measure undercut the intensity of this strike, support for which is far from universal here.
[On Wednesday, some Hyundai employees wanting to return to work burst through the picket lines in Ulsan, clashing with strikers. Union officials say that nationwide, about 260,000 workers were striking Thursday. But the Government says the number was 80,000.]
Woo Byung Ho, 40, a welder at Hyundai Heavy Industries, said he could not afford to walk away from his job. "I was in strikes in 1988, 1989 and 1990," he said. "Now I dislike the labor union. During the strikes, I lost a lot of money."
Cheung Ho Pyung, a 55-year-old employee of Hyundai's ship repair yard, said the labor law issue was not a problem between the company and workers. "It has nothing to do with us," he insisted.
Workers' affluence is increasingly evident in Ulsan, which in the last decade has acquired trendy department stores, boutiques and an airport. In addition to salaries that have tripled in 10 years, Hyundai workers enjoy a variety of benefits typically available in company towns.
Employees are offered a 50 percent discount at the hospital, which is owned by Hyundai. The company also pays children's tuition at its own private school. And workers can rent or buy subsidized apartments like those at the Ten Thousand Apartments complex, which Hyundai built.
About 90 percent of married workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hyundai Motor own their apartments or houses, a Hyundai spokesman said.
Wages have risen 15 percent a year for the past 10 years -- 8 percent after adjustment for inflation. The Goverment and South Korean corporations say that is too high and threatens the competitiveness of Korean industry. "Korea and the Hyundai Group are facing globalization," a Hyundai Group spokesman said, "but the labor leaders don't want to change."
Some workers say that pay is still not high enough and that their gains have been eaten away by inflation, which was as high as 9 percent annually a few years ago and is now about 5 percent.
"It's true that life is better," said Chung Jong Soo, 32, an assembly line worker at Hyundai Motor. "But I don't think we are well off."
When Mr. Chung began working, he was poor; in fact his poverty forced him into the work force right after graduation from middle school. Now he makes about $1,500 a month. But he said he still did not have enough money to buy a home, go to movies or travel.
Workers express concern that with the nation's economic growth slowing, their relative success might now be in jeopardy. Newspaper articles and television dramas are filled with stories of "honorary retirees," people induced to end their careers early in return for large severance packages. With the new labor law, many workers fear, companies will be able to dismiss them without severance.
"Hyundai Motor has 48,000 workers," said Kim Dong Soo, 36, an assembly line worker. "Twenty percent of them will be fired."
Such fears might not be misplaced. The Hyundai spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no employee cutbacks had been made or announced at any Hyundai companies. But he noted that many companies in Korea are having to decrease their work forces.
Still, while some workers say they realize companies must remain competitive, this does little to assuage their fears. "I'm also worried about losing competitiveness," Mr. Kim said. "But it is necessary to protect workers' rights."
Workers are not oblivious to the argument that frequent strikes hurt companies' performance. "I think strikes do great harm to the firm," said Mr. Lee, the equipment repairman at Hyundai, as he prepared to depart for a hike. "Most workers are tired of going on strike. They don't want to strike anymore."

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Will Begin Attack on Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Opening a campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would require balancing the budget, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said today that he planned to warn Congress on Friday that it was on the brink of making "a terrible mistake" that would pose "unacceptable economic risks to the nation."
In an interview in his office, Mr. Rubin acknowledged that sentiment in favor of the amendment, which was defeated by only one vote in the Senate last year, appeared to be building on Capitol Hill. 
 "This will be an uphill battle," said Mr. Rubin, who has been the Administration's most outspoken opponent of a constitutional limit. But he insisted that "those who count the votes say the outcome is still uncertain, and it is monumentally important that the balanced budget amendment not be put in place."
In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, Mr. Rubin said that he would affirm the Administration's commitment to balance the budget by 2002 -- but that he would also warn of "the many, many risks" of enshrining such a balance in the Constitution.
A constitutional amendment requires passage by two-thirds of both houses, and then by three-quarters of the state legislatures. Passage appears likely in the Senate, but the amendment's fate in the House is unclear. So is the timing of the vote.
But there is still debate among Republican proponents of the amendment over which chamber should take up the issue first. Those proponents also hope to use the prospect of a vote as leverage in their negotiations with the White House over the next budget.
President Clinton has no formal role in the approval or rejection of constitutional amendments, though Mr. Rubin said today that his testimony would be "the first public discussion of the very powerful reasons the balanced budget amendment would be a terrible mistake and something we should not do."
The first public discussion in recent months actually came from President Clinton, who gave a winding talk in mid-November in which he seemed at times to acknowledge that passage of the amendment would be hard to stop. Though Mr. Clinton expressed some misgivings then, he did not muster any strong language, leading Mr. Rubin to correct his boss gently the next day.
In his testimony on Friday, Mr. Rubin said he would stress that if the amendment was in force, an economic downturn could quickly "turn into a recession, and a recession into something worse."
"The problem is that if the nation does in fact get into a recession," he said, "we now have automatic stabilizers that go into effect that can increase demand in the government sector to offset declines in the private sector. What the balanced budget amendment would require is that during a recession we would have to raise taxes or cut spending to put ourselves back in balance. And that could exacerbate the recession."
The Administration has in the past marshaled economists to make the point that since the Government began using Government spending to compensate for economic downturns, a practice that did not begin until World War II, recessions have been shorter and less severe.
But it is unclear how big an effort the Administration will make, especially if it fears spending Mr. Clinton's limited political capital in Congress. Instead, it could focus its efforts in the state legislatures, arguing that if Federal spending was sharply cut back because of the amendment, the burden might fall on the legislatures.
Mr. Rubin also plans to unleash several other arguments. Among them is that an amendment would increase the chances of default on the national debt because it would restrict increases in the debt limit, the amount the Government is allowed to borrow. Similarly, he argues, it could pose additional risks for the Social Security system.
In his speech in November, Mr. Clinton speculated about the possibility of including an automatic "escape hatch" in the constitutional amendment that would permit deficit spending in times of economic downturn. Under the current wording of the proposed amendment, such spending would require approval by 60 percent of both houses of Congress, a high hurdle. Proponents of the amendment say such an extraordinary obstacle is needed to insure that the Government balances the budget except in times of national emergency, like war.
Mr. Rubin says it would be virtually impossible to write wording that would protect the economy. "I haven't seen a trap door I thought was commensurate with the complexities of the economy," he said today.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Good U.S. Trade Data Help Dollar Against Mark and Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached its highest level in two and a half years against the mark and Swiss franc yesterday in a rally powered by better-than-expected United States trade data and by hints of lower German interest rates from two top Bundesbank officials.
The dollar also rose to a 45-month high against the yen, helped by more signs of economic anemia in Japan. 
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin further aided the dollar by declaring for the third time this week that a strong currency was desirable.
Traders who had bet on a lower dollar scrambled to buy dollars as it surpassed important technical levels against the mark, accelerating the dollar's advance in what is known as a short-covering rally.
"The dollar has really had a substantial up move," said Victor Polce, vice president and corporate foreign exchange manager at the New York branch of Commerzbank.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6174 marks from 1.5943 on Thursday, and to 1.3989 Swiss francs from 1.3796 francs. Both were the highest levels for the dollar since mid-June 1994. The dollar rose to 117.38 yen, from 116.44 yen on Thursday, the highest since March 1993. The British pound fell to $1.6674 from $1.6798.
Traders said the main force driving the dollar higher yesterday was the report from the Commerce Department that the United States trade deficit edged up only slightly to $8.4 billion in November, well below the $10 billion widely expected. The report was seen as a sign that the dollar's nearly 14 percent rise against the yen and 13 percent rise against the mark over the last year had not started to expand the deficit.
The dollar strengthened further on mark weakness after Johann Wilhelm Gaddum and Franc-Christoph Zeitler, two senior members of the Bundesbank, suggested that German interest rates might be eased.
In separate remarks made in Germany, Mr. Gaddum said "interest rate increases certainly aren't on the Bundesbank's present agenda," and Mr. Zeitler said benign German inflation would give the central bank flexibility to lower rates.
Their remarks came less than a week before the Bundesbank council meets, and there has been growing speculation it will nudge rates lower.

HEADLINE: Epilogue for Another Bookstore

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Books & Company, the venerable Upper East Side bookstore that has provided a home for a generation of writers, giving them space for readings and allowing them to browse uninterruptedly amid its dark paneled stacks, will close on May 31, the owner, Jeannette Watson, announced this week. "We just cannot afford to pay the rent," Ms. Watson said.
It is the latest in a series of independent bookstore closings in Manhattan. On the Upper West Side alone, at least three independent bookstores have closed since a Barnes & Noble superstore moved in in 1993. Nationally, the American Booksellers Association has estimated, some 50 to 60 independent bookstores shut down in 1996. And as the news of Books & Company's closing spread through the literary community, the reaction was dismay. 
 "I'm heartbroken," said the writer Cynthia Ozick over the phone last week. "What does it tell us? That New York City can't support an independent bookstore?"
The reason for the closing, said Ms. Watson, is simply that business has been bad lately. The building, on Madison Avenue at 74th Street, is owned by the adjacent Whitney Museum of American Art, and Ms. Watson's lease is up. "They were not willing to lease it on terms that were economically reasonable for Books & Company," she said.
The new lease provided for a rent increase that Willard Holmes, the deputy director of the Whitney, called "a small percentage."
Mr. Holmes added, "It's unfortunate that they're not going to renew." Neither he nor Ms. Watson would say exactly what the rent was, but rents for relatively small spaces on Madison Avenue can be as high as $400,000 a year.
Books & Company was started in 1977 by Ms. Watson, the granddaughter of Thomas J. Watson, the founder of I.B.M., and her partner, Burt Britton. Since then it has been a gathering place for writers, its antique air, its smell of old books and creaking floors making it seem like a bit of London.
When she opened her store, Ms. Watson, a divorced mother of a son, was doing charity work. She had attended Sarah Lawrence College and had always loved books, so much, in fact, that her father called her "Madame-Nose-in-Books," she said.
Still, her friends and family were surprised that the wealthy young woman would want to tend store. Her father, Thomas Watson Jr. a former Ambassador to Russia, asked, "Why do you want to start a bookstore?' " Ms. Watson remembers. "I told him I want to start something no one can take away from me."
For 10 years the shop flourished. It was a place where literary fiction got the best display, not the latest best sellers. Ms. Watson called those years the Golden Age. "It was not unusual to make a $2,000 sale to one person," she said. "People had a tremendous amount of money. They would buy expensive art books."
Through its reading series, the bookstore introduced young writers, among them Amy Hempel, Susan Cheever, Steven Millhauser and Edwidge Danticat. Harold Brodkey met his wife, the novelist Ellen Schwamm, there and called Books & Company "symphonically important to me."
The poet James Merrill even wrote a poem about the store for its 10th anniversary:
Ten years of browsing, and the shelves
Mysteriously grow more packed
Full of reflection, silver-backed . . .
Looking for books, we find ourselves.
During those years, Ms. Watson met and married her second husband, Alex Sanger, grandson of Margaret Sanger and president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. They had two sons.
But the last decade has not been kind to Books & Company. Real estate values have driven many aspiring writers out of the neighborhood. The superstores have come along, offering big discounts. And now there's competition on the Internet. "You give your credit card number," Ms. Watson said in describing Amazon.com, an Internet bookstore, "and the book comes in two days."
Ms. Watson resisted change. "We stayed old-fashioned," she said. She never put in a computer. When customers called to request a book, she would dash around the store looking for it while the customer waited on the line. To increase business, she did start a personal delivery service, to anywhere in the city.
For the last five years, said Ms. Watson, she has been putting some of her inheritance into the place. "But a bookstore should not be a charity," she said. "It should be a business. I give money to charity." Sales picked up at Christmas, she said, but it wasn't enough.
Last year she started a publishing venture with Jonathan Rabinowitz of Turtle Point Press in Purchase, N.Y. The first book was a reprint of Hannah Green's "Dead of the House," a coming-of-age novel that the author, who died last year, had painstakingly worked on for years. "Just a beautiful book," said Ms. Watson. "We have to keep reprinting it. We're sort of close to breaking even."
She has discovered she loves publishing: editing, "working on the book jacket," all the minutiae. And she will continue doing it after the store has closed. " In May will come "A Journey With Elsa Cloud," a travelogue about India by Leila Hadley, a descendant of James Boswell.
"This has always been my private club," Ms. Watson said of her store. "It's an amazing way of getting to know people. I like to go through my house charge customer lists: 'Oh, interesting! They're reading this! They're sending the book to the White House!' I felt this thrill of pride. My books are going all over the world. It's taught me not to judge people simply by what they do. The doormen on Madison Avenue, for instance, have an intense interest in books."
There has been talk of a final reading. "But that would be too hard," she said. "We'll have a final party, instead. We'll just invite everybody."

HEADLINE: Bonds, Ignoring Strong Reports, Are Unchanged

BYLINE: >By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in choppy trading yesterday in an abbreviated session ahead of a long holiday weekend. The market will be closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
The 30-year bond was unchanged at a price of 9528/32 for a yield of 6.83 percent. 
 Traders attributed whatever price gains the market managed in the short session to a strong dollar and an article in The Washington Post that asserted that senior officials of the Federal Reserve appeared unlikely to raise short-term interest rates anytime soon as a precaution against a resurgence of inflation.
The market's friendly tone was only temporarily interrupted by the Government's reports on trade and industrial production yesterday. November international trade figures showed little change, as the deficit widened 4.9 percent, to $8.4 billion, from the $8 billion in October. That was well under expectations of the deficit's widening in November to $9.8 billion after shrinking 30 percent the month before.
Industrial production and capacity utilization in December continued to expand, as production rose eight-tenths of a percent, compared with estimates of seven-tenths of a percent, and November's number was revised lower by one-tenth of a percentage point, to an increase of eight-tenths of a percent. Capacity reached its highest level of the year in December, to 83.8 percent, up from 83.3 percent in November and higher than the 83.5 percent economists had expected. However, it is still below levels that raise fears of bottlenecks and potential inflation pressures.
Traders said the negative impact of the economic news was short-lived, as consumer confidence fell. The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment this month fell to 96 from 96.9 in December.
Max Bublitz, president of Conseco Capital Management, Carmel, Ind., said that until the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting in December, he had expected the Fed to tighten. But, he said, it appeared to him that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, had since made it clear he would not raise interest rates unless there was a sharp rise in inflationary pressures.
"The markets are ill prepared for a tightening," Mr. Bublitz said, "but they're better than they were a month ago, before Greenspan made his 'irrational exuberance' comment."

HEADLINE: A Tunnel to the Future

 BODY:
In an age when New York City seems to have given up on big building projects, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made a smart, farsighted decision to press for construction of a $900 million rail freight tunnel between the city and New Jersey. But to succeed, the Mayor will have to build some political bridges.
New York City is economically crippled by its inability to connect to the national rail freight system, which lies just over the Hudson in New Jersey. The city's passenger train tracks do not have enough clearance for taller cargo freight cars, and the closest usable bridge for freight is almost as far north as Albany. As a result, virtually all the cargo moving into and out of the metropolitan region is carried by truck. 
 Truck transport over long distances is more expensive, both for manufacturers and consumers. There are also the indirect costs of traffic jams, air pollution and deteriorating highways and bridges. The lack of a rail freight connection also helped destroy New York's port, sending shippers across the river to Newark.
New York's deep, natural harbor is one of its greatest resources. It took a combination of civic shortsightedness, union intransigence and bad planning to allow the bulk of port business to go to New Jersey, where land was cheaper but the harbor is much shallower and difficult to navigate. Now the Newark port is not deep enough to accommodate newer, larger ships without blasting through the bedrock beneath the water at enormous expense. A recent study by the city showed that building the rail freight tunnel and rebuilding the Brooklyn harbor would be cheaper than deepening Newark's port. It also concludes that an expanded regional port involving both facilities could protect Newark's shipping business while adding more than 50,000 jobs to New York City. The city now plans to go ahead with two more studies that could make the projects eligible for partial Federal financing.
In the meantime, Mr. Giuliani has a lot of work to do. New Jersey must be convinced that the project is also in its interest. New Jersey politicians regard expansion of New York's port as a greater threat than the increasingly competitive ports elsewhere. The Mayor also needs to bring Gov. George Pataki in as a full partner. The state controls the distribution of Federal transportation aid, and there is a distinct lack of enthusiasm about the idea in Albany. The tunnel could be Mr. Pataki's crowning achievement as an environmentalist, and give credibility to his contention that he is as concerned about the future of New York City as he is about his own suburban and rural base.
The Mayor has demonstrated that he is capable of working in a bipartisan, cooperative manner. He embraced the rail freight idea even though it is the brainchild of Representative Jerrold Nadler, who has been fighting for the project for nearly 20 years. The liberal Mr. Nadler demonstrated how productive such alliances can be when he formed an unlikely partnership with the Conservative Party's head, Michael Long, who likes the idea of those thousands of potential Brooklyn jobs.
Now Mr. Giuliani must reach out further. If this project succeeds, he and Mr. Pataki will be remembered among the city's great politician-builders.

HEADLINE: Vindication of the Mexican Bailout

 BODY:
Mexico's early repayment of loans made by the United States in 1994 puts the finishing touch on a public-policy success. President Clinton's decision to bail out Mexico, over Congress's opposition, was politically unpopular. But with support from the Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole, Mr. Clinton tapped an obscure Treasury fund to lend Mexico more than $13 billion.
Loans from the United States and the International Monetary Fund helped Mexico repay foreign lenders and halt collapse of the peso. Mexicans suffered from their Government's austerity program, and wages are still falling, but the economy grew by about 4 percent last year. After the peso collapsed in the early 1980's, Mexico stagnated for the rest of the decade. 
 Mexico pledged its oil exports as collateral and adopted strict monetary and fiscal policies -- the only way foreigners could be coaxed to reinvest. The austere conditions and stiff interest charges sent other countries the message that Western bailouts would not serve as an attractive alternative to adopting responsible policies.
The United States intervened in Mexico because Mexico's economic collapse would have slashed demand for American exports and driven illegal workers across the border. Such dangers will not be easily replicated elsewhere. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, understood that United States intervention could help Mexico, thereby encouraging other developing countries undergoing market reforms. Powerful politicians criticized the bailout. To everyone's benefit, Mr. Clinton did not retreat.

Moving to end speculation that this will be his last term in Washington, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said yesterday that he had arranged a birthday fund-raising event to kick off his re-election campaign. The unusually early event -- the election is not until 2000 -- is also intended to discourage fellow Democrats from jockeying for his seat, aides said.
Senator Moynihan said his decision to run was all but final. "It means that would be my present intention," he said. 
 The Senator from New York said that in arranging a fund-raising event almost four years before the election -- a $1,000-a-head reception on March 10 at the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center -- he was bowing to aides who are concerned about the escalating cost of senatorial campaigns, and about Mr. Moynihan's tendency to put off raising money. The Senator spent about $6 million during his 1994 campaign, and aides said he was likely to spend close to $10 million in 2000.
The decision to schedule and draw attention to the fund-raising reception, first reported yesterday in The Forward, the English-language Jewish weekly, was clearly intended to put an end to discussion that has begun about Democrats who might run for Mr. Moynihan's seat in 2000.
There has been widespread Washington speculation, which Mr. Moynihan's aides described yesterday as unfounded, that the Senator, 69, would not run again because of his age, his health or out of frustration with finding himself a member of the Senate minority.
"I picked this up, too," Mr. Moynihan said of the speculation. "I know why: I wasn't raising money." As to his health, Mr. Moynihan described himself as fit. He said he was satisfied with his effectiveness in Washington, even with the Republicans in control of Congress.
And while Mr. Moynihan will mark his 70th birthday at the fund-raising event, he suggested that he is serving in an institution that values, rather than frowns on, older members. "Senate, senior and sentient are all related terms," he said.
There are currently 14 senators older than Mr. Moynihan. If he ran and won, he would be 79 by the end of his next term.
The speculation about Mr. Moynihan's intentions was set off when Andrew M. Cuomo was nominated by President Clinton to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In accepting the nomination, Mr. Cuomo specifically ruled out any intention of challenging Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998, and there was speculation that Mr. Cuomo would join the list of Democrats who would seek Senator Moynihan's seat.
Mr. Moynihan, though, could not resist holding out a sliver of enticement to any other Democrats hungering for his position.
"Well, yes, it means it would be my present intention," he said of running for re-election. "But I've been around long enough that surprises come along. I just heard today of a friend who has been nominated to be U.S. permanent representative in Geneva.
"Now if you offered me that job? A most beautiful house, a view on the lake, once every August the economic-social council meets, and what else you do, I don't know -- check out the restaurants?"
"No one's offered it to me yet," he said. "But try me."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Modestly Wider; Industrial Production Surges

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Record exports and a surge in industrial production combined late last year to propel the economy at an accelerating pace, Government figures showed today.
Led by sales of farm products, exports climbed to a new peak of $72 billion in November as the nation's trade deficit widened, but considerably less than expected, to $8.4 billion, the Commerce Department reported. 
 And American industry raised output in December by a hefty eight-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month, surpassing most forecasts, as plants operated more intensely than they had in more than a year.
Despite such momentum, which has prompted many analysts to raise their estimates of overall economic growth to a rate of 4 percent or more for the final 1996 quarter, the Federal Reserve is still not expected to see enough risk of accelerating inflation to raise short-term interest rates at its coming policy meeting in early February.
"We still anticipate the entire economy to ease in coming quarters," said Tim O'Neill, economist at the Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, reflecting a widespread view that Fed officials have strongly indicated they share. "Factors cooling the economy should include consumer demand, residential contraction and a stronger U.S. dollar."
A higher-valued dollar, now up 10 percent on a trade-weighted basis from its lows of early 1995, tends to curb foreign sales of this country's goods and services.
The bond market took today's data in stride while stocks barreled to yet another record, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 67.73 points, to 6,833.10.
After a sharp narrowing of the American trade deficit in October -- more than one-third of it reflecting overseas deliveries of big commercial aircraft, which tend to occur in bursts -- most analysts had expected a substantial rebound in the other direction for November. But today's report showed only a modest $400 million widening of the gap between exports and imports as sales of soybeans, corn and other farm products soared.
Still, the trade deficit for last year is now certain to eclipse the $105.1 billion recorded in 1995; the 11-month total stands at $102.9 billion. This would be the fifth straight annual increase.
Although many American exporters have been able to overcome the disadvantage of a rising dollar, they suffer from the inability of weakened trading partners to buy their goods. On the other side of the equation, American consumers can afford to indulge themselves by buying foreign goods and services -- $80.4 billion in November, second only to the record $80.8 billion of May 1996.
Today's report also showed that United States deficits with both China and Japan narrowed substantially in the latest month, but analysts cautioned against drawing conclusions about trends. One reason is that the figures for individual trading partners -- unlike the aggregate numbers -- are not adjusted for recurring seasonal variation, and goods for the holiday shopping season were mostly brought here before November.
The gap with China, which last year briefly surpassed that with Japan, narrowed to $3 billion from $4.9 billion, about two-thirds of this from lower imports and one-third from higher exports to China.
John Park, economist at Sanwa Securities in New York, called the big decline with China "a one-time blip."
With Japan, the gap shrank to $4.3 billion from $5 billion as imports fell about twice as much as exports.
The monthly figures for China and Japan do not yet include services, on which the United States runs a substantial surplus.
The American deficit with Western Europe narrowed $400 million in November while expanding that amount with Mexico, the report also showed. The deficit with Canada shrank by $500 million but this result was again muddied by the strike there at General Motors, which ships huge amounts of parts and vehicles across the border.
The Federal Reserve's report on industrial production for December showed sharp advances in output of business equipment and consumer goods and materials, excluding energy, with the production index of 129.1 standing 5.1 percent higher than in December 1995.
And had it not been for exceptionally mild weather last month, which caused a 3.3 percent slump in utility output, industrial production would have risen 1.1 percent instead of the reported eight-tenths of 1 percent.
Manufacturing rose 1.1 percent last month after an increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent in November while the nation's mines had a 1.2 percent gain, twice that of November.
The Fed's report also showed that use of industrial capacity increased four-tenths of a point in December, to 83.8 percent, the highest level since August 1995.

Expansion May Cause Teams to Trade Leagues

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Like kids trading baseball cards, the National and American Leagues may soon trade teams -- Houston for Kansas City, for example, or maybe Montreal for Tampa Bay.
Those swaps were two of the early possibilities raised today on the outcome of the study by baseball's realignment and expansion committee that owners and officials believe will lead to a geographical shuffling of teams between leagues. Expansion by two more teams to 32 was also viewed as a likely development. 
"I'm not a big proponent of expansion, but I think at some point there will be expansion," Tom Schieffer, president of the Texas Rangers, said today.
The Rangers were one of the clubs whose opposition to the placement of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League helped prompt the realignment study. Schieffer hopes the study leads to a change that would put the Rangers and the Astros in the same league.
"We would prefer Houston move to the American League, but that's something we all should be open-minded on," Schieffer said by telephone from Arlington, Tex. "I hope this discussion will lead to teams considering changing leagues if it enhances a regional rivalry."
The Rangers, Schieffer noted, do not have a regional rival in the American League. And, worse, playing in the A.L. West with three teams in the Pacific time zone creates difficulties for the team.
"If you had Houston and Texas playing in the same league, you'd have an intrastate rivalry that would be good for baseball," the Rangers' executive said. "The people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area think the people in Houston are competitors. We would have been much better served years ago if we had been in the same league."
Based on the Rangers' experience, Schieffer said he believed the Florida Marlins and the new Tampa Bay Devil Rays would fare better economically if they played in the same league.
"That was my advice to the people in Florida," he said.
Vincent Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, said Thursday that he liked being in the American League because his team will be the only A.L. team in the Southeast. But a natural geographical alignment would have the Devil Rays, Florida and Atlanta in the same division. Then if Charlotte, N.C., gets an expansion team, it could form one of four divisions in a 16-team league.
If the Devil Rays were to switch leagues after their first two years, Montreal could replace them in the A.L. and form a natural rivalry with the Toronto Blue Jays, Canada's other team.
Drayton McLane Jr., the Astros' owner, did not return a telephone call seeking his views on changing leagues, but Schieffer said he believed McLane had "pretty much the same feeling" about the Rangers and the Astros being in the same league.
"I think Kansas City might look favorably on something like that, where they could play St. Louis all the time," Schieffer said. "There's such a logic to geographic realignment. These time zones have much greater effect than people think. If you can get it lined up right, it could have a tremendously beneficial effect on the game."
David Glass, chairman of the Royals, did not return a call seeking his views, but a person who attended Thursday's meeting said that Glass had discussed the possibility of moving to the National League.
Glass had been opposed to moving to the A.L. West in 1998, a move that was considered a possibility in conjunction with Tampa Bay's joining the A.L. East. But in an effort to avoid further conflict, Tampa Bay is headed to the West for two years.
George Steinbrenner of the Yankees took advantage of the change in Tampa Bay's placement by swapping two series of interleague games with the Devil Rays in 1998. The changes must still be approved, but the Yankees would play Los Angeles and San Francisco and give the Devil Rays their games with the Marlins and the Braves.
When interleague play begins this year, teams in the corresponding divisions will play each other.
After meeting Thursday, the owners discussed keeping the same interleague matchups for 1997 and 1998 instead of switching to other division pairings. That plan would enable the Mets and the Yankees, for example, to play at Shea Stadium in 1998 after playing at Yankee Stadium in 1997.

Trade Deficit Up Slightly As Exports Reach Record
Record exports and a surge in industrial production combined late last year to propel the economy at an accelerating pace. Led by sales of farm products, exports climbed to a peak of $72 billion in November as the nation's trade deficit widened, but considerably less than expected, to $8.4 billion, the Commerce Department reported.
The report also showed that United States deficits with both China and Japan narrowed substantially in the latest month. The gap with China, which last year briefly surpassed that with Japan, narrowed to $3 billion from $4.9 billion. [Page 37.]

Court to Hear Insider Trading Case
Urged by the Federal Government to close a "large loophole" in the prosecution of securities fraud, the Supreme Court agreed to review a lower court's decision that cut back sharply on the Securities and Exchange Commission's approach to illegal insider trading. The case may produce one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in years on a question of securities law. [37].
 
New Price for AT&T-Loral Deal
The $712.5 million deal by Loral Space and Communications to purchase AT&T's Skynet Satellite Services will be repriced, after the disclosure by AT&T that one of its telecommunications satellites had been declared permanently out of service. [36.]

Gas Producer May Sell Field
The TransTexas Gas Corporation, a major natural gas producer, is close to an agreement to sell one of its largest and most productive natural gas fields to Conoco for about $1.2 billion, people close to the transaction said. A purchase by Conoco would be unusual because major oil companies have been selling some of their large domestic oil and gas fields in recent years as they shift their investment and exploration efforts overseas. [36.]

Market Continues Its Record Ways
Propelled by strong earnings reports, the stock market continued its January rally. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 67.73 points, or 1 percent, to close at 6,833.10, its eighth record this year, and a 6 percent gain since Dec. 31. Pacing the advance were: Du Pont, up 2 7/8 points, to 111 5/8; McDonald's, up 1 7/8, to 46 3/8, and Merck, up 1 7/8, to 86 3/8. Broader measures were also up, although not as strongly as the Dow. The S.& P. 500 rose 6.42 points, to 776.17, and the Nasdaq composite 8.59 points, to 1,349.05. [37.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities changed little in choppy trading ahead of a long holiday weekend. The yield on the 30-year bond held steady at 6.83 percent. [48.]
 
Dayton Hudson Paring Mervyn's
Dayton Hudson said that its Mervyn's division was pulling out of Florida and Georgia and that it would close 10 other stores as part of its effort to turn that division around. As a result of the moves and of previously announced plans to close five Marshall Field's stores in Texas and Illinois, it will take a pretax charge of $134 million against earnings. [36.]
 
Amre Plans Bankruptcy Filing
Faced with mounting losses, Amre Inc., a home improvement and remodeling company that licenses the Century 21 name from HFS Inc., said that it would file for bankruptcy protection and sell assets to repay creditors. In September, Amre successfully completed a public offering of 1.6 million shares at a price of $16 a share; the stock was last quoted on Thursday at 43.75 cents a share. [36.]
 
Equity REIT to Buy Wellsford
Equity Residential Properties Trust, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago and controlled by Sam Zell, said that it would buy Wellsford Residential Property Trust for $620 million in stock. The deal solidifies its position as the nation's largest apartment owner, with 317 complexes comprising 90,873 units -- about double its nearest competitor, Security Capital Pacific Trust. [36.]
 
Dollar Rises Against Mark and Yen
The dollar reached its highest level in two and a half years against the mark and Swiss franc in a rally powered by better-than-expected United States trade data and by hints of lower German interest rates from two top Bundesbank officials. The dollar also rose to a 45-month high against the yen, helped by more signs of economic anemia in Japan. [38.]

HEADLINE: Stores Gear Up for Week of Tax Relief

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
Today is Day 1 of a weeklong experiment in which most clothing costing less than $500 will be free of sales tax in much of New York State, and retailers have reprogrammed cash registers and beefed up sales forces, hoping to serve throngs of bargain hunters.
Most of the confusion among many retailers earlier in the week over exactly what articles were tax-exempt seemed to have cleared up by yesterday. The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance held seminars all week with local Chambers of Commerce and distributed an encyclopedic list of the tax-free categories. Among the finer distinctions: nylons, chef uniforms, ski masks and clerical vestments are tax exempt, but riding boots, bobby pins and watch bands are not. 
 "We're continuing to get the word out to vendors and consumers about what is and isn't taxable," said Kevin C. Quinn, a department spokesman.
All but 8 of New York's 62 counties have agreed to participate in the tax-free week, ending Jan. 24, by waiving their local sales taxes on clothing in addition to the state's tax break. In New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has tirelessly promoted this week as a possible prelude to permanent sales tax relief, consumers will save 8.25 percent -- 4 percent from the state, 4 percent from the city, and one-quarter of 1 percent levied by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"We're pretty optimistic about the week," said Jack Delargy, vice president and general manager of the Brooks Brothers store on Madison Avenue at 44th Street. "We have bolstered up our staffing of sales associates and managers."
Beverly Butler, a spokeswoman for Gap Inc., the retail giant that owns Banana Republic, the Gap and Old Navy stores, said, "We think there may be a pent-up demand because it's been publicized that the sales tax will be repealed, so we're going to increase our sales staff by 10 to 20 percent."
Many stores in New Jersey -- where clothing is not taxed -- are in the midst of their post-holiday clearance sales anyway. But at least one mall, Newport Center in Jersey City, said it had rescheduled a sale to compete with New York's sales-tax holiday. "Usually we hold our winter sidewalk sale the first weekend of January," said Sarah Liddle, the mall's marketing director. "But when I got wind of what was going on with the New York tax abatement, I decided to plan it for this weekend."
Newport Center, which is just opposite a PATH train stop, draws 25 percent of its customers from New York City. Like other retailers in New Jersey that are frequented by cost-conscious New Yorkers, the mall is keeping a wary eye on New York's consideration of repealing sales taxes on clothing. "If the repeal is extended," Ms. Liddle said, "it would have a big impact in the beginning, but people are still going to want to come over here and shop in a climate-controlled environment."
The plan for a week of tax abeyance was approved by the State Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki last summer as part of a budget package. Local retailers have complained for years that they were losing business to New Jersey and surrounding states, where clothing is not taxed.
State and local governments plan to study the results of the tax-free week to gauge the wisdom of making a permanent cut in the retail sales tax. But some economists and retailers have questioned the usefulness of a one-shot shopping spree, arguing that bitter temperatures and advance news media coverage could skew the outcome.
"It's an unfair test," said Marcia Wilson, a vice president of Daffy's, a discount apparel chain with stores in New York and New Jersey. "If I wanted to spend a lot of money advertising a sale in my stores, I guarantee I could drive up sales."

HEADLINE: Hot Garden Rivalry: Battle for Tickets

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Forget about the Knicks versus the Bulls. Forget about the Rangers versus the Islanders. The hottest Madison Square Garden clash of the winter season took place yesterday in State Supreme Court. And when the smoke cleared, the outcome was still in question.
At stake is not a trophy or a playoff berth but the rights to some $86,000 worth of season tickets, covering a block of eight seats at mid-ice or midcourt for each Rangers and Knicks home game. 
 Swirling in the pool of bad blood between the combatants are allegations of revenge and blackmail, the defeat of an infant's birthright, the denial of charity, the specter of insult to the Archbishop of Newark and the presence of celebrities like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.
In one corner in this battle are Dennis Riese and the Riese Organization, better known as operators of food outlets like Nathan's, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, TGI Friday's and Houlihan's, as well as restaurants like Charlie O's, Beefsteak Charlie's, Martini's and the Java Shop.
In the other corner are Madison Square Garden (home to the Rangers and Knicks) and the Garden's president, David W. Checketts, known to the better-spoken sports aficionados as Dave.
In the black robes, refereeing yesterday's contest was Elliot Wilk, State Supreme Court Justice.
According to court papers, the Garden and Mr. Checketts revoked the Riese season ticket subscriptions that date back some 30 years "in a mean-spirited pique" after deciding that the Riese Organization failed to move quickly enough to conclude a real estate deal proposed by the Garden and involving the lease on Riese's Beefsteak Charlie's restaurant in the Seventh Avenue arcade leading into the arena.
"I was completely stunned," Mr. Riese, president and chief executive of the Riese Organization, said as he recalled the Jan. 2 letter that informed him of the cancellations. "It was like a punch in the gut."
Applying to the court for injunctive relief and damages, Larry Hutcher of Davidoff & Malito, the lawyer for the Riese interests, used language like "economic revenge" and "blackmail" to describe the motives underlying revocation of the subscriptions, which were described as "irreplaceable."
In reply, Ken Munoz, executive vice president and general counsel for Madison Square Garden, said: "Well, that's just not accurate. The law is very clear. We have the right at any time or for any reason to revoke a season subscription. There are many cases in New York that have so held."
Mr. Munoz also disputed a Riese contention that the Garden had refused to allow the corporation to continue to advertise in the Garden and on the MSG cable network after it had spent more than $1 million from 1994 to 1996. Mr. Munoz said Mr. Riese "unilaterally terminated that on us."
He said, "We have had an acrimonious business relationship with the Riese Organization." And he said that in the past, the Garden had revoked season subscriptions "when we decided not to have any further business relationship with that company."
The court papers said that the Riese tickets were used for purposes of business and goodwill -- given to employees and customers, donated to charities for use in raffles, made available to people like the Archbishop of Newark and used for family purposes.
Mr. Riese, who is 43, said he had looked forward to sharing a Ranger game with his son, Samuel, now 6 months old. But, he said, "MSG, for perverted reasons, now seeks to deprive me of this pleasure both as a fan and a father."
On the evening of Jan. 8, Mr. Riese contended in his court papers, four people who intended to use their tickets were removed from their seats by security guards and escorted from the building, and the Garden used the tickets "to curry favor with their celebrity clientele by giving them to Susan Sarandon, the Oscar-winning actress and her husband actor/director Tim Robbins."
On Jan. 10, in the first courtroom skirmish, Justice Lorraine S. Miller awarded Mr. Riese and the Riese Organization a temporary restraining order, which prevents the Garden from interfering with the Rieses' right to use their tickets. When the parties faced off at 2 P.M. yesterday before Justice Wilk, he vacated that restraining order, pending a hearing on Tuesday, when the argument will resume over the Riese request for a permanent injunction against the Garden and unspecified damages.

WOMEN AND THE COMMON LIFE
 Love, Marriage, and Feminism.
 By Christopher Lasch.
 Edited by Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn.
 196 pp. New York:
 W.W. Norton & Company. $23. 
 When Christopher Lasch died three years ago at the age of 61, he left behind a body of work as likely to endure as that of any postwar American intellectual. According to many who knew him, he was a courteous and gentle man; but for those, including me, who knew him only through his books, his writing conveys a feeling of controlled outrage, as if he were working hard to convert indignation into argument.
Lasch, who was a professor of history at the University of Rochester at the time of his death, was angry about the condition of American society. In his provocative book "The True and Only Heaven: Progress and Its Critics" (1991), a study of how the Enlightenment ideal of progress has been perverted into a frantic consumer culture based on the ceaseless "transformation of luxuries into necessities," he describes contemporary America with a phrase that nicely declines to distinguish between greed and lust: we are, he writes, a culture obsessed with "the pornography of 'making it.' "
In a personal introduction to the same book, Laschallowed himself the ironic remark that the "one unambiguous success" he and his wife could claim in raising their children in this unappeasable consumer culture was their "failure to educate them for success." One of these children, Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn, succeeded in becoming a professor of history at Syracuse University, and she has now assembled her father's last essays into a book entitled "Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism." Along with a touching memoir by Ms. Lasch-Quinn of her father's last weeks, the new book comprises nine essays whose topics range from medieval romance to Robert Bly and the "men's movement."
"Women and the Common Life" is vintage Lasch. It continues his assault on the culture of consumption, and extends it to feminist and academic critics who claim to stand outside and above it. It carries forward his lifelong theme that each generation must provide for its children not chiefly in the material sense but in the sense of bequeathing to them a structure of thought and feeling through which a meaningful life may be achieved. As long ago as "The New Radicalism in America, 1889-1963" (1965), Lasch concluded that "at the end of the 19th century, middle-class parents found themselves unable any longer to explain to their children why their way of life was important or desirable." Thirty years later, in an essay in "Women and the Common Life" on the spiritual deprivations of suburban life, he returns to the same theme: "how to revive a sense of vocation in a society destitute of any sense of common purpose."
"Revive" is a key word for Lasch, who writes, perhaps more than he realized, in the religious tradition of calling a backsliding people to return to its abandoned ideals. One of the refreshments of reading him is that he states his beliefs outright, rather than wrapping them in putatively objective historical arguments -- as when he remarks (in an essay in "Women and the Common Life" on romantic love) that it is "heartbreaking" that "lifelong marriage no longer serves as the standard to which erotic practice ought to aspire," or when, in "The Revolt of the Elites" (1994), he declares that "luxury is morally repugnant."
Lasch knew that such pronouncements would be greeted by howls of post-modern derision: Whose standards? Whose morals? Why prefer self-denial to self-indulgence? What entitles anyone to imagine that one's disgust is more than a local or contingent response to an alien value? Isn't the very vocabulary with which we discuss these matters -- using words such as "dissipation" and "discipline" -- proof that the etymology of our moral terms leads back through an endless chain of conventions to . . . nowhere? These are the sorts of hectoring questions one hears in the background of Lasch's work, and to which he writes in fervent response.
In "Women and the Common Life," the ideal world whose virtue has been lost to the fashion of relativism is best expressed through the symbol and actual practice of marriage. The kind of marriage Lasch has in mind is not the old "dynastic" institution that preserved wealth within the confines of the propertied gentry and was therefore threatened when sexual attraction erupted between members of distinct classes. He has in mind a different, essentially middle-class ideal of marriage, more erotic than contractual, which he traces from its appearance in the Middle Ages, through the 18th century with its political debates about what constitutes legitimate marital union, and into our own time.
In defending this "union of desire and esteem," Lasch reveals himself as a true puritan -- not in the pejorative sense of being prudish, but in the sense of believing that good societies (on the small scale of families and the large scale of political communities) can be sustained only if desire is sanctified by respect. This is why the New England Puritans (to whom Lasch grew increasingly sympathetic as he grew older) thought of marriage as a "miniature commonwealth," a model for human relations in which appetite and obligations are held in delicate balance. Lasch agrees, which is why he may be fairly described as an economic liberal and a cultural conservative -- a liberal whothinks that humane societies must curb excesses of wealth and poverty, a conservative who thinks that individual members of such societies should be held accountable to a standard of personal responsibility.
In Lasch's view, the structures that have fostered this kind of moral equipoise in the past -- political institutions, civic and charitable organizations, and especially families -- are today in chronic crisis, and nothing much has arisen in their place. Unlike neoconservatives, who seem to imagine that the so-called traditional family has somehow always existed, he locates its invention in the 19th-century "cult of domesticity." But he differs just as sharply from historians on the left who regard its invention as a scheme for suppressing the aspirations of women. For Lasch, the new family -- with its companionate marriage ideal, its premium on maternal nurture and its complement in the public sphere of women's leadership in reform and charity -- was a "liberal solution to the problems of industrial society."
Whatever one thinks of this historical account, it seems beyond dispute that in our postindustrial era the traditional family is under assault -- by poverty and illegitimacy in what is often termed the underclass, by the imperative of two wage-earning parents and the disappearance of domestic servants in the middle class, and by divorce and the rise in respectability of extramarital sex and homosexuality across the classes. Since Lasch believes that the threatened family has been the chief means of imparting such values as love, realism, obligation and trust, he suspects that we are losing our best means of resistance to the contrary values of the marketplace. (It would have been interesting to have his response to the movement for gay marriage that has accelerated since his death.) We are ruled, he thinks, by an "increasingly narrow identification of the American dream with the American standard of living," and since for much of the middle class that standard is no longer rising, a spiritual crisis has seized us.
One comes away from Lasch's last work with disturbing questions. What resources can Americans call upon to deal with their reluctant discovery that "progress" -- understood solely as material acquisition -- is slowing down and will perhaps even be reversed? What ideals do we have left besides the rule of the marketplace, the thrill of power and the "sharp, small, immediate and more or less interchangeable pleasures" of sex? These are among the questions with which "Women and the Common Life" interrogates feminism, which Lasch fears has been infected by the spirit of the marketplace. "The feminist movement," as he puts it, "far from civilizing corporate capitalism, has been corrupted by it. It has adopted mercantile habits of thought as its own." He doubts that the prospect of upward mobility alone is enough to confer meaning on the lives of women any more than on the lives of men.

To the Editor:
In his review of my book "Kellogg's Six-Hour Day" (Dec. 22), Michael Kazin objects that my explanations for the death of shorter hours in Battle Creek, Mich., fall short because "many . . . workers tolerate long hours when their jobs are challenging, dramatic or essential to helping people they know and like." Sounding for all the world like a business management textbook writer from the 1950's, Mr. Kazin concludes with a utopian fantasy that has long befuddled historians and sociologists: "Automation can, over time, eliminate the most tedious occupations." 
 I most certainly did not ignore this development. To the contrary, I spent two of the book's nine chapters detailing the rise of the very rhetoric Mr. Kazin employs. I argued that in order to counter shortening work hours, a process that had been going on steadily for over a century, managers, industrial leaders, senior male workers and sympathetic academics fashioned a rhetorical foundation for industrial work discipline. This new, word-based work discipline included the promise of "good jobs" (Mr. Kazin's wonderful, "challenging" jobs) and emerged over the last 50 years to combat successfully the threat of increasing leisure, stanching the hemorrhage of time flowing out of the economy.
Once I shared Mr. Kazin's fantasy that a "good" job is a realistic expectation for most people. But on my first visit to Battle Creek, one of the women workers glared at me over half-spectacles and said: "Sure, everybody wants a Prince Charming job. But the jobs I know about, and that the people I know are likely to get, are mostly a pain in the butt. Everybody but a complete idiot or a college professor who has never hit a lick of work in their lives looks forward to quitting time, and the sooner it comes the better. Why do I even have to tell you that time off is way better than having to work?"

 Holy Land
 A Suburban Memoir.
 By D. J. Waldie.
 Norton, $24. 
 Placelessness has been a favorite conceit of writers on the postwar suburbs almost since their beginning. D. J. Waldie grew up in Lakewood, Calif., a West Coast Levittown rolled out near Los Angeles in the early 1950's "on fields cut to stubble only hours before construction began." What is unusual about Mr. Waldie, and what gives his book, "Holy Land," its uncanny force, is that he still lives there, in the house where his father died; he also happens to work there, as a Lakewood city official. Mr. Waldie is much too close to Lakewood to sentimentalize it and far too deeply rooted there to buy into any glib notions of its placelessness. He has written a quirky, multidimensional portrait of Lakewood in the form of a mosaic: "Holy Land" is constructed of 316 sharp and often weirdly elliptical chapters, some as short as a sentence, none longer than a page. What Mr. Waldie is up to is overlaying a sequence of different perceptual maps on his hometown: he lets us see it by turns through the grids of history, memoir, journalism, geology, politics, economics and anecdote. And by the end of this short, fascinating book, he has presented Lakewood with a history as rich and various -- as storied -- as the most ancient of cities. Michael Pollan

Fort Lauderdale

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO; MIREYA NAVARRO is chief of the Miami bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
With its reputation as a spring-break capital long behind it, Fort Lauderdale -- along with its neighboring beach towns -- is working hard to become known as a destination for grown-ups who cherish good food, shopping bargains and a taste of Americana. While Miami, just 25 miles to the south, offers Cuban food and salsa music, the 28 municipalities known as Greater Fort Lauderdale boast cowboys, a flea market with drive-in movies, and a circus.
But Fort Lauderdale is also competing for the tourist dollar on sophistication and comfort. There is top-notch dining among its more than 2,500 restaurants. The airport is receiving nearly $1 billion worth of new terminals, gates and refurbishing, and is already attracting South Floridians fleeing the congestion of its counterpart in Miami. 
 The beach and warm weather, of course, are the primary draw in the winter. But to lure more international visitors, another $1 billion in public and private money has been earmarked for new attractions over the next five years, including an entertainment and retail complex and an aquarium, both in downtown Fort Lauderdale and scheduled for completion in 1998.

O Glorious France! (Born In the U.S.A.)

BYLINE: By Bernard Holland 

 BODY:
AMERICANS. HANG YOUR HEADS. France is not pleased with you. It is not enough that your State Department fails to treat her as a mighty diplomatic power; now you persist in fiddling with her culture. Careful, lest you and your British colleagues find yourselves relegated to the wrong side of the French border, wistful outsiders looking in at the musical glory that is modern France.
Yes, Bruce Springsteen and the Who do seem vile next to that Gallic giant of rock-and-roll, Johnny Halliday. Duke Ellington fades in comparison with Michel Legrand. Begone Tina Turner and McDonald's. French sensibility has no need of you. (I say this last with some puzzlement after watching a hundred of France's young elite struggle desperately to purchase Big Macs on the Rue de Rennes last October.) 
 The world watches in awe as the French Ministry of Culture legislates quotas for imported television programs and plays neological catch-up in its attempt to replace omnipresent English terms with French equivalents. One wishes these rear-guard actions against impurity well, but will "gros porteur" ever really replace "jumbo jet"?
But France. Take care whom you reject. With all of us English-speakers gone, who is going to put on your operas and play your music? Think on Germany's postwar Economic Miracle: What would have happened if, in the middle of it, that vast imported Turkish work force had suddenly been sent home. In music, that crisis is multiplied, for not only have the Americans and English dug the ditches; they have drawn up the plans as well.
France. You have not done a very good job with your music, but don't worry; we are there to help you. The new Paris Opera at the Bastille is by all reports a bureaucratic, political and artistic morass, but perhaps its new music director, the American James Conlon, will knock the appropriate heads together.
Rejoice, France, in the revival of Baroque opera: the re-emergence of Rameau and the careful reconsiderations of 17th- and 18th-century style that have gone with it. Whom shall we applaud for this considerable accomplishment? Who better than that great symbol of French cultural superiority, William Christie, of South Wales, N.Y., founder and director of the ensemble Les Arts Florissants?
Paris. Thanks for all the money given to the Theatre du Chatelet last October to support an extended survey of Stravinsky and France's influence on his work. Difficult to explain, however, is why it took an orchestra from California (the Los Angeles Philharmonic) to bring it off.
With the American Robert Hale as Wotan, Jeffrey Tate, an Englishman, led the first Paris "Ring" cycle in 36 years three years ago; Antonio Pappano, an American, led the recent, successful "Don Carlos." Consistently high-level orchestra concerts have come not from the Orchestre de Paris but through the regular visits of the London Philharmonia.
The evident star of the Bastille's "Cosi Fan Tutte" not long ago (again with Mr. Tate) was a Welsh mezzo-soprano named Eirian James. Paris in the 1990's has known a Richard Strauss craze, but with blessed few French singers in the major roles. (Try Maria Ewing or Karen Huffstodt as Salome instead.) Strauss aside, the distinctive French singing style, with its clear, fastidious head tones, has more or less vanished into an international one-size-fits-all school of opera singing. Mr. Christie's young Baroque performers come the closest I have heard to keeping French singing alive.
Don't look to the Paris Conservatory for help here. In Cherubini's time it may have been a great institution. In my era there, in the 1960's, it was not, offering instead a viciously competitive educational system that rewarded toughness and uniformity and crushed the weak and the different. Everyone played more or less the same, and today's paucity of important French conductors, players and singers seems to indicate that not much has changed in 30 years.
The buildings are better. France has poured millions into arts construction, and to be fair, it has done valuable and expensive work in developing its regional operatic and music centers. Yet as one Parisian commentator said not long ago in these pages, "Money can't buy the ability to create." Pierre Boulez's master classes for conductors last May at the shiny new Cite de la Musique complex in Paris attracted full houses for two days. The orchestra was from Cleveland, and by the way, the classes were in English.
The most interesting music in Paris is coming not from the so-called major institutions but from the relatively marginal Chatelet. The city has provided it money, a lot of which is going to bring in creative artists from Britain, America and elsewhere. France did better in the past. Indeed, when contemporary musical politics finally fade away, it may well dawn on the world that Debussy has been the century's greatest composer. Today, Henri Dutilleux's music gives off an elusive, tantalizing beauty that will also be more widely recognized. Along with his striking approach to composition, Mr. Boulez is approaching greatness as a conductor of the general repertory. Beyond these people and perhaps a few others, the pickings are slim.
France's correct response to American culture is not insults and condescension. Nor is it quotas. Replacing simple English terms with complicated and confused French ones seems just one more foolish battle. France will expel our popular culture from its consciousness only by replacing it with a strong culture of its own. Be patient, France. We are doing our best to help you build it.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Chasing Value In Fliers' Miles

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON; DAVID CAY JOHNSTON is a business reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
SOME people will go to absurd lengths to collect frequent flier miles, traveling from New York to Seattle by way of Charlotte, Atlanta or even Miami, or staying in a pricey hotel on the company tab to take advantage of a double miles offer. But how much value you get for your miles can be even more important than how you earn them.
As demand for air travel has grown with the economy, the airlines have in the last couple of years trimmed back on miles they give out, raised the number of miles for some awards, added blackout dates, tightened up on the availability of seats that can be purchased with frequent flier miles and added new fees. But there are ways to get more bang for your miles. 
 The rule of thumb is that a frequent flier mile is worth 2 cents, based on the notion that a domestic ticket typically costs $500 and such a ticket requires 25,000 miles on most airlines. With some smart moves frequent flier miles can be worth a nickel or even close to a dime each. But the airlines are perfectly happy to let you redeem 25,000 miles for a ticket you could have bought for $100, valuing your miles at less than a half cent each.
Flexibility Is a Major Plus
What you can get for your miles depends on your travel plans, your tastes and on knowing how to spot a chance to get a good deal from the airlines. It also helps to be flexible, and to know the signals that an airline has seats going begging. And you might consider using miles for benefits you might otherwise regard as extravagances, such as first class or even a ride on the Concorde.
The first rule of cashing in miles is flexibility. "Go off peak," advises Karen Goodwin, editor of Frequent Flyer Magazine. "Don't expect to find the seat you want at the busiest season. The airlines can easily sell seats to London in July and August so they don't make as many free ones available."
Joe Chapline, Delta Air Lines's frequent flier director, says it also pays "to be flexible about which days you travel. Going one or two days earlier or later will truly make a difference," he continued, "and remember that flying Thursdays and Saturdays you are more likely to get frequent flier award seats."
Being flexible about which airport, or changing planes, can help, too. If you want to fly from New York to Los Angeles and are told no seats are available, ask about a seat to nearby Orange County, said John McDonald, a spokesman for T.W.A. Flights to Orlando may not be available, but the amusement parks are only an hour or so drive from Tampa, Daytona Beach and other Central Florida cities whose flights may have plenty of seats.
Likewise, if you want to spend high season in Paris, London or Rome but cannot find a seat, you might have better luck asking about a seat to Brussels, Nice, Milan or Manchester, assuming you want to visit one of those cities and like European trains.
Changing planes instead of going nonstop can also help at busy times, said Richard Metzner, a vice president for marketing at Continental. "If the agent tells you nothing is available nonstop ask, 'Is there anything available via Cleveland or Houston?' "
If you want to stop over in a connecting city, say in Pittsburgh on your way from Boston to New Orleans, most airlines will charge you a much higher fare, but many reward tickets allow stopovers, according to Mark Seltzer, a Toronto dealer in rare travel books. Likewise, tickets bought on deep discounts often prohibit an "open jaw," in which you fly to one city, but fly home from another, while many reward tickets allow this option.
The second rule is to watch for signs that an airline has unsold seats. Last summer, when most airlines offered fewer frequent flier seats across the North Atlantic because they had a surge of paying customers, Continental increased the number of frequent flier seats to Europe by 68 percent over summer 1995. The reason? The airline had added more flights, increasing its capacity by 30 percent. If the airlines are offering incredibly inexpensive seats or bonus miles, they may well have seats available for reward travel.
Airlines often offer deals to new destinations or when they are trying to get fliers to associate their name with a destination. When United bought Pan American's Asian route system a decade ago, for example, it offered travel to Japan or Tokyo for half the usual number of miles, a program that packed its planes and soaked up a lot of frequent flier miles, which are a liability on the company's books. Cathay Pacific recently offered round-trip coach travel to Hong Kong for 40,000 American Airlines miles from any city in the United States. In the recent past, it has offered trips to Australia, Thailand, India and South Africa for similar amounts.
"If you see a destination on sale it's a good bet that there are plenty of frequent flier seats on those flights," said David Castleveter, a spokesman for USAir.
Airlines will sometimes offer brief frequent flier sales. Continental sometimes has trips to Europe for 25,000 miles, half the usual requirement. And United and some other airlines also sometimes offer a combination cash and miles deal, such as Europe from the East Coast for 20,000 miles and $100.
High-Value Upgrades
 Some of the best deals come from using frequent flier miles for business class or first class. USAir frequent fliers can go round trip to Europe on five carriers -- Air France, Alitalia, Sabena, Swissair and USAir (and British Air until March 29) in coach for 60,000 miles during the warm months, when an advance purchase ticket is often around $1,000. But business class requires only slightly more at 80,000 miles. First class is 100,000 miles, while a first-class ticket costs about $8,000, making miles worth about 8 cents each. And the even costlier Concorde is 125,000 miles, although that deal ends when USAir's alliance with British Air ends.
Greg Lyon, 25, a computer consultant in St. Louis, used 85,000 miles last May to fly T.W.A. business class to New York and first class on to London and return the same way. "For 50,000 miles I could have flown coach from St. Louis to London, a ticket worth maybe $500." Mr. Lyon said. "But for 70 percent more miles I got a ticket that would have cost five to eight times that much. To me that's an excellent value."
Tony Todd, 44, a software developer in Tampa, figures he got $24,000 worth of tickets for 240,000 miles and $1,000. He used 160,000 miles for two round-trip first-class tickets to London and another 80,000 miles to upgrade two round-trip coach tickets, which had cost $500 each, to business class. "I figure I got close to a dime per mile," he said.
His trip also illustrates two additional ways to get more value for your miles: plan and travel in pairs. American Airlines requires 200,000 miles for an "anytime" first-class ticket to Europe good on any flight. But by planning your trip well in advance and avoiding the blackout dates, you only need 100,000 miles. If you travel with a companion, however, two first-class plan ahead tickets bought well ahead of time require only 160,000 miles, a 20 percent discount.
But sometimes, you can get more value for your money with a last-minute trip, if seats are available. Airlines often charge a fee of $50 to $75 for arranging tickets within three weeks or less of flying. But some will let you redeem miles at the airport -- Delta Air Lines, for example, charges $60 for last-second mile redemption -- and take the next flight with an open seat.
Frequent Flyer Magazine, in an annual reader poll, found that the availability of first-class upgrades was the most desired perk for people who participate in frequent flier programs, but that 66 percent of those responding said it was getting harder to get into first class.
Airlines typically offer three ways to fly up front without buying a first-class ticket: an upgrade certificate given as a bonus to its most frequent fliers; a fee, typically $30 for short flights and $90 cross-country or an upgrade bought with miles. If you choose the last option, be careful which miles are deducted because miles in old programs can often be more valuable. On Delta Air Lines, for example, to upgrade from coach to business or first class from most fares, including a deeply discounted ticket, you need only 2,500 miles from its old program. But if you use miles from its current Sky Miles program, the upgrade costs 10,000 miles.
The worst way to get value for your miles is to let them expire. Continental, T.W.A. and USAir miles never expire. But American Airlines miles expire after three years, and on Jan. 1 the first to go were those earned in 1993 and earlier. United and Northwest miles begin expiring at the end of this year if they are three years old. Delta Air Lines miles also expire after three years if you have not flown on the airline in that time.

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
A World of Enchantment, Page After Illuminated Page

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
FOR MORE THAN a thousand years, beginning around A.D. 500, Roman Catholic monks copied stories and illustrated them with heroic saints and fantastic beasts, capturing the glorious imagery also seen in medieval stained-glass windows. These illuminated manuscripts have been popular ever since, first with monarchs and bishops, and more recently with bankers and industrialists.
This year, illuminated manuscripts will be more visible in New York than they have been in decades. A bizarre world of monsters, demons, groveling humans and wide-eyed angels is vividly depicted in the new book "The Illuminated Manuscripts of Medieval Spain," by Mireille Mentre. The book, which was published last month by Thames and Hudson of London, focuses on works from around the year 1000. 
 The Metropolitan Museum of Art will include 50 books of exotic illuminations in "The Glory of Byzantium," an exhibition that will run from March 8 through July 6. The most ambitious show of such art, "Medieval Best Seller: The Book of Hours," will be held at the Pierpont Morgan Library, from September into January 1998. It will present 100 books from the 13th to the 16th century.
A prelude to this rich feast is currently on view in "Princely Magnificence," an exhibition of 50 illuminated manuscripts at Ursus Rare Books, in the Carlyle Hotel, through Feb. 8. The show of 13th- to 16th-century works is the first of its kind at Ursus, which was founded 25 years ago by T. Peter Kraus. He got started in the business 30 years ago, working in Manhattan for his uncle, Hans P. Kraus, the Vienna-born dealer in rare books who dominated the market in illuminated manuscripts until his death at 81 in 1988.
The Ursus exhibition was organized with Jorn Gunther of Hamburg, Germany, a dealer in medieval manuscripts and early printed books. He also apprenticed at H. P. Kraus a decade ago.
The works at Ursus range in price from $27,500 for a gilded 16th-century image of Pentecost, depicting the Holy Ghost as a dove descending on the apostles and Mary, to $5.5 million for a 13th-century psalterfrom Wurzburg, Germany, containing many surrealistic images. Among them is a haloed Christ, seated in a temple among elders who wear hats shaped like flying saucers.
The boldly rendered illuminations enchant medievalists because they are so readily understood. "But what appeals even more to collectors is that most of these books come from great collections," Mr. Kraus said. "To know that an illuminated manuscript once belonged to a French king, or J. P. Morgan, helps them to identify with these men of power."
Past owners of books in the show include many famous people. In the 1930's, Henri de Rothschild, for example, owned a 15th-century Parisian Book of Hours, a medieval book of prayers. And at the turn of the century, William Waldorf Astor bought another French version of the book, made in about 1520. That book is now called the Astor Book of Hours. J. P. Morgan, the banker, was also buying a century ago when he acquired "Ars Moriendi Treatise," a colorfully decorated 15th-century work about death.
In centuries past, wars and social upheavals caused many books to come on the market. "In France, illuminated manuscripts were still in religious houses in the 18th century," Mr. Kraus said. "They got dispersed during the French Revolution." But these days, sales of illuminated manuscripts are sparked by either plummeting financial markets or soaring prices.
During an economic downturn in 1983, Peter Ludwig, the German chocolate manufacturer and collector of everything from medieval books to Pop Art, sold his 144 illuminated medieval manuscripts to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., for $50 million.
Six months later, Sotheby's auctioned the most important book of illuminations ever to go under the gavel, the Henry the Lion Gospels, a book given by a 12th-century Bavarian duke to the Brunswick Cathedral. The $11.7 million sale price was then the record for any work of art sold at auction. It was paid by a team of dealers headed by H. P. Kraus, acting as agents for the German consortium that bought it.
Since then, the market for medieval illuminations has been largely quiet, even though Christopher de Hamel organizes auctions of such manuscripts twice a year at Sotheby's in London. Of the five or six collectors buying important medieval books today, the most prominent is J. Paul Getty Jr. With rare exceptions, Mr. de Hamel said, the buyers become known only when they sell their libraries.
Mr. de Hamel said it was not until the 1983 sale that "I realized Peter Ludwig was a collector of illuminations." Ludwig, who died last July, kept his passion secret by buying almost exclusively at H. P. Kraus.
For collectors like Ludwig, these books have a singular distinction. "Illuminated manuscripts remain the one true confluence in art of words and images," Peter Kraus said. "It's where paintings and books come together as art."

HEADLINE: The View From: Danielson Airport;
Exercise In Small Town Aviation

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
MOST airfields are bustling centers of activity, but at Danielson Airport they do in a month what some would do in a busy afternoon. There are generally just 100 to 200 takeoffs and landings a month, including students at the flight school. "Sometimes in the winter when the weather's real bad, we might not have any for a day or two," said J. Gary Boroughf, president of Northeast Air Management Inc., which manages the airport.
The track team from the adjacent Harvard H. Ellis Technical School maintains a 3.5-mile trail on the airport property, and the State Police have a shooting range in a gravel pit just south of the runway. Dagwood, a yellow dog with a great disposition, wanders among the 63 parked aircraft, cadging the occasional biscuit. State Traffic Commission signs warn visitors, "Area closed from sunset to sunrise." 
 "It's a great, grass roots, general aviation airport," said Mr. Boroughf. And, he said, people want it to stay that way. In November, when the Federal Department of Transportation announced a $900,000 grant for improvements, including resurfacing the runway, new lights and new signs, town and airport officials were quick to emphasize that no expansion was planned.
Keith L. Knowlton, vice president of Fiberoptic Technology Inc. in Pomfret, who flies a Beechcraft Baron -- "The best thing ever made for turning money into noise" -- said no one wants to relive the battles in the 1980's when the local business community advocated extending the runway 300 feet. That would have made it safer to land the twin- and single-engine propeller planes at Danielson, and reduce everyone's insurance premiums, he said.
But, Mr. Knowlton added, "People in the area think extending the runway is a nefarious scheme to bring 747's into Danielson."
As Mr. Boroughf explained, "We try to maintain a balance between the neighbors and the flying public. There are always going to be noise issues and esthetic issues, but those can be managed if you're careful about traffic patterns and pilot practices."
There are occasional conflicts. R. Thomas Homan, town manager of Killingly, which encompasses the borough of Danielson, said a few years ago townspeople were upset about a plan to fence in the airport property. Eventually the State Department of Transportation modified the design, leaving unfenced some heavily used walking trails.
A new dispute centers around a Federal Aviation Administration plan to clearcut more than 40 acres of trees to provide a clearer flight path -- a plan the town only heard of by accident, Mr. Homan said.
"You've got a lot of residents around there, and those trees are an important resource," both to the environment and because they provide a buffer between the airport and nearby homes, Mr. Homan said. "They should have at least talked to us about it first." Forty acres might not seem like much to a major Federal agency, he acknowledged, but in Killingly it certainly counts.
The F.A.A. is "always willing to sit down and work out a compromise once they realize people are upset," he said, "but sometimes they don't consider how much of a controversy a project might cause."
Robert F. Juliano, chief of the Bureau of Ports and Aviation at the State Department of Transportation, said the $900,000 Federal grant and $100,000 in state funds meant Danielson represents less than 3 per cent of the $35 million annual operating budget of Bradley International Airport, the state's largest.
But Mr. Juliano said small airports are important. With more companies buying their own aircraft so they are no longer at the mercy of commercial schedules, he said, general aviation fields are economic development tools. They also provide other services -- a local stop for organ transplant teams, for instance.
To get to Danielson Airport, off Maple Street in Killingly, one takes a narrow, winding asphalt road through dense woods, to a one-story hangar surrounded by planes with names like Yankee Boy and Top Gun. There's a T-6 military aircraft from South Africa and an Army L-19 Bird Dog, once used for reconnaissance over Vietnam. There are old fabric-body planes, and more than a few tail-draggers, the tiny propeller planes with the back landing gear mounted as far back as possible, used by many weekend flyers.
It has a 2,700-foot air strip that runs east-west. A dense stand of pine borders the runway to the south, and hardwoods lie to the north. To the west is the Quinebaug River, and, to the east, a housing complex for elderly people.
"We don't get any complaints about the airport as it is now," said Town Council Chairman John E. Burke. "The airport predates most of the housing in that area. People built their homes knowing it was there." The airfield was built in 1963 for the aviation department at Ellis Technical School, said to be the oldest public aviation school in the country. The head of the department, Edward A. Baranski Jr., said interest in the three-year post-high school course has waned in recent years because of publicity about downsizing by the airlines; only half of his 80 student slots are filled. But there is no shortage of jobs for aircraft mechanics.
"The schools can't supply enough," Mr. Baranski said. "Most of my students have several job offers when they graduate. They're in the enviable position of being able to pick and choose."
Mr. Baranski, who flies a Piper Tomahawk out of Danielson, said his department gets about 24 planes a year for repairs, from all over New England and New York, and sometimes farther. "I turn enough work away to keep someone in business full-time," he said.
Does Danielson need some help? Yes, Mr. Boroughf said, pointing to some aerial pictures of the airport. "This is work that we've needed to do for a while," he said, noting the photographic evidence of worsening conditions in the last decade or so, since the fissures first appeared in the asphalt. Today, a walk on the runway reveals a spider web-like collection of cracks.
This will be the first renovation of the runway since the airport was built, and the repairs are likely to last for another 30 years because of light traffic and because it is built on top of an old gravel bank, which means good drainage and less weather-related cracking and heaving, Mr. Borough said.
And Danielson is becoming increasingly important as other small airports -- like one in Fall River, Mass. -- shut down. A few planes came in from Lakeside Airport in Voluntown when the operations there were scaled back this year. And the Woodstock Parachute Center is expected to move to Danielson soon, joining a glider club and a chapter of the Experimental Aircraft Association that are already there. "Now you'll have three groups competing for the same time slots on the weekends," said Donald N. LaPointe of Brooklyn, a pilot who flies a 1961 two-seater Piper Colt out of Danielson, and belongs to the association. "It'll be interesting to see if we can all get along."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
Worthy of a World Capital

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
GOOD NEWS. THE WILDLY imperfect process of creating civic architecture in New York has produced a first-rate piece of design. It's time to rub our eyes. Wake up and see the architecture. Step up to one big question.
Will New Yorkers recognize the chance to make a marriage between a major civic site and a design worthy of its stature? Or will we derail a process that richly deserves our contempt and in doing so kill off an excellent project and set architecture in New York back another 25 years? 
 The project is Murphy/Jahn's design for Tishman Speyer Properties' proposed redevelopment of the Coliseum site on Columbus Circle, one of the most important locations in the world's greatest city, and Helmut Jahn has come up with a plan that is more than worthy of this site. It is on a par with the best architecture in the world today.
Many of us will be strongly tempted to disbelieve this. New Yorkers are more than entitled to be cynical about the schemes our public agencies come up with. And Helmut Jahn is probably not the first name you would think of in connection with a solid work of design. For many New Yorkers, Jahn brings to mind unpleasant images of glitzy skyscrapers from the go-go 80's.
But times and architects change. Don't trust my word for it. Judge for yourself. Nine competing designs for the Coliseum project will be on view through the end of the month in the Coliseum's lobby. A more ambitious show, sponsored by the Municipal Art Society, will open on Tuesday at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue. Debate on the merits of all nine projects will take place on Feb. 19 and 20 at 2 Columbus Circle. These events, also presented by the Municipal Art Society, could prove invaluable to restoring the well-being of architecture in New York. Or they could just reinforce the denial that contemporary architecture in New York is far less creative than this vibrant city deserves.
The issue transcends the respective merits of the designs. It even overarches the dismal political process that produced them. How do you make discriminations in a relativistic universe? How do you distinguish architecture from the kind of architectural impersonations proposed by a majority of the developers for the Coliseum site? How do you persuade public officials that the values of art, while subjective, are no less real than the hard facts of the bottom line?
Probably many New Yorkers don't even want to hear about the Coliseum project. Talk about deja vu all over again. Twelve years ago, an earlier round of proposals subjected the city to an urban psychodrama that dragged on for four years. Esthetically, the choices lay between Moshe Safdie's strident piece of glass origami and David Childs's nostalgic Art Deco reprise.
No building resulted from that contest. First lawsuits, then the collapse of the real estate market, prevented the realization of either project. But the exercise was not fruitless. At least New Yorkers got to see the intellectual bankruptcy of the public agencies responsible for building in the public realm. The redevelopment of this major civic site was conducted as if it were a fire sale. Art counted for nothing. The bottom line ruled.
Public officials even seemed to take it as a point of pride that they were not "imposing" their esthetic judgments -- as if anyone in their right mind were expecting them to do that, as if the only two choices available to civic building were the esthetic dictatorship of politicians or the tyranny of the bottom line. What was expected then, and what is expected now, is that public agencies adopt the mechanism of the design competition, an arrangement accepted as a matter of course by every other major city in the civilized world.
Sadly, New York seems no closer to recognizing the value of this device today than it was 12 years ago. Once again, economic factors alone are likely to determine the outcome of this process. At a news conference on the nine proposals, officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Empire State Development Corporation declined to say what role, if any, designers would play in the selection of the developer, which is expected to take place in the spring.
The M.T.A.'s indifference to architecture was not a surprise. It could have been gleaned from the request for proposals that the agency sent out last July. Apart from a vague reference to the desire for a "world class" plan and a requirement that the new building define a circular street wall, the document offered little guidance to the meaning or cultural value of this site.
Let's write our own.
Columbus Circle is a child of the City Beautiful movement, born just over a century ago. The Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, with its famous White City, set out the movement's guiding ideas: classical, academic, monumental, homogeneous, dedicated to sweeping urban vistas of Beaux-Arts buildings adorned with fountains and heroic statues. The movement produced some noble cityscapes and buildings, like the New York Public Library and Bryant Park, as well as comically unrealized visions like Columbus Circle.
No point trying to exhume the movement's precepts today. They represent an outmoded style of art and an objectionable political philosophy. As Lewis Mumford observed decades ago, the City Beautiful movement was the perfect style for America's imperial phase, of trusts and monopolies, of the exploitation of regions by industrial urban centers. But there's no reason architects couldn't ask themselves to visualize the beauty of the contemporary city.
Indeed, New York's most important buildings of this century have done precisely that. The United Nations headquarters, the Seagram Building, the T.W.A. Terminal at Kennedy Airport: each of these, in different ways, channeled urban energy into built form. More recent projects, outside New York, have also crystallized the beauty of particular cities. Arquitectonica's Atlantis condominium tower in Miami; Jean Nouvel's Cartier Foundation in Paris; Arata Isozaki's Convention Hall for Nara, Japan; Frank Gehry's plan for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles: these projects, too, show that the beauty of cities changes.
Like most of the other plans, Jahn's reuses the existing Coliseum and adjacent office building at 10 Columbus Circle. The tan brick facades are stripped away; the office tower is enlarged with structural additions that transform the floor plan from a rectangle to a trapezoid. This then becomes the base for two triangular towers, each 40 stories high, rising at the east and west ends of the site. The whole composition is then wrapped in a taut glass skin.
This is no plain glass box. Like Nouvel in his design for the Cartier Foundation in Paris, Jahn pushes glass beyond its standard curtain-wall application. On both towers and base, Jahn cantilevers the glass skin beyond the building envelope, so that one sees the glass as pure transparency, as well as the semi-opaque curtain wall.
The design's tripartite division is forthrightly classical. Public areas -- stores, restaurants, exhibition space, a museum -- are housed in the curving base that defines the site's circular street wall. The glass trapezoid contains offices. Twin towers, two precisely placed prisms, will house condominium apartments. Classical, too, and classically modern are the exposure of structure and the deference of its forms to light and void. Who wouldn't make a detour to watch the towers reach up, grab a square of sky and rotate the space gently between them?
The James Stewart Polshek & Partners plan for Millenium Partners is the only other proposal that one could reasonably call architecture. Like Jahn, Polshek defines the street wall with a cinematically grand curving glass screen, though Polshek contains his screen within a metal frame and projects it toward the sidewalk. Two glass towers, soberly expressionist, rise from the curving base. But Polshek's is cautious compared with Jahn's design.
EVALUATING A PROJECT LIKE the Coliseum involves two kinds of truth. One kind is objective; it can be quantified. The M.T.A. has not provided any financial data, such as how much each developer proposes to pay for the site, but the difference between, say, a $250 million bid from one developer and a $300 million bid from another developer is a coolly factual $50 million. The other kind is subjective -- no one can prove that Jahn's and Polshek's designs are superior to the other seven -- but it is a truth nonetheless. Indeed, it's one of the highest truths that art and architecture can lay claim to.
The purpose of a design competition is to honor that claim. The decision of a jury is, of course, the result of opinions. But the jury process is grounded in the belief that informed opinions of art are more likely than uninformed opinions to distinguish good from bad. It may not always work out that way -- look at last year's overbearing winning design to expand the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. But even in a case like that, the design competition still stands for an important principle: subjectivity is a serious matter. It is not the same as chance, whim or public relations. Any architect can hire a publicist to write words like "bold," "visionary," "dramatic," "inventive." The architect may believe them; a public official, unveiling a design at a news conference, may repeat them with something like stirring conviction. Occasionally, they may even be true.
In 1987, New Yorkers justly fought the Coliseum proposal because of the shadows it threatened to cast over Central Park. Will they rally to support this building because it would actually improve the play of light and shadow on the West Side skyline?
A sentence from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Crack-Up" comes to mind: "New York had all the iridescence of the beginning of the world." Fitzgerald was talking about 1920's, and the great giddy skyscrapers that were redefining the Jazz Age skyline. Like no other New York building in the last 25 years, Jahn's design recaptures the romantic promise of Fitzgerald's great lost city. A scaffold, cloaked in light, the project conveys with minimal means the enduring idea of New York as the great world capital of permanent becoming. You could imagine Christopher Columbus making port in this radiant image of the New World.

HEADLINE: Westchester Q&A: Dee DelBello;
Former First Lady Reigns as a Publisher

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
FOR almost a decade, she was the First Lady of Westchester County and she had a brief reign as the Second Lady of New York State -- all the while pursuing her own career. Today Dee DelBello is the publisher of the weekly Westchester and Fairfield Business Journals. Her husband, Alfred, the former Westchester County Executive and New York State Lieutenant Governor, is in private law practice, having lost a bid to the State Senate two years ago.
Mrs. DelBello was recently honored with the annual Samuel J. Duboff Memorial Award, given by the Fund for Modern Courts, for her work from 1976 to 1994 as one of two people who are not lawyers on the 11-member New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct. 
 The commission, based in Manhattan, considers complaints brought against judges.
Gerry Stern, a resident of White Plains, has been its executive director since its formation in 1976. The position on the commission was one of several jobs Mrs. DelBello has held over the last 25 years, during which she had a daily interview show on radio station WFAS-AM (1230) and worked as a regional public relations director at Bloomingdale's.
Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Mrs. DelBello, who lives in Lewisboro:
Q. You are someone who at times has felt the press has wronged your husband or yourself. You crossed to the other side when you bought The Business Journals. What processes took you through that?
A. It was a very easy process in that I understood the other side. And having come from public relations, I understood somewhat the press side, but not nearly enough. I suppose if I knew all that I know now about publishing I might not have at that time bought the newspapers because it's a very tough business. Particularly in 1990 when I bought the papers it was the beginning of the recession and the worst advertising slump.
Q. Do you have more empathy now for what reporters go through?
A. I do have empathy for what reporters go through. I'm very concerned about maintaining the integrity of the newspaper. I understand the other side. I understand what the subject of an article might be going through, but I also understand the need to maintain that integrity, not to be persuaded or dissuaded by any empathy one might feel. So what we try to do, as all good reporters do, is tell both sides of the story until we get to the truth of the story. We tell every aspect as scrupulously as we possibly can, without any influences, whether it be influences from the subject of the article or influences from sales; you know, the dynamics between sales and editorial.
Q. As publisher, do you read everything that goes into the paper, or do you rely on your editors for that?
A. I rely on the editors. I don't get involved, except from a philosophic point of view in what's going into the newspaper. I am concerned about how the papers look, what the stories are about and whether we are maintaining our mission, which is to cover local business news.
Q. Do you miss politics?
A. Yes, I do. I miss it to the extent that there is an involvement in what's happening in the community that only can occur when you're involved politically. You can make things happen. I look around and I see the programs that Al initiated when he was County Executive, and they're still in existence. I also miss the opportunities to meet so many people.
Q. Will Al try to run for public office again?
A. I don't know.
Q. What about you?
A. Oh, goodness, no. I enjoy working behind the scenes.
Q. Did you ever, when Al was running for State Senate two years ago, have any conflicts as the owner of a newspaper?
A. No, we really don't cover political campaigns. We really stick to our niche. We don't endorse.
Q. What made the work on the Commission on Judicial Conduct interesting for you?
A. It gave me a view of the judiciary that I never had before. You are inside the judiciary, understanding what makes it work, what's going on.
Q. Is it true that people who are not lawyers bring an entirely different perspective to such a commission?
A. There is no question about it. I think they bring more objective viewpoints. They have no ties to other lawyers. The lay people look out for all the citizens they encounter when they're involved in the court system.
Q. By the time something got to the commission, past the staff people, had there already been a screening so you heard only serious complaints?
A. The complaints are, of course, looked at by the staff, and they are screened to a certain extent as to which are more serious than others. But the commission essentially looks at every complaint. Even when a staff person may recommend dismissal, if one of the commission members thinks there is some substance to the complaint then the complaint is considered further. There is not one complaint that is acted on in a willy-nilly fashion. Gerry Stern, the executive director, is the most effective public administrator I have ever come across. Any agency that doesn't have some one like Gerry Stern should have some one like him, and he has put together the most loyal and committed staff.
Q. Are most complaints ones in which litigants did not get what they wanted so they blame the judge in some manner?
A. When you're a litigant, sure, if the case does not go in your favor you're going to feel put upon. But you really need to have more of a basis than that to complain against the judge. Remember, the Commission on Judicial Conduct oversees the conduct of a judge on the bench. If a judge drank a lot that wouldn't be an issue unless that affected his conduct on the bench. So, yes, there are some dissatisfied litigants who bring some complaints. But whether the majority of them were that way, no, I wouldn't say that.
Q. What were the types of complaints that had some validity? Drunken judges? Judges who showed partisanship? Corrupt judges?
A. All of those things. Remember judges are human, but they hold almost a sacred role in their jobs. They have to be held to higher standards.
Q. Did you feel the commission was tough enough on judges it found had done something wrong?
A. Yes, generally. We would argue for hours, days sometimes, hold things over, just to make sure that justice was done for both the judges and the court system as a whole and the citizenry of New York as a whole.
Q. In the last 20 years that you served, the selection process for judges has changed. There is screening by panels that did not exist a few decades ago. Did you get a sense that better judges are sitting on the bench?
A. Yes and no. I think we have an imperfect system, and we probably will always have an imperfect system because whether judges are selected by election or by appointment, it is always a selection of one kind or another.
Q. There was a time in some of New York's rural areas when a local judge did not have to be a lawyer. Is that still the case?
A. It's still so for town justices; I don't remember all the numbers right now, but I think about two-thirds of these town judges are not lawyers. But that's really not so important because they are trained. It's important that they know their locale and get the proper training.
Q. Often you hear people say: anyone on the bench can be bought. What's your response?
A. Not true. There are, in every profession, people who are not perfect. There are some terrible doctors, some terrible lawyers, terrible politicians. But by and large, the judges are a good group and with the help of the Commission and the Fund for Modern Courts, they have become better.

Experts Agree: We're Finished

 BODY:
With the year 2000 approaching, it seems that everyone Christians and
secularists alike is theorizing about scary futures, often in prose whose inscrutability rivals the Book of Revelation's. ("As middle-aged 13ers survey the Crisis-era detritus of the Unraveling," argues one such book, "The Fourth Turning," "they will see the opposite of what the midlife Silent saw in the Awakening-era wreckage of the High.") Lest you think we exaggerate, here's a sample side by side, for comparison, with prophecy from an apocalyptic Christian. Read 'em and tremble.
 
1998-2000
*"The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order," Samuel P. Huntington: A Harvard political scientist explains how "the fault lines between civilizations are becoming the central lines of conflict in global politics." The culture to watch as 2000 rolls around: Islam. One in five people on the planet now prays to Allah. Ever restive, the Islamic world starts to think seriously about grabbing a bigger piece of the global pie.
*"The Next War," Caspar Weinberger and Peter Schweizer: "Fictive accounts" of wars that could occur thanks to our supposed military unreadiness. Trouble comes large and loud when China invades Taiwan while North Korea surges across the DMZ. Seoul is sacked, United States troops are hit with biological weapons, and the U.S. exchanges tactical nukes with Korea and China. We accept an unfavorable peace, realizing that we cannot risk an all-out war with another superpower.
*"The Fourth Turning," William Strauss and Neil Howe: Pop futurists examine what the cycles of history tell us about America's next rendezvous with destiny. The authors believe that the "next Crisis era will most likely extend roughly from the middle Oh-Ohs to the middle 2020's." Key to this period are the Millennials, good, selfless hard-working young people (now entering high school) whose destiny is to save the world (if they can) from a baby-boomer-generated economic, spiritual, political and environmental collapse, circa 2005.
*"Beginning of the End: The Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the Coming Antichrist," John Hagee: A look at the Bible's apocalyptic timetable by a fundamentalist Christian. (Hagee resists giving dates, saying only that these events are coming "very soon.") Islam unites with a reborn Soviet Union to invade Israel. Israel nukes her enemies and triggers global war. The Antichrist rises and sets himself up as God. For this he is assassinated, but then he is reborn -- live on CNN.
 
2000-2010
*Huntington: World War III begins when China invades Vietnam to tap its oil. The U.S. engages but is hobbled when Japan declares itself neutral. Chaos results. India attacks Pakistan but is repelled by Iran. An Arab coalition attacks Israel. China squeezes Japan until it joins the war against the U.S. Every major civilization is mobilized.
*Weinberger and Schweizer: A radical mob sacks the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. A drug gang blows up a Houston shopping center. The U.S. invades Mexico to topple its evil "Presidente Ruiz."
*Strauss and Howe: Boomers start collecting Social Security, but the system is bankrupt, and when too many boomers try to unload their greedily hoarded assets, Wall Street lays an egg. "The Fourth Turning" begins as economic collapse and other boomer-related problems cause society to seize up like a rusty engine. Two possible scenarios:
1) A state-led tax revolt ignites secessionist frenzies, Federal occupation, militia violence and a demand for a Constitutional convention. 2) A new, highly contagious killer virus prompts "unsafe neighborhood" quarantines and a three-way war between the National Guard, urban gangs and suburban militias.
*Hagee: Islam is defeated. Israel, governed by the Antichrist, must fight 200 million Chinese at Armageddon. Jesus arrives to defeat the forces of evil.
 
2020-3000
*Huntington: Hispanic men and women grow to become a full quarter of the U.S. population and we become a "cleft country." Civil war and national dissolution are probable.
*Strauss and Howe: The Crisis of 2005 ends circa 2025, very likely with a deadly civil war or larger global conflagration. If we're not all dead, we'll have the Millennials to thank, for it will be their can-do spirit that rebuilds America to a state of post-World War II greatness.
*Hagee: Christ's earthly reign ends after a thousand years. God destroys the present earth and eternity begins, in Heaven. If you want to be a part of it, Hagee writes, repent now. "Like no other generation," he writes, in a conclusion that could apply to all these books, "we are the ones who cannot take for granted tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Patricia McCann-Vissepo;
Educating New Haven, and Its Critics

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THE chairwoman of the New Haven Board of Education, Patricia McCann-Vissepo, is determined to dispel stereotypes about urban schools. In fact, said Ms. McCann, "I would send my own child to any New Haven high school before I would send him" to the suburban West Haven High, East Haven High or Hamden High. And she does. Her eighth-grader attends a New Haven magnet school, West Hills Middle School.
That's because, she said, "I think we have more programs, more specialization, more resources and a much more creative curriculum. I think we have a much higher rate of sensitivity to children, especially children of color than any of those schools." New Haven, with 2,000 employees and 45 buildings, has a student population of 20,000, about 60 percent black, 25 percent Hispanic and 15 percent white. 
 Raised in Puerto Rico -- her full name reflects the Hispanic tradition of linking her father's and mother's last names -- Ms. McCann spoke Spanish as her first language. Aside from her volunteer work on the Board of Education, and as a member of the New Haven Advisory Group on Educational Improvement that advocated region-wide public school choice in the wake of the Sheff v. O'Neill case, she is executive director of Casa Otonal, a human services and housing organization.
Recently Ms. McCann met to discuss some of her concerns about urban education. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. The New Haven Board of Education is the only board in Connecticut to be appointed by the mayor rather than elected. Should that system be changed?
A. Only about 2 percent of the boards in the country are appointed. When I began I really thought it was a mistake, that we should have an elected group. Then several things happened that changed my mind.
One, I went to the National School Board Convention in Los Angeles and all the conversations I heard were "How do you raise money for your campaign?"
Then we removed some employees from the system, which would have been much harder to do if we were an elected body.
Then we voted to put condoms in New Haven middle schools, a very controversial decision.
Being appointed gives us freedom to do what's right. You may see more appointed boards in the future.
Q. The Hartford Board of Education hired Educational Alternatives, a private management firm, to run some of its schools. Will New Haven try this also?
A. I saw through Educational Alternatives Inc. in a hot minute. They took me out to dinner. I could tell those people were selling snake oil. It was so obvious. I asked these people literally seven times -- I counted -- "How do you make money?" The first time the answer was a story about their founder who had a special ed child. Then they told me another lovely story about another child. They just wouldn't answer.
Q. What do you think of moving some children from the city to suburban schools?
A. I am not convinced that suburban schools are better than our schools. They do have higher Connecticut Mastery Test scores but that is tied to socio-economic factors. The greatest indicator in S.A.T. scores is family income. The higher the family income the higher the S.A.T. scores.
We might ask ourselves, why can't we change the district lines: Just put Fair Haven in East Haven, put West Haven out in Woodbridge, the Hill in West Haven. Seems perfectly reasonable to me. Is it politically realistic? Probably not.
Q. Do you think more magnet schools will end racial isolation? How about vouchers?
A. I have advocated for all schools to be magnet schools. Every child is unique. We have a lot of children who for whatever reason we have not been able to engage. The bigger the menu of things we have to offer, the more likely we are to find something that will engage each child. We'll have schools that focus on science, health, the arts. The more you have to offer, the more likely something will click.
Vouchers are a fraud. They are very misleading. For parochial schools to receive vouchers, I think poses a Constitutional problem. Why do parochial schools do better? They pick their children.
Q. Do New Haven teachers and administrators receive excessively high salaries?
A. It's true our teachers are the highest paid teachers in the United States. On the other hand it's a very hard job for which you have to prepare academically for a long time and have to continue to take courses. It's not like you finish your B.A. and that's it.
Given those realities I think they earn a fair wage. A starting teacher gets about $29,000. It goes up to about $60,000, but that's for someone who has a Ph.D., who has worked for 20 years.
Could some of our teachers give more? Absolutely, that's something we have to work on. We also have a responsibility as management to develop teachers.
Elementary school principals make around $68,000, $69,000. It's a decent salary but it's a big job. They are responsible for several hundred children, teachers, custodians, food, para-professionals. If you look at the private sector they pay significantly more than that.
The superintendent of schools supervises 2,000 employees and makes about $120,000. The man who heads United Illumination supervises 1,000 employees and makes $500,000.
Q. Why are resources scarce in the New Haven public schools?
A. It's a bureaucratic problem. People haven't figured out how to get supplies to schools in a timely fashion. We are hiring our own purchasing agent. Given the large volume of our purchases it makes sense.
We have made progress with updating textbooks and maps. We had maps that still showed the Belgian Congo! Have we had as much progress as we should have? No. Our main focus has been to buy literature books and computers. With computers we have a very good ratio of seven to one. Every single kindergarten and first grade has computers.
Q. Are the New Haven schools emphasizing early childhood learning?
 A. We made a strategic decision partially based on the Connecticut Mastery Test results. How can we best amortize our resources for all grades? We obviously have not given up on the older children, the sixth to eighth graders, but what we decided was to take the youngest kids, those entering kindergarten, and give them everything we had -- the computers, a teacher's aide. If by the time these kids take the fourth grade Mastery Test they don't do well then we know we really have a problem.
Q. Would you like the school age requirement moved down from 7 to 5 or 6?
A. Finally people have realized if you don't start early you start late. We have a large number of children who come to kindergarten who don't know their colors, right from left, their numbers. It is so archaic, so 19th century, it boggles the mind.
Q. Is special education a thorny problem for the board?
A. It's a lot of money. There probably are a lot of kids who are labeled without needing to be labeled. On the other hand there are a lot of parents who feel that this is a way for their child to get extra resources. I don't blame them.
We have children who spent their first year in an incubator. We have crack babies coming into to school who can't sit still for 10 seconds.
We don't do as much out-placement as we used to. We try to handle more and more at the home school. Out-placement tuition is outrageous. We had some kids whose placement cost $100,000.
Q. What about the rate of violence, drug abuse and pregnancy among New Haven teen-agers?
A. I saw an ad once that said, "If 40 percent of drug users live in the city where do the other 60 percent live?" Where indeed?
We have had no violent incidents in the last two years. Gangs are not that much of a problem. I am not saying there are no weapons in school. That would be naive. But they are not using them in schools. If weapons are found, the kids are expelled.
Teen pregnancy is down 4 percent. We have a school for teen moms and their children, Polly McCabe School. Two Yale sociologists did a study that showed McCabe students are 80 percent less likely to have a second child. It shows that intervention works.

Something Doesn't Love a Wall

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
THE OVERNIGHT transformation of George Stephanopoulos from partisan pitchman to television journalist highlights a disturbing phenomenon: the progressive collapse of the walls that traditionally separated news from propaganda.
Self-respecting news organizations used to pride themselves on the sturdy barriers they maintained to guard against all kinds of partisan contamination. Inside the office, they built a high wall between those who reported and analyzed events and those who offered opinions about them -- between the newsroom and the editorial page. A second wall separated both the news and editorial departments from the commercial ambitions of the business office. And an especially thick wall was erected around the entire enterprise to keep out the pollution generated by politicians and advertisers. 
 Particularly in television, America's primary source of news, the walls are buckling. Stephanopoulos is hardly the first politician to breach them. But his case shows how no one even bothers any longer to decontaminate a convert (like, say, Bill Moyers) by stretching out his passage from politics to reporting over a cleansing period of time. Nor does anyone feel the need to put distance between an active politician (like Pat Buchanan) and the news team. On the contrary, the commerce of television welcomes celebrity and contentiousness.
When ABC News first announced the hiring of Stephanopoulos, it said he would be both a "political analyst" and a "correspondent," with appearances weekdays on "Good Morning America" and Sundays on "This Week." That gilding of an amateur must have caused a ripple of resentment among reporters who take pride in the title "correspondent." So a second announcement quickly emphasized that the new recruit would not be reporting news or questioning guests, like other correspondents. And that, it was said, would avoid any "appearance of conflict."
Oh, sure. Who could possibly find conflict in an "analysis" of the words, deeds and motives of Bill Clinton and his Administration by one of the architects of his Presidency who just happens to owe his celebrity and new job entirely to that President? How could anyone discern even the appearance of a conflict between Stephanopoulos's four-year career of media manipulation for the White House and whatever he will now say or neglect to say as an ABC commentator?
If our senses are so dulled to journalistic conflicts of interest, it cannot be because of any redeeming features of the Stephanopoulos appointment. It must be because news organizations, and particularly television talk shows, so routinely confuse dispassionate news analysis with the expression of partisan opinion. At most, they compensate for one prejudiced commentator by employing another, which further conditions us to getting heat where there should be light.
As ABC argued in self-justification, why should it not put Stephanopoulos on a Sunday program that has frequently featured William Kristol, a former aide to Vice President Dan Quayle? (Quayle, at least, is a former Vice President and not quite a candidate for President in 2000.) But then why be squeamish about Kristol and Stephanopoulos questioning guests, like real reporters? A professional opinion-monger like George Will routinely does that on the same program and thereby baits reporters, like Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, into expressing their contrary opinions.
The trouble with news programs that lapse into bouts of opinion is that the panelists end up scoring points instead of illuminating events. The ultimate perversion occurs on "The McLaughlin Group," whose members are encouraged to rudely shout out ill-argued conclusions, often three or four at the same time. And some television "news" shows abandon all pretense of nonpartisanship by staging cockfights among unemployed politicians -- pitting John Sununu against Geraldine Ferraro or Mary Matalin against Dee Dee Myers.
The paradox in all this is that the principal network anchors, who used to be scorned for coloring the news with the curl of a lip or the arch of an eyebrow, now stand out as the most impartial and polite voices in television news. Although the experiences and independence of Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Ted Koppel would give their opinions a lot more weight than those of any politician, they still observe the disciplines of their craft. Their on-air analyses plumb the views and prejudices of others without parading their own.
To be sure, none of us in the news business are perfectly disinterested; we are not entirely above commercial motive or always successful in suppressing a personal view. And yes, The Times once felt a need to balance the opinions on its Op-Ed page by hiring Bill Safire direct from President Nixon's staff of speech writers. And so long as Nixon remained in the White House with Watergate bursting all around, our colleague Bill showed himself understandably conflicted in some of the columns he wrote. But they were plainly carried as columns of opinion, strictly segregated from the news reports. In my experience, The Times was insufficiently fastidious only once, two decades ago, when it hired Leslie Gelb, an arms control expert, to write about diplomacy soon after he had practiced it inside the State Department. It even let him shuttle to and from government, making an exception that reinforced our rule against such slackness.
Why is television increasingly lax about the old standards? Obviously, a Stephanopoulos has star qualities. He comes as a ready-made celebrity expert, telegenic, charming, articulate. He brings promise of an immediate lift in the ratings and in profits. The same qualities and promise must explain why, contrary to custom, the highest officials of Columbia University escorted him before the cameras to announce Stephanopoulos's other new job -- as teacher and scholar.
If he is serious about academia and journalism, Stephanopoulos will in time outgrow his youthful ardors and escapades, recover his chastity and qualify as a professional student and observer of public affairs. But if television news is serious about its reputation for disinterested analysis, it had better cement those walls.

HEADLINE: Deregulation: A Seismic Shift, Intensity Unknown

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
NO one knows with any degree of certainty what the impact will be if the New York State Legislature takes steps in the next few months to further deregulate the state's 1.2 million rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. Empirical studies of the economic and social consequences of removing rent regulations have simply not been done, scholars of housing say.
But opponents and proponents of deregulation do agree on one thing: Some people will be jolted and dislocated in a seismic shift. 
 Who would experience that shock, how deeply and for how long are questions subject to a revolving hologram of points of view, most of them focused through prisms of ideology. And yet, one of the most thoughtful supporters of opening all rents to free-market pricing, James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Urban Policy at Rutgers University, likens the possibility -- in intensity, if not magnitude -- to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"It's not a clean, pretty process," Dr. Hughes said. "Clearly, any change that radical is going to produce pain and dislocation. There would certainly be short-term turmoil, with a great number of individuals subject to economic shock treatment."
But, eventually, Dr. Hughes believes, "some new equilibrium is going to be reached."
"Housing is going to be better off because it's going to generate new construction," he said. "Rent-paying capacity will be one of the forces that define rent structures. You're going to have a functioning market. The problem is, eventually can be a very long time."
And as one deregulation opponent, W. Dennis Keating, a professor of urban affairs at Cleveland State University, said, paraphrasing the noted economist John Maynard Keynes, "It's like, 'In the long run it will work, but we'll all be dead.' "
The deregulation gauntlet was thrown down last month by the State Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, when he virtually dared Democrats to either cooperate in eliminating most controls by mid-1999 or, he said, he will simply not permit the Senate to vote on renewal of current rent laws before they expire June 15. "When a law sunsets, it sunsets all by itself," said Mr. Bruno, a Republican from Rensselaer County.
A week later, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican facing re-election next year, called for a more gradual approach, saying, "We have to have an intelligent transition that has an orderly process that protects seniors, the disabled, people on fixed incomes."
Mr. Bruno then softened his stance, saying he would support maintaining rent protection for poor tenants, but that he would still allow the current laws to expire if Democrats do not agree to decontrol any apartments that become vacant and to lower the income threshold for what is called luxury decontrol -- though he would not say to what level. The current level is $250,000 for two consecutive years for tenants in apartments renting for $2,000 or more.
What the Legislature and the Governor ultimately do remains, of course, to be seen. But, perhaps as never before, the debate has raised searching questions about whether or how to dismantle a system that protects about about 2 million people from sharp rent increases, most of them in New York City.
Perhaps surprisingly, scholars of housing have no economic model for how and with what consequences deregulation might evolve. "I don't know anybody who has done empirical studies of removing rent control," said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
In Dr. Hughes's estimation, "There's too much ideology by so many of the players in the discussion, and so there is no quantitative model that's going to settle the argument."
Proponents of letting landlords charge what the market will bear argue that rent regulation is counterproductive, does not help those it is meant to help and disrupts normal market movement by creating incentives for people to stay in place. By limiting rent rolls, they say, regulation reduces tax revenues, constrains municipal services, discourages building maintenance and eventually leads to abandonment of properties.
And, the proponents say, rent regulation is a self-fulfilling prophecy. "It makes the market tight by discouraging investment," said Arthur Zabarkes, dean of New York University's Real Estate Institute. "People stay in much bigger apartments than they need, you have low turnover, low maintenance, no new production and the market becomes very tight. Then, whenever you look at the market, you say we can't deregulate because it's too tight."
What is needed, some supporters of deregulation say, is as painless a transition as possible, one that prompts tenants to move from apartments too large for their needs, that induces landlords to upgrade existing buildings and developers to construct new ones. And, in time, they say, affordable housing will filter down to all segments of the population.
Opponents of deregulation are, to say the least, skeptical of the trickle-down theory.
There will be tremors throughout the city, they say. In today's very tight market, long-time tenants of large apartments in regulated buildings will see their rents rise by multiples or be uprooted. Middle-income people will face "sticker shock," or, if they can, will move to the suburbs or buy a co-op or condominium. Or they will relocate to less expensive neighborhoods, raising rents in those communities and squeezing out poorer residents.
OF the deregulators' contention that a free market will eventually produce affordable housing, Dr. Keating said: "That's quite a stretch. If deregulated markets work the way the supply-siders argue, then why do we have such terrible slums in cities like Houston and Miami? That's where filtering should have worked, by now. They've never had regulation."
The private sector, said Chester Hartman, president of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council in Washington and a former professor of housing policy at Harvard University, has never been very interested in producing apartments for the poor.
"The market seeks to maximize its profit, so there are tens of thousands of families who can't afford what the market will produce," Dr. Hartman said. "And particularly at a time when the Federal government is cutting back on its housing programs, this can only exacerbate the market's inability to provide for the lower end of the income scale.
"I can't imagine that ending rent regulations will do anything but force people out of their homes, or force them to spend larger proportions of their income for housing and neglect other necessities, like food and clothing."
Dr. Hartman wonders what impact deregulation might have on communities. "I think one wants to look not just at individual cases, but what it does to neighborhoods, to stability."
And, though the Wharton School's Dr. Wachter favors deregulation, she voices similar concerns: "Low-wage workers could be priced out. This could have consequences for the availability of blue-collar and service workers for the general economy."
The impact of deregulation on middle-income tenants is not clear, said Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at N.Y.U.'s School of Law.
"The abolition of rent regulation will lead to increases for families currently in regulated housing," said Professor Schill. Eventually, however -- as underutilized apartments become available, construction starts and buildings are rehabilitated -- rents for middle-income tenants would moderate, he said.
Professor Schill concurs with those who say the newly available housing "would probably not be affordable to low- and moderate-income New Yorkers." But not all poor tenants in rent-regulated buildings would be harmed by the end of regulation. "In some predominantly lower-income sections of the city, rent regulations are irrelevant because market rents are actually below what is permitted by the regulations," he said.
"There is little doubt, however," Professor Schill said, "that a substantial number of low- and moderate-income tenants or tenants on fixed incomes would be hurt by a sudden ending of rent regulation."
Dr. Keating sees three ways that the Legislature, if it chooses to deregulate, might go.
"The first and, I think, the worst" is immediate decontrol upon vacancy, he said, because it is "scattershot, hard to keep track of; in the same building, apartment by apartment, one person's rent is tremendously different by the sheer accident of who moved out." And vacancy decontrol spurs some landlords to harass tenants to move, Dr. Keating said.
The second method is to deregulate certain classes of apartments, such as higher-priced units, by certain dates, "so people have notice," he said, and the city "can keep track."
And the third is a step-down process: giving landlords larger increases than they would receive under rent regulations, but delaying total decontrol. "That way everybody knows there's rules and, presumably, there's much less chance of landlords trying to get rid of tenants," Dr. Keating said.
Dr. Wachter and Dean Zabarkes believe, however, that vacancy decontrol is the least disruptive method because it does not affect tenants remaining in place -- as long, Dr. Wachter said, as there are protections against harassment, and as long, Dean Zabarkes said, as it is not implemented during a tight rental market.
"If you agree that we want deregulation, then you have to do it by softening the market at the same time," Dean Zabarkes said, perhaps with a "short window of incentives" for new construction.
Professor Schill wonders whether increased tax revenues from rising property values could help soften the deregulatory blow. "If these gains in revenue are redistributed to lower-income households through rent vouchers or increased production of affordable housing, it could lessen the hardship," he said.
THE chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee, Vito J. Lopez, a Democrat from Brooklyn, believes the deregulation fight will, in the end, focus on proposals to lower the income threshold for luxury decontrol. "I believe the battle will be: do we move it to $200,000 or lower?" Assemblyman Lopez said. If that happens, he said, middle-class tenants will be forced out of Manhattan "and we will economically ghettoize certain communities."
State Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Republican from Manhattan who opposes any form of deregulation, believes the debate will focus on outright vacancy decontrol. "It was a disaster under Rockefeller because of widespread harassment of tenants by landlords," Senator Goodman said. The Senator was referring to a period between 1971 and 1974 when vacancy decontrol was implemented, only to be limited, in Dr. Keating's words, "by, of all people, Nixon, when he instituted national wage and price controls."
Presumably, all those routes to deregulation will be fiercely debated in the coming months. But in the end, as Dr. Hughes said, if any significant change in rent regulation is enacted, "This will be the great housing experiment."

HEADLINE: A Victim of DES Puts Experience Into a Documentary

BYLINE: By BARBARA DELATINER 

 BODY:
JUDITH HELFAND was 14 when she heard about DES, a drug given to five million women from 1938 to 1971 to prevent miscarriages. Ms. Helfand was home from Kennedy High School in Bellmore because of a broken leg when she saw a talk show about DES, the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol, a and its legacy. Of the 2.4 million daughters of the women who took DES, half have malformed reproductive organs or child-bearing problems, and 1 in 1,000 has developed or is expected to develop DES-related cancer.
"I was struck by the idea of these mothers taking a drug to have a baby," Ms. Helfand recalled. "And now these babies can't have babies." 
 It stuck in her mind, and when her mother, Florence, returned home to Merrick from working as a librarian at Roslyn Middle School, the girl told her mother about this "terrible thing."
Ms. Helfand remembers seeing her mother "turn white."
"She couldn't even talk," Ms. Helfand said. "But finally she said, 'Judy, I took that drug and I've known about it since you were 8. I always knew you'd read about it and ask me, and I've been waiting until you were old enough to tell.'
"At that point I knew that my future, my potential, had been challenged. There was a time bomb ticking inside me."
For 18 years DES has played a pre-eminent role in her life. Like so many "DES daughters," she cannot have children. She had a hysterectomy in 1990, when she was given a diagnosis of cervical cancer.
Now Ms. Helfand, a film maker, has created a documentary about her experience, "A Healthy Baby Girl."
The film is one of 15 feature documentaries in competition this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and when the awards are presented on Saturday, her parents will be at her side.
Public television has scheduled the film for the spring.
The 56-minute film chronicles in cinema verite style five years of family life, from the diagnosis of clear-cell adinocarcinoma to the fifth anniversary of the surgery.
There are intimate scenes of Ms. Helfand and her mother and father, Ted, who sells commercial interiors, trying to deal with their grief. At one point Mrs. Helfand tells her daughter that she is depressed because she has no nice clothes or money or a decent place to live, adding, "You don't have what you would like to have."
"On top of that," Ms. Helfand said, "I don't have my reproductive organs."
"Later," she said in an interview, "I realized it was my mother's grasping at things she was able to fix."
For seven years Ms. Helfand went every six months to the DES Screening Center at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park for checkups, with negative results.
"My mom would come with me," Ms. Helfand said, "but never say anything, because I knew she felt so guilty and just couldn't talk about it. So my dad would come, too, making it kind of a family affair."
At 21, when "DES daughters" were thought to be past danger, the Helfands began to relax. "Besides," Ms. Helfand said, "only 1 in 1,000 daughters get cancer, and you never think you'll be the one."
By 1990, Ms. Helfand had credits on her reseume from working on two documentaries on public television, "Through the Wire," a study of women in prison, and "Broken Minds," a look at schizophrenics.
"I had some free time after 'Broken Minds,' and when friends told me about a film on DES that two women were making, I volunteered to do research for them," Ms. Helfand said.
Her colleagues, Darci Picoult and Dina Boogaard, insisted that she have a checkup, which she had avoided because she thought that "at 25 I was over the hump."
"Besides," Ms. Helfand said, "I didn't have health insurance and couldn't afford to see a doctor privately."
Coincidentally her application for group insurance through a professional organization was approved, and she went for an examination. "They found a DES tumor," Ms. Helfand said, "and after more tests and second opinions, surgery was ordered."
The film makers decided to make their movie about Ms. Helfand. "I even considered having them at the house in Merrick when I told my parents," she said. "Luckily my therapist talked me out of it, asking me if I was out of my mind."
She asked her brother Alex, of New Rochelle, a software engineer, to accompany her. Another brother, David, is a special-education teacher in Eugene, Ore.
"When I told them," Ms. Helfand recounted, "my mother ran into the bathroom to cry. My father went into the kitchen, because at a time like that we needed food. I was terrified for my mother, afraid that this would kill her, since she was suffering from Graves' disease," a goiter.
The next hurdle was deciding where Ms. Helfand would recuperate after the surgery. "I wanted to stay in Manhattan with my friends," she said. "I was afraid to go home to heal in the room I had grown up in. Neutered and fixed, coming back to my mother as a baby again.
"But my mother put her foot down, saying, 'I need to take care of you,' and she was right. The six weeks I spent at home marked the beginning of us truly dealing with a DES-exposed life. Why did my parents agree to the documentary? I guess they were so overwhelmed that they had no room to say no. For me the film was a means of escape."
But frustrated because the film makers refused to spend the time that Ms. Helfand thought was necessary , she withdrew. That film, "The Children of DES," was shown on "The Health Quarterly," without her participation.
Ms. Helfand decided to go it alone. Using a cousin's camera, she began keeping a video diary that over five years evolved into "A Healthy Baby Girl."
"Granted I was a little obsessive," Ms. Helfand said. "But the only thing left was this experience, not my reproductive organs. Besides, as a documentary maker I knew that by showing in detail the impact that this experience had on a family, I could tell a story that was personal, but very universal, very public."
Ms. Helfand also wanted to give viewers a message about corporate greed and responsibility and accountability.
"It's not just about DES exposure," she said. "It's a concrete example of all toxic exposure. My cancer and other problems caused by toxic chemicals or improperly tested drugs are a much bigger issue affecting everyone. And grounded in one house, my house, it's told through relationships everybody can relate to."
Major financing was from the Independent Television Service, an arm of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Other grants were from groups like the State Council for the Arts and the Fund for Jewish Documentary Filmmaking-National Foundation for Jewish Culture.
The support from the fund, which Steven Spielberg finances, was especially appropriate, Ms. Helfand said, because the film is a "very Jewish story." Not only because it had a Yiddish scholar as a co-writer, Irena Klepfisz, and has a score by the Klezmatics, but also, she said, because "of the 150,000 women served by the Long Island Jewish Medical Center's DES Screening Center, half are Jewish."
"And while statistics aren't available elsewhere," Ms. Helfand added, "I'd guess that the same holds true in other affluent urban and suburban areas.
"Continuity, or the lack of it, has always played a major role in Jewish life. Just look at the Matriarchs, all of whom were barren, but by hook or by crook managed to bear children. We're always concerned about how we can make it into the future and into the next generation."
To emphasize that connection, Ms. Helfand has been screening the film at synagogues. It will be shown at e the North Country Reform Temple in Glen Cove on Feb. 9.
The screenings are accompanied by discussions led by Rabbi Dianne Cohler-Esses, director of the New York Kollel Feminist Education Project.
When "A Healthy Baby Girl" is shown on television, Ms. Helfand said she hoped similar sessions would cross sectarian, social and economic boundaries.
"I want all people to make that connection between their health, the environment and corporate greed," she said, "so that the DES story won't be replicated over and over again."

Point of View, which is published in Wyandanch, contains articles, columns, reviews and essays that deal specifically with black issues and that address major regional and national issues from that perspective. Mr. Stewart, who has also served as the Long Island campaign coordinator for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, lives in Wyandanch. 
 Q. Why did you start Point of View?
A. Over the years I had been talking to people about the way black communities on Long Island were being portrayed by the media, and we didn't feel that portrayal was accurate nor was there adequate information being shared about black communities. There appeared to be a pattern of misrepresentation. It didn't seem like the mainstream was going to change its views and practices. It was necessary to have another point of view. Thus the publication and its name.
Q. What did you bring to being a newspaper publisher, and why did you take on the responsibility of presenting that other view?
A. I did not have any direct publishing experience. My background includes working in the school system in the late 1970's, being actively involved in several community efforts. By occupation I was an insurance broker.
I had no intention of starting a newspaper. My role, as I saw it, was to prod black people in the media to do it. Though it was discussed, nothing happened. Then I figured if I started a publication, I would embarrass others to jump in and get involved. Well, I was wrong because I began Point of View and no one jumped in. So I kept doing it myself.
Once I was doing it, I learned a lot and became more comfortable. It's been a lot of work. I do or oversee everything and the kitchen sink too, though now there are more people giving of their time and effort. I sold my insurance business to make a full-time commitment. I feel this publication is not only necessary but important because as H. L. Mencken said, "Every civilized people had their own newspaper."
Q. Do you feel that African-Americans on Long Island are treated unfairly by the media or that they are omitted from coverage?
A. It's some of both. The unfair treatment is a result of social conditions. Many people don't see things as being unfair but more like "that's the way things are." For example, there is an unfair rate of taxation in black communities but many good, upstanding, church-going folks will not want to see this or think there is nothing wrong with it, that's just the system and they'll enjoy the advantages of it.
There are unfair portrayals. Recently I picked up a copy of a major Sunday newspaper and counted stories and photos of 27 black people in it. One was a reporter, another was a sports figure and a third was a child. The other 24 were criminals of various kinds. White people in the paper were portrayed as strivers or victims. Day after day of this inevitably leads readers to form conscious and unconscious judgments about African-Americans.
Q. Why are there so few African-American decision-makers in the media?
A. I often read and am confronted with at media-related conferences that the journalism industry takes heart from what they consider incredible improvement in minority hiring. Sure, if you add one black to the black who's already there, you've improved by 100 percent.
In my experience over the last few years, the racial composition of newsrooms bears no relation to the population they serve. That composition has a considerable impact on the tone, quality and balance of reporting.
But on our end, among black people and leaders, we have been slack too. We need to better prepare people, provide them with educational, occupational and other outlets for growth prior to having them enter the newsroom. We need more black community newspapers that can serve as training grounds along with spreading accurate information about black communities. By itself, I don't think the white-dominated major media will instigate significant changes.
Q. On Long Island there appear to be few mixed-race communities. Why are many communities separated by color?
A. Long Island as a whole is one of the most racially segregated communities I know of anywhere. A big reason is very deep-rooted steering practices in real estate. Blacks are simply turned away from open-market housing options. When blacks do make the attempt to integrate communities or blocks, often they are made very uncomfortable, ranging from painful social interaction to criminal activity against them.
I don't like it, but I understand why this happens. A large percentage of Long Islanders have moved out here from the city, especially the Bronx and Brooklyn, to escape the encroachment of minorities, particularly during the so-called "white flight" of the 1960's and 70's. This escape from the developing mix of different colors and cultures was an attempt to set up communities on Long Island that they hoped would be impervious to encroachment. But by being closed, negative and fearful, they are repeating the same mistakes as in the city. You can't run away from a problem; there just isn't that much room left.
Q. Are there ways that blacks are discriminated against illegally that go unnoticed or unreported?
A. The major acts of discrimination are noticed and reported, though they go uncorrected. But what is potentially damaging long-term are the ways of discrimination that are not officially illegal but essentially serve the same purpose. One example is the withholding of services a town is supposed to provide. Point of View did a comparison of the man-hours spent providing taxpayer-supported services in Wyandanch to those provided in surrounding communities, and Wyandanch came up way short. So we're victimized twice, by receiving fewer services and paying more for them, or three times if you consider that black taxpayers help underwrite the services given to white communities. This is institutional discrimination that we know exists but we're unable to correct it, and it is so embedded in the system that it's not news.
One effort to correct the inequality is through Federal block grants. Much of that money ends up going to communities that have already benefitted unfairly. The reason is political leaders try to curry favor with the majority of their constituents. So acts don't have to be illegal to be harmful, and often they are so subtle that they go unnoticed and unreported.
Q. Isn't the court system an opportunity to resolve inequities, and isn't it an option when other measures fail?
A. Yes and no. Yes, in that many laws promoting fairness are on the books. No, in that they aren't applied fairly enough.
In my role as a journalist, I've spent a lot of time in courtrooms. I've seen that when you have two youths, one black and one white, and both have been charged with first offenses, they are treated completely different by the D.A. In one case I saw the white defendant was released on his own recognizance while the black defendant was given $25,000 bail. This difference can have lifelong consequences. However, unless such defendants are in the same court at the same time, the disparate treatment is not so obvious. It goes on all the time, and the far-reaching effects are subtle.
Look at the composition of the court system. The only black judge in Suffolk County was Marquette Floyd, and he was recently appointed to the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court. Now there are none. That has to have an impact on the judicial environment.
Q. Does the political system offer more opportunity?
A. There are no black officeholders that I'm aware of, except for Town Clerk Joan Johnson in Islip, in Suffolk County. A major problem is the structure of county and town elections, where people run at large. No matter how much blacks target their votes, it is very difficult to overcome the majority.
Nassau County is, promisingly, a different story. The switch from a Board of Supervisors to legislative districts -- and I suppose we can thank the court system for this -- has worked to the advantage of black people, with predominantly black districts electing black legislators. Suffolk County, though, has been racially reticent about joining the 20th century.
Q. What would you like to see happen that would enhance racial cooperation that would ultimately benefit Long Island?
A. There has to be a coalition of political and economic power that can be shared or wielded to achieve equality among the races. This won't happen by itself, no matter how much you dream. Black communities have to look to incorporation to have political clout, and from that we will have increased participation in the decision-making processes and the practices at all levels of government on Long Island.
There also has to be an increase in the amount of business development within black communities. We must make ourselves stronger in ways that will be influential and attractive to the overall business community and by extension socially and politically. Many studies and examples have shown that an increase in economic and political power have resulted in a decrease in racial discrimination.
The Village of Hempstead offers such an example. Some years back, as a reaction to the increasing black population and political participation, many white-owned businesses left and for a time the central business area resembled a ghost town. But recently, with black leaders in place, there has been a rebuilding of the economic base and the people involved are doing a terrific job. As a result, some white business owners are coming back and others are starting up in Hempstead. In this climate, there appears to be increasing cooperation between the races for mutual benefit.
The bottom line is developing and promoting an atmosphere devoid of fear, mistrust and disrespect. We all want to make Long Island a better place to live.

HEADLINE: Homeowner Faults Utility Over Cutting Down Trees

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

DATELINE: LEWISBORO

 BODY:
WHEN Jacqueline F. Oliva built her house here 27 years ago, she chose a heavily wooded plot for its privacy and tranquillity. The house, designed to nestle into the landscape, was set back nearly 200 feet from the road, and Ms. Oliva ruled out a lawn in order to let the forest grow free.
Nearly three decades of privacy were wiped out in one day, however, when New York State Electric and Gas recently cut a wide swath through mature trees and saplings on Ms. Oliva's property. Now passing motorists can see her at work in her kitchen, and her own view of webbed branches has been replaced by two exposed utility poles. 
 The power company, which had an easement on the property, says it was only doing what was necessary to keep the lights on in Ms. Oliva's neighborhood. Ms. Oliva, on the other hand, says the company butchered her land. She is especially outraged because she says the electric company went back on several agreements it had made with her about its wire-clearing plans.
Ms. Oliva says her experience is a cautionary tale for homeowners, because she took pains to avoid excessive cutting. At the least, the dispute highlights the potential clash that can occur wherever there are overhead wires, between the public's demand for safe, reliable power and its love of high-arching, sheltering trees.
Ms. Oliva, a criminal lawyer, said her anguish began when she arrived home from her office one recent night.
"The car's headlights picked up what looked to me like another driveway," she said. "My stomach sank; my heart pounded, and I screamed. They had cut 86 feet in from the road. It took me three days before I could walk that land. I couldn't look out my kitchen window."
Ms. Oliva, knowing that the electric company had an easement covering 10 feet to either side of the wires leading to the two utility poles on her property, said she had carefully arranged with the company to be home when tree trimming took place. She met with a representative of Tree Preservation Company, the contractor hired to do the job, and agreed in advance to the removal of "four or five trees." Later, she met with an electric company forester to discuss a mature ash whose health was in dispute.
Soon afterward, the electric company left a message on Ms. Oliva's office answering machine saying that the trimming would take place before the scheduled date. What she did not know, Ms. Oliva said, was that the trimming was taking place that very day.
"Had she said, 'We're cutting today,' I would have borrowed a car and run home," Ms. Oliva said, as trees outside her living room window swayed in the stark winter light. "I would never have stood by and let them do what they did."
In all, she said, 61 trees, including the ash and many saplings, were removed from an area 86 feet long and 20 feet wide. "I think they went beyond the easement because the easement says they have the right to cut 'to the extent necessary.' Rather than topping the trees, they cut them to the ground, and that was beyond the extent necessary. Besides that, I measured, and I think two trees might be outside the easement."
She continued: "I would have preferred to have just trunks standing. I would have been dismayed, but there wouldn't have been the devastation there is now."
William P. Morrison, operations manager for the electric company, upheld the company's right to cut trees on Ms. Oliva's property, but said he would not comment on her complaints because of a possible lawsuit. (Ms. Oliva said she is negotiating with the company to restore plantings and has no immediate plans to sue.) Mr. Morrison said the company had cleared branches and trees along 154 miles during the fall, and that out of 2,400 property owners, only Ms. Oliva had been dissatisfied.
"In many cases, our representatives have been greeted with open arms because of all the outages," he said, referring to the aftermath of recent storms. Mr. Morrison added that the company removes trees "that are going to grow up into the lines," especially along the "least reliable circuits." Since trimming is only done every four or five years, he said, significant cuts must be made in order to allow tree branches to bend under the weight of snowfall.
"You have to weigh economics in there somewhere," he said. "You can't clip six inches or a foot and come back every six months."
Trimming is also done to comply with laws relating to the safety of workers, he said. Workers in trees close to power lines must be protected from electric shock.
In order to work cooperatively with the public, Mr. Morrison said, New York State Electric and Gas, which operates largely in northern Westchester County and farther north, hires real estate agents to go door to door notifying residents of the planned cutting. Foresters become involved if there are disagreements, but usually the electric company prevails, he said. "If a person says the company has no right of way, one of our real estate people goes to our files and digs out a copy of the actual easement," he said. "That usually resolves the final problem."
He said he himself reviews any further disputes, implying that he has little patience with a heels-dug-in attitude. "If you've cut across 999 property owners and made that circuit safe, what do you do about that last customer?" he asked. "Exercise your rights of way or just ignore it?"
Consolidated Edison follows a similar notification procedure in southern Westchester, William Lent, a spokesman, said. But he added that the company, which operates with only a 6- to 8-foot easement on either side of its wires, was "not as aggressive as other utilities are" in tree clearing. "We're trying to be less visual in what we do," he said. "We don't want to cut those big holes in the middle of the trees so our wires can get through."
In the quest for a balance between natural beauty on the one hand and safety and efficiency on the other, many regard buried power lines as an obvious solution. But Mr. Morrison said underground wires -- besides being expensive -- can be even more trouble than overhead ones. "In order to put underground cables into a three-inch-deep ditch off the road, you'd have to cut trees to get the cable installed," he said. "You'd have to keep it free of trees to keep roots from growing into the cable."
As a result, he said, "You'd have to keep clearing trees even more than with overhead wires."

HEADLINE: The Power Women Share as Lobbyists

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE president of a prominent taxpayers' group has discounted them as "self-annointed do-gooders" who squander public money. And the chairman of the county chapter of the Christian Coalition recently claimed their "so-called people's agenda" was a front for Planned Parenthood. But judging by the handprint that the Westchester Women's Agenda left on the county's latest budget, the impact of their political influence is difficult to deny -- their critics' sentiments notwithstanding.
During a budget process that was as contentious as any in recent memory -- in-fights over privatization and taxes and the proper role of government -- elected officials said it was clear that the newly formed feminist group had become a lobbying force to be reckoned with. 
 And while their roots are in a gentle tradition of volunteerism and ministering to the needy, their strength now lies in the fact that 53 percent of registered voters in the county -- as in the rest of the country -- are women.
"The numbers tell the story: it's happening everywhere," said Camille Murphy, director of the Westchester Office for Women and an ex officio member of the Women's Agenda.
"Finally," she said, "feminists are using their vote and their voice to influence government."
Ms. Murphy, who is also the president of the National Association of Commissions for Women, which represents 270 offices for women in the United States, said that as governments at all levels seek to downsize and as women and children's issues are increasingly at risk, feminist lobbying groups are intensifying efforts to protect their interests.
Leaving earlier endeavors behind, some feminists with political agendas -- in Westchester, as in other parts of the United States -- have parted ways with organizations like the League of Women Voters, where many cut their teeth on public policy issues.
Claiming that the League and similar groups lack real clout because they do not endorse candidates, the Westchester Women's Agenda formed a political action committee and endorsed its first slate of state legislative candidates sympathetic to their issues last fall.
In its two-year history, the Women's Agenda has taken on the business of child care, women's health, domestic violence and affirmative action. Untroubled by criticisms that they are little more than domestic do-gooders -- "It's better than being called do-badders," said Amy Paulin, a founding member -- they tick off a list of legislative accomplishments so far:
During the 1995 county budget negotiations, they lobbied successfully to establish a supervised visitation program in Westchester for children and custodial parents who are at risk of physical, sexual or other kinds of abuse from the non-custodial parent. That allotment -- $160,000 -- has been continued in subsequent budgets.
In 1996 they won $200,000 in state and county money to provide services for victims of domestic violence. And they advocated for the creation of a countywide domestic violence council, which was formed. For 1997, they persuaded the Board of Legislators and County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke to allocate about $150,000 to establish a supervision program for abusive spouses or companions through the county's criminal courts program.
Also, they are in part responsible for obtaining $1.7 million for three county neighborhood health centers. And they lobbied for $4.2 million in county day-care subsidies for children of working poor families.
County Legislator George S. Latimer, a Democrat from city of Rye and the minority leader on the 17-member Board of Legislators, described the impact of the Women's Agenda on the budget process in recent years as profound.
But critics see them otherwise and question whether public money should be spent on their agenda. "Not only do they not represent all women, they don't represent all taxpayers," said Kelly Jones, president of the Taxpayers' Alliance of New York, a 500-member anti-tax advocacy group. "If they are so concerned about families, where do they stand in terms of easing the tax burden?"
Mr. Jones, who in another role is Deputy Commissioner for the state's Department of Economic Development, also challenged the feminist group's concern for the needy, saying that "moral sentiment is not a substitute for political passion."
Another critic, Wendy L. Holibaugh, chairwoman of the Westchester Christian Coalition, wrote in a letter to the editor of Gannett Suburban Newspapers, that "promulgation of such issues as abortion and family planning is nothing but a front for Planned Parenthood, an organization that receives big tax dollars to undermine parental authority and push sales of abortion and birth control services onto young people without parental knowledge or consent."
Last week, Mrs. Holibaugh said: "Certainly the group doesn't represent conservative women in the county. They're trying to push through a liberal Democratic agenda as though it is everyone's agenda, and that just isn't so."
Mrs. Holibaugh, a single mother of three children, opposes money in the budget for day care and advocates instead tax breaks for families "so that mothers can stay home."
The Christian Coalition, a national organization with state and local chapters, represents an alliance of "evangelicals, Catholics and other people of faith that seek to enact public policy friendly to the family," according to its literature.
Mrs. Holibaugh said the aim of the coalition is "to get churchgoers out of the pews and into the party process."
Countering the opposition, Polly Rothstein, a steering committee member and president of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion, a 25-year-old advocacy group, denied that the Women's Agenda was a front for Planned Parenthood but said the group was clearly concerned with women's reproductive health issues.
"Our bottom line is abortion rights, and no candidate will get endorsed who is not pro-choice," she said. "However, if someone is only pro-choice and terrible on everything else, they won't get an endorsement either."
Citing the positive side of the opposition, she observed that Mr. Jones and Mrs. Holibaugh's criticisms were "a clear indication that our message is getting through."
Also in response to the opposition, Charlotte A. Watson, a member of the Women's Agenda steering committee and executive director of My Sisters' Place, a domestic violence service and shelter, said that the group did indeed represent the views of most women -- and men as well.
She suggested that the intensity of the group's efforts was in part responsible for some of the opposition.
"Some of us have been willing to risk everything for this, and, yes, we're coming on very strong," she said. "But we're not going to back down." County officials, however, said they were not put off by the group's political power brokering -- or its decision to endorse candidates.
"We take them very seriously," County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said. "They're where the issues are."
With the county's $956.6 million budget representing less than a 1 percent increase over last year, Mr. O'Rourke observed that taxpayers' groups should have little to complain about.
County Legislator Paul J. Noto, a Republican from Mamaroneck and majority leader of the Board of Legislators, said he was not troubled by the group's apparently liberal agenda.
"And I don't see their point of view as either Republican or Democratic," he said. "Their issues are legitimate and cut across party and socioeconomic lines."
Mr. Noto added: "For that matter, I don't see the issues as necessarily liberal or conservative. If they're working to strengthen collection of child-support payments, then that's actually a conservative issue, because it saves taxpayers money and gets people off the welfare rolls. Actually, it's a good Republican issue, too."
A question facing the Women's Agenda is whether the organization will be able to maintain its momemtum. As Stephen P. Tenore, previous chairman of the Board of Legislators and a former political mentor to some members of the organization, said: "The real test of any group, and this one is no exception, is their staying power. I saw many well-meaning groups come and go in the last few years of my political career, and right now, it's too soon to tell about this one."

HEADLINE: Trying to Keep Alive Nobel Laureate's Ideas

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH FOLBERTH 

DATELINE: BRONXVILLE

 BODY:
THE last time C. Lowell Harriss, professor emeritus of economics at Columbia University, saw William Vickrey, his friend and colleague of 61 years, he said Professor Vickrey was "just the epitome of happiness."
"He was obviously on top of the world," he added. 
 The occasion was a champagne reception at Columbia on the day Professor Vickrey learned that he had won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science. Finally, the gentle visionary, who had been proposing practical economic solutions to everyday problems like traffic jams and crowded subways since the 1950's, seemed to have found his bully pulpit and. Professor Vickrey said, after learning of the prize, the "chance to spread some economic sense into the nonsense world."
On Oct. 10, three days after the public began to pay attention to the work of a lifetime, Professor Vickrey, 82, suffered a heart attack and was found dead at the wheel of his car on the Hutchinson River Parkway, not many miles from his home in Hastings-on-Hudson. Two months later, Professor Harriss accepted the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in Stockholm on behalf of his friend. He returned determined to be a missionary, to make sure that Professor Vickrey's ideas and ideals continue to get a valid hearing.
The two men met when both began graduate study in economics at Columbia in 1935. They worked together at the United States Treasury during World War II and were colleagues on the faculty at Columbia University for almost 50 years. Their wives were good friends.
Yet even Professor Harriss did not appreciate the full measure of his friend's brilliance until Professor Vickrey was given the Nobel award. In Stockholm, Professor Harriss said he was stunned by the extensive international admiration for Professor Vickrey's work.
"What is the saying?" Professor Harriss said with a chuckle, in a recent interview at his home here. " 'A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house,' something like that. People in Westchester, around here, didn't know the qualities of this neighbor they had.
"I have known almost all of the persons who have gotten the Nobel Prize in economics since it was instituted in 1969," added Professor Harriss, who was inspired to reread Professor Vickrey's book, "Public Economics," "and there's none, absolutely none, who has the range of content or subject matter that my friend had. Just one subject after another in which he did innovative work.
"He was a Quaker," he said. "I don't know what he believed theologically but in terms of human conduct, he was the epitome of what could be fine in human character and behavior. He believed that economic knowledge could help human beings get more out of life."
Professor Harriss, 84, sat on a loveseat, surrounded by gilt-engraved invitations, elaborate menus, books, posters and other memorabilia from his weeklong stay in Stockholm.
Shaking his head in awe, he recounted the pomp and circumstance of the constant round of gala events, including a luncheon at the American Embassy and being feted by the King and Queen of Sweden at the palace, spectacular occasions "like you read in storybooks or see in the movies."
Professor Harriss's was a special case. Only once before in the 100-year history of the awards had a recipient died before he could receive a prize, said Kristina Fallenius of the Nobel Foundation. That was in 1931 when the Swedish author Erik Axel Karlfeldt died before he could receive his Nobel Prize in Literature. Mr. Karlfeldt'swidow attended the ceremony in the Concert Hall but was seated in the audience. Professor Harriss was seated on the dais and accorded the same dignity and attention as the other Nobel laureates.
There was only one subtle difference dictated by the Nobel Foundation for Professor Harriss's appearance. After accepting Professor Vickrey's award, Professor Harriss bowed only to KingCarl XVI Gustav while the other laureates bowed to the King, then to the chairman of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, then to the audience.
Cecile Vickrey, Professor Vickrey's wife of 45 years and his sole survivor, was unable to travel to Stockholm, hampered by both ill health and grief. But the Harriss family was represented by three generations: Professor Harriss's grandson, Christopher, 20, a sophomore at Columbia University, and Professor Harriss's son, Brian, 47, of Greenwich. Professor Harriss said of the experience, "These people are at the pinnacle of their careers, leaders in the world, and having the opportunity to associate with them is a privilege that only very few people in the whole civilization will ever have."
Professor Harriss said that many of the laureates he met were shy, unassuming scholars who like Professor Vickrey had waited years for recognition of their work. One reason for his friend's relative obscurity was that the ideas he was proposing, in the 1940's through 60's -- like congestion pricing for subway and bus fares or averaging income for tax purposes over a lifetime -- were so innovative that the technology did not yet exist to make them feasible. Technology is just now catching up with his vision.
Professor Harriss is not alone in trying to keep Professor Vickrey's ideas alive. Professor Vickrey's last paper, "Fifteen Fatal Fallacies of Financial Fundamentalism," is posted on Columbia's economics department's Web site, http://www.columbia.edu/cu/economics. On April 28, a conference at Columbia University , involving the tristate Regional Planning Association, will focus on Professor Vickrey's transportation proposals.
"Vickrey was deprived of the bully pulpit," said Dan O'Flaherty, associate professor of economics and public affairs at Columbia University and an organizer of the conference, "so we're trying to let the world hear some of the things that would have been said from the bully pulpit."
Before his trip to Stockholm Professor Harriss tried out his missionary role by speaking to the international relations group of the League of Women Voters of Bronxville.
"His talk kept the audience spellbound," said Elsie Hall, chairwoman of the committee. "His presentation of Vickrey's economics opened up a new world for us. Not much abstract theory, but a definite conviction that with Vickrey's ideas everybody could be better off. Lowell put his listeners in everyday situations of frustration: behind the wheel of their cars, sitting in a traffic jam.
"Vickrey's solution was to put stickers on cars and cameras in much trafficked areas that would note time of day and subsequently bill car owners. Many drivers would thus choose to avoid rush-hour traffic," she continued. "That solution was ridiculed as cumbersome and indisputably unworkable when Vickrey proposed it. Note today's E-Z Pass at toll booths. All through Lowell's talk we were astonished by how adventuresome and exciting economics could be."
Ms. Hall said the League of Women Voters of Bronxville has asked Professor Harriss to speak again on Feb. 6 at 7:30 P.M. at the Reformed Church in Bronxville. The meeting is free and open to the public.

HEADLINE: MUGGED BY REALITY

 BODY:
"Why so much anger" about the welfare system? Not, as Jason DeParle's article "Mugged by Reality" (Dec. 8) suggests, because David T. Ellwood's ideas have been hijacked and brutalized by the conservatives but because the ideas remain locked within the flawed logic of welfare. Cash entitlements -- the basis of the welfare system -- are simply inconsistent with the principle of work.
The only way to "end welfare as we know it" is to end the welfare system. Not abruptly, all at once, but gradually, over a period of a generation. 
 As individuals reach the age of, say, 18, they should have the right to register not for welfare but for work -- a system with three basic elements: job counseling and training; job placement and government as the employer of last resort. The guarantee of a stipend would be replaced by the guarantee of work.
Because it would change a whole generation's view of work and of government's responsibility for the individual citizen, it would rehabilitate an entire lost segment of society, with inevitable benefit to the economy.

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Wall Street Meets Main Street, Not Far From Chicago

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
THE 87,000 residents of Elgin, Ill., are about to get a 10-month, $2 million course in personal finance, compliments of Money magazine, with some help from Fidelity Investments, the Nasdaq stock market and Microsoft.
The project -- whose goal is to raise the "financial I.Q." of Elgin residents -- is part of the magazine's run-up to its 25th anniversary issue in October. The events will begin on Jan. 29 with an introductory session for the entire town that will feature former President George Bush. Highlights in coming months will include: 
 * Free seminars with Money editors and reporters.
* Workshops to teach adults and children about specific money matters like investing, saving, retirement planning and reducing taxes.
* Consultations between Elgin residents and certified financial planners.
* A free one-year subscription to Money for each household in the town.
The magazine will conduct a poll at the beginning and the end of the project to document its progress. And each month, beginning with the current February issue, articles will track the progress of individual families toward their financial goals.
Money says it chose Elgin, 38 miles northwest of Chicago, because it is a "virtual mirror of America," with a diverse population and incomes and property values that are near national averages.
Frank Lalli, Money's managing editor, has written that the project was selected over a traditional fancy party for advertisers as a way to celebrate the magazine's 25 years.
Sounds like a win-win proposition for all concerned. The folks in Elgin may well gain from the financial advice, and some of those free subscriptions are bound to turn into paying ones for Money. The other companies, which are picking up some of the expenses, will also pick up a lot of good will. Fidelity might attract some customers, and the Nasdaq some investors. And tracking investments would be a lot easier on new computer software. Right, Bill Gates?
 
BACK TO THE LAND In their February issues, four personal finance magazines take a look at real estate investments. Kiplinger's and Individual Investor like real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, while Money advocates buying rental property directly.
Worth takes a different approach. In a cover report, the magazine examines the pros and cons of owning land -- acres and acres of it, that is. It suggests ways to make the investment work, including farming, timber operations and hunting leases.
Worth also compares returns on land with those of stocks and gold. During the last nine years, timberland has produced an annualized return of 21.87 percent; farmland, 6.26 percent, and other property, 3.74 percent. During the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has returned 14.8 percent annually. And gold? Since 1985, it has produced a miserly 1.7 percent a year.
 
A MATTER OF INTEREST Money's Michael Sivy, in a forecast for the year, argues that rising credit-card debt could lead to a stock market drop of 15 percent or more. Consumer debt stands at $1.2 trillion, up 52 percent over the last three years, and a typical adult has nine credit cards and a total balance of almost $4,000. Mr. Sivy contends that these factors will undercut the economy and hold down corporate growth, leading to a setback for stocks this year. But he also expects that they will soon come "roaring back."
In another article, Money throws one of its occasional punches at credit-card issuers ("plastic peddlers," the magazine calls them) for what it says are excessively high interest rates and other charges. The magazine conducted a survey in which readers overwhelmingly endorsed proposed legislation aimed at curbing some practices, like assessing huge penalties on card holders who miss a single payment, or charging fees to people who pay their balances in full each month.
Smart Money and Kiplinger's also weigh in on the subject. In Smart Money, Nelson D. Schwartz and Scott Medintz provide a useful guide to the best and worst credit-card deals, and offer some strategies for getting the most out of a card. Kiplinger's points out some favorable deals for credit-worthy customers.
 
PICKING MUTUAL FUNDS Money and Smart Money have splashy cover articles on their favorite mutual funds for 1997 -- and the two lists share not a single fund. Money's 11 "winners you can count on," in various categories, are: Brandywine, T. Rowe Price Equity-Income, Managers Special Equity, EuroPacific Growth, Ivy International A, Merrill Lynch Developing Capital Markets B, Vanguard Bond Index Fund -- Total Bond Market, Merrill Lynch Corporate High Income B, Loomis Sayles Bond, Vanguard Municipal Intermediate Term and Dodge & Cox Balanced.
Smart Money's seven "best mutual funds for 1997" are Legg Mason Value Trust, Third Avenue Value, Janus Worldwide, Longleaf Partners Small-Cap, T. Rowe Price Growth Stock, Mairs & Power Growth and Scudder Growth and Income.
 
FLYING HIGH Individual Investor looks beyond the proposed merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas and sees a potential boom for three suppliers to the new, combined aircraft maker: BE Aerospace, Fairchild and Ducommun. BE, based in Wellington, Fla., makes aircraft interior fittings. Fairchild, whose headquarters are at Dulles International Airport near Washington, supplies an average of $900,000 worth of bolts and fasteners for every plane Boeing builds. Ducommun, which supplies various parts to the aerospace industry, is described as well-suited for work on the new Boeing 777. Individual Investor provides good research on these companies and is careful not to overlook risks.
 
BITS AND PIECES Kiplinger's sees good growth in four oilfield-service companies and examines on-line computer services. . . . Smart Money has a guide to good restaurants at or near some big United States airports. . . . Individual Investor's cover article examines the fickle fashion business.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Conducting An Energy Audit

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
UNLIKE space shuttles and Mason jars, houses are not meant to be airtight. Some houses, however, are better than others at letting outside air in. And what may be good in moderation turns to bad when what is leaking into your house is a lot of cold winter air.
Rather than just bundling up and bearing it, however, homeowners can use winter's onslaught to their advantage: There is no better time than now to conduct a home energy audit. 
 "In all likelihood, any house built more than 15 years ago and never upgraded could benefit from an energy audit," said Alex Wilson, editor and publisher of Environmental Building News, a trade journal in Brattleboro, Vt.
An energy audit, Mr. Wilson said, is used to determine the efficiency of a home's heating system and to pinpoint where energy is being lost.
Professional energy auditors, Mr. Wilson said, will typically use special tools -- like infrared cameras, smoke pencils and blower doors -- to prepare a highly detailed assessment of problems and recommended solutions.
John Lyon, the owner of Energy Services Group, a diagnostic and consulting company in Frazer, Pa., said that when he conducts a home energy audit he gives the house an infrared scan.
An infrared scanner, Mr. Lyon said, like an infrared camera, will display differences in temperature when pointed at a surface. Accordingly, he said, an infrared scan conducted from inside the house will reveal not only the areas of cold air infiltration, but areas of walls and floors that are warmer or colder than adjoining areas.
"We can see heat ducts, water pipes, even the studs in the wall," Mr. Lyon said, adding that the infrared scan will also reveal areas of inadequate or nonexistent insulation.
After the scan, he said, he will then conduct a pressurization test using a blower door -- a fan with expandable sides and top that allow it to fit snugly in a doorway -- to draw air out of the house.
"When we suck air out of a house, the outside air comes in through all the points of leakage," Mr. Lyon said, explaining that while the outside air is coming in, another infrared scan is taken to determine where the house is leaking -- thereby allowing the homeowner to take action later to plug the leaks with caulking or insulation.
In houses with hot-air heating systems, Mr. Lyon said, an energy auditor should also perform a duct-flow analysis test to assess the integrity of the ductwork in the home.
In such a test, he said, the air blowing out of the system through delivery vents is measured and compared with the amount of air going back into the system through return vents. Since it is more efficient to have previously heated air reheated, Mr. Lyon said, the closer the two numbers are, the better.
"You want the system to be as tight as possible," he said. "So if you're delivering 1,000 cubic feet of air per minute into the house, and only 300 feet per minute is going back into the system, then the system's getting air from somewhere else." That "somewhere else," Mr. Lyon said, is typically from unheated areas of the house -- like the basement or attic.
To pinpoint where air is leaking into the system, he said, an auditor will use a smoke pencil -- a pencil-shaped device that emits white smoke to search for points in the system where the smoke is either sucked in or puffed away -- an indication of a leak that can then be sealed.
Most homeowners, of course, don't have access to infrared scanners, blower doors or smoke pencils. They can, however, conduct their own mini-pressurization test by closing all doors and windows and turning on ventilation fans in kitchens and bathrooms. They can then use an incense stick to smoke out areas of air infiltration around windows, doors, baseboards, electrical outlets and at seams in ductwork.
Homeowners can also conduct their own energy audit by calculating the total efficiency of their house and its heating system.
"It's easiest when you heat with fuel oil because in most cases, oil is only used for heat," said Mr. Wilson of Environmental Building News. In some houses, he said, the oil-fired furnace is also used to heat household hot water, making an assessment of heating costs alone difficult. Houses that use gas or electricity for heat, he said, pose even greater problems because those energy sources are typically used for other purposes -- such as cooking and running household appliances.
John Morrill, a spokesman for the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a public interest organization in Washington, said that homeowners can assess the efficiency of their heating system by first calculating the B.T.U.'s used during the last year, from July 1 to June 30. Since one gallon of oil produces 138,000 B.T.U.'s of heat, the total number of B.T.U.'s used can be calculated by multiplying the gallons of oil used during the season -- a figure that can be obtained from the oil supplier -- by 138,000.
They should then calculate the total square footage of the heated area of their home, and, finally, determine the total number of "degree days" for their area during the 1995-1996 heating season.
(Degree days are calculated by taking the average of the day's highest and lowest temperatures and then subtracting the result from 65. So, for example, a day with a low of 30 and high of 50 would equal 25 degree days. The total number of degree days for last year's heating season -- which varies from one area to another -- can usually be obtained from local fuel oil dealers, who use the figure to estimate when customers need fuel deliveries.)
Once the necessary numbers have been calculated, Mr. Morrill said, homeowners should divide the total number of B.T.U.'s used by the total square footage of the heated space in the house, and then divide the result by the total degree days for the heating season.
"You end up with B.T.U.'s per square foot per degree day," Mr. Morrill said. "An average home should be somewhere between 8 and 12." The higher the number, the more potential there is for efficiency improvements. If the result is higher than 12, he said, the homeowner should try to identify the cause of the problem -- which could be an inefficient furnace, insufficient insulation, or a combination of the two.
"I've personally poked my head into attics from Massachusetts to California," Mr. Morrill said. "And although the country has been more energy aware over the last 25 years, there are still millions of homes with pathetic levels of insulation."
Generally, Mr. Morrill said, homes in the Northeast should have at least six inches of insulation in their attics.
In many cases, the efficiency of a heating plant can be assessed by the fuel supplier. Most fuel oil suppliers will provide customers with a furnace inspection for a nominal fee, and an annual tuneup for about $100. Gas customers can call their local utility for similar services.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Warehouses;
For Developers, It's Raise High the Roof Beams

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THE 1950's-era factory building on Andrews Road in Hicksville, L.I., is a curious sight: Its walls stop at a one-story height, but the roof, like a raised eyebrow, stands 11 feet higher with nothing but a network of steel columns attaching it to the structure below.
The building, owned by Reckson Associates Realty Company of nearby Melville, is an indication of a trend in industrial property: Warehouses are getting taller as operators push to handle more goods in the same place. 
 Warehouses occupy an important if seldom noticed place in the chain of commerce. They are the place where products are stored after being shipped from manufacturers and before being sorted for shipment to retailers for sale to customers.
"There has been a steady progression in warehouse height from under 20 feet in the 1960's to the mid- to high 30's currently," said William L. Mascharka, president of Frazier Industrial Company in Long Valley, N.J., which manufactures the racks used to hold material stored in the buildings. The racks make it possible to organize the inventory in a warehouse and to quickly load and remove containers -- doing so would be a slower, more difficult process if pallets were stacked on top of each other.
Mr. Mascharka said improved lifting equipment, some of it developed in Europe, had made the more vertical operations practical in recent years.
Brokers said the scarcity of unoccupied land close to New York City and the consequent rising price had also induced warehouse operators to look upward. "As land costs get higher, you end up paying less for cubic feet than square feet," said Ronald Shalom, chairman of SBWE Inc., an industrial and retail brokerage in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J. "Existing buildings with 12 to 16 feet of clear space under the roof are obsolete."
Mr. Shalom said the lack of large tracts of space close to New York had also been driving distribution companies to locations farther from the city. "The Meadowlands are pretty well built up," he said. "So the new development is taking place in central New Jersey."
Another trend leading to the construction of bigger, higher warehouses is the desire of companies to reduce the number of separate locations they are operating. "There is a trend to fewer but larger warehouses," said Eugene A. Preston, director of marketing for the International Trade Center in Mount Olive, N.J., a project of Rockefeller Center Development Corporation.
He said newer warehouses were being constructed with 300,000 square feet of floor space or more, compared to the 100,000- to 200,000-square-foot facilities that were standard in the past. Mr. Preston said the center already contained 2 million square feet of warehouse space and was prepared to build more on a recently acquired 250-acre site adjacent to the existing property.
"We can put up one as big as 1 million square feet, or several at 300,000 square feet," he said.
He said new technology was helping to make the new buildings more economical. "There have been tremendous developments in sprinkler technology," Mr. Preston said. "The new, high-efficiency sprinkler heads can dump an enormous amounts of water."
This means a warehouse only needs one set of sprinkler pipes installed near the roof to suppress fires. The alternative is putting sprinklers at each level of a rack system, which could involve four or five times as much piping.
Taller buildings also demand more precision in construction. If, for example, floors are not all but perfectly flat, at 45 feet high, the forks of a lift truck could be several inches out of alignment with the pallet it is attempting to remove.
Industrial real estate specialists caution that very high warehouses need costly automated equipment. "If you have a 40 or 50 foot building, you are going to need a robotic system that follows guidewires in the floor and ceiling while somebody works a computer," said Ben Katz, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, the new name for the former Edward S. Gordon Company.
HE said most existing warehouses in the heavily industrialized areas between Exits 8A and 10 along the New Jersey Turnpike are of a medium height, although he acknowledges pressure to build new buildings taller. "For now, the Turnpike crowd will accept 24 feet," he said.
But that leaves a lot of buildings erected as manufacturing plants in the early post-World War II era, with single-story horizontal layout, languishing on the market.
The building on Andrews Road was built to house a factory producing aluminum storm doors and windows. In the fashion of the time, the 175,000-square-foot structure was built with a clear height of just 14 feet and a band of windows around the top to admit some natural light for factory workers.
It was acquired in foreclosure by a bank and sat empty for about six years until it was bought by Reckson last year. "Buildings like this were typical of the early industrial market in the Hicksville area," said Gregg Rechler, an executive vice president of Reckson.
Mr. Rechler said the company decided to buy the building and reposition it by raising the roof so it could function as a modern warehouse. "We were able to buy it at a pretty good discount to replacement value," he said. "We are raising the roof and going to put on a new skin, new mechanicals and modern lighting."
He said the location close to the Long Island Expressway, the Cross Island Parkway and other roads should make the structure attractive to distributors. "There is not a lot of this type of product in this location," he said.
The roof lift is being managed by another Melville-based company, Space Technology, which markets a technology developed by Industrial Service Enterprises of Dover, N.J.
To do the lift, the existing columns are cut at the floor level and then encased in a sturdy steel sleeve. Hydraulic jacks at the top of the sleeves then lift the old columns at the rate of a foot an hour. The roof goes up intact, with its structure, lighting, piping and rooftop equipment undisturbed.
The roof on Andrews Road was lifted 11 feet, from 14 feet of clear space to 25 feet, because of the need to keep about three feet of old column within the sleeve, so the two can be securely bolted together. The new upper area will be sheathed with insulated steel panels, to keep out the weather and to give the building an attractive appearance. The band of windows, which would be of no value to a warehouse operation, will be eliminated.
Roof raising is becoming increasing popular as a way of recycling old buildings, said Gregory Benson, a vice president of Industrial Service Enterprises. "It was pretty spotty in the past, but for the last three or four years we have had a steady flow of work."
Brokers specializing in industrial properties said that roof-raising costs from $6 to $10 a square foot, far less than it would cost to demolish an old structure and build a new one. Nevertheless, they say, the economics work best on larger properties because the return on a 20,000- or 30,000-square-foot building usually does not justify a renovation project.
GOING up rather than out, as had been the practice in the past, avoids a host of problems, said Jeffrey R. Allen, a partner in Space Technologies. No new land needs to be purchased, and the often-contentious process of getting government approvals is truncated.
"If you do not build out, you do not have to worry about zoning changes," Mr. Allen said. "That means it is a building permit issue, not a planning board issue."
Raising an existing roof means a building can be quickly back into operation, said Stuart I. Goldring, another official of Space Technologies. "With electricity, you can splice a loop into existing cable that unfolds as the lift proceeds. With the sprinklers, you turn them off during the lift, put in a new section of vertical pipe afterward, and you are back in business."
Mr. Rechler said Reckson decided to rehabilitate the building on a speculative basis because "it is pretty hard to get across to the user what it will be without doing the work." He said he started hearing from brokers after the first of four sections of the roof was hoisted.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
In Just a Year, Reckson Gains a Major Role in County

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
FROM a perch atop a pyramidal office building that looks like something out of "Star Trek," Salvatore Campofranco surveys the 1.2 million-square-foot Tarrytown Corporate Center below him with satisfaction and some surprise.
Since Reckson Associates Realty Corporation entered the Westchester market last year by purchasing 768,000 square feet of the office space in the complex on Route 119 just east of Tarrytown, the property has consistently outperformed the market and has now reached nearly full occupancy, said Mr. Campofranco, managing director of Reckson's Westchester Division. 
 When Reckson bought the Tarrytown Corporate Center from Halpern Enterprises "occupancy was at about 90 percent," Mr. Campofranco said. "Now it's 96 percent, and we expect it to reach 98 percent soon."
Reckson, now a real estate investment trust based in Melville, L.I., started out as a family business on Long Island in 1962. It now owns or has under contract 9.3 million square feet of office and industrial space in the New York metropolitan area.
Last year, it completed the $86 million purchase of most of developer Jon L. Halpern's office portfolio, which included eight buildings with a total of 935,000 square feet. Five are in the corporate park. Reckson has since added two additional buildings with total of 181,000 square feet.
Since taking over the Westchester Division in June, Mr. Campofranco said he had been so busy trying to meet the needs of his tenants and signing new leases that he had not had time to unpack boxes or even carve out space for his own office.
He is currently working out of a windowless cubbyhole in a nondescript inner sanctum of 660 White Plains Road, which is the flagship building in the park.
In the tight space, Mr. Campofranco has piles of boxes and papers teetering precariously in every direction. The floor is covered with carpet remnants that don't meet in places, exposing large sections of the cement floor.
"It came down to whether I was going to spend time working on my office or helping the tenants with their needs," he explained. "In real estate, there's always been a philosophy that you'd move into the basement if necessary in order to keep the best space for your tenants."
"When I look at the office vacancy reports, they don't reflect my experience or the excitement I see," he continued. "We have companies that are expanding and need more space and new companies coming in. It's been very dynamic."
The Tarrytown Corporate Center is situated in a section of the county known as the western corridor. Most of that area's buildings are concentrated along Route 119 inside and just outside Tarrytown.
LAST year, the corridor posted a 9.4 percent vacancy rate, down from 13.8 percent the year before, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company, a commercial brokerage.
"If you looked at our properties alone," Mr. Campofranco said, "the rate has got to be at historic lows. It doesn't get much better."
Reckson now owns about one-seventh of the office space in the county's western market. "Historically there's been less available space in that segment of the market," said Michael H. Siegel, executive director of the Edward S. Gordon offices in White Plains and Stamford, Conn. "A lot of companies like to be located there because of its proximity to Rockland County, where a lot of the labor pool comes from."
It is also a part of the county loaded with attractions for commercial tenants, according to Frank Tomasulo, first vice president with the CB Commercial brokerage in White Plains. "There are a lot of hotels there and conference centers and restaurants," Mr. Tomasulo said. "It's always been considered very desirable."
The Tarrytown Corporate Center has a Marriott Hotel on its property. "It really helps us attract tenants," Mr. Campofranco said. "It has a swimming pool tenants can use, a spa and restaurants. In a suburban park, it's great to have something like that people can walk to."
Built between 1974 and 1985, the Tarrytown Corporate Center has fared well even in the worst of times. "At the lowest point of the recession, we were 80 percent leased," explained Mr. Halpern, whose family company created the park and sold all but two owner-occupied buildings to Reckson.
Part of the reason for its success, Mr. Halpern said, is that the park was built for the long term. "We were investment builders," he explained. "If we put up a building for I.B.M., we did it with an eye toward having to market it to another company some day. It had to be flexible."
Mr. Halpern now works with Reckson as executive vice president in charge of acquisitions and financing. He is also president of the Westchester Division.
Before joining Reckson, Mr. Campofranco was chief financial officer for Towermarc Corporation, a privately held real estate development company in Boston. "The suburban market there is very similar to Westchester's," he said. "We had the same kind of downsizing with several high-technology firms. But things have started to stabilize just like here."
One of the buildings that Reckson added to its portfolio in the western corridor -- 555 White Plains Road, across from the Tarrytown Corporate Center -- was a former Halpern property that had fallen into foreclosure. As a result, occupancy plummeted to 37 percent. It is now at 100 percent occupancy, Mr. Campofranco said.
RECKSON purchased the 121,000-square-foot building for $4.8 million in April. "It really helped us address some of the needs of our tenants in the park who needed to expand," Mr. Campofranco said.
The building is now undergoing a $3.5 million renovation, Mr. Campofranco explained, which will include a new entrance, a new cafeteria, a computer-ready conference room and remodeled elevators.
As Reckson succeeds in filling up its buildings, it is on the lookout for new opportunities in Westchester, Mr. Campofranco said. Last year, the company formed a joint venture partnership with Capelli Associates, of Valhalla, to purchase 360 Hamilton Avenue in White Plains. The 380,000-square-foot building has been largely vacant since I.B.M. abandoned it in 1989.
"We see White Plains as a very desirable market," Mr. Campofranco said. "We think the building can be successfully repositioned and have a new life. It's being marketed now. We need a kick-off tenant to take at least 50,000 square feet before we can begin working on it."
John H. Rostenberg, a principal of Rostenberg-Doern, a commercial brokerage with offices in Purchase and Stamford, Conn., said that with the new ownership, 360 Hamilton Avenue was in a great position to turn around its fortunes. "It's a well-constructed and esthetically pleasing building," he said. "It's near affordable housing so people could walk to work, which is a very unique feature. I think they'll do well with it."
While White Plains had strong leasing activity last year, it nevertheless continues to be plagued with corporate downsizing. The vacancy rate in the central business district reached 27.5 percent in 1996, up from 24.4 percent the year before, according to Edward S. Gordon. The county's overall vacancy rate also climbed -- to 17 percent from 16.4 percent in 1995.
If Reckson is successful in repositioning 360 Hamilton Avenue, it would mean one of the most persistent drags on the White Plains market would be eliminated. "We have no false expectations," Mr. Campofranco said. "We know it will take time, but we think it's a viable candidate for a big user of space. "There's less of the big blocks of space available," he said. "We believe it will be a big success."

HEADLINE: Renewal of Union Square Reaches a Key Block

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
THE long-awaited construction of a mixed-use building on the full block south of Union Square between Broadway and Fourth Avenue is under way, foreshadowing a large expansion of retailing and entertainment activities in an area that has been one of the most active for redevelopment in Manhattan.
Layered within an immense glass box rising 85 feet from street level on four sides will be a new Virgin music and entertainment store, almost as large as the megastore that Virgin opened on Times Square last April; a 14-screen theater component for United Artists Theater Circuit, which will have 3,500 seats, and a Circuit City electronics store, the first in New York City by a national chain that wants to be the somebody who beats The Wiz. 
 The presence of a Nobody Beats the Wiz store on the west side of Union Square Park -- and a Barnes & Noble on the north side, a Toys "R" Us on the east, a Bradlees on the south, and a P.C. Richard half a block away -- underscore the growth of retailing already under way.
The new project also has a major residential component. From the roof of the retail base, set back from 14th Street, will rise a tower with 240 apartments, with 50 reserved for people of lower income. The total development cost is estimated at $130 million, with $50 million in financing for the mixed-income residential portion coming from tax-exempt state bonds.
The developer, The Related Companies LP, has sponsored a competition under the auspices of the Municipal Art Society and the Public Art Fund for the selection of a monumental artwork rising from the facade facing Union Square. It is the key element in the design by the firm of Davis Brody Bond, and is intended to set a tone for the southern terminus of a midtown spine stretching all the way from Union Square along Park Avenue South to Grand Central Terminal. The artwork will stand 100 feet high and 60 feet wide and form a visual link with the residential structure. The winner of the competition is to be announced by the developer at a ceremonial ground-breaking on Feb. 25.
Apart from its purely local impact, the Related project throws light on several aspects of the Manhattan development scene in the mid-90's. It shows anew how closely tied new development has been to the availability of tax-exempt bond financing from New York State. Without this financing, and city tax abatements that are also available, the development would not have gone forward, said Stephen M. Ross, chairman of The Related Companies.
It also demonstrates how in strong or promising retailing locations in Manhattan, retailing is often the dog that wags the residential tail. The Lincoln Square development on Broadway in the West 60's, with condominium apartments above a base of superstores and theaters, was the model.
Not only have the developers taken advantage of the zoning to provide the superstores that big specialized retailers want in the 90's; they have also used the retailing commitment as a critical building block in the financing of the entire project.
In another sense, the Union Square development shows how the happenstance of the business cycle as much as the well-laid plans of mere mortals influences who builds what in New York, and when.
But for the sharp decline of the real-estate market in the late 80's, the developer of the 50,000-square-foot site might have been Philip Pilevsky, the principal in Philips International Holding Corporation. He had a contract to buy the northern, or 14th Street, portion of the site from its two owners, and had already bought the 13th Street side, which had been in single ownership, when the real estate recession struck. "The timing was horrible," Mr. Pilevsky said.
The 14th Street portion fell back into the hands of the landowners, First Sterling Corporation and a partnership of Marvin Fastenberg and Dan Birnant. A lender, FGH Realty, took control of the 13th Street half.
In 1993, Mr. Ross of Related ran into a nephew of Marvin Fastenberg, the late Steven Fastenberg, on a flight to a meeting of shopping center executives in Las Vegas. "He was sitting in front of me and recognized me, and turned around to ask if I'd be interested in that site his uncle has," Mr. Ross said. "I said yes."
Mr. Ross made a commitment to lease the land from the two 14th Street owners, but the deal was contingent on his ability to get control of the 13th Street side. Ultimately, he was able to make that deal, getting a leasehold to the retail portion and fee-simple-ownership of the residential portion.
Then Related sold the leasehold position for the 250,000-square-foot retail base to a state pension fund -- the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, which effectively becomes the owner of the commercial base. Related will manage the investment for the pension fund. The payments made in these various deals were not disclosed.
LAST year Related demolished the remaining building on the site, the eight-story 1902 structure at 842 Broadway, on 13th Street. In its day it had housed Rogers, Peet, the men's clothing store; The Village Voice and Berkey Photos.
With the firm of Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron as its architect of record, Related is producing a structure of about 500,000 square feet of space. Half the site is in the special Union Square zoning district and half is out of it. Both portions allow commercial and residential use up to a floor-area ratio of 10 above street level (10 square feet of building area for each square foot of land). But the allowable proportion of commercial use to residential use is higher within the special zoning district than on the 13th Street side.
Utilizing somewhat less than the total zoning potential of the site, Related will build 458,000 square feet of space above street level, more than half of it for the stores and theaters. The commercial base will have 248,000 square feet of space above street level (plus 48,000 square feet, not counted for zoning purposes, below street level). The residential space will start on the fifth floor and rise to the 21st floor. Residents will enter a 2,000-square-foot lobby on Fourth Avenue and take an elevator to the residential floors.
"The minimum street-wall height allowed on Union Square was 85 feet," said Peter Claman, the architect. "The maximum retail height allowed on 13th Street is 85 feet. This made the whole project feasible."
The Virgin music and entertainment store will be entered from 14th Street and Broadway and occupy space on the ground floor and basement for a total of 75,000 square feet. The main entrance to the United Artists theater space on the third and fourth floors will be at 13th Street and Broadway, with escalators running to the third-floor lobby.
The Circuit City store on the first and second floors will be entered at 14th Street and Fourth Avenue, with an internal escalator taking shoppers to the second floor. It will occupy 48,000 square feet of space, mainly on the second floor.
At various stages in the development process, Related was close to a deal with Caldor, Kmart and Sears Roebuck & Company, said Robert Futterman, senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, the retail-space brokerage firm, who was Related's leasing agent for the project. But Sears decided not to go forward with its first Manhattan location, he said, and the prospect of a bankruptcy proceeding for Caldor led Related to back away from that deal.
Had any of those deals been completed, the retail base of the building would probably have been built to its maximum zoning potential, with five retail levels and the full 500,000 square feet, plus 50,000 square feet below street level, Related executives said.
The "art wall" along 14th Street will be one of the city's most prominent pieces of public art, costing the developer about $1 million. Last June six finalists were chosen from the 100 artists across the country who responded to an invitation to join the competition. They were commissioned to develop their preliminary ideas further. The finalists were Ivan Chermayeff; Kristin Jones & Andrew Ginzel; Clyde Lynds; Matt Mullican; Tom Otterness, and Frank Stella.
In August, after consulting with an advisory committee drawn from the community, the arts organizations and Davis Brody Bond, the developer decided to continue with the development of two of the proposals, the Public Art Fund said. The two were not identified.
Visually, the sculpture will relate to the masonry residential component more than the glassy commercial component, said Steven M. Davis of the architectural firm. "The tower grows out of the art," he said. The glass facades above the clear glass at the base of the building will be of a different tone on either side of the sculpture, Mr. Davis said: an opaque curtain wall of a pewter tone on the Broadway side, and translucent in a range of tones on the eastern side.
As for the housing component, it will have 57 studio apartments, 152 one-bedrooms and 31 two-bedroom apartments. To finance it, the New York State Housing Finance Agency has issued $50 million in tax-exempt bonds, including $1 million for a debt service reserve fund. Rents for the 80 percent of apartments that will be leased at market rates are expected to average about $33 a square foot a year, or roughly $2,100 a month for a one-bedroom apartment.
THE lenders providing credit enhancement -- which insures repayment on the bond to the bondholders -- were Fleet Bank and Hypo Bank of Munich, as it is known in this country. (The German name is Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank.) Securing credit enhancement is a necessary part of the financing process, and not always an easy one. The state won't issue bonds until the security for the bondholders is assured.
Stephen J. Hunt, president of the Housing Finance Agency, said that the statewide commitment of tax-exempt bonds under the 80-20 program (with 20 percent of the units reserved for lower-income occupants) has expanded significantly since 1995. The pipeline now stands at about $850 million statewide, of which about $650 million is in New York City, where the program works particularly well. The $650 million is expected to finance about 3,100 additional Manhattan apartments, of which 20 percent are to be for lower-income tenants.
The program works well in Manhattan because Manhattan is one of the few places where developers can obtain high enough market rents to provide an internal cross-subsidy benefiting lower-income tenants. This subsidy at present is estimated at about $18,000 per lower-income one-bedroom apartment a year, Related says. That is to say, the lower-income tenants pay rents that are about $18,000 a year below the market-rate rents. "The combination of tax-exempt financing, the tax abatement programs and the market-rate rents we can get in Manhattan make the entire project feasible," Mr. Ross said.
Handling the new construction on Union Square is HRH Construction, one of the constituents of the Starrett Corporation, a public real estate services organization. Last week Starrett disclosed that Related Capital Company, one of the financial services affiliates of The Related Companies, had agreed to buy a majority stake in Starrett, most of it the holdings of Paul and Seymour Milstein. Besides HRH, major operating entities of Starrett are Grenadier Realty, a national housing management company, and Levitt Homes, a leading home builder in Florida and Puerto Rico.
Refraining from specifics, Mr. Ross said that he hoped to build the company as a real-estate services organization. He also commented that it was important to keep HRH intact under the leadership of Frank Ross, its chief executive (and no relation to Stephen Ross).
The major improvements to Union Square Park that the New York City Parks Department began in the 80's have played an important role in encouraging new investment and development around the perimeter. A $3.4 million program included the creation of east-to-west and north-to-south sight lines that helped make the park a safer place at night. In 1993 two new playgrounds were added at a cost of $300,000.
Future expansion of the park is planned in a westward and to some extent in a southeasterly direction, said Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner. "It will be a bigger, greener place a few years from now," Mr. Stern said. The park currently embraces 3.593 acres, and expansion could add at least an acre, he said. On the northwest side of the park, the Union Square Greenmarket, celebrated in Manhattan for the produce it sells four days a week, will be unaffected by the expansion.
On certain sites, redevelopment activity needs little further inducement. New York University is already in construction with new dormitory building on 14th Street between Broadway and Third Avenue, on the former site of Luchow's Restaurant. It will have 20 floors on the 14th Street side and 14 floors on the 13th Street side, with 172 apartments, 637 beds, and dining facilities for 300 people. Davis Broad Bond is the architect.
AND farther east on the block, J.D. Carlisle Development Corporation is in contract to buy the property where the Palladium Club operates under a lease that will soon expire, plus a contiguous property that is operated as a parking lot. This site might support a major building on a substantial 41,000-square-foot footprint.
The Related project is scheduled to open late next year. For those who have worked for the advancement of redevelopment in the Union Square area over the last several years, the opening will mark a long step forward.
"It will bring activity to the street, and fill in a broken tooth in the comb that breaks the flow of retail traffic," said Jonathan F. Fanton, president of the New School for Social Research, on West 12th Street, and co-chair of the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation. "And in the evening the theaters will generate street traffic."
James I. Gabbe, a board member of the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, who lives in the 670-unit Zeckendorf Towers condominium on the east side of the park, said that by bringing in shoppers and new permanent residents the development will expand the contribution to areawide improvement that William Zeckendorf Jr. made when he developed Zeckendorf Towers in the 80's.
And William L. Haines, principal in an ownership group on lower Fifth Avenue that leases stores to Barnes & Noble, The Gap and other office and commercial tenants, said that 14th Street had long been retailing's Achilles heel in the area. "Now it's starting to take off," he said.

HEADLINE: IN PERSON;
For an Art Museum's Sake

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Some see only the generations of paint flaking from the concrete block walls, the rust of steel showing through a pillar here and there, the plaster on the floor and the faded block letters saying "Blow Horn" -- mementos of the 1920's when this shell of a building was a post office garage.
But Nina S. Jacobs sees a museum. 
 "Over there will be classrooms," she says, excitement flashing in her dark eyes in the illumination of the construction lights strung overhead. "And when the skylight area is built, it will create a corridor here, and we'll line it with display cases, for the most part Jersey City history."
Ms. Jacobs, despite the sign, can't stop blowing the horn, not her own but that of the Jersey City Museum. It is an institution for which she has labored for almost a decade, four of them as its director. After almost 100 years in the same location -- cramped quarters on the fourth floor of the public library whose roof leaks -- the museum is being relocated to a two-story, yellow brick building that will provide three times more gallery space, an auditorium, classrooms and a resource room for the city's growing population of artists.
Overseeing the $5.2 million renovation is Ms. Jacobs, a lapsed painter turned administrator. At a time when funding for the arts is drying up, she was able to get a $2 million grant last July from the New Jersey State Council of the Arts, one of the last sizable grants from a 1987 bond issue for cultural institutions. And now she is about to begin a campaign to raise matching funds for a museum that she hopes will reflect and unite the diverse peoples who make up this battered industrial city.
"You know, we're building a museum, but this is a much larger issue than a museum," she says. "This is really about community revitalization and urban revitalization. We're going to have a significant impact on the life and optimism of what's happening in Jersey City, the development of Jersey City."
She adds, "This is a historic time for us."
If that sounds like ego talking, it isn't. Ms. Jacobs, 43, cringes at talking about herself, her skills as an administrator and the frustrations that keep her from painting again.
"The museum is interesting; I'm not," she says.
Attached to the wall, just inside her small office, is an old industrial-style sink. It is not a quaint piece of art but a real sink, clogged, suggesting that her office could once have been a janitor's closet. The office, overheated in winter, stifling in the summer, overlooks the roofs of tenements. It's filled with books and papers and several scale models of the new building, a 25,700-square-foot-structure that, Ms. Jacobs notes gleefully, will have a working heating and air-conditioning system.
"This is not a self-aggrandizing moment for Nina," said Charles Gifford of Myer & Gifford Architects of Manhattan who has been planning the building with her. "She's really an unselfish person who is not driven by a desire for glory or even the desire for a new office that has a working air-conditioner and doesn't have a sink in it."
Since she discovered and fell in love with the abandoned postal garage, which literally had trees growing from its roof two years ago, she has been unafraid to get her hands dirty. During a driving rain last year, she headed up to the snow-covered roof of the building, a pickax in her hands, to look for clogged storm drains, -- embarrassing a work crew into coming up to help.
"She's a real, genuine person, despite all this artsy stuff," said Bob Cotter, director of the Jersey City planning department. "A stuffed shirt wouldn't be appropriate for a museum like Jersey City's."
She joined the museum at another historic time, 1987, when it was almost forced to close for lack of funds, as it had once before, from 1953 to 1975. In 1987, the city gave the museum its own budget line, separating it from the library's finances.
At first she worked in development, writing requests for grants and funds, then in public relations, publicizing exhibitions and programs. She moved up to assistant director, acting director, and in 1992, director.
As director, she is responsible for cultivating community, political and financial support for the museum. She also oversees day-to-day operations, insuring that they are consistent with the museum's mission, and provides guidance to a 10-member staff that includes an assistant director, curator of education, and teachers, collection manager, public relations associate, development director and a curator who plans the exhibitions.
Catherine Dunning, an educator with the museum, praised Ms. Jacobs for supporting the summer Public A.R.T. (Art Related Training) Program in which youths are paid to create murals and billboards under the guidance of professional artists. When the starkness of some of the anti-drug and anti-violence messages drew criticism, Ms. Dunning said, "She showed a certain courage and was willing to field any comments." She added, "She has not backed down."
Some directors, many being artists themselves, assume the role of curator as well, but she has chosen not to, and wisely so, said the architect, Mr. Gifford.
"She leaves people alone to do their jobs," Mr. Gifford said, while focusing on "the more important issues like the museum's future, mission and constituency."
Barbara Russo, executive director of the State Council of the Arts, said that in awarding the $2 million grant, her agency had been impressed with the museum's impact on cultural life beyond Jersey City and by the scope of its programs for the community.
"She's taken an important cultural institution and shown how it can work with a community of artists and a community of residents and be meaningful," said Ms. Russo.
Carlos Hernandez, the president of Jersey City State College who serves as chairman of the museum's board of directors, says it is Ms. Jacobs' background as a painter that enlightens her work as director.
"She understands the bridge between what the arts are and what they can do to stimulate excitement and creative energies in people," Dr. Hernandez says. "It takes a creative person to spark that creative flair in others."
Ms. Jacobs was born in Red Bank but grew up in Keyport. Her father at various times was a salesman, auto body shop owner and restaurateur. Her mother worked in a doctor's office.
She credits her great grandfather, John Wester, a Danish emigre architect who designed schools and churches in New Jersey at the turn of the century, for her lifelong interest in art.
"I have early memories of sitting with him and learning how to draw," she recalled.
After graduation from Keyport High School, she attended the University of Miami in Florida for two years, but missed New Jersey and returned to major in studio art at Douglass College.
During college, she worked odd jobs, including sales, to pay for her tuition, and after graduation in 1980, moved to Erwinna, Pa., to live the life of an artist. For a half-dozen years, she explored her talent, painting full-time, and to support herself designed clothes, gave private art lessons and eventually took work as an assistant editor for a company that published art books for major museums.
She moved back to New Jersey eventually and briefly lived with her sister in Highlands. It was at this point she heard about a job opening at the Jersey City Museum and applied. The job, she says, demanded most of her time and she eventually quit painting.
"It's painful," she says of painting, a solitary act, she adds, that puts one's intimate creations up for criticism and then becomes a process in which one is forced to promote the work. "It requires a kind of focus I can't give it right now."
Maybe at some point she will resume. "I know I've been thinking about it," she says. "I've been seeing things that have been pulling at me."
But something else is pulling at her now: a new museum.
"This has given me everything that I ever looked for in terms of an art career," Nina Jacobs says, cheerily. "I'd like to think that this is a creative project. And trying to envision a space for the future and the activities that are going to occur in the space, to be able to create a flexible space that a hundred years from now will still be of service -- that's a pretty challenging proposition."

Getting Help Getting Children in for Vaccinations

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
In the back of a rundown Newark house, up a short flight of unlighted stairs, in a bedroom where MTV blares, is Rebecca Gordon, hugely pregnant and between labor pains.
Ms. Gordon is 22. She is having twins. She has four other children, 6, 5, 3 and 1. Understandably, Ms. Gordon, who is single, on welfare, overwhelmed by her duties as a mother and likely to become more so, lets some things slip. 
 One such thing is her children's vaccinations. Her youngest child, until tomorrow, anyway, is months behind on his vaccinations. That is why Frank and Heidi Abernethy have dropped by. They are volunteers in a Fair Lawn organization to aid parents in vaccinating their children.
New Jersey has 7,000 other volunteers in Hope for Kids, as the organization is called. It was started by church members in 1993 in Orlando, Fla. It moved to Harlem, then Fair Lawn, and has branches in 29 states and Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, India and Cambodia.
In Newark and Paterson, as in all of New Jersey's economically depressed cities, large numbers of children are unimmunized. Many do not get their shots protecting them against serious childhood illnesses until they are 5 or 6, when they must be immunized to enter school. In Newark, nearly half the children are unimmunized; in some neighborhoods, the immunization rate is as low as 1 in 5.
When a high percentage of children in a neighborhood are unvaccinated, the risk of serious illness is high. Children should be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, polio, whooping cough and tetanus, among other diseases.
They should receive five shots between 2 months and 2 years. Some people assume that childhood diseases are an irritating but harmless part of growing up, but these illnesses can cause deafness, blindness, brain damage, paralysis and death. When measles swept the country in 1991, it was children from inner cities like Newark and Paterson who suffered and died.
Ms. Gordon agreed that vaccination is a good idea. But she has no way of getting to a clinic. Transportation and money are obstacles for many low-income parents. Another is suspicion of government programs and fear of officials. A drug-addicted mother may worry her child will be put in foster care. Some religious groups oppose vaccination. Some parents believe that vaccination is harmful, causing the disease it is supposed to prevent.
The same morning that Rebecca Gordon was awaiting the birth of her twins, Susan Hirsch, a South Orange piano teacher, brought two children, 2 1/2 and 4 1/2, for their first shots, which they should have received at 2 months.
"This is what I have to do to get them in school," she said. She believes a diet of organic foods and immunity created by light cases of disease is far superior. "I don't believe in this stuff," she said. "It's the religion of my life."
This conviction is held by some parents adhering to alternative medical theories, from homeopathy to voodoo. It is opposed by doctors and public health officials.
But most parents whose children have missed immunizations have simply forgotten or procrastinated.
In the mid-80's, the percentage of children vaccinated dropped steeply around the country at all income levels. Memories of the toll of childhood diseases like polio and measles, once fresh in parents' minds, had dulled, said Elin Gursky, an assistant commissioner in the State Department of Health and Senior Services. By the late 80's, New Jersey, like the rest of the country, saw large increases in measles and mumps and smaller increases in diphtheria.
New Jersey's legislators, like other state and Federal officials, assumed childhood diseases were no longer much of a threat. Legislators cut budgets, creating "failing public health systems," Ms. Gursky said.
When 1,138 New Jersey children contracted measles in 1991 and 4 died, the Legislature, shaken, improved its tracking of immunizations. A system to follow the vaccinations of each child born in the state is slated to be ready by the end of 1997.
To do any good, leaders of volunteer organizations need more than good will. They also need political savvy. Lawton Chiles 3d, known as Bud, has this in abundance.
He learned it as a child from his father, Lawton Chiles, a former Senator from Florida and now its Governor. A few years ago, in Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant, the younger Mr. Chiles hooked up with Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had warehouses of donated vaccines and medical supplies earmarked for low-income children, but lacked the staff to connect the children with the medical workers. Mr. Chiles supplied workers, transportation and door-to-door canvassing, and let the credit go to the Mayor.
In New Jersey, he and his organization work with county health departments, getting names of children who have missed vaccination appointments and visiting their homes. New Jersey volunteers have followed 300 children through their five-shot cycle over a two-year period. In Trenton, Jersey City, Paterson and Newark, 200 volunteers are following 600 other children. They also offer information on other childhood health concerns: lead poisoning, nutrition, AIDS testing and asthma.
The problem is not a lack of vaccines or medical workers, Mr. Chiles said. It is connecting, getting parents and children to clinics. "We keep coming back," he said, "visiting the kids, whatever it takes."

HEADLINE: What Whitman Says, What Whitman Does

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When Governor Whitman said it was necessary to concentrate on a law to equalize school financing to meet a Supreme Court deadline, the teachers, Democrats and the public believed her. Big mistake. 
 Without confiding in the public at all, for the first time in our history, Governor Whitman slips in a provision for state financing of student transfers to outlying school districts. Since the receiving district can pick and choose, will this siphon off the better students and devastate inner-city schools? Never discussed.
Clearly, the Governor believes public education is some kind of a "business." Public schools should "compete," and if inner-city schools go "out of business," too bad.
This is no surprise. The Governor's public persona is one of caring, but her track record tells a different, cynical story: her eliminating the Public Advocate so utility rates can escape public scrutiny; her shifting of the tax burden to municipalities and homeowners, and her financing of her famous "income tax reduction" by looting the pension funds and unemployment funds of billions.
When it's time to shine, she's on television. When it's time to explain hidden deals, the spokesmen speak. When times get tough and these chickens come home to roost, she will have "moved on to better things." She should be moved out now because she does not level with the people.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Renaissance Ballroom: Lost for $1,000

BYLINE: By JANET ALLON 

 BODY:
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and a group of Harlem investors had big plans for the Renaissance Ballroom, a faded relic of Harlem's heyday. Restoration plans for the two-story building on 138th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard included reviving the banquet hall, where Harlemites had held dances and celebrated weddings and other life passages. But the investors did not have title to the property.
Led by the Abyssinian Development Corporation, the group of investors had for years been trying to buy both the Rennie, as they called it fondly, and the nearby nightclub Small's Paradise. In 1992, they came close when they bought the mortgages to the historical landmarks from the Resolution Trust Corporation. But a real-estate investor, Baruch Singer, retained the title. 
 But early last month, their hopes of owning the Renaissance Ballroom were dashed when a real-estate investor, Michael Berman, who is also a partner of Mr. Singer, outbid Abyssinian Development in a foreclosure auction that Abyssinian sought in an attempt to gain ownership. The Harlem investors had come within a hairbreadth; the winning bid ($3,671,000) was $1,000 higher than theirs.
"We were stunned," said Darren Walker, director of development for Abyssinian, who said the group's representative had not been authorized to engage in a bidding war.
In the aftermath, community activists denounced Mr. Singer as an unscrupulous speculator.
"This project is dear to us," said Dr. Preston R. Washington, president of Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement. "Where is the community's equity? I don't think it's appropriate for the community to accept this. We are sick and tired of being a colony that is run by outside interests."
Mr. Singer, who defaulted on his loans, says he does not see himself as a speculator. "I am committed to develop the property, and I am willing to work with the community," he said, blaming the economic downturn for his failure to develop. The owners said a number of retailers and entertainment companies were interested in the site. The area is anticipating a boon, partly as a result of millions of dollars to be allocated by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.
The issue of ownership of the Renaissance is also charged because of the property's history. Unlike other popular nightspots that catered to a largely white clientele, the Renaissance Ballroom, with its arched Palladian windows, was always a haven for middle-class blacks and featured films with all-black casts and was home to the Renaissance Big Five, a semiprofessional basketball team regarded as one of the best of its time.
But the ballroom's popularity declined in the 1960's as people began patronizing clubs downtown. In 1989, Mr. Singer and investors bought the building for $2.7 million. Soon afterward, Mr. Butts began negotiations to buy it. In 1991 the church won a grant to study the building's commercial potential.
During the savings and loan crises of the early 1990's, the bank that held the mortgage failed and was taken over by the Resolution Trust Corporation. Representative Charles B. Rangel persuaded the corporation to sell the mortgage to Abyssinian for $300,000. And the group led by Abyssinian bought the mortgage for Small's Paradise, also owned by Mr. Singer's group, for $100,000.
With the Renaissance lost to them, the Harlem investors are trying to avoid losing Small's Paradise. The foreclosure auction on that is set for Feb. 11. JANET ALLON

HEADLINE: Europe's Social Net

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Jan. 13 news analysis on the shift toward self-reliance in the welfare system quotes a Harvard economist as saying that America is "growing up and we are getting out of the European mode, which is more the welfare state." But this ignores an essential aspect of the Western and Northern European welfare states, as is often the case in American analyses. 
 The European welfare state is not only and not even in the first place about giving away money to people who have fallen behind. It is about creating a public space shared by high-income and low-income people: amenities like schools, universities, hospitals, parks, low-cost transportation and swimming pools. That is why France, for instance, spends four times as much per capita on its infrastructure as our Federal and state governments combined.
The well-to-do get more out of this than the poor, for they live longer, take better care of themselves, send their children to universities, use the libraries more and so forth. The resulting social climate is less aggressive and more pleasant, and the quality of life for everyone is improved.
Admittedly, this lessens the enterprising spirit such as we find in the United States, and as a result there is more unemployment and less wealth in absolute terms. However, I do not doubt that it creates more human happiness.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
The Bond Fund Ratings That Ads Can't Trumpet

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
THE Payden & Rygel Global Fixed-Income fund has earned an "a+" for safety from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Few people know it, however, because the fund can't advertise the fact. The National Association of Securities Dealers "will not allow us to publish these ratings," said Joan Payden, president and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based investment firm that manages the portfolio.
The N.A.S.D. has sided -- twice -- with the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund industry's trade association, in rejecting the S.& P. market-risk ratings for bond funds. It has argued largely that the ratings might be viewed as predicting a fund's behavior, which fund companies are not allowed to do. But under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the N.A.S.D. has taken up the issue again. The new ratings could well be legitimized, and spread beyond the small number of fixed-income mutual funds that already have them. 
 If they do, S.& P. officials said, fund investors will be well served. "I think if Orange County had had the kind of disclosure that would be required by this risk-rating process, then the risks of its bonds would have been more apparent," said Cliff Griep, executive managing director of S.& P.'s financial institutions group.
Many of the nation's 3,500-plus bond mutual funds report enough information about their portfolios in prospectuses and annual reports to let a knowledgeable investor measure their vulnerability to defaults, interest rate changes and other risks.
These documents, however, are widely ignored. "The information is all there, and anybody can look it up, but the point is people don't do it," Ms. Payden said. She said her firm subscribed to S.& P.'s ratings to help its customers "know what they're buying." The fund received the rating last year and now awaits approval to use it.
In the meantime, S.& P. provides its subscribers' risk ratings in its monthly Global Ratings Handbook, on its Web site (http:// www.ratings.standardpoor.com/funds) and to investors who request them.
To arrive at a risk score, S.& P. officials say their evaluations go far beyond even sophisticated measurements of risk like convexity, a response of a bond's value to a change in interest rates. Gary Arne, director of the company's managed funds group, said, "We also do a qualitative assessment of management, including its strategy and dedication to risk parameters, as well as a historical risk analysis."
THE S.& P. ratings play to a clamor for more disclosure from fund companies, which often withhold information, citing competitive reasons, until it is so dated as to be useless. The collapse of some bond funds in 1994, notably portfolios of Paine Webber and Piper Jaffray that had bought risky derivatives, stunned shareholders who were ignorant of the risks.
"I think anything that would improve disclosure and unbiased ratings of the relative risks of bond funds is to be applauded," said Daniel Wiener, who edits a newsletter, the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors.
Despite acceptance by a few fund complexes, the new S.& P. ratings have been resisted by the largest and most influential ones. "This is a self-serving effort by S.& P. to sell information that's of limited to no value to the public," said Jack Brennan, chief executive of the Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest fund complex, after Fidelity Investments. "This is a quixotic hunt for an easy answer to the definition of risk, which defies easy answers."
He cited the example of the a+ rating carried by the Payden & Rygel fund. In both academia and the insurance industry, that's the best grade you can get. To S.& P., however, it falls four steps short of perfection, which is a grade of "aaa." (S.& P. uses lower-case letters for risk ratings, to distinguish them from its credit-quality rankings, which are expressed in upper-case letters.)
The top rating is given to funds defined by S.& P. as having "an extremely low sensitivity to changing market conditions." After that, the ratings symbols, designating increasing market risk, are "aa," "a," "bbb," "bb," "b" and the riskiest, "ccc," which refers to funds that are "highly speculative with currently identifiable risks."
The "aa" to "ccc" ratings may also carry a plus or minus sign to indicate lower or higher overall risk within categories.
WILLIAM N. SHIEBLER, president of Putnam Mutual Funds, has also opposed the S.& P. proposal. "This is not something like Morningstar, where every fund is judged," he noted. Unlike that Chicago-based fund-tracking and rating company, S.& P. charges funds to be included in its ratings. The annual tariff, which includes monthly monitoring as well as an initial assessment, is $25,000 for a company's first fund and $6,000 for each additional fund, said Michael Dorfsman, an S.& P. spokesman. The service has been purchased by only about 100 bond funds.
If S.& P. prevails, the funds would be free to publish their ratings in advertisements, much as funds do when they receive the top four- or five-star ratings from Morningstar Inc. The Morningstar ratings, which measure both return and risk, are, however, based only on historical data and have not been viewed as predictive by the N.A.S.D.
"The only reason to pay S.& P. for information you already know," said Don Phillips, president of Morningstar, "is so you can use it in your advertisements." By the same token, however, he said consumer acceptance of the ratings could persuade funds that they need to purchase them.
The greatest concern of the N.A.S.D., which sets the rules for fund advertising, has been that consumers will see the S.& P. ratings as predicting a fund's future behavior, which regulations prohibit. But S.& P. is now turning to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the N.A.S.D., to seek relief. It hired a former commissioner of the agency, Richard Y. Roberts, to press its case in Washington, and to good effect.
Barry Barbash, director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, noted in an interview last week that the S.E.C. chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., recently delivered a speech in which "he suggested that as a general principle more information was better, and he hoped the N.A.S.D. would be open-minded about the Standard & Poor's proposal."
The N.A.S.D. took the hint and agreed to a rehearing. It is accepting public comment until the end of February. Mr. Shiebler, a member of the N.A.S.D. panel evaluating the S.& P.'s proposal, said his past opposition was no guarantee of future resistance. "I'm not prepared to say how I'm going to vote on the new proposal," he said.
However the matter is decided, fund investors who are interested in the risks their bond managers are taking can usually find out by studying the portfolio's holdings and management's shareholder letter explaining its strategy. If the fund is not forthcoming with the information, or if the investor finds it unsettling, there are plenty of other funds to choose from. And that's precisely why fund companies look for potential marketing advantages, like a good S.& P. rating, in the first place.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Applauded, An Investor Steps Onto A New Stage

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON 

 BODY:
THE Profit Lomax Value fund was begun only in mid-November, but it has gotten off to an impressive start: through Thursday, it is ahead 5.6 percent, putting it in the top 25 percent of all growth-and income funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.
Longer-term observers of the fund's manager were not surprised. "Randall Eley is really out in front -- an outstanding investor," said Tony Chapelle, editor of Securities Pro, a monthly newsletter that reports on African-American professionals on Wall Street. Mr. Chapelle profiled Mr. Eley, who is based in Springfield, Va., last summer, after his 10-year-old firm, the Edgar Lomax Company, was cited in Nelson Publications' rankings of institutional money managers. 
 Mr. Eley's firm was the top-performing institutional money manager in the nation, among those investing in large-capitalization value stocks, for the one-year and three-year periods that ended last March. The firm's assets under management returned 41.0 percent for the year, and an annual average of 23.6 percent for the three years. The fund continues to perform solidly, ranking third in the same group for the three years through September, with a 21.1 percent annual average.
Mr. Eley's excellent performance led to the new no-load mutual fund, the Profit Lomax Value fund, part of a planned family and one of only a dozen with black managers, according to Mr. Chapelle. The fund's investment adviser is the Investor Resources Group, a firm in Chevy Chase, Md., started last February by Eugene Profit.
"The fund gives us a chance to gain access to a different market -- the individual retail market," Mr. Eley said.
Mr. Eley, 44, said he became interested in investing as a teen-ager and was always encouraged by his parents to start his own business. So after nine years as a securities lawyer in Omaha, he returned to his native Virginia in 1986 and started his company, named after his maternal grandfather. "I wanted to name it after my mother, Florence Lomax Eley, who was my first client, my first promoter, and who put by far the most money in, besides me," he said. "But she didn't want that."
The firm now manages $460 million, and its clients include Marriott International, the Florida State Board of Administration and pension funds for Baltimore and the District of Columbia.
MR. ELEY said his investment discipline consisted of scrutinizing the large companies of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. "We're looking for names that represent value, either in terms of a low price/earnings ratio, a high yield or a low price-to-book value," he said. "We differ from some value managers in that a stock doesn't have to meet all three criteria; any one of them will attract our interest."
After this initial screening has eliminated about half the potential universe of investment candidates, Edgar Lomax looks for situations in which Wall Street has seriously misunderstood, and therefore mispriced, a stock. Extreme misvaluations are uncommon; the fund currently has only 27 names in its portfolio. That means positions are very concentrated; the top 10 holdings represent 42 percent of the total.
In the case of AT&T, for example -- the sixth-largest holding at 4.1 percent -- Mr. Eley was attracted to the telecommunications giant's dividend yield, now 3.3 percent.
"This is a simple story," he said. "The S.& P. 500 for the first time in history is yielding less than 2 percent, so with AT&T you're looking at a 50 percent premium over the market."
The high yield represents a relatively low market price for the stock; it closed on Friday at $38.25. That is only 12 times the company's annual per-share earnings, calculated in the form preferred by Value Line, to reflect the last six months of reported profits and those forecast for the next six months. "We expect to make money simply from the price/earnings ratio expanding," Mr. Eley said, as the market realizes that competitive pressures in telecommunications are not so severe that AT&T can't continue to increase its profits.
Shares of Chevron -- the fund's fourth-largest holding, at 4.6 percent -- represent a different sort of value to Mr. Eley, although they are also trading at a price that produces a dividend yield of 3.2 percent.
"We are in a very overvalued stock market, and we are probably not, in the next year to year and a half, going to get the same kind of strong gains we've seen in the recent past," he said. "I'm not predicting a bear market, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a market that is flat, or slightly up."
In such an environment, the strong earnings of energy companies should make their shares increasingly attractive, Mr. Eley believes. He is not put off by Chevron's above-average price/earnings ratio, which is 26 on trailing 12-month earnings. Other value investors might feel that price is too high, but to Mr. Eley the value is relative. He said the energy sector "is our favorite this year," accounting for 19 percent of Edgar Lomax's assets under management, or nearly twice the group's market weighting.
May Department Stores represents yet another kind of value to Mr. Eley. Though it is not among the fund's biggest holdings, "it represents the set of stocks that form the bulk of our holdings -- the backbone of our portfolio," he said.
AT&T, Chevron and several other big stakes represent special situations, he explained. May Department Stores, on the other hand, is a stock simply overlooked by other investors. May's longer-term earnings growth, of 8.5 percent over the last 10 years, is not dazzling, but combined with a current yield of 2.5 percent it represents above-market growth at a below-market price of 16 times its earnings for the last year.
"We don't feel the investment community has fully recognized the value of the work this company's management is doing," he said. "We feel they're doing everything right." Retailing is under a cloud because Christmas sales were disappointing.
The economy of the Edgar Lomax Company, meanwhile, is looking stronger, and with it the demands on the time of Mr. Eley, its president, have been mounting.
"My dad started a couple of businesses, and all my life growing up he always talked about the greatness of starting and running a business of your own," he said. "He used to say, 'You can be your own boss,' and that's the only thing I've come to disagree with him about. I probably have more bosses now than I ever had."

HEADLINE: Promises to Keep: Rethinking the Future of Social Security

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
SOCIAL SECURITY may not be broke -- yet -- but there are already plenty of ideas about how to fix it.
The recent report from a Federal advisory panel of experts, who split into three factions because they were unable to agree on any full solution, only underscores the range of clashing views on one of the most vexing social and economic problems facing the nation. 
 For the debate over Social Security is not just about how to prevent the retirement system itself from running out of money, but also about much bigger questions: Do Americans spend too much and save too little? How much burden should the old impose on working generations? Is it better to continue the collective "all-for-one-and-one-for all" sense embodied in Social Security and other Government benefit programs, or should Americans be asked to assume more responsibility for their own needs?
None of these questions are easy to answer. And your perspective often depends on where you stand: the young tend to view matters differently from the old, and the comfortable see things in a different light than the afflicted. That is why The New York Times asked several prominent experts -- three from the Advisory Council on Social Security and three others representing varying viewpoints -- to make their cases. Their comments on the latest proposals to overhaul Social Security follow, inside this section.
To a large extent, Social Security is a victim of its own success. The basic quandary of the program is that the Government has promised to deliver trillions of dollars more to retirees and other beneficiaries over the next several decades than it can reasonably expect to collect in payroll taxes from workers. A crisis is not immediate: Social Security now takes in more than it pays out, with the extra money marked as a future obligation from the Treasury to the Social Security system.
But after 2012, the program is expected to start paying out more each year than it receives in tax revenues. In theory, Social Security could continue to call on the Treasury to redeem the obligations held in the Social Security trust fund through 2029, yet it is not clear today just how the Government will respond. Will it have to cut other programs, borrow more from the public or impose higher taxes to pay those bills? Regardless of what happens during the interim, Social Security would have to tap additional resources, reduce its benefits or come up with some combination of the two in order to remain in balance after 2029, according to official projections.
To overcome this problem, advocates split basically into two camps.
On one side are longtime supporters of Social Security and those representing the elderly and labor unions, who favor shoring up the existing pay-as-you-go system. They want to retain its essential character in which today's workers pay taxes to provide income for today's retirees because they believe that doing so sustains the commitment to a system built to encourage the haves to share their bounty with the have-nots. To keep it going, they are prepared to risk some of Social Security's assets in the stock market in hopes of painlessly generating higher revenues.
On the other side are those who argue that Social Security, in its current form, undermines the economy by discouraging Americans from saving more for the future. They want to limit its guaranteed benefits, saying that Social Security should be transformed into a hybrid public-private system that requires people to invest in advance for their own retirement.
Few in Washington expect action anytime soon. But that could be costly. Because the longer policy choices are delayed, the more abrupt and painful any changes are likely to be. TOM REDBURN
 
Benefit Cuts, Kind and Gentle
EDWARD M. GRAMLICH, dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Policy and chairman of the Advisory Council on Social Security.
In trying to reform Social Security, I am guided by three goals. The first is to retain the important social protections of this program that has worked so well for 60 years. The second is to make these social protections affordable by bringing Social Security back into long-term financial balance. It is not in balance now. The third is to add new national savings for retirement -- both to help individuals maintain their own standards of living in retirement and to build up the nation's capital stock in advance of the baby boom retirement crunch.
In the recently released report of the Advisory Council, I have introduced a compromise proposal, the Individual Accounts Plan, that tries to achieve all three goals. I would preserve the important social protections of Social Security and still achieve long-term financial balance through what might be called kind and gentle benefit cuts. Most of the cuts would be felt by high-wage workers, with disabled and low-wage workers being largely protected from the cuts. Similarly to the other two proposals offered by Advisory Council members, the I.A.P. would involve some technical changes, like including all new hires of state and local government.
Then, beginning in the 21st century, there would be a slight increase in the normal retirement age for all workers and a slight reduction in the growth of Social Security benefits for high-wage workers. Both changes would be phased in very gradually to avoid actual benefit cuts for present retirees and "notches" in the benefit schedule -- instances in which younger workers get lower real benefits than older workers with the same earnings records.
These adjustments would result in a modest reduction in the overall growth of real Social Security benefits. When combined with the rising number of retirees, the share of the economy's annual output devoted to Social Security spending would be approximately the same as at present, eliminating this part of the impending explosion in future entitlement spending.
These benefit cuts alone would mean that high-wage workers would not experience rising real benefits as their real wages grew. So I would supplement these changes with another measure to raise overall retirement (and national) savings. All workers would be required to contribute an extra 1.6 percent of their pay to new individual accounts.
These accounts would be owned by workers but centrally managed. Workers would be able to allocate their funds among 5 to 10 broad mutual funds covering stocks and bonds. Central management of the funds would cut down the risk that funds would be invested unwisely, would cut administrative costs and would mean that Wall Street firms would not reap a financial bonanza. The funds would be converted to real annuities on retirement, to protect against inflation and the chance that retirees would overspend in their early retirement years.
Together, these changes would mean that approximately the presently scheduled level of benefits would be paid to all wage classes of workers, of all ages. The difference is that this plan would mean that these benefits would be affordable; under present law, they are not.
The changes would eliminate the system's long-term financial deficit while holding together the important retirement safety net that Social Security provides. But the changes do move beyond the present pay-as-you-go financing plan by building up the nation's capital stock in advance of the baby boom retirement crunch.
 
Turning Workers Into Investors
CAROLYN WEAVER, director of Social Security and pension studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a member of the Advisory Council.
Social Security is in trouble again. An infusion of $3.1 trillion, we are told, is required to keep benefit checks going out in the long range -- assuming we don't experience any more "adverse" economic or demographic shocks, like living longer than expected. This cash infusion could be met by a payroll tax increase of about one percentage point, on average, every decade over the next 70 years. Alternatively, benefits for middle- and high-wage workers who retire after the turn of the century could be reduced by 25 percent to 30 percent.
If cash-flow deficits were all that ailed the system, the situation would be difficult enough. But it is actually more serious. Since Social Security basically operates on a pay-as-you-go basis -- with income roughly equal to outgo -- it holds few assets against accruing liabilities.
This has two important implications. First, Social Security can now offer younger workers an average real rate of return on their taxes of no more than 1 percent to 2 percent, the real rate of growth of wages. That is substantially below the real return of private capital investment. Cuts in benefits and increases in taxes can only aggravate these poor returns and undermine political support among young workers.
Second, even if the deficits were closed, Social Security would have an enormous unfunded liability. The current $550 billion reserve fund is a mere 5 percent of the estimated $9 trillion to $11 trillion in net benefits that Social Security has promised to current workers and retirees. This "off the books" liability, or implicit debt, is fully double the Government's explicit debt of about $5 trillion.
The fundamental economic problem with financing Social Security in this way -- through income transfers from younger to older generations -- is that it depresses savings and investment, resulting in a lower capital stock, lower real wages and less national income than there would otherwise be. Workers -- and society, more generally -- have forgone the opportunity to invest in real private capital and to earn the higher return it affords.
While it is too late to recover the income lost as a result of the Government's past decisions, it is not too late to halt the losses caused by the continued growth of these promises. The Personal Security Accounts Plan that I support would sharply curtail the growth of future unfunded liabilities, while transforming Social Security into a straightforward retirement savings program backed by a Government safety net. The benefits to American workers, and to their children and grandchildren, would be very large.
The P.S.A. plan would gradually replace one-half of our pay-as-you-go retirement program with a system of personal accounts that would be owned and invested by workers and managed by the financial institutions of their choice. Workers would receive a rebate of part of their taxes for investment in their P.S.A.'s, allowing workers at all earning levels to begin accumulating real wealth. The balance of the retirement program would gradually be converted to a flat benefit, set at a level that would insure all full-career workers -- those who work all or most of their adult lives, low- and high-wage alike -- a base level of retirement income at or above the poverty level.
Under this plan, digging out from Social Security's debt while continuing to provide basically full benefits for current retirees and older workers would involve significant transition costs. It would require a supplemental payroll tax of 1.5 percent (or equivalent spending reductions) over a 70-year period, substantial reductions in long-range spending, and new -- explicit -- Federal borrowing. Despite these transition costs, this plan, when compared with the alternatives, holds the greatest promise for increasing national saving and expanding economic output over the long haul.
The benefits of the P.S.A. plan are not limited to increasing national saving. Under reasonable assumptions, single workers and two-earner couples are expected to fare better than they would under either of the other plans or a shored-up pay-as-you-go system. Younger workers stand to gain the most. In addition, workers and families would be directly involved in the financial decisions that will affect their own future well-being. While workers would take on financial risks, they would gain ownership of their P.S.A.'s and shed some of the political risks attached to Government benefit promises 20, 30 or 40 years down the road.
Critics decry the idea of workers managing their own accounts -- somewhat surprising in a nation with extensive experience with 401(k) plans and various mutual funds, not to mention the most sophisticated financial markets in the world. But what is the alternative? With literally trillions of dollars at stake, it is essential that our investment policy be structured so that workers' taxes are actually saved and invested for the future, rather than spent on current consumption, and that the allocation of capital in the economy is shielded from political manipulation.
Those of us who support the P.S.A. plan believe that securing Social Security in the decades ahead will take more than the traditional "nip and tuck" changes. Creating a system of real value to younger workers requires reforms that create real wealth, bolster expected returns and lessen the political risks attached to the Government's long-term promises.
 
First, the System Is Hardly in Crisis
ROBERT M. BALL, former Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and a member of the Advisory Council.
The difficulty of balancing Social Security over the next 75 years is being greatly exaggerated. There is no need to make major cuts in promised benefits or to make major increases in contribution rates. And certainly there is no need to substitute uncertain returns from individual savings accounts for part of the basic Social Security system. There is, in short, no need to panic.
Here are the facts:
* It is estimated that without changing present law, full benefits can be paid on time until 2029.
* After 2029, without changing present law, 77 percent of benefits could still be paid -- and even after the end of the 75-year projection, 70 percent of benefits could be paid.
* Common-sense adjustments -- several of which are desirable in any event -- would make full benefits payable on time through 2050 and reduce the 75-year deficit from the present estimated 2.17 percent of payroll to 0.80 percent of payroll.
* This remaining deficit can be eliminated in several ways, and there is ample time to evaluate the options calmly. A system in balance until 2050 is hardly in crisis.
The common-sense changes we support should be made promptly. They include improving the accuracy of the cost-of-living adjustments; taxing the Social Security benefits that exceed what the worker paid in, just as other private and public contributory defined-benefit pension plans are taxed today, and making Social Security universal by covering new hires in some 3.7 million full-time state and local government jobs not now under Social Security.
It would also be necessary to either cut the benefits of future recipients modestly, by an average of 3 percent, or increase the contribution rate by three-tenths of a percentage point on employers and employees combined. And we need to correct an anomoly in the allocation of Social Security taxes to the Medicare program.
As stated above, these modest steps would bring the 75-year deficit down to eight-tenths of 1 percent of payroll. In considering how to bring Social Security into complete balance and how to improve the return people get on what they pay in, there is no reason to put a part of Social Security's promised benefits at risk by substituting private individual investment accounts for basic benefits. If we want to improve the return on Social Security contributions by investing in stocks -- rather than putting all the accumulated funds in long-term Government bonds as is now the case -- the Social Security Administration could do this directly. That would be a much safer and more prudent approach.
The idea of Social Security investing, say, as much as 40 percent of its accumulating funds in passively managed stocks indexed to the broad market is certainly worth considering. Through the higher returns expected on the investments in the stock market, the program could come fully into balance and would not compromise any of the principles that have been so successful over the last 60 years in greatly reducing poverty among the elderly and forming the foundation on which just about all Americans build protection for their retirement years.
We recommend for immediate actionthe common-sense changes advocated by the six Advisory Council members backing the Maintenance of Benefits Plan. And we recommend for further study the proposal to directly invest a portion of Social Security funds in stocks. Such actions protect Social Security and avoid the major uncertainties of the individual investment accounts advocated by some council members.
With our approach, there would be no need for an increase in the payroll tax of more than one-and-a-half percentage points beginning in 1998. (To finance the system beyond 75 years, we do recommend such an increase, but not until 2045.)
There would be no need to cut Social Security's defined benefit plan by 30 percent, as in the Individual Accounts Plan, a proposal that is based on the hope that the return from individual investments would on average make up for the cut. There would be no need to borrow $2 trillion from the Federal Government and greatly increase the Federal deficit and debt, as called for in the Personal Security Accounts Plan. Over time, that approach would abolish Social Security as we know it and substitute a flat benefit of $410 a month (increased in line with average wages), supplemented by whatever the individual might earn from a compulsory savings plan.
We do not believe that the Advisory Council has produced three acceptable choices. It has produced just one; the other two plans would be high-risk, high-cost gambles.
 
Paying for Yourself, And for Your Parents
PETER G. PETERSON, chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment banking firm, and the author of "Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old?" (Random House).
I have come to believe that the best way to evaluate any Social Security reform proposal, including those now placed on the table by the Advisory Council, is to focus on four bottom-line tests.
Does the proposal add to the publicly held federal debt?
We are told repeatedly that Social Security can pay every penny of promised benefits through 2029. This "solvency" rests on the fiction that trust fund surpluses accumulated in prior years will alleviate the burden that Americans must face in future years. They won't. The assets held by Social Security consist of nothing but Treasury i.o.u.'s. When it comes time for the trust funds to redeem them, Congress must raise taxes, cut other spending, or borrow more from the public -- that is, turn the trust fund paper i.o.u.'s into real i.o.u.'s.
What matters is the annual difference between Social Security's outlays and its earmarked tax revenues. Under current law, this operating balance is due to turn negative in 2012 and widen to an annual deficit of $650 billion by 2029, the last year the trust funds are "solvent." By 2040, this annual deficit would hit $1.2 trillion. This level of Government borrowing is obviously unsustainable.
Does the proposal increase payroll taxes?
To pay promised benefits without adding to the debt, taxes will have to increase to an astounding 17 percent to 22 percent of payroll by 2040. (The current payroll tax is 12.4 percent on earnings up to $65,400.) Add in the still more daunting costs of Social Security's sister program, Medicare, and the tax burden will rise to 35 to 55 percent of payroll. Even the lower figure would kill the economy -- not to mention the taxpayer.
The fact that health-benefit spending is growing so fast makes Social Security reform all the more urgent if we are to afford the metastasizing health care costs of an aging population. The apologists for the Social Security status quo disagree. They prefer to think of each benefit program as an isolated problem. As they see it, Americans won't mind paying a stupefying total tax burden as long as many different Government agencies are collecting and spending the money.
Tax increases also raise the issue of payback fairness. Most of today's elderly are getting back much more than the market value of their prior contributions. Younger Americans know that, in the next century, most of them will be big "market losers" -- even if the current system were sustainable. Any reform that merely raises taxes will worsen the system's cascading pattern of generational inequity.
Does the proposal increase national savings?
More national savings make possible more investment and more economic growth, which in turn makes public benefits more affordable. Moreover, to the extent that households save more, Americans will become less dependent on public benefits to meet their retirement needs. The latter point is crucial. Fewer than half of private-sector workers have a pension, and the median net financial assets of adults in their late 50's -- when workers are staring straight at retirement -- is a paltry $12,000.
If an overhaul merely shifts part of current Social Security tax revenue into the stock market, it will simply force the Government to borrow that much more. If the proposal assumes that stocks will do much better than bonds, then presumably those buying the additional bonds will do less well. This is a zero-sum game. We must increase savings to make us all better off in the long run.
Does the proposal take full account of any transition costs?
Privatizers want to revoke the pay-as-you-go chain letter and require each generation to save for its own retirement. I, too, favor a system of personally owned, portable and fully financed retirement accounts -- combined with a reformed Social Security system that provides a durable safety net.
But there is no escaping the brute fact that today's workers would have to consume less and save more to prefund their own retirement since, at the same time, they would have to keep paying for their parents' benefits. These transition costs are huge. To be fair and realistic, many retired parents -- those who can afford it -- will have to forgo some of the Social Security benefits they are now receiving. That is why I recommend three gradual, humane and, I believe, reasonable reforms to reduce costs:
 * Increase the retirement age to 70 over the next 20 years.
 * Reduce each year's cost-of-living adjustment by at least one-half of a percentage point.
* Progressively reduce all entitlement benefits to upper-income households (what I call an "affluence test").
The first proposal of the Advisory Council -- the Maintenance of Benefits Plan -- fails the first three tests. Since it doesn't include any transition to a new system, the fourth test does not apply. The council's other two proposals are more promising, though not perfect. The Personal Security Accounts Plan, for instance, adds to the public debt, thus neutralizing some of its boost to private savings. Still, the P.S.A. plan has the great merit of confronting the real issue framing today's debate, which is not how to meet some technical solvency test but how to insure Social Security's economic sustainability and generational equity.
 
Deep Thinking, Not Quick Fixes
JOHN ROTHER, director of legislation and public policy for the American Association of Retired Persons.
A financially secure retirement for all generations will require reform in pensions, savings and Social Security. But as we debate these reforms, we must not ignore the needs of American families.
Any discussion of reform should begin with the recognition that Social Security is not in crisis. It can pay full benefits on time until 2029, and thereafter it still has sufficient revenue to pay about 75 percent of the benefits promised under current law without increasing payroll taxes. But, as we have done before, we must address Social Security's longer-term problems to keep it strong for the future. Waiting too long to act means even more significant changes will be needed later. People will have less time to adjust.
Each of the three plans put forward by the Advisory Council includes investing some Social Security money in the private market instead of exclusively in Government securities. Many regard this change as revolutionary, but far more radical is the concept of substantially replacing Social Security with individual investment accounts.
This go-it-alone approach means income security would depend on individual investment skills, luck, the health of the markets and the ability to accumulate sufficient assets to maintain a reasonable living standard throughout retirement. Such uncertainties are a problem, particularly for low- and moderate-income families, who have less to invest, who pay proportionately higher fees and who have limited ability to diversify their portfolios to shield against market downturns.
The cost of financing the transition from the current system to individual accounts would mean higher taxes or additional Federal borrowing, or both. One generation would pay twice -- once for its parents and grandparents, and again for itself.
Social Security was never intended as an investment program or as a stand-alone pension. It works because individuals pool their contributions and share the risks and the benefits -- the basis of a social insurance approach. It is designed to help assure an adequate basis for family economic security throughout an individual's life. That is why the benefit formula helps low-wage workers, why workers with dependents receive family benefits and why disability insurance is provided.
The Advisory Council's differences are significant, but the areas of agreement are instructive and encouraging. The council emphasizes Social Security's ongoing importance. All three factions agree on continuing basic features like employee/employer contributions and universal participation, providing benefits to all contributors, and full benefit adjustments for inflation determined by technical experts, not politicians. They reject means-testing, or limiting benefits for those with higher incomes, and they reject legislating reductions in calculating the Consumer Price Index.
Means-testing of benefits is inconsistent with a fundamental tenet of the program -- that retirement benefits are earned based on contributions -- and would greatly weaken future public support. Political reductions by fiat to the C.P.I., on the theory that the index is inherently flawed and exaggerates inflation, would make beneficiaries poorer in real terms as they age.
The debate should begin with a close examination of the impact of reforms on families, the nation and the economy. Social Security's essential role creates a moral imperative that we insure its viability for future generations. The program is strongly supported by Americans of all ages, has always paid benefits on time and keeps 15 million beneficiaries of all ages out of poverty. More than 44 million people receive benefits -- one-quarter of them under age 65. About four million are children.
The American Association of Retired Persons hopes a national dialogue will lead to pragmatic steps that strengthen the program and improve the economic well-being of future generations. Social Security must continue as the base of family income security. Pensions and individual investments should complement, not replace, Social Security. Now is the time for thoughtful and careful steps to insure Social Security's future, not for quick fixes. Let's make sure we keep the "security" in Social Security.
 
Generation X Sees An Unfair Burden
RICHARD THAU, executive director of Third Millennium, a nonpartisan, Manhattan-based advocacy group begun by and for Americans born after 1960.
Many young adults view Social Security with an odd combination of confusion and contempt: How is it that the Federal Government's largest program, which consumes thousands of dollars of their annual income, is scheduled to become insolvent at the very moment they will need it most?
Until this question is addressed, Social Security is very likely to face a crisis of sinking confidence among the young. This is no idle point, because Generation Xers, people in their 20's and early 30's, will be asked to foot the bill for the baby boom generation that precedes them. If they balk, the system could come to a screeching halt, with perilous consequences.
Although people in this demographic group recognize how vital Social Security is to their grandparents, they do not possess a deep attachment to it. To them, F.I.C.A. is just another tax on their pay stub, not the Federal Insurance Contributions that the acronym stands for. Moreover, this generation was not around during Social Security's developmental phase, and as today's young adults came of age they were never asked whether they wanted to participate in this particular compact among generations. Now, as they learn the strengths and weaknesses of the existing social contract, most 20- and 30-somethings recognize that it needs to be renegotiated, not scrapped.
Social Security represents a terrific deal for today's seniors, but could become a raw deal for the young. A typical single male worker born in 1915 who earned an average wage paid $51,000 in aggregate Social Security taxes during his working life and received a generous $90,200 in benefits (both figures in 1993 dollars), according to Eugene Steuerle and Jon Bakija of the Urban Institute. That worker's single, average-earning grandson, born in 1965, is currently expected to pay $195,800 in Social Security taxes and receive just $139,600 in benefits (also in 1993 dollars), the Urban Institute researchers found.
Aware that one's elders nearly doubled their Social Security "investments," why should any young adult consent to a projected $56,200 loss over a working lifetime?
Given this dismal forecast, it is particularly unreasonable for some putative reformers to deny young people the chance for a positive return, and to instead suggest a 2.2 percent F.I.C.A. tax increase to keep the system solvent. Even if this increase saved the system (and it wouldn't; the Trust Fund would have to contain real assets, not Treasury i.o.u.'s, for the math to work), it would prove onerous to workers, particularly lower-wage earners with young families.
For the record, the proposed 2.2 percent F.I.C.A. hike would mean an additional $550 above the $3,100 in combined employer and employee annual payroll taxes already paid by a family earning $25,000 -- and would do nothing to increase the return. This would make a lousy deal even more costly.
To fix Social Security, Third Millennium has recommended -- in repeated Congressional testimony -- several reforms. The Government should introduce an affluence test on benefits for wealthier retirees, based on a sliding scale that exempts the poor; it should raise the official retirement age to 70 over the next two decades, and the law should be changed to enable workers to redirect a portion of current Social Security taxes into private accounts, as a number of Advisory Council members recommended.
Surveys by Third Millennium and others have shown overwhelming support by Americans for greater personal control over their F.I.C.A. contributions. This has been recognized by a handful of visionary political leaders -- including Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican, and Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles W. Stenholm, the Texas Democrat -- who are working in their respective chambers to build bipartisan consensus for substantive reforms. But to be successful, they ultimately will need the help of the primary builder of the bridge to the 21st century, Bill Clinton, who undoubtedly knows it makes no sense to drive across that bridge in an Edsel.

Chart: "RESCUING SOCIAL SECURITY"
The 13 members of a Federal advisory council recently put forth three plans to enable Social Security to meet its obligations in the years ahead. They agreed that benefits must be trimmed, that the retirement age should be pushed back, that state and local government workers should be required.
But they split sharply over whether to continue the pay-as-you-go system, in which today's workers basically pay benefits to current retirees, or to move closer to a true pension system in which workers are required to put aside money in advance for their own retirement.
In addition to the three proposals from the panel, others have suggested a variety of fixes for Social Security, including an immediate payroll tax increase, significantly lower cost-of-living adjustments and strict limits on benefits for more affluent retirees.
Here are the important differences among the three major proposals.
 
MAINTAIN BENEFITS PLAN: Keeps the pay-as-you-go system. To help pay future benefits, the Government would consider putting up to 40 percent of the Social Security trust funds in the stock market. Advocated by Robert M. Ball and one other member of the panel. Higher taxes would be needed later.
 
INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS PLAN: Serves as a middle ground between the two other plans. In addition to the current 12.4 percent payroll tax, workers would pay a 1.6 percent payroll tax that would go into their individual accounts, managed by the Government. People would choose from limited options, including stock investments. Advocated by Edward Gramlich and one other member of the panel.
 
PERSONAL SECURITY ACCOUNTS PLAN: Turns over much of the resources and responsibility for retirement to individuals. Diverts 5 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax into personal accounts, which could be invested through a wide variety of private channels. An increase of 1.5 percent in the payroll tax and additional borrowing would help finance the transition to the new system. Advocated by Carolyn Weaver and four others on the panel.

INVESTIGATIONS
I Led Six or Seven Lives
Remember "I Led Three Lives"? Well, the patriot/spy/patriot in that convoluted, zealously anti-Communist 50's TV drama led a bland life indeed compared with Mark E. Whitacre. Mr. Whitacre, you may recall, was in the thick of things when the Archer Daniels Midland price-fixing case blew open a few years ago. Just look at all his starring roles: First he was a loyal employee shocked -- shocked! -- at Archer's misdeeds. It quickly turned out he'd also been an F.B.I. informant, but the patriotic veneer wore thin when he acknowledged getting money improperly from Archer accounts overseas. Then, yet again, he joined the Government's side -- but a year later turned around and sued the F.B.I. agent in the case. (Exhausted yet? Read on.) To back up this final accusations, he produced documents that painted the F.B.I. as the villain -- but last week he admitted he'd fabricated some of those documents. He sought care for manic depression and was indicted on charges of defrauding the company. Sounds like a mini-series.
 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING
Medicaid Alert: Never Mind
A year ago, when crusading Republicans shut down part of the Government in that nasty budget battle, one big sticking point was growth in Medicaid spending. Republicans at one point wanted to slash $70 billion out of that growth over six years, but the White House would have none of that. With the flick of a statistic last week, though, that $70 billion -- and more -- vanished from the ledger. The Congressional Budget Office now says Medicaid spending will rise an average of just 7.8 percent a year through aught-two, not the more dire 9.7 percent the agency predicted six months ago, which would have meant $86 billion more spending. Why the rosier outlook? Mainly, the agency is now assuming that inflation will stay minor, and that more of the poor will use managed care.
 
RIGHTS, CIVIL
Accentuating the Affirmative
Affirmative action? No affirmative action? This is no longer a debate for the timid, the unorganized or the unincorporated. Not by a long shot. On a single day last week, two forces on opposite ends of the country institutionalized their fiercely held -- and opposite -- positions. In Sacramento, the people who persuaded Californians to vote for Proposition 209 -- which a Federal judge has squelched, for now -- formed something called the American Civil Rights Institute. This group, led by Ward Connerly, plans to fight affirmative action on the national front. And in New York, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson announced that he would open an office on Wall Street to do exactly the opposite -- pressure companies to hire and promote more workers from minority groups. Drivers, start your engines.
 
AMERICA UNPLUGGED
Off Line, and Fed Up
Oh, the glories of the on-line age! E-mail with a click of a mouse. The Internet's wonders at your fingertips. All you have to do is spend all your waking hours, your cyber-frustration rising with your megabytes, trying to sign on to America Online. Ever since the company began its unlimited-time pricing in December, users -- surprise! -- have flooded to their screens. The average member is on line 32 minutes a day now, up from 14 in September. But so many say they can't get on in the first place that the class-action suits and complaints are fast and thick. (An existential dilemma: How do you send an E-mail complaint if you can't sign on?) Last week, America Online moved to try to relieve the digital gridlock, but all it could do was suspend advertising and add more agents to field irate calls. It can't make a big dent in the capacity problem, it said, until late spring. Don't throw out your envelopes and your encyclopedias (you know: the ones that go on shelves) just yet.
 
SHOPPING
It's Tax-Free, and Legal
Even now, two powerful human urges are slamming smack into each other in New York State. First, no shoppers in their right minds want to set foot in a clothing store at the end of January. Memories of December's excess are too fresh, and bloated charge-card bills sit menacingly on the desk -- forget it! On the other hand, never underestimate humankind's passionate desire to avoid taxes. Retailers and state officials hope that second urge will win out. Starting yesterday, for one week, the state is collecting no sales tax on clothing items up to $500 -- and New York City is skipping its tax, too. It's all part of an experiment in the long-running debate about the impact of all those shoppers who flee local stores to avoid high taxes. Tax foes insist that shoppers will buy enough food, and pay for enough transportation, to more than make up the difference. We'll see. The city alone will lose an estimated $7 million in tax revenues this week.
 
MEXICO
Profitable Neighbor
Politicians of every stripe were patting themselves on the back last week after Mexico -- three years ahead of schedule -- repaid the last of the $12.5 billion Washington lent it two years ago. For Bill Clinton, of course, and for Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, it was a huge gamble that paid huge dividends, both political and financial. Even Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who had fought the bailout, grudgingly acknowledged being "pleased" -- then gave the credit to "vigilant Congressional oversight." But wait a second. The bailout, labeled a magnanimous gesture, was awfully good business, too. Washington earned a tidy half-billion dollars on the deal -- Mexico paid up early only because the interest rates were so high. And what of the Mexican people? The austerity program that was part of the deal cost them jobs, homes, businesses. Good neighbor, indeed.
 
THE ART OF LUXURY
Trumprification
Brace yourself. Any day now, your doorbell will ring, and there, stomping against the cold, will stand Donald J. Trump. "Good morning," he might say. "I'd like to buy your house, sheathe it in something glitzy like bronze-tinted glass and sell it back to you for three times the price. Oh, and put my name on it, of course." "Huh?" you say, rubbing your eyes in disbelief. But he might get his way. Like an aluminum-siding salesman run amok, Mr. Trump is going around the city working his glittering magic. Trump Tower. Trump Parc (not, of course, "Park"). Trump International Hotel and Condominium. And last week came word that Mr. Trump has agreed to put his inimitable stamp on the St. Moritz, on Central Park South, turning it into luxury condos. A footnote: Mr. Trump bought the same hotel in the mid-80's from, among others, some folks named Helmsley for $72 million, selling it soon after for $180 million. A question: just how many buyers are there for multimillion-dollar condos?
 
TOBACCO WARS
He Blew Doubts Away
The great tobacco wars, which have escalated mightily in the mid-90's, began with a bang one day in 1964 -- the day, of course, when that ashtray-shattering Surgeon General's report came out. That's when the tobacco industry began its tireless campaign to deny what that report stated: smoking's link to cancer. And who did the most to establish that link? A pathologist named Oscar Auerbach, who pored over thousands of slides of human tissue from smokers and nonsmokers and found a statistical correlation with those who got cancer. Dr. Auerbach, who can be credited with saving thousands of lives, died last week at 92.

Crime Fighting's About-face

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
IN the face of America's vast crime problem, liberals and conservatives have long clashed over the causes of lawlessness and what to do about it.
For liberals, crime must be traced to its roots in poverty, joblessness and racism, deep-seated social and economic ills. Nonsense, conservatives counter, the origins are cultural, stemming from the decline of the family along with the rise of welfare dependency, single motherhood and a permissive social ethos. One thing both sides agree on: there is little the police can do to reduce crime. 
 Taken together, these views add up to the conventional wisdom about crime that has prevailed for 20 years or more. Without profound changes in society, there isn't much anyone can do about crime in this country.
Suddenly, new facts have turned this accepted wisdom on its head. For five years, reported crime, especially murder, has been dropping sharply even though the economic plight of the inner cities and the disarray in poor families remain the same. This decline is the longest in 25 years, and when the final figures for 1996 are in, it is likely that the national homicide rate will fall to its lowest level since the 1960's, when an explosion of violence triggered America's modern crime problem.
No one really knows why crime is dropping.
"This is a humbling time for all crime analysts," said John J. DiIulio Jr., a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University. "It is a puzzlement."
Still, a remarkably optimistic new view of crime prevention is emerging among experts, and their revised consensus suggests that law enforcement may make a critical difference after all, through innovative and concerted police strategies on guns, teen-agers and petty crimes. Call this the management approach.
At the same time, another new theory gaining adherents is that fighting crime is like combatting an epidemic whose pattern of infection doesn't follow a tidy mathematical progression.
"Acts of violence lead to further acts of violence, creating a contagion effect and a sudden jump in crime rates that is hard to explain," said John Laub, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University. This may be what happened when the advent of crack cocaine in the mid-1980's produced a sudden, huge increase in violence.
Epidemiologists term this dramatic escalation the "tipping point." Fortunately, the same effect applies once enough measures are taken to contain the epidemic, even though the measures, by themselves, seem far less ambitious than previous efforts to attack crime at its roots.
William J. Bratton, the former New York City Police Commissioner who is credited with introducing some of the successful new law enforcement strategies, said, "I think we are now at another one of those tipping points, only on the way down."
Preliminary F.B.I. data for 1996, released this month, seem to support Mr. Bratton and underscore how mistaken the old wisdom about crime now appears. The biggest decreases in serious and violent crime last year came in the nation's largest cities, precisely those areas where traditional criminology predicted crimes would be the worst.
In the past five years, murders in New York have fallen by 50 percent, to 984 in 1996 from 1,995 in 1992. The rate also dropped in other big cities where the police have adopted new tactics: in Houston by 49 percent, Chicago by 16 percent and Boston by 62 percent.
It is difficult to overstate how different the new view of policing is. As recently as 1990, Travis Hirschi, an influential criminologist, in a book titled "A General Theory of Crime" (Stanford University Press), wrote, "No evidence exists that augmentation of police forces or equipment, differential patrol strategies or differential intensities of surveillance have any effect on crime rates."
The seeds of the new approach were sown by Mr. Bratton when he took charge of the New York City Transit Authority police in 1990. Following the advice of George Kelling, a criminologist, Mr. Bratton instituted a program of trying to head off more serious crimes by cracking down on minor ones like turnstile-jumping and panhandling. Later, as commissioner, Mr. Bratton added further elements to his management strategy, using computer-generated statistics to target crime hot spots and making his subordinates responsible for reaching crime-reduction goals, the way a businessman demands increased profits.
But, cautioned James Q. Wilson, a professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles, improved police work is not the whole story. In Los Angeles, Professor Wilson said, "the police may not be part of the story at all," since murders have dropped there by 37 percent over the past five years despite poor police leadership, bad morale and a decline in arrests.
Instead, Professor Wilson said, it is important to note that the adult homicide rate has been declining since 1981, and that the only reason the homicide rate rose in the late 1980's was that juvenile violence tripled with the advent of crack. This form of cocaine brought youths into the drug trade and created a demand for automatic handguns. Many teen-agers suddenly wanted a gun for safety or prestige.
Unlike adult crime, teen-age crime "follows a fad-like pattern, where the changes come quickly," Professor Wilson said. Just as teen-agers' tastes in clothing are driven by trends, so was their jump into crack culture. But when they saw the cost in death, hospitalization and prison time, many turned away, he said.
Geoffrey Canada, the president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families in Harlem, who counsels poor children, said he has witnessed a change among 14-, 15- and 16-year-olds in the past five years. The toll of death in their families, tougher police tactics and stepped-up efforts by neighborhood groups to combat violence have combined to reduce involvement in the drug trade.
The drug market is still there, Mr. Canada said, but it is more stable now, back in the hands of older people who treat it like a business.
"When you had 15-year-olds selling crack, they were wild cowboys who shot off their guns if somebody dissed them," he said.
There are several other possible explanations for the decline in murder. The development of hospital trauma centers has saved more gunshot victims from death. The ban on assault weapons and the Brady law, requiring a five-day waiting period to purchase a handgun, have made it harder for criminals to obtain guns. Longer prison sentences have removed some career criminals from the streets, though the threat of longer sentences may not actually deter crime.
Given this plenitude of possible causes, it may be that "this is a case where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts," said Jeffrey Fagan, the director of the Center for Violence Research and Prevention at Columbia University.
 
 
 
Homicide Isn't Human Nature
 This, said Professor Fagan, would also fit in the epidemiological theory of a "tipping point," where a number of small factors help reduce the epidemic faster than can be logically explained.
There is no guarantee, of course, that the drop in murder will last just because it has declined for five years. Some experts are worried that the rapidly rising popularity of methamphetamines, or speed, in the Southwest may turn it into something like crack was in the mid-1980's, an unforeseen catalyst that drives up crime rates. But the recent decrease does illustrate an important point that often gets forgotten in the shrill public debate over crime: there is nothing immutable in human nature about homicide.
Roger Lane, a historian at Haverford College, calculates the murder rate in England in the 13th and 14th centuries was at least 20 to 25 per 100,000, two to three times the 1995 American rate of 8 per 100,000.
Most of these murders took place in the countryside, where peasants, who drank beer as a daily beverage, carried knives for eating and quarterstaffs for walking on muddy roads. Quarrels between neighbors escalated into violence, with no legal authority to settle disputes.
"Whatever your prejudices, there were no guns, no blacks, no cities larger than Kokomo, Ind.," said Professor Lane, the author of a forthcoming book, "Murder in America: A History" (Ohio State University Press). "Religion, tradition, the community and attachment to the family were all powerful," he said, and hanging was the penalty for any felony.
While some criminologists remain skeptical that the current decline in crime can continue without fundamental economic and social changes, Felton Earls, a professor of child psychiatry at the Harvard School of Public Health, says he believes improved police work may help troubled neighborhoods.
"This could be the leading edge of greater change," said Professor Earls, "because reduced crime brings local neighborhood life under better control."

Speaking Softly In the Bully Pulpit

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS he approaches his second swearing-in, Bill Clinton, that avid student of history, has been rummaging through the second-term inaugural addresses of Presidents past and thinking about junctures in American history when a leader helped transform the nation.
Great Presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln and great moments of change in society most often come out of the crucible of war or economic turmoil, Mr. Clinton has told his aides. But sometimes a peacetime President can seize the moment. And for at least a year now, Mr. Clinton has been turning for inspiration to Theodore Roosevelt, the roughriding Republican trustbuster from Oyster Bay, L.I. 
 He has praised Roosevelt in speeches as a man who moved the country into the future. He quoted Roosevelt when he designated a swath of Utah's red rock country as a national monument. Riding his campaign train last summer, Mr. Clinton even called Roosevelt "one of my favorite Presidents ever."
Roosevelt has many points of appeal for Mr. Clinton. He became President after the turn of the century, when an agrarian nation was being shaken by industrialization -- a time Mr. Clinton has often called analogous to this moment at the edge of a millennium, when America is making the transition from industrialism to the global information age.
Roosevelt also was an activist who had an expansive view of executive power, a leader who made powerful use of what he called the President's "bully pulpit." Faced with a Republican Congress, Mr. Clinton, too, has become ever more interested in the oratorical potential in his office.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said recently that in the next term, the President will be looking beyond just working with Congress. "A lot of his work goes to the use of the bully pulpit, to his work with the American people to talk about the things that we can do together to address some of the problems we face," Mr. McCurry said.
Yet Mr. Clinton has shied away from his role model's unbridled assaults on the status quo. By his nature, Mr. Clinton tries to smooth over conflict, not provoke it. His preaching, says Wayne Fields, the director of Washington University's Center for the Study of American Culture, is of the "I'm O.K., you're O.K." school. It is not designed to pain the powerful.
Roosevelt, in contrast, gave little oratorical quarter to the corporate interests of his day, though at times his actions were more measured than his words. His speeches were designed to force Congress to support his program of business regulation, or to assure the public that the President was as powerful as the great corporate trusts. He accused "predatory wealth" of blocking his program to help the working man. He lambasted the judiciary, saying it had failed "to stop the abuses of the criminal rich."
Roosevelt explained the need for securities regulation, for income and inheritance taxes, for guarantees that workers have "a larger share of the wealth." By his second term, he found it harder to sway Congress, but he changed the national debate and prepared the way for social legislation by his successors.
Some members of Mr. Clinton's party almost seem to be trying to goad the President into being more like Roosevelt. On his way out of office, Robert E. Reich, Mr. Clinton's first-term Labor Secretary, spoke out against the breakdown of the implicit social compact of the post-World War II era: when companies prospered, they shared the prosperity with the workers.
For example, he said, corporate America currently gives senior executives generous health and retirement benefits, while only 14 percent of workers earning $10,000 to $20,000 are covered by 401(k) retirement programs and only 34 percent by a pension plan.
"It has never been economics alone that defines America," Mr. Reich said. "If we choose as a culture to push back against the economic forces that would otherwise divide us, it is within our ability to do so. And the consequence of choosing otherwise -- by pretending that the choice is not ours to make -- is to cease being a society."
But during the campaign year just past, Mr. Clinton chose to emphasize the good news about the economy -- job growth, reduced deficits and stable prices -- while giving nods to Mr. Reich's concerns by saying that those at risk in the new economy should be helped by tax cuts for education and small government steps to make health insurance and pensions somewhat more secure.
Occasionally he reverted to the populist tones of his 1992 campaign. But when he did, political consultants were on on hand to remind him, as Dick Morris recounts in his recent book, that when his speeches contained only good economic news and not the mixed message, voter approval rose by 20 percent.
So instead, Mr. Clinton used his bully pulpit not to afflict the comfortable -- whose campaign cash he was assiduously soliciting -- but to highlight popular poll-tested ideas such as youth curfews or school uniforms. When he addressed the themes of corporate responsibility, he did so by showcasing companies that were doing something extra for their workers.
"Teddy Roosevelt had very clear causes in which he was also clearly the leader," said Mr. Fields of Washington University. "That's less obvious with Clinton. The issues he's carrying have lots of people who represent them and often he's back in the pack on them. He's for improving education, a lot of popular and good things that have a lot of support, but there is no particular agenda in which he seems to be out front."
Mr. Clinton's aides say that the President now plans to turn his eloquence and moral suasion to education and welfare. Those, of course, are areas where he might have had a more direct role if he had not signed Republican legislation that gave states the primary responsibility for welfare policy and if he had not agreed with Republican governors that education standards should be a state matter.
But he still hopes to bring about change by holding up positive models to the nation. "So when business and communities join together to provide jobs for welfare recipients, I will be there," he said recently. "When parents and state legislators work to establish and uphold the toughest standards for our schools, I will be there. When communities band together to bring values, discipline and hope to their children through school uniforms or imposing curfews or enforcing truancy laws, I will continue to be there."
Is there enough bully in that kind of pulpit? When Mr. Clinton's legacy is in the hands of historians, they may be better able to decide whether the President was leading or simply cheerleading.

HEADLINE: America, Syria and South Africa

 BODY:
The usually warm relations between the United States and Nelson Mandela's South African Government were troubled last week by news of a prospective arms deal between South Africa and Syria. Washington put Pretoria on notice that the transfer to Syria of a sophisticated system for accurately directing tank fire might force the suspension of American aid to South Africa, which this year amounts to $82 million. President Mandela responded icily that his country would make its own decisions in these matters.
Pretoria's agreement to let the partially state-owned company, Denel, explore the Syrian deal is regrettable. But talk of denying aid is premature. More nuanced diplomacy and some common sense should be able to prevent the arms sale without damaging relations with South Africa. 
 Washington considers Syria to be a terrorist state. Under United States law, countries selling lethal arms to Syria or other countries that sponsor terrorism forfeit their own eligibility to receive many categories of American assistance. Even when a potential arms seller receives no United States aid, as is the case with some European arms-exporting countries, Washington has usually tried hard to discourage deals with terrorist states.
Selling Syria this technology would upset the present military balance between Israel and Syria. Israel now has the tank system, while Syria does not. Ironically, Denel developed the system in a technology-sharing deal between Israel and South Africa's former apartheid regime.
South Africa's arms export industry is one of its more valuable economic inheritances from that old regime, providing jobs and much needed foreign exchange. But, as the present case shows, it can be a diplomatic and political liability. President Mandela has imposed some useful restraints on arms deals. These guidelines ought to have excluded even exploratory dealings with Syria. But pressures from the arms industry and some elements of the governing African National Congress reportedly outweighed Foreign Ministry objections.
Several further stages of official review by Pretoria are required before any actual technology transfer can proceed. Washington, having made clear its legitimate concerns, would now do best to step back from public bullying and see if a calm and respectful diplomatic dialogue can persuade South Africa to live up to its own high standards.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Opens Its Drive for Budget Amendment

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
As they kick off their latest effort to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget, Republican leaders are expressing confidence that they have the votes to win in the Senate, where the proposal has been defeated by the thinnest of margins in each of the last two years.
But opponents of the measure say its fate appears to hinge on an issue that has doomed it in the past: a demand, by a group of Democratic senators who are the swing votes, that the amendment protect the Social Security fund from being raided to pay the Government's bills. 
The proposed amendment, which passed the House easily in the last Congress and appears to have enough support to pass there again this year, is strongly opposed by the Clinton Administration, which views it as a distraction from separate efforts to negotiate an agreement to balance the budget by 2002, as both parties have promised to do.
The Republicans' latest drive on the amendment's behalf got under way on Friday with a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. There, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin testified that the measure could worsen economic downturns by limiting the Government's ability to pay unemployment and other social welfare benefits when the economy slows. Increased benefit payments combined with lower tax receipts during downturns can increase the deficit, but typically give the economy enough of a boost to help spur a recovery or at least limit any rise in unemployment.
Even if the measure were to pass both houses with the necessary two-thirds vote, it would still have to be ratified by the legislatures of three-quarters of the states, and, under one of its own provisions, it would not take effect before 2002. But the proposal is one of the top legislative priorities of the Republicans, who hope to pass it by middle or late February and so strengthen themselves for later budget negotiations between the White House and the Congressional leadership.
Congressional aides said the Senate and the House would vote on the amendment either just before or just after the one-week recess that Congress will take starting on Feb. 15.
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Orrin G. Hatch, who will introduce the measure on Tuesday, said he had won support from 7 Democrats and all 55 Republicans in the Senate, where the amendment needs 67 votes.
In 1995, when the Republicans last made an all-out push for the amendment, 14 Senate Democrats voted in favor, leaving supporters just one vote short. Mr. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday that if every senator who pledged support for the amendment during the 1996 election campaign or voted for it in the past backed it this time, there would be 68 votes in favor. He did not identify the seven Democrats whom he described as firm supporters, and his office said their names would not be made public until next week.
But another group, of at least seven Democrats who have previously supported the amendment in principle, is continuing to hedge because of the dispute over Social Security. Several tried to alter the amendment in the last Congress to reflect their concerns but were defeated by the Republicans, who argued that the Social Security issue was best dealt with through legislation.
Democrats said that the Senate Democrats whose votes would depend on resolving the Social Security issue were Dianne Feinstein of California, Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan, both of North Dakota; Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky; Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina; Harry Reid of Nevada, and perhaps Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader. Mr. Daschle voted against the amendment in 1995 and 1996 but supported a version in 1994.

HEADLINE: MEDICARE PANEL ADVISES A FREEZE ON HOSPITAL PAY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
A Federal advisory panel has decided to recommend that Congress freeze Medicare payments to hospitals next year. It would be the first time in the history of the program that hospitals have not received an increase.
In approving the recommendation, the panel said that hospitals had effectively controlled their costs, so that existing Medicare payment rates were generally adequate. 
 The chairman of the panel, Prof. Joseph P. Newhouse of Harvard, said in an interview that payment rates could be kept level next year without harming the quality of health care or access to care for beneficiaries.
Medicare finances care for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled. Payments to hospitals totaled $84 billion last year, or 44 percent of all Medicare spending.
The Federal advisory panel, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, voted this week to recommend a "zero update" -- no change -- in Medicare payment rates for hospitals. Congress pays close attention to the panel's advice, often providing less money but rarely more than it suggests.
The unexpected recommendation offers President Clinton and Congress a relatively easy way to reduce the Federal budget deficit and shore up the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills.
Carmela S. Coyle, a vice president of the American Hospital Association, said: "We are surprised that the commission recommended no increase at all in Medicare payment amounts. It's unprecedented. Hospitals have become more efficient. We've kept down costs for two or three years in a row. There have been real cuts in the cost of treating Medicare patients. But how long can these cost reductions be sustained?"
Mrs. Coyle said hospitals were, in effect, being punished for having improved their productivity. Federal officials contend that Medicare should share the benefits of such improvements, and that hospitals can continue increasing productivity.
Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the Medicare proposal was "the third stroke of a triple whammy" adversely affecting hospital revenues. New York State recently lifted price controls on hospitals, forcing them to compete for patients by offering discounts to insurers. In addition, Mr. Raske said, New York has cut Medicaid payments to hospitals, and Gov. George E. Pataki is proposing deeper cuts.
The recommendation from the Federal advisory panel coincides with new evidence showing how inflation has been squeezed from the health care industry.
The cost of medical care, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose last year by just 3 percent, the smallest amount in three decades. The price index for all items increased 3.3 percent. It was the first time since 1980 that medical prices rose less than the overall index, which measures changes in the prices paid by consumers for a fixed market basket of goods and services.
While the Government data show that medical prices are leveling off, some economists say they are actually declining.
"For example," said Dahlia K. Remler, a health economist at Tulane University in New Orleans, "the price you have to pay for extending your life after a heart attack is not rising as fast as the price of other goods in the economy like food, clothing and housing. In the last 15 years, the price of what we care about -- the price of having our health improved when we are sick -- has gone down in real terms."
Since 1984, hospitals have received a fixed amount of money for each Medicare patient they treat, regardless of how long the person stays in the hospital. Each Medicare patient is assigned to 1 of 495 categories, depending on the illness. Payments are set in advance for each category and can be updated annually.
The Congressional Budget Office had assumed that payment rates would be increased 3 percent next year. Based on that figure, the panel's recommendation would save more than $2 billion in 1998. It would permanently lower the base for future increases, saving more than $11 billion over five years.
The sum, while substantial, is a relatively small part of the savings that will be needed to guarantee the long-term solvency of Medicare.
In the last decade, the commission has recommended increases averaging 3 percent a year, and Congress has approved increases averaging 2.6 percent a year.
Stuart Guterman, deputy executive director of the commission, said: "Hospital costs have been declining while Medicare payments have increased at a moderate rate. As a result, hospitals have found their Medicare business more profitable."
The hospital association boasted last year that "increases in hospitals' costs of delivering care hit their lowest point in 40 years." One reason, the commission said, is that wages and benefits of hospital employees are growing more slowly than compensation in many other industries.
Data collected by the Government show that hospital profit margins have, on the average, been rising for several years. But Mrs. Coyle said the data also showed that some hospitals were experiencing financial difficulties. Nineteen percent of hospitals lost money over all, she said, while 39 percent lost money on their Medicare business.
Kay Ford, an economist at the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that the growing use of managed care had helped hold down health costs. Nearly three-fourths of workers with health insurance are in some type of managed care.
Both H.M.O.'s and traditional insurance plans are negotiating with hospitals to get lower rates for their patients. Hardly anyone pays the full list price any more.
Economists told Congress last month that the Consumer Price Index tends to overstate increases in the cost of living because it does not fully account for the development of new products, improvements in the quality of old products and other changes in the standard market basket of goods and services.
Such changes are occurring throughout the health care industry. New drugs and devices and medical procedures are introduced every month. Employers, labor unions, H.M.O.'s and insurance companies are continually devising new ways to pay for services. Different people often pay different prices for the same service provided by the same doctor or hospital.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data showing the prices of hospital rooms over the last 60 years. But the price index does not take account of the fact that the average length of hospital stays has declined in the last 15 years, especially for elderly patients.
In addition, "a hospital day today is very different from one 10 years ago in terms of the procedures a patient receives," said Dr. Mark McClellan, an economist and physician at Stanford University.
David M. Cutler, an economist at Harvard, said that the services provided by doctors and hospitals today were worth more than those provided 10 or 20 years ago.
Mr. Cutler, Dr. McClellan, Ms. Remler, and Mr. Newhouse recently studied the care of people who had suffered heart attacks. In a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, they found that while the "use of more intensive procedures like bypass surgery and angioplasty has skyrocketed," prices have come down and patients are living longer.
For these patients, they said, the cost of living in a literal sense -- the cost of prolonging life after a heart attack -- has declined.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Is Crossing Starting Line for Year 2000

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
When President Clinton takes the oath of office for the second time on Monday, it will mark a watershed in the career of Vice President Al Gore.
From that point on, Mr. Gore will begin, very slowly at first, then perhaps more rapidly, to emerge from Mr. Clinton's shadow. He will still be subject to the rule that Vice Presidents are more seen than heard. He will still be a very junior partner in the White House firm, there more than anything else to assume the Presidency if anything should happen to the President. 
 But he will also be the heir apparent, the favorite for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000, when Mr. Clinton must step down.
"Tuesday is the turning point," said Thomas J. Downey, a Washington lobbyist who served for 18 years as a Congressman from Long Island and who is counted as a member of the Gore inner circle. "The salad days are over."
Although Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore are from the same generation and the same region, and although they have shown an unshakeable loyalty to each other during the last four years, it is conceivable that their interests will diverge in the months to come. One Gore intimate suggested, for example, that in a budget deal, Mr. Gore would want to get the fiscal "pain" out of the way before 2000 and Mr. Clinton would want to push it into the future.
"One would be a back-loader, one a front-loader," the friend said, although he predicted that any tensions would be handled in private.
Peter S. Knight, who served as the manager of the Clinton/Gore 1996 campaign and might manage Mr. Gore's effort in 2000, said he thought any such divergences would be rare. "The most important thing Al Gore can do for his future is help to make this the most successful President in history," he said. "What's good for Clinton is good for Gore. They are joined at the hip, politically."
That close identification can cut both ways, of course. If Mr. Clinton is popular three years from now, if the economy remains sound, if there is no major crisis abroad, Mr. Gore will benefit. But many second terms go awry for one reason or another, and that could cost Mr. Gore the nomination or force him to fight so hard for it -- like Hubert H. Humphrey had to in 1968, when Vietnam split the party -- that he is fatally weakened for the general election.
Mr. Gore is also a kind of hostage to Mr. Clinton's frailties, including his legal problems. Should the Paula Jones case or the Whitewater affair or some other scandal blow up in the President's face in the months ahead, Mr. Gore will have to decide, as one of his friends said, "whether he can afford to be a bit less vigorous in his support or whether that would look disloyal."
He also has his own problems. During last year's campaign, he got caught up in the controversy surrounding fund-raising for the Democratic ticket, holding what proved to be an illegal, if unintentionally comical, fund-raiser in a Buddhist temple among nuns who had taken vows of poverty. Like Mr. Clinton, he sometimes seems excessively technocratic, lacking political passion. And he has not entirely shaken his reputation as a rather wooden, humorless campaigner.
In an interview at the White House this week, Mr. Gore said he would keep his plans for 2000 under wraps until well after the 1998 Congressional elections -- until "about two and a half years from now," as he put it.
"The country doesn't want these campaigns to start as early as they do," he said. "I'm not going to change my outlook or way of thinking. Any campaign associated with me is going to be a lot like my macarena -- no visible movement but some people may think they know what I'm doing anyway."
Mr. Gore said he intended to pursue the same interests in his second term that have occupied him in his first term, like the environment, the reorganization of the Federal Government and foreign policy, especially United States relations with Russia, China, Egypt and South Africa.
At the Cabinet retreat a week ago, Mr. Gore added, the President asked him to speak and he spent his entire time on "reinventing Government."
Presumably, those sorts of issues would play an important part in a Gore campaign for the Presidency. But the campaign to shrink and restructure the Government has met with only limited success, with the Internal Revenue Service, for example, still considered a big problem, even by Mr. Gore.
"We're ahead of schedule, but we still have a long way to go," the Vice President said. "I'm very pleased with the progress that has been made. But we have not yet crossed the threshold beyond which the American people generally say, 'Yeah, I see a big change' or 'I feel a big change.' "
Much of his work has lacked political glamor and, hence, saleability.
"Among Gore's responsibilities are a lot of things like trying to clean up the fissionable materials in Kazakstan," said Martin Peretz, the editor-in-chief of The New Republic, who taught Mr. Gore as a freshman at Harvard University and has maintained a close friendship with him. "They could be crucial to our children and grandchildren, but they don't matter a lot to most of the voters of today."
What he can do in planning and policy terms in the Vice Presidency is largely dependent on Mr. Clinton. In that sense, too, Mr. Gore is not entirely captain of his own fate.
Few of those around him expect him to win the nomination in a walkover, no matter how well he performs his duties, how popular Mr. Clinton is three years from now or how strong Mr. Gore looks going into 2000.
"It's inevitable that he'll have challengers," said Roy M. Neel, the president of the United Telephone Association, which lobbies on telecommunications issues. "You have to go back a lot of years to find a vice president who wasn't challenged when he went after the Presidency."
In fact, only four of the nation's 45 Vice Presidents were elected to the Presidency at the end of their Vice-Presidential terms: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George Bush. Like several others, Richard M. Nixon tried and failed when he left the Vice Presidency in 1960, but he was elected President eight years later, a unique accomplishment.
Mr. Neel, who served as Mr. Gore's assistant in Congress and later as his vice-presidential chief of staff, suggested that rivals might begin to emerge as early as this year. The first sign, he said, would be when a Democratic governor or senator took a public position on a prominent issue that differed from the President's.
Among the Democrats who may challenge Mr. Gore are Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader in the House, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both of whom ran unsuccessfully for President in 1988.
But it is former Senator Bill Bradely of New Jersey who gives Mr. Gore's advisers nightmares. Mr. Bradley plans to teach and to make a series of public-service television commercials, which should keep him in the public eye. One of the Vice President's friends said he most feared a Bradley campaign built around a crusade against the present system of financing American politics.
People like Mr. Downey, Mr. Knight, Mr. Neel and Jack Quinn, the departing White House counsel who is also a Gore sidekick, have of course long since begun mulling over strategies for 2000 and making preliminary plans.
"You have to think it through very carefully, far in advance, and have a plan in mind," Mr. Quinn said. "But don't show your hand too much. For political as well as legal reasons, you don't display your ambitions."
No Gore fund-raising operations are likely until 1999, but that does not prevent the Vice President from buttering up past contributors. He is doing that this weekend in a series of events at his official residence, including a cocktail reception for 500 this evening and a brunch on Tuesday.
He has also developed a core of loyalists within the Administration. Among them are Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; Leon Fuerth, his longtime foreign-policy adviser, and the incoming Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, son of the former New York governor, who is widely regarded as a rising Democratic star.
This week, Mr. Gore added another. Steve Grossman, a fund-raiser from Massachusetts, was named to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Democratic National Committee. Though his choice was ratified by Mr. Clinton, he is more Mr. Gore's man, according to leading Democrats here and in Boston.

HEADLINE: ON PRO FOOTBALL;
Modern N.F.L. Makes Coach a Marked Man

BYLINE: By Timothy W. Smith 

 BODY:
George Seifert's resignation as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers last week left a few people scratching their heads. The head scratching continued when the 49ers chose his successor: Steve Mariucci, who guided the University of California to a 6-6 record last year in his only head coaching job.
What in the name of George Halas is going on these days in the National Football League? How does a team go from the coach who won more games than anyone in its history to a man who has never coached in the league? 
 By the time the 1997 season starts, a third of the 30 teams in the league will have new coaches. Some of the coaches who were fired were in their jobs for only a short time. Mike White lasted two seasons in Oakland. Rich Brooks made it through two seasons with the Rams. Rich Kotite fired himself after two seasons with the Jets. That was better than his predecessor, Pete Carroll, who lasted one season. The Jets' next coach will be their third in four seasons.
Of the 10 coaches who were dismissed or resigned this past season, only three had tenures of more than five seasons: Jim Mora (11 years with New Orleans), Wayne Fontes (9 years with Detroit) and Seifert (8).
Bills Coach Marv Levy, who will be entering his 12th season at Buffalo when the 1997 season kicks off, has the longest tenure of any active N.F.L. coach. Levy, who will be 73 on Aug. 3, has a chance to break Halas's record of being the oldest coach in the N.F.L. The way things are going in the N.F.L. these days, the fact that Levy would be in his 14th season with the same team and would be 74 would be equally amazing feats.
Halas was 73 when he retired as the Bears coach on May 27, 1968. He stepped down from 1929 to 1933 in a dispute over play-calling with his co-coach, Ed (Dutch) Sternaman. Halas also left from 1942 to 1946 for a stint in the Navy and again from 1955 to 1958 to let his friend, John (Paddy) Driscoll, coach the team.
In all, Halas coached the Bears for 27 years. Granted, he owned the team and answered to himself for most of those years, but it is almost impossible for any modern N.F.L. coach to last half that time.
The modern N.F.L. coach must be not only a combination of Halas and Vince Lombardi, but also equal parts Dale Carnegie and P. T. Barnum. That's why many of the N.F.L. jobs will go to college coaches, who have spent time recruiting players, know how to sell a program to fans and are adroit at quickly assembling teams with disparate players because of frequent turnover.
Several factors have converged to make an N.F.L. coach a marked man. The main factors are player free agency, stadium free agency (the quest for enhanced luxury-box revenue) and the need to win quickly. They are all tied together in a bundle that is placed squarely on a coach's shoulders. If he buckles under the load, he will be gone. There is no time for him to try to shift the weight and carry on.
N.F.L. owners believe they can build a winning team quickly with free-agent talent. They need ready cash for the huge signing bonuses commanded by the top free agents. Luxury boxes provide the owners with a steady stream of available cash besides their television revenue. New stadiums have more luxury boxes with better amenities that command higher prices. Winning teams attract more corporations and groups to the luxury boxes.
It is a sinister spiral that sucks up coaches like a rampaging tornado and spits them out in the land of unemployment.
The Rams were looking to relocate from Anaheim, Calif., to St. Louis a couple of years ago. They had to convince a largely apathetic football fan base in St. Louis that they were bringing a winner to town. What is the best way to do that? Fire the old coach and hire a new one.
Out goes Chuck Knox with his tired 15-33 record and in comes Brooks, a fresh-faced winner from college (Oregon). The Rams christened their Trans World Dome this season with a losing season. Now, Brooks is out.
Same thing in Cleveland. Bill Belichick bit the dust before the moving vans could load up for the trip to Baltimore. Down the road in Cincinnati, David Shula, the son of the N.F.L. coaching great Don Shula, had to go to make a new stadium proposal appetizing to the Hamilton County electorate. Falcons Coach June Jones kept looking up at a lot of empty seats and a few darkened luxury boxes inside the Georgia Dome this season. Now, he is looking for a new job.
Sometimes it is not all about winning.
Seifert carried the load for a long time in San Francisco, where the 49ers would like a new stadium, and he did it well. Under Seifert, the 49ers were 108-35, won four straight National Football Conference West titles (five in all), played in four N.F.C. championship games and won two Super Bowls. Carolina surprised them and won the N.F.C. West this season, and the Niners were knocked out of the playoffs by the Packers.
Seifert knew he had to leave. Nothing short of another Super Bowl victory is good enough in San Francisco. In comes Mariucci, a fresh face whom the 49ers have tabbed the next great coach in the line of Bill Walsh and Seifert. Good luck, Mr. Mariucci.
If Halas had luxury boxes to fill and free agents to cajole, would he have lasted 27 years? Would he have been able to spend five years developing a championship team as he did from 1958 through 1963? Or with dwindling fan support, empty luxury boxes and poor merchandise sales would Halas have pulled a Kotite and fired himself?

HEADLINE: Tax Respite May Not Prove Much

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
The one-week repeal of the sales tax on clothing that costs less than $500 may have stirred a tumult of promotion yesterday in stores across New York City and most of the state, but in the end this experiment will probably be of little use in gauging what would happen if the tax were reduced permanently.
If the cold does not ward off shoppers and clothing sales rise this week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other officials will no doubt point to the jump as evidence that the state should forever cut the tax, which in the city totals 8.25 percent. That, they say, would stanch the flow of New Yorkers who travel to New Jersey and other states with lower sales taxes to buy their clothes. 
 Yet economists and retail analysts say there is no way to draw that or any other conclusion from a trial run that will last only seven days. So, given its origin in a round of horse trading last summer in Albany, the one-week repeal seems to be more of a political contrivance than a fruitful experiment.
"As a piece of hype, it rates an A," said Isaac Lagnado, publisher of the Tactical Retail Monitor, a newsletter that covers the retail industry. "As a sincere, empirical measurement of a new way of doing business, it's irrelevant."
Even the Mayor himself, who has been talking up the tax-exempt bargains like a sidewalk barker, acknowledged yesterday that the experiment was flawed, particularly because it was occurring in the month after Christmas, one of the slowest retail periods of the year.
But he emphasized that the Legislature, which sets sales taxes for both the city and state, had refused his request to reduce the tax permanently, so he had to settle for this abbreviated test. He said, in fact, that he didn't think there was any need for an experiment because he was already certain that a permanent cut in the sales tax would generate so much economic activity that it would ultimately leave the municipal government with more money from other taxes.
"The State Legislature picked the week of the year that had the least amount of retail activity," the Mayor told reporters during a shopping trip to Herald Square to focus attention on the tax holiday. "And they gave us only a week. I would have liked this to have been longer."
Even if shoppers do flock to the stores for the whole week, officials will have great difficulty in directly determining the size of any jump in revenues. The state is asking retailers to tally their sales of tax-exempt items, but there is no corresponding information for previous years because the state normally tracks sales taxes and retail sales quarterly, and does not keep separate statistics on sales of clothing items that cost less than $500.
To be sure, all of this naysaying is directed at the brevity of the experiment, not at the impact of permanent reductions in sales taxes. Economists say many studies have shown that sales tax cuts can influence where people shop, though there is some disagreement over how much.
In criticizing the experiment, retail analysts point out that they generally recommend that stores run promotions -- and the one-week tax repeal is essentially a state-sponsored giveaway -- for at least three months before assessing their impact. By doing so, the stores can lessen the effect of a host of factors that can cloud an analysis, from the weather to inventory size to the state of the economy.
For example, the biting cold that hit the region last week and may continue could skew the results of the repeal by depressing sales.
In the case of a tax holiday, officials also have to determine whether a rise in clothing sales means there has been a geographic shift in spending -- which is their goal -- or merely a chronological one.
In other words, are New Yorkers who normally shop in New Jersey keeping their business at home, or are people who do their shopping in New York simply concentrating their purchases on this week? Are residents who never set foot in New Jersey doling out their whole winter or spring budgets for clothing in this one week to take advantage of the discount, causing a short-lived spurt in sales?
The Mayor called on residents to follow this strategy, saying they should squirrel away their money until this week. If clothing sales rise, he says, that will pressure Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature to reduce the sales tax permanently.
"By lifting the tax for one week and really increasing sales, we can send a powerful message to Albany," Mr. Giuliani exhorts in one of the radio advertisements that the city is broadcasting to broaden awareness of the tax holiday.
To economists, though, the shifting around of money that residents would be spending in the city anyway does not prove anything. They say it merely gives people a temporary tax cut, one that for the week will cost the city $7 million and the state $20 million.
"Economists are always suspicious of any kind of tax holiday system," Prof. John L. Mikesell, an expert on tax policy at Indiana University, said. "You are just moving activity from one period to another. The week before and the week after are going to be stolen from. In terms of base economic activity, there is no change."
The assertion that the tax holiday is more political expedience than policy-making tool stems in part from its beginnings in Albany. Mr. Giuliani and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, had pushed for a permanent cut in the sales tax, but Mr. Pataki and Republicans in the State Senate, who are more interested in reducing business and property taxes, balked.
As a compromise, the two sides agreed last July to the experiment.
Of course, the state could have repealed the sales tax for a longer period, one that might have yielded more insight. But that would have cost much more in tax revenue.
State leaders actually picked such a slow sales week so the government would not lose much tax revenue. Economists and retail analysts say the timing of the week is one more reason the state will not get an accurate picture.
"Trying to gather any information from this strikes me as an impossibility," said Prof. William F. Fox, a tax expert who is head of the economics department at the University of Tennessee. "I don't think it's a meaningful experiment at all."

HEADLINE: Virginia Seen as Undercutting U.S. Environmental Rules

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Virginia's shores are just across the Potomac River from the Environmental Protection Agency's waterside headquarters here, but a political gap much broader than that is threatening the usual partnership between the state and the Federal pollution authorities.
Senior officials at the E.P.A. call Virginia a leading example of widespread resistance by some states against vigorous enforcement of Federal environmental laws. The problem the state exemplifies, they say, is especially alarming at a time when states are gaining more responsibility in this area. 
 Virginia officials respond that the E.P.A. has been heavyhanded and rigid, and that its leaders are distorting Virginia's more flexible approach to environmental regulation for political reasons.
"I think that it is unfortunate that you have a lack of leadership in the state," said Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the E.P.A. "There is a disregard for the requirements of Federal laws, and I think there is a belief on the part of some in Virginia that ignoring the environment and public health standards is what the business community wants."
Becky Norton Dunlop, Virginia's Secretary of Natural Resources, said she strongly resented such remarks. "It is not something that Carol Browner has ever had the moral character to say to any of us directly," Ms. Dunlop said.
"I have made very clear with the E.P.A. people whom I have worked with that none of this is personal," Ms. Dunlop said. "This is strictly a matter of policy, not personality or politics."
The differences between the two sides came into sharp relief last month when the Federal Government sued Smithfield Foods and two of its subsidiaries about pollution of the Pagan River at the company's meat plants in Smithfield, Va. The E.P.A. acted because Virginia, in a suit of its own, had sought far lighter penalties than the agency wanted.
But modest penalties are just part of what concerns Federal officials -- and also some in Virginia's General Assembly, which recently received a highly critical review of the state's Department of Environmental Quality by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the lawmakers' nonpartisan investigative arm.
In the 1996 fiscal year, Virginia assessed just $4,000 in civil penalties for water violations, one-tenth of the penalties the year before and sharply less than the average of the previous four years, the report said.
Additionally, according to the report, the number of cases referred to state law-enforcement authorities for prosecution has declined steadily in the past eight years. The number of inspections for air and water pollution violations is declining even as the number and complexity of pollution sources increase. (The state has said it is hiring more inspectors and expects water penalties this year to surpass the past five years combined.)
Virginia is appealing to the Supreme Court the requirements of 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act setting up a new system of air-pollution permits that states are supposed to enforce; the court is about to decide whether to hear the case.
The state has also blocked the E.P.A. from adding several new sites to the Federal list of the most serious Superfund violations. And over the agency's objections, it has enacted a law protecting companies from disclosure and punishment when they detect pollution violations in self-inspections and remedy them.
Some of these arguments go back many years, but they heated up when Gov. George Allen, a Republican, took office in 1994, pledging to make the regulatory climate more favorable to business.
Senior officials in the state continue to defend that approach and said that the E.P.A. was putting too much emphasis on prosecuting violations and collecting penalties and not enough on less punitive approaches, like negotiated consent orders.
"We think they should be working in partnership with the states, rather than engaging in 'gotcha,' if their interest is in the environment rather than building a bigger Federal bureaucracy," Ms. Dunlop said.
In pilot projects, the Federal agency has recently promoted alternatives to environmental regulation, Ms. Dunlop noted. "Even the Clinton Administration recognizes that compliance first is a legitimate policy of government," she said. "Then when you have bad actors, you fine them, and pursue them."
The state's critics, though, reply that to take this policy too far risks removing any economic incentive for companies to clean up their pollution problems, and that Virginia has been doing everything possible to minimize the Federal role in state environmental policy.
"The Allen administration has sought to turn this into an ideological battle over states' rights," said Katherine Slaughter, a staff lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center in Charlottesville, Va., an advocacy group. "If you look beyond the environmental question, they have done it with the motor-voter legislation for voting registration, with the rejection of the Goals 2000 program for the schools. So it is consistent with their ideology.
"The consistent message has been throughout that the states should be left to do their own thing, and on the environment, even more so."
 
Jurisdictions
Officials Clash Over Smithfield Case
Virginia officials say that the Federal Government's intervention in the highly publicized case involving Smithfield Foods, a maker of traditionally cured hams and other meat products, exemplifies Washington's interference in the state's handling of environmental enforcement.
In December, the E.P.A. filed a complaint against the company seeking as much as $125 million in civil penalties for longstanding serious water pollution violations, including discharges of fecal bacteria, phosphorous, ammonia, cyanide, oil and grease into a waterway. The state, trying to head off the Federal action, had earlier filed its own suit, but sought far lighter penalties.
The animosity between the state and Federal agencies erupted in late August, when Virginia officials learned that the E.P.A. was about to sue Smithfield.
The state was upset because what the Federal Government considered continuing violations concerned wastewater discharges that were within the limits of a consent order the state had negotiated with the company. The order gave the company time to hook up its meat operations to sewage treatment plants.
Virginia officials defend their use of consent orders rather than penalties, saying that they have led companies and municipalities to make billions of dollars of investments in pollution control.
The Federal authorities, for their part, were upset by the long history of violations by Smithfield, the continuing damage to the river and the state's lack of punitive action, an approach that critics say allows companies to enjoy economic gains from violations of the law.
Thomas L. Hopkins, director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, argued angrily in a letter in August to the E.P.A.'s regional administrator that the E.P.A.'s planned complaint "strikes a grievous blow to E.P.A.'s credibility and to Federal-state cooperation in environmental enforcement."
A few days later, the state filed its own complaint against Smithfield, knowing that this usually pre-empted any Federal action. But this time, Michael McCabe, the E.P.A.'s regional administrator, signaled that the Federal Government would not defer to the state.
"Virginia has a history of initiating enforcement once E.P.A. informs the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality of its intentions to pursue Federal action," Mr. McCabe wrote to Mr. Hopkins on Sept. 19, citing three specific cases involving municipalities in the state. "In each case, the actions taken by the Commonwealth and the penalties collected were much less than E.P.A. believes were appropriate."
Reciting statistics showing how enforcement cases and penalties were steadily declining, he wrote that the decline "does not correlate to any increase in compliance" and complained that top Virginia officials "have made clear the desire to conduct less enforcement."
The Smithfield Foods case, Mr. McCabe said in the letter, was not an isolated example. Another was the state's decision to file for a modest penalty against Allied Signal Inc.
For many years, that company, which is based in Morristown, N.J., but has operations in Virginia, had spilled chemicals resulting in several fish kills. It paid penalties for spills from 1989 to 1991, but not for another series of spills from 1992 to January 1996. Two more spills of sulfuric acid last March and April killed thousands more fish. Three days after the E.P.A. moved to penalize the company, the state sought a penalty, but a lighter one.
"If there remained any question of your intentions to try to insulate violating industries from Federal enforcement, your recent order with Allied Signal Inc. should erase all uncertainty," Mr. McCabe contended. "The sanctions by the Commonwealth in attempting to shield two violators from legitimate Federal enforcement has provided no basis and little hope for effective cooperation on enforcement matters."
In his letter on Dec. 5 to the state legislative panel investigating the situation, Mr. Hopkins called Mr. McCabe's words "ill-advised" and said that E.P.A. aides had said informally that Mr. McCabe had acted for political reasons over the objections of his aides.
Ms. Dunlop, in an interview, echoed that complaint.
"I feel that E.P.A. truly became political," she said, contending, for instance, that the agency was making a point of going after states controlled by Republicans. "I find this frankly very disturbing. When you make environmental policy a political issue, you frankly damage the credibility of the agency with the people. And they have certainly damaged their credibility with me."

Weaknesses
A Poor Guardian Of Clean Water
 Virginia's critics have raised another serious concern about the Smithfield case, saying that it disclosed weaknesses at the heart of the water pollution control program, a system established by the Federal Clean Water Act but managed by the states, in which companies record and report data about their own discharges within the limits of permits.
Like other states, Virginia is supposed to oversee compliance with water pollution permits by using monthly reports known as discharge monitoring reports, or D.M.R.'s. These are based on samples collected by the companies and analyzed by the companies' laboratories or by labs that the companies hire.
"It appears that Virginia has never had adequate oversight of the D.M.R. process, and any oversight which may have existed in the past has diminished recently," the Virginia legislative report found.
The Smithfield case is especially noteworthy because the company was filing falsified reports, an offense that eventually led to a guilty plea by the person responsible.
In two consecutive months in 1993, the legislative investigators found, Smithfield submitted identical pollution reports for two different spots: the exact same amount of coliform bacteria, cyanide and nitrogen, for example, were said to be entering the water at two different locations two months in a row.
Other factors convinced state investigators that, as the report said, Virginia's "current water monitoring programs are inadequate":
*Virginia canceled a program in 1994 that used a mobile laboratory to check the accuracy of companies' lab analyses.
*Annual quality-control tests required by the E.P.A. show that in 1995 fewer than half of all water permit holders in the state achieved acceptable scores, the lowest performance in seven years.
*Unlike other states, Virginia has no minimum requirements for operating a lab to sample permit holders' effluents; some labs in Virginia actually seek North Carolina certification as a way of proving their competence to customers in Virginia.
The Federal Government, meanwhile, has a separate problem with Virginia's use of the discharge data. Beginning in October 1994, the state stopped entering the figures into the national data base known as the Permit Compliance System.
Last summer, after months of staff negotiations, the E.P.A. told Virginia that it would withhold water quality grants until the situation was corrected. Virginia promised that it was bringing a new computer system on line and would enter all the missing data by the end of 1996. According to E.P.A. officials, that has yet to be completed.
 
Beneficiaries
Small Companies Get Deference, Too
 Large companies like Smithfield and Allied Signal are not the only ones to have benefited from the state's policies.
For almost a mile downstream from the Casta Line Trout Farm, at the spot in the Shenandoahs where Cockran Spring feeds the Middle River, the water quality is "severely impaired," Virginia records say.
More than a year ago, state environmental enforcement officials drafted notices of violation for Casta Line and two other fish farms. In March, an inspection found several more violations of Casta Line's permits. But the officials were ordered by superiors not to press the case, and no fines or other penalties were assessed, according to a state report.
While the pollution by trout waste of one mile of creek water might seem trivial in a state that monitors 32,000 miles of waterways for pollution, critics of Virginia's environmental performance say the case typifies the state's deference to the needs of businesses.
In July 1995, the same month that the state's enforcement staff was drafting notices of violation for the fish farm, Ms. Dunlop wrote Brian Plemmons, the owner of Casta Line, about "your frustration that Virginia is applying E.P.A. regulations more stringently than other states."
Though her letter did not address the specifics of the violations at the trout farm, she promised Mr. Plemmons that the state would take action, including "minimizing monitoring requirements, to reduce the burdens on fish farms."
To Mr. Plemmons, accusations that he is polluting the water are ridiculous. He described his violations -- which inspectors said included inappropriate flushing of solid fish waste into the stream, failing to take samples during normal operations and failure to file a required report -- as mainly just technicalities.
"I have gotten a notice of violation for using ditto marks in a monthly discharge report," he said. "I have gotten a notice of violation for photocopying my signature. I have gotten a notice of violation for a broken membrane on my dissolved oxygen meter, and I think the inspector broke it."
But the scathing report issued in December by the State Legislature's panel cited the trout farm's case, along with many others, as evidence that Virginia's top environmental officials "have chosen to disregard" the state's laws and Constitution and were skirting Federal environmental requirements to favor industry.
"The state continues to experience difficulty in addressing long-term noncompliance and does not have a consistent, credible enforcement program," the report said. "D.E.Q.'s lack of leadership in these areas puts the state's future water quality at risk."
In response, Mr. Hopkins said the state agency believed that punishment was less important than bringing pollution under control, using what he called "an ascending ladder of compliance and enforcement tools."
"The change in policy is a deliberate attempt to change the focus of enforcement by shifting from punitive enforcement as the initial and primary compliance tool, as it had been a demonstrated failure nationwide," he said.

HEADLINE: Setting Campaign Goals, Whitman Describes a Record Broader Than Income Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Her proposal to cut the state's income tax helped get her elected. And keeping her promise accounts for much of her popularity. But now that Christine Todd Whitman is seeking re-election as Governor of New Jersey, she says she is concerned that she seems to be known for just one thing: cutting taxes.
"I keep hearing that 'She cut taxes by 30 percent, and that is all she has done,' " Mrs. Whitman said. "That infuriates me because we have done so much, a lot of it not sexy stuff but very important things. We have done a lot of things that have built the base for real quantum changes over the next few years, that really will make a long-term difference." 
 Mrs. Whitman offered these remarks today in an interview in which she laid out an election strategy intended to broaden her appeal among Democratic and independent voters. She insisted that in her first term, she had taken major steps to overhaul the juvenile justice system, the state's welfare programs and the way that New Jersey sets curriculum standards and finances its public schools. She said she was seeking a second term to see those changes through.
In addition, she said her priorities would be more jobs and affordable housing in the state's cities and to help strengthen the state's economy.
She dismissed critics who contend that all she has done is cut state taxes and pay for those cuts with risky fiscal maneuvers.
"They are wrong," she said. "There are schools. There is welfare. There is the environment. There are jobs. There is the Transportation Trust Fund, and there have been smaller, but important changes, like tort reform, and binding arbitration, which should help localities lower property taxes."
Although she made no mention of her upcoming re-election bid in her annual address to the Legislature last Tuesday, Mrs. Whitman clearly was staking out her administration's accomplishments in areas where Democrats believe she is vulnerable. She offered a plan to bring down the state's high automobile insurance rates. She said property tax increases have been, on average, the lowest in decades. She also promised millions of dollars in new spending to help build affordable housing in the cities.
"She sounded like a Democrat running in a Democratic primary," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Congressman from Camden County and one of seven potential Democratic challengers who insists that she can be toppled in November because of voter anger over property taxes and the quality of public education.
Mrs. Whitman said that perhaps she has been at fault for not getting out the message about her administration's accomplishments. She said that she was determined to tell voters about her whole record.
She also said that she was not daunted by the large Democratic turnout at the polls in the state's urban areas last November because she thinks that many of those voters will vote for her.
"You never forget your base," said Mrs. Whitman, who vowed to run as "an underdog" even in Republican strongholds. "Politics is the heart of the election process and we have done a lot of things. I refuse to concede anything. I am not going to concede any part of this state.
"I am Governor of the whole state, and I have always been someone who has been very interested in what we can do with some of the bigger challenges. I hear a lot about that Democrats are the ones who care, and they are in the cities. Look at the cities. Our cities are in really bad shape. Republicans have not been running them. I believe that our state can not thrive if our cities are not doing better."
Mrs. Whitman's job performance ratings in polls have been consistently above 50 percent. And as Clifford Zukin, a pollster and professor at Rutgers University, says, she may be tough to beat because the state's economy shows no signs of weakening, and incumbents usually fare well in good economic times.
"Right now, people are satisfied with the way the state is run," Mr. Zukin said. "They like her. There is not a reason in the world to vote against her. She is well liked, but people don't know much about her. She is not viewed as having a second issue yet."
Mrs. Whitman said she knows that Democrats will try to make an issue out of the state's high property taxes. She said she does not have a plan similar to that proposed by New York Governor George E. Pataki that would provide localities with direct property tax relief. But she said that she would look at the proposal and consider similar measures, if re-elected.
At the same time, she said she thinks voters understand that local governments, not state government, set the local property tax rate, and she believes that local governments are reining in their spending, which has led to the slowest property tax growth in decades. She also said she signed legislation last year returning the property tax deduction on state income tax returns.
"I can't take away the property tax," she said. "But there is no question about it, we have done a great deal to address the issue, like taking over the court system from the counties, which gives the counties and the municipalities the flexibility that they need to address the issue on their own."
During her 1993 campaign, she said some of her political advisers urged her to propose property tax relief instead of an income tax cut. But she said her economic advisers, among them Steve Forbes, convinced her that only a reduction in the state's income tax rates would improve the state's business climate and create jobs.
"I grew up in this state," she said. "I understand the property tax issue, but it wasn't going to be what we needed to turn this state around, and my goal was to turn this state around."
Although she said there was much more to do to help create jobs, she said she was confident that the state was on the right track. Yet there are new challenges ahead in attracting and keeping business in the state, she said, with new technology making it easier for companies to locate outside the northeast and away from their customers.
Although gubernatorial races in New Jersey are publicly financed, the playing field this year is far from even since all of the potential Democratic challengers are relatively unknown outside their districts, with the exception of former Gov. Jim Florio, who has not yet said whether he wants the job back.
Mrs. Whitman, who assembled her own campaign team this week, said she thinks that a rematch with Mr. Florio would be "fascinating because there would be a real apples to apples comparison," and she is confident that voters would approve her approach toward government.
Of the other potential Democratic candidates, she said Representative Andrews or State Senator James E. McGreevey, who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, would pose the biggest challenges because they each can claim a political base in important areas of the state.
Under New Jersey's campaign finance rules, Governor Whitman begins fund raising this week, like all the other candidates, without any money in the bank. But she has already established her ability at fund raising, collecting $4 million for the state and national Republican Committee last year. A $500-a-plate fund-raiser has been scheduled in February. Her brother, former Assemblyman Webster Dan Todd Jr., who served as her campaign manager for much of her 1993 race, will return to her side for this campaign as her finance chairman.
Contributions are limited to $2,100, and there is a $6.9 million campaign spending limit, including $4.6 million in taxpayer funds.
But Mrs. Whitman said that she expected outside money would be spent in New Jersey, perhaps from organized labor or even the Democratic National Committee. She said that it was too early to know whether the Republican National Committee would allocate resources to her campaign.
Mrs. Whitman, who was much talked about last year as a possible vice presidential nominee, brushed aside questions about whether she would promise voters that she would serve her an entire term and whether she had political aspirations beyond New Jersey.
"Honest to God, I am not thinking about any agenda beyond New Jersey," she said. "Obviously, I would like to be re-elected comfortably because that would be an affirmation of what we have been doing, and I think that we have done an awful lot."

HEADLINE: Tax Break Warms Shoppers' Hearts, Despite Cold Snap

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
On a day so cold that newscasters were advising people to venture out only for essentials like bread and milk, Beth Murphy bundled up and went to the Gap. There, amid the blue sweaters and smart black shoes, she found her own comforting warmth in the form of New York State's temporary sales-tax repeal.
Inside the store at Herald Square, with the hood of her pink coat still pulled over her head and her hands clenching and unclenching to regain feeling, Ms. Murphy patiently tried yesterday to explain why she had risked frostbite to shop. There is something liberating, she said, in seeing a price tag and knowing that no further math is involved to determine the final cost. 
 "What you see is what you get," she said. "It's a real incentive."
Throughout the city and in most of the state, the first day of a weeklong tax exemption on most clothing and accessories lured shoppers from the warmth of their homes and into temperatures that, with the wind-chill factor, dipped below zero. The idea is to test the economic effect of ending the tax permanently, but tax experts say the brief experiment will probably be of little real use. [News analysis, page 30.]
At Bloomingdale's on Lexington Avenue and East 59th Street, as many as 200 people were waiting outside for the store to open at 10 A.M. By late afternoon, a spokesman estimated, the store had doubled the sales it enjoyed at the same time last year. But it was hard to determine yesterday whether the scene at Bloomingdale's was an aberration or the norm.
A Victoria's Secret on East 57th Street was more crowded than usual, while a Banana Republic on Fifth Avenue was less crowded, perhaps because of the cold weather. Also, January is the month when customers receive credit card statements stating, in the starkest of terms, what they owe from that giddy holiday spending spree in December. Widespread frugality traditionally ensues, leaving sales clerks with nothing to do but fold and refold the sweaters on display.
"I don't think it's really a true test," said the general manager at Banana Republic, at Fifth Avenue and 53d Street. "Everyone is spent out."
At the very least, the tax holiday prompted several of the state's politicians to come down with shopping fever. Gov. George E. Pataki went to Macy's at Herald Square. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani visited the Manhattan Mall nearby, then joined the Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, at the Staten Island Mall. And the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, went looking for shirts, ties and a tuxedo along Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens.
Before heading off to browse at Modell's, Mayor Giuliani banged a gong to ring in the day. "I know that dropping the sales tax will bring more commercial activity to New York City," he said. "I know that it will bring more jobs to New York City. And if you see the fear that people around us have of this happening, you realize that I am right."
The bang of a gong signaled the declaration of war, or at least a brief battle, against that shopping haven to the west, New Jersey, where the sales tax is considerably lower. Governor Pataki and the State Legislature instituted the 4 percent state tax reduction -- on clothes and certain other items costing less than $500 each, regardless of the total bill -- in part to test the sense that New York was losing business to New Jersey and surrounding states.
All but 8 of New York's 62 counties chose to match the state's tax exemption. Meanwhile, New York City suspended its 4 percent tax at the same time that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax, of one-quarter of 1 percent, was waived. That translated into an 8.25 percent tax break in the city.
So if Ms. Murphy had spent $100 on clothes at the Gap yesterday, she would have saved $8.25 -- enough to buy two pairs of Gap socks that could have been worn to ward off frostbite on her way home.
Ms. Murphy, a secretary who lives in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan, chose not to buy anything at the Gap. Even so, the sales tax exemption had been enough to lure her from her apartment. "I wouldn't normally come out when it's this cold," she said.
Ms. Murphy was not alone in her arctic expedition. David L. Fisher, a senior vice president at Bloomingdale's, said the store's strong results were part serendipitous, part self-fulfilling. Sales were slightly sluggish last week, which he said indicated that people were waiting for the tax waiver. In addition, Bloomingdale's had called many of its preferred customers to recommend that they wait until the tax holiday to shop. "We advised them that this would be a good time to shop for apparel, shoes and some accessory items like scarves and gloves," he said. "We solicited it."
In fact, shoppers everywhere were finding ways to capitalize on the tax holiday. Customers repeatedly called Jildor's, an upscale shoe store in Cedarhurst, L.I., last week to request that shoes be put aside for them; those customers began returning yesterday to complete their tax free purchases of shoes that generally cost more than $100 a pair.
Sheila Stehlik, a store manager, motioned toward a back room. Inside were shelves stacked with more than 200 reserved boxes of shoes, all labeled with the names of customers.
Over all, the day with little taxation annoyed some and pleased others. Vincent Valentino, the director of the South Bronx Business Improvement District, said the organization had spent $20,000 promoting the tax free week. And so far, he said, he was not pleased with the turnout.
"This should have been done right before Christmas or after Thanksgiving," Mr. Valentino said.
Meanwhile, Beverly Conner and Kisha Lettine resisted the urge to cross the Goethals Bridge to New Jersey and were rewarded with savings at the stores on Staten Island, where they live.
"Of course, we're down here for the tax savings," Ms. Conner said, her arms wrapped around packages. "I usually go to New Jersey," Ms. Lettine said, "but because of the tax free day, I was able to save myself the $4 toll."
This was the reaction hoped for by Governor Pataki, who also did what he could yesterday to promote his Shop New York cause. The Governor, his wife, Libby, and his daughter Allison arrived at Macy's with his pronouncement, "We're here to shop." The family then bought several items, including a sweater and a jacket, at a tax savings of about $12.
As the Governor was leaving the department store, a woman stopped him at the door with a question: "Can you buy me a bottle of perfume."
"Buy you a bottle of perfume?" he said, somewhat stunned. "No."
If the Governor had bought the constituent a bottle of perfume, the gesture would have been magnanimous without being politically useful. In New York, perfume remains a taxable item.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE ISSUES;
Crowded, Ambitious Foreign Policy Agenda Awaits President in New Term

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
There would be enough on the foreign policy plate even if this President were preoccupied with foreign policy. If President Clinton's first term was about minimalist goals -- intervening when absolutely necessary to stop the killing in Haiti and Bosnia, finding a workable China policy, helping to keep Russia from falling apart -- his second term is inevitably more ambitious.
Mr. Clinton would like to preside over an expanded NATO, a Syrian-Israeli settlement in the Middle East, peace in Northern Ireland, and a relationship with both Russia and China that anchors them in the obligations of the community of nations. 
 Some senior European diplomats even worry that a re-elected President, with a bolder, more vocal Secretary of State in Madeleine K. Albright, will overreach. But she describes herself as a "principled pragmatist," looking to make Americans understand how important foreign policy and foreign trade are to their daily jobs and lives.
No one has a very compelling "vision" of this new post-Soviet world, but Ms. Albright, with her experience at the United Nations, is as prepared as anyone to try to persuade Americans, as The Economist magazine suggested last week, of "how alliances and multilateral institutions can enhance and legitimize" American power, "rather than hamper it."
But discussions with State Department, White House and Congressional foreign policy experts suggests that this year's agenda will be dominated by NATO expansion, Russia's opposition to it, China and, of course, the Middle East.
 
NATO and Russia
There is a lot to get done before July. It is then that NATO leaders meet in Madrid, in a trans-Atlantic version of the Oscars, to name the successful candidates for membership in 1999. The oddsmakers are pretty sure about Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but they are uncertain about Slovenia and doubtful about the chances for Slovakia, Romania and everybody else.
But by then, Washington wants to have an understanding with Russia -- sometimes called a charter -- laying out Moscow's security relationship with a "new" NATO and allowing Moscow to have some institutionalized, advisory say on pan-European issues like Bosnia.
The idea is to try to make Russia -- whose transition to a democracy and a market economy without imperial ambitions is supported by Washington -- more comfortable with the enlargement of an alliance set up to defend Europe from Russia. Turning a sense of ostracism into one of inclusion is a difficult trick the charter is supposed to perform.
While Washington does not want to make NATO expansion dependent on the completion of such a charter, important NATO allies like France and even Germany are stressing the need for parallelism. President Jacques Chirac of France said this month that it was "unimaginable" to expand NATO without a complete charter, and senior American officials themselves say that by July, "we need to have a package of understandings that makes concrete the rhetoric of cooperation with Russia."
Tomorrow, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana is expected to be in Moscow to begin such discussions. But with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia still recuperating from his heart operation and pneumonia, the Russian position is hard to read.
Meanwhile, citing the "threat" of NATO enlargement, the Russians are holding off on ratifying the second strategic arms reduction treaty, Start 2, and are making intermittent and possibly idle threats about merging with Belarus and refusing to conclude a border dispute with Estonia.
While backing Mr. Yeltsin, American officials admit their frustration with the stagnant Washington-Moscow relations of the last six months.
Mr. Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, is being allowed more authority to discuss security issues, and he and Vice President Al Gore will have one of their semiannual meetings in the first week of February. Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton are scheduled to have one of their regular summit meetings in March. Still, many American officials believe that talks on a charter will go down to the wire.
Ms. Albright must also try to insure that NATO expansion does not diminish the security of countries that will not join NATO now, like the Baltic states and Ukraine.
 
China
July is also the month the British flag comes down over Hong Kong as it reverts to Chinese rule. Washington regards the manner of China's reabsorption of Hong Kong as a benchmark. Some American officials fear that friction between Hong Kong's democracy advocates and its new Chinese rulers could spark overreaction by Beijing, producing popular revulsion among Americans over closer Sino-American ties.
Last year, the Clinton Administration tried to rebuild a relationship with Beijing on the basis of mutual interests in security, nuclear nonproliferation and trade. The idea is to pull China more firmly into the community of nations, while persauding Beijing that membership also means responsibility on intellectual property rights, arms sales, global trade, regional security and human rights.
While Beijing is cooperative on important questions like the future of collapsing North Korea's nuclear program, it has been less than forthcoming about its nuclear and military cooperation agreements with Pakistan and Iran, has put blunt military pressure on Taiwan, has not adequately opened its huge market to foreign goods and its human-rights record has worsened.
The Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, is due in Washington sometime before March, and Vice President Gore -- taking on more foreign policy responsibility as he burnishes his resume for the 2000 campaign -- is scheduled to visit Beijing.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin is likely to make a state visit here in the autumn, presuming that the Hong Kong hand over goes relatively smoothly, with President Clinton due to visit Beijing in 1998.
 
The Middle East
The special envoy Dennis B. Ross just spent the best part of a month trying to get Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to conclude the details of an agreement already negotiated: the redeployment of Israeli troops in Hebron. The core problem is trust, or the lack of it, complicated by almost total disagreement on the harder issues to come, like the final status of Jerusalem and whether there will be a Palestinian state.
Mr. Clinton is inviting both men, plus the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders, Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein, to Washington meetings to discuss the future.
Mr. Clinton would like Israel to resume peace talks with Syria, but Damascus wants back the Golan Heights, which Mr. Netanyahu intends to keep.
The first task, as aides to Mr. Ross admit, is to see whether Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat are able to meet without an American mediator in the room.
 
Money and Neighbors
Mr. Clinton is eager to make his first Presidential trip to Latin America -- which could take place before the end of March, officials say -- to acknowledge the spread of democracy and promote freer trade. He will also make a trip to Mexico, to congratulate the leaders there for paying off all their emergency loans from Washington last week. But some officials worry that Mexico is not out of danger from unrest and economic mismanagement.
Ms. Albright promises a renewed effort to stop the slide in spending, in real terms, on foreign policy. Leadership, she says -- and as Warren Christopher said before her -- cannot be had "on the cheap." But to make the case, she will need a concerted effort from Mr. Clinton, which he has not yet been willing to make. And the United Nations is expecting its largest debtor to pay its bills.
 
Nailbiters
New tensions over Cyprus have officials extremely worried. The Greek Cypriots have told American diplomats that their purchase of an air-defense system from Russia is only to prepare them for negotiations with the Turkish side. Istanbul does not see it that way, and has threatened war, if necessary, to block deployment.
The Administration will need to rethink its decaying policy of "dual containment" of Iran and Iraq. The Saudis, trying to mask dissent by religious fundamentalists, are pointing at Iran for the bomb that killed 19 American soldiers last year in Dhahran. Iraq's Saddam Hussein remains in place and unbowed. Avoiding military action of some sort in the gulf over the next four years, some officials think, will be difficult.
Conflicts in Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire simmer, with the potential for new genocide in Africa. Northern Ireland is fraying again, with no quick prospect for a renewed ceasefire, let alone peace. The South Koreans need constant hand-holding as North Korea totters. India and Pakistan, both with nuclear weapons, love each other no more than before.
In the former Yugoslavia, where the United States has troops in Bosnia, the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, is teetering and the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, is dying, while an arbitrator's decision on the disputed town of Brcko is due in a month. Most officials consider this a recipe for instability.
And no matter what any American President's goals may be, there is always the Middle East.

HEADLINE: Governor of Puerto Rico Presses Battle for Statehood

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Jan. 13

 BODY:
At his inauguration as Puerto Rico's re-elected Governor earlier this month, Pedro J. Rossello apologized to those who find him "stubborn, obsessive, even intransigent." He then promised more of the same for his next four-year term, including forging ahead with a new plebiscite to get the island and the United States to redefine their nearly century-old relationship once and for all.
"It is the responsibility of this generation, facing the new millennium, to define clearly, decisively and finally the route of our political destiny," Mr. Rossello said from the grounds of El Morro, the four-century-old fort that provided a backdrop of Spanish colonialism for the Governor's reference to what he and other supporters of statehood for Puerto Rico regard as its modern-day American version. 
 The new millennium and next year's 100th anniversary of the Spanish-American War loom heavily on this island as its leadership seeks a permanent political status that leaves behind any vestiges of colonialism. Mr. Rossello provided the momentum last November when he carried his pro-statehood New Progressive Party to its greatest electoral triumph ever by capturing 51 percent of all votes cast, the first absolute majority victory for the party in an election for governor.
Most agree that Mr. Rossello, a 52-year-old pediatric surgeon with no previous experience in an elective office before first winning the governorship in 1992, won more on personality and performance than ideology. His tough anti-crime measures and government-sponsored health insurance program have drawn wide support, and his confrontational style of politics is tempered by a populist image best captured last year when he campaigned in blue jeans and to the beat of the "Macarena," dancing to wild cheering.
But Mr. Rossello also campaigned on a pledge to seek a binding, Congressionally sponsored plebiscite in 1998 that would allow Puerto Rico's 3.7 million residents to choose among statehood, independence, the existing commonwealth or some other form of association with the United States. And the election results are seen by many here and in Washington as a strong demand, if not for statehood, then for the chance to vote on that choice.
"There's no doubt we have a mandate to deal with the decolonization process," said Charlie Rodriguez, the pro-statehood president of the Puerto Rican Senate.
It is unknown whether the current Congress will be any more ready to set out the terms under which the island would be admitted to the union than previous ones, which have failed, despite bipartisan support, to reach a consensus on statehood and the enhanced political and economic benefits that go with it. But statehooders here, fresh from also sweeping both houses of the Legislature, most municipalities and the island's nonvoting seat in Congress in the November election, are confident that they would be able to win a majority in a status referendum, enough to be taken seriously by Congress and prod it into action.
A spokeswoman for Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, said he planned to re-introduce a bill that drew encouraging support last year in the House and that called for a plebiscite next year, ratification by voters and Congress, and a phase-in period to carry out the chosen option by 2010. In a letter to Mr. Rossello last month, President Clinton for the first time promised to work "to establish a process that would enable the fundamental issue of Puerto Rico's political status to finally be resolved."
Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War and Puerto Ricans became American citizens in 1917. Puerto Rico has its own laws, taxes and government but is subject to Federal policy, including military service. Puerto Ricans who live on the island do not pay Federal taxes, cannot vote for President or receive full representation in Congress, and their Federal aid is limited.
Although supporters of the commonwealth status established in 1952 see the relationship with the United States as a bilateral agreement, proponents of statehood and independence shun it as second-class citizenship or colonialism.
The historic ambivalence in Congress over a status change in Puerto Rico is sharply mirrored on the island, primarily because of concerns over the fate of the Spanish language, American citizenship and the island's nationhood under new political formulas. In a nonbinding plebiscite held in 1993, the commonwealth option won 48 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for statehood and 4 percent for independence.
But support for the commonwealth eroded from a previous plebiscite held in 1967, when that option got 60 percent of the vote, compared with 39 percent for statehood. In a recent interview here, Governor Rossello credited the gains in the pro-statehood movement in part to demographics -- young voters, who cast their ballots for him in large numbers, "are more open to change and more confident of their own capabilities," he said.
Mr. Rossello acknowledged that the idea of a 51st state will encounter resistance in the mainland, particularly from those threatened by the growth of the nation's Hispanic population. But he said Puerto Rico has the world's largest unenfranchised population and belies American championship of democracy.
The New Progressive Party sweep came at the expense of the two other political forces on the island, the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party. The Popular Democrats, who say commonwealth status offers Puerto Ricans the best of two worlds, attribute their loss to campaign mistakes and the need of their party to modernize and focus on urban problems.

HEADLINE: Paul Tsongas, Ex-Senator Who Sought Presidency in '92, Dies at 55

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts who was the only candidate in the 1992 Democratic Presidential campaign to offer painful solutions to the nation's economic problems, died last night at a hospital in Boston. He was 55.
Mr. Tsongas, who was hospitalized on Jan. 3 with a liver problem related to his treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph system, and later developed pneumonia, died at Brigham and Women's Hospital, officials told The Associated Press. 
 Mr. Tsongas made his survival from cancer an issue in his Presidential campaign when he and two of his doctors, Dr. Tak Takvorian and Dr. George Canellos, said he had been cancer-free since a bone-marrow transplant in 1986.
In May 1996, he underwent another transplant, getting bone marrow from his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger, to correct myelodysplasia, a bone-marrow disorder common in people who have recovered from lymph cancer.
In seeking the nomination, Mr. Tsongas offered a somber analysis of the nation's economic plight in a book published by his campaign, "Economic Call to Arms." He opposed a tax cut for the middle class but advocated one on capital gains to stimulate investment.
Instead of fire-in-the-belly oratory, Mr. Tsongas offered a wry, self-deprecatory and occasionally moralistic message about responsibility. He began the primariy campaign with a victory in New Hampshire and went on to win in three other states and the caucuses of four states.
He suspended his campaign after losing primaries in Illinois and Michigan. By not formally withdrawing, Mr. Tsongas retained his delegates, which totaled 551 by convention time, but Bill Clinton had more than the 2,145 needed for nomination.
Mr. Tsongas once said three things defined him: working as a young man in his father's dry-cleaning business in the economically depressed city of Lowell, Mass., serving in the Peace Corps and contracting the cancer that interrupted his political career in 1983.
He said the first made him aware of economic hardships; the second brought a joy in public service that led to a political career, and the third, his cancer, tempered what he called an overriding ambition.
"Pre-cancer, I was one of the pettiest people you've ever run into," Mr. Tsongas said in an interview in 1992. "I would get angry at my wife for leaving the top off the toothpaste. I'd get angry at my kids for the dumbest things. Looking back on it I feel mortified. I was a fool."
In his Presidential run, he tried to blend his three defining experiences into a political philosophy, characterizing his emphasis on building the economy as well as maintaining traditional Democratic social programs as "compassionate realism."
At the start of the campaign, Mr. Tsongas used what he said was his victory over the disease in his advertisements, and demonstrated his health by swimming the strenuous butterfly stroke. His doctors said he had been free of the disease after a bone marrow transplant in 1986.
But in April 1992, a few days after the New York primary, Mr. Tsongas conceded that he had been treated in 1987 for a recurrence of the lymphoma. Months after the campaign, Mr. Tsongas said he had erred in not disclosing the recurrence.
He pledged that if he ever ran again, he would submit his medical records to independent experts.
Most of Mr. Tsongas's political career was a triumph against the odds. After serving on the Lowell City Council from 1969 to 1972 and later as a Middlesex County Commissioner, he decided to seek the Congressional seat for his home district in 1974.
He won the Democratic primary with 70 percent of the vote. Then, in the aftermath of Watergate, he defeated the one-term Republican incumbent, Paul W. Cronin, to become the first Democrat to represent the district in about 90 years.
In 1978 he was one of five Democrats who sought to challenge Senator Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts. Mr. Tsongas won the primary with 36 percent of the vote and then defeated Senator Brooke by about 200,000 votes.
On Sept. 29, 1983, when Mr. Tsongas discovered a lump in his groin, he thought it was a hernia, an inconvenience that would interfere with his plans to run in the Boston Marathon. But it was the cancer that would change his life.
What followed was a painful bone marrow transplant that left him with a new sense of his mortality. With that came a desire to spend more time with his family and subsequently a decision to retire from the Senate. He then joined the Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag & Eliot, saying that there he could earn the kind of income that would provide security for his family should he die.
But Mr. Tsongas said he did not want to be remembered only as the Senator who quit his political career because he had cancer.
In part, he said, it was his five-year freedom from cancer that had prompted him to run for the Democratic nomination when President George Bush's popularity was at its high point. But Mr. Tsongas had long coveted the office.
Like President Clinton, Mr. Tsongas was inspired to go into politics by President John F. Kennedy. In 1962, answering Kennedy's call to public service, Mr. Tsongas was among the first young people to join the newly created Peace Corps. He spent two years as a teacher in Ethiopia.
After returning to the United States, he attended Yale Law School and spent two summers working in the Washington office of Representative F. Bradford Morse, a Republican who represented Mr. Tsongas's home district.
Fascinated by the Vietnam War, Mr. Tsongas read about Vietnam and studied its language. He considered becoming a medic with the Green Berets. Instead, after he finished law school, he returned to the Peace Corps as director in the West Indies. Unable to recapture the satisfaction he had felt as a volunteer, he decided to go into politics, this time as a Democrat. Mr. Tsongas attributed the switch to his experience in the Peace Corps and growing up in a declining city.
Paul Efthemios Tsongas was born Feb. 14, 1941, in Lowell, the son of Efthemios and Katina Tsongas, who had immigrated from Greece. Growing up in Lowell after the closing of the textile mills, he keenly felt the plight of its residents. It was a city whose empty factories and stores and jobless workers, he said, reflected the economic troubles of the nation as a whole.
His father, who had missed graduating from Harvard by a semester because of the Depression, owned a modest dry-cleaning business where Paul and his twin sister, Thaleia, worked after school. He straightened hangers, he said, and brooded about not being able to take part in school sports because of the work.
Mr. Tsongas said he had had a respectful and sometimes strained relationship with his father, particularly when the son's growing liberalism conflicted with his father's conservatism. The elder Mr. Tsongas died in 1980, and Paul Tsongas's mother died tuberculosis when he 6.
Survivors include his wife, the former Nicola Sauvage; three daughters, Ashlay, Katina, and Molly, and his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger.
On Dec. 1, 1992, when he disclosed at a news conference that he had developed a new type of lymphoma, Mr. Tsongas exhibited his characteristically dry humor. Asked what he would say if he had been elected President, he replied: "I would love to be standing here today as President-elect. The fact is a lot of people who should have run for President didn't. There was a medical problem with gonads, not lymph nodes."

Mexico Repays Its Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
No sooner had President Clinton bailed out Mexico in 1995, forestalling an economic collapse that might have also sunk other big, emerging markets, than critics warned he could kiss that $12.5 billion goodbye. "You'll never see it again," Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato warned. Last week the Treasury saw it again. Getting a better rate from the international lenders who have returned to Mexico, the Zedillo Government repaid Washington -- and the Administration boasted that it made $560 million in interest.

HEADLINE: The Clinton Principle;
The Vital Center Will Not Hold

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley is a professor of American history at Columbia University and the author most recently of "The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War."

 BODY:
President Clinton approaches his second inauguration with his campaign still running at full throttle. Having spent 1996 embracing the political center so fervently that his Republican opponents were hard-pressed to find an issue on which they disagreed with him, he has been talking ever since of governing from a new "vital center." "The public wants us to work together," he said recently. "I stand ready to forge a coalition of the center. . . ."
 The image of a consensual, bipartisan politics is an old and attractive one. It is also unattainable. Standing above partisanship was a brilliant campaign tactic, but campaigning and governing are two different things. If President Clinton really expects to govern without conflict by identifying an noncontroversial center, his second term wll be even more frustrating than his first. For there is nothing -- either in our history or in the present, fractious political moment -- to suggest that there is a nonpolitical route to progress. 
 There were similar efforts in the first years of the Republic, when most Americans considered the idea of party and faction antithetical to the nation's founding ideals (but which produced some of the bitterest partisan battles in our history); the "era of Good Feeling" after the War of 1812, when the two-party system briefly collapsed and James Monroe was elected President virtually without opposition (an era that also produced extraordinary acrimony and, eventually, another vigorous party system), and Lincoln's effort to produce a national unity government through the Union Party in 1864 (followed by the agonizing politics of Reconstruction). None of them succeeded in the end. In our large, diverse and contentious society, there is rarely any real consensus on anything beyond a few broad principles. And a leader who ceases to take sides simply abdicates his role and hands authority over to his strongest competitors. That is precisely what President Clinton now risks doing.
 We have seen a glimpse of what this strategy would likely produce were the President to pursue it. The election was hardly behind us when he backed away from his longstanding, principled opposition to the balanced-budget amendment -- apparently reluctant to shatter the "era of good feeling" that he is so implausibly trying to create. But nothing would be more damaging to Clinton's hopes than an inflexible requirement that the budget be constantly in balance. The President may not be able to stop Congress from passing the amendment, but to acquiesce now will destroy any influence he might have over the ratification process, where it might still be derailed.
 President Clinton won re-election by targeting his campaign at a small group of middle-class, white swing voters whose impatience with partisan politics borders on disdain. For them, the "vital center" will seem appealing. But those voters will not be working Capitol Hill this year. Highly organized and lavishly funded interest groups will. And interest groups have no incentive to embrace the center; each of them is answerable to the constituency that employs them. A President who shies away from conflict will greatly increase their power.
 Nor does the 105th Congress seem any more likely than the 104th to sign up for membership in the President's "vital center." If anything, the present Republican leadership may be more partisan (even if less vocal about it) than it was in the last session. Newt Gingrich continues to insist that the meltdown of his own political reputation is a result of unscrupulous attacks by his opponents. And Trent Lott -- the personification of the iron fist in the velvet glove -- has proclaimed that he will not cooperate in any effort to reform Medicare unless President Clinton first renounces his own "demagogic" campaign attacks on the Republicans. If the verdict of the electorate was for centrist policies, it was a verdict that seems lost on the Republican leaders in Congress.
 President Clinton's most significant achievements in his first term were the result of arduous partisan struggles. He passed his first budget, substantially lowering the deficit, without a single Republican vote. He both stalled the "Gingrich Revolution" and revived his own campaign by refusing to accept the Republicans' budget in 1995, despite two shutdowns of the Federal Government. By contrast, his ambitious health care reform was tailored to meet conservative objections, and he urged Congressional consensus on the issue. The result was an epic political disaster.
When Arthur Schlesinger published "The Vital Center" in 1948, he surely did not anticipate that its title would be appropriated to describe President Clinton's careful, limited second-term agenda. The problem of democracy, Schlesinger wrote then, was that it failed to inspire much passion and was, therefore, vulnerable to competition from the millennial promises of the totalitarian right and left, and even more to widespread disaffection and apathy. For the "vital center" of democracy to thrive, he wrote, it had to be more than a cautious, pragmatic creed. It had to be a "fighting faith," an arena of struggle "breeding contradiction, breeding strife," capable of answering questions vital to the human condition. If President Clinton wants to create a true "vital center," he will fight for what he believes and exhort others to follow -- not seek a refuge in the myth of a world without politics.

ONE WORLD,
 READY OR NOT
 The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism.
 By William Greider.
 528 pp. New York.
 Simon & Schuster. $27.50. 
 Most thinking Americans, and even some investment bankers, get wind of events in today's global economy and aren't sure what it all means. If you've been baffled by the whirlwind but haven't known where to begin, I wish I could say that William Greider's new jeremiad, "One World, Ready or Not," is the one book you'll need. But it's only half of it.
The truth is there won't be another book this year that grapples more ambitiously with the big picture in political economy -- or which fluctuates so maddeningly between brilliance and fallacy in its analysis. Mr. Greider, the populist critic (and onetime David Stockman confessor) who writes for Rolling Stone, predicts an almost apocalyptic reckoning if upheavals in commerce, finance and societies worldwide go unchecked. The problem is that for all his impressive reporting, imaginative syntheses and moral conviction, Mr. Greider's economics are often sloppy or worse. The result is a paradox. Usually books like this feature compelling diagnoses followed by lame cures. Here, though Mr. Greider mischaracterizes many of our troubles, he's full of important ideas about what we should do about them.
It's hard to do summary justice to Mr. Greider's many-layered argument, but here goes. We live at the dawn of a new age, in which technology has brought transport, communications and computing costs low enough to make production and capital flows truly global. Governments, heeding the Wall Street types who control the terms of public borrowing (and who benefit most from globalization), have pushed the process along through deregulation. While global integration brings undeniable marvels and progress (Islamic women get bank accounts thanks to Motorola's training; British homeowners get cheaper mortgages thanks to George Soros's war on the pound), it also brings social havoc and power that is accountable to no one (Islamic men ask what happened; Brits ask who elected Mr. Soros anyway).
If this sounds a little like the creative destruction of capitalism and its discontents, it is. But Mr. Greider goes farther. New features of global capitalism, he argues, will bring unparalleled inequality and exploitation. The coming power of new computer chips makes job losses from automation look piddling. Worldwide competition drags wages in advanced nations down toward those of the poorest countries. Capital, answerable only to itself, seeks maximum returns, regardless of the dislocations its sudden flight brings or the chaos its burst speculative bubbles can shower. As poor nations race to get into the industrial game and rich ones innovate to stay ahead, the globe is flooded with chronic overproduction, sure to bring mass plant closings and unemployment. With labor unorganized or suppressed, inhuman treatment becomes routine.
Worse, Mr. Greider says, there's no obvious fixer. At the dawn of this century, a time of similar abuse, governments could step in with minimum wage, child labor and workplace safety laws that saved rampant capitalism from itself (and the states from bidding against one another to get jobs). No international authority exists that can similarly temper the global market's excesses. Instead, governments everywhere are in retreat, unable to appease angry constituents yet scaling back services, tax bases and safety nets to lure multinationals and keep bond traders happy. All in all, Mr. Greider concludes, it's a recipe for social meltdown and financial disaster, unless we reverse our unthinking deference to the dictates of global business and capital, and fast.
While spinning out this cataclysmic vision, Mr. Greider's rich reporting brings the global economic beast to life in all its splendor and horror. The biggest assembly plant in the world -- a hundred acres of Boeing engineering miracles under one giant roof -- inspires awe at human ingenuity; girls locked and killed inside a tinderbox Thai sweatshop prompt revulsion at human indifference. Mr. Greider shows the perpetual ambiguity of events from the global citizen's point of view: when Boeing transfers production to China in exchange for access to its market, Mr. Greider is torn between lamenting the loss of good American jobs and cheering the Chinese, for whom plane building offers a path out of poverty. He also denounces the hypocrisy of global elites, like financiers who preach the virtues of free markets 364 days a year, until Mexico collapses and they need a little "big government" to bail out their bad bets.
But while the social concerns raised by Mr. Greider's reporting are surely valid, his almost Marxist prophecies of doom flow from some basic economic confusions. His contention, for example, that wages here will inexorably fall to third-world levels ignores the fact that American workers are still far more productive than their counterparts (and thus can earn far more without pricing American goods out of world markets). For all the talk of globalization, moreover, tradable goods account for only one-fifth of our economy. If you're a textile worker in South Carolina, yes, you're in trouble; but most workers' wage woes have more to do with getting United States productivity moving even higher and the premium new technologies place on having greater skills.
In addition, while certain industries, like steel, see new factories mysteriously financed even in the face of existing surplus, there's little evidence of the global supply glut Mr. Greider repeatedly stresses. If he were right, we'd expect Depression-era rates of unemployment, plummeting prices and stock markets, and very low interest rates, thanks to the savings surplus that would accompany underconsumption. We have none of these. Similar fallacies mar Mr. Greider's views on many other issues, from trade deficits and the economy's growth potential to the structure of demand and the causes and cures of our Great Depression. Readers otherwise sympathetic to Mr. Greider's ambitious project will learn to bleep over them.
But economists (whose role as the arbiters of much public debate Mr. Greider regrets) will seize on these errors to dimiss the book outright. That's a mistake. You don't need to agree we're facing apocalypse soon to know we're facing spiraling unfairness already, or to admit that Mr. Greider's right when he says all whose Christmas list included Asian-made toys are probably complicit in exploiting the weak. Indeed, his moral passion is a rebuke to the petty obsessions of many modern economists, and a tonic for today's fainthearted debates.
Mr. Greider rightly calls on governments to moderate (not derail) the pace of this latest industrial revolution and push the global system toward more equitable outcomes. This means refusing to yield a society's destiny to multinationals or financiers unfettered by social obligation. He'd restore some controls on capital flows; tax wealth more heavily while slashing payroll levies that punish work; ask trading nations to honor labor rights or face tariffs; and subsidize low-wage employment to assure a decent life for those not equipped to thrive in the high-tech age. A new commitment to "lifting the bottom" is Mr. Greider's sensible answer to the downward pressures the global economy brings.
Like James Fallows and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. before him, Mr. Greider urges American elites to wake up and pursue a Japanese model of national interest, rather than cling to pretty trade theories that sanction the loss of major industries. He'd renew Louis O. Kelso and Senator Russell B. Long's worthy efforts to increase employee ownership, steps that might let market incentives triumph while making everyman a capitalist. And his plea for our best minds to fashion a new ideology for a world now truly indivisible ("global humanism," he tentatively calls it) is inspiring.
Many of Mr. Greider's proposals -- such as transaction taxes to damp currency speculation, and labor agreements in trade deals -- would take multilateral action to work, no small feat. And some of his tics, like his endless Fed-bashing, are off base. But challenges like Mr. Greider's to establishment nostrums and powerful interests are rare. In a season when politicians seem determined to make no large plans, Mr. Greider's ideas deserve wide debate. They made me question many of my assumptions. Given the choice between economists with little passion for justice and progressive journalists like Mr. Greider with little patience for economics, it's the latter who stand the best chance of pointing us to a brighter world.

Paradoxical Reign of the King of Steel

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
With streams of flame and showers of fire, white-hot ingots and yellow-hot rails, muscle pitted against metal and the smoke-blackened faces of sweating men, tonight's "American Experience" brings back the beginnings of America's age of steel.
"The Richest Man in the World: Andrew Carnegie" is the story of the king of steel: the boy from an impoverished family in Scotland and the Slabtown section of Pittsburgh who became his adopted country's master of industry and its most prodigious philanthropist. But the program is considerably more than an upward-and-onward tale as it tries to get at the character of a man who squeezed customers, subverted competitors, betrayed partners and beat down workers in the bare-knuckle capitalism of the late 19th century, yet also enhanced the lives of his employees and of many other Americans. 
 The evening's historians, much abetted by the evocative photographs for which "The American Experience" is justly known, trace Carnegie's feelings for workers to his father's ruin by the steam-powered looms that put Britain's hand-loom weavers out of work in the mid-1800's and drove the Carnegie family to America. From his father he may have inherited radical anti-privilege notions, but it was his mother, with whom he lived until her death, when he was 51 years old, who is credited or blamed for fueling his drive for success, whatever the price in egalitarian ideals.
His career, vividly sketched in these two hours, is in the Horatio Alger mode, except that Carnegie worked harder and with fewer scruples than any Alger hero. Operating in a man's world of railroads, coal, iron and finally steel, he makes today's power players of Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood seem like sissies.
But even at his toughest, he presented himself as the worker's friend. Whether his proclaimed philosophy that what profits business profits everyone was hypocrisy or self-deception or an early faith in supply-side economics, you can decide.
The bloody 1892 conflict at his Homestead, Pa., factory town receives the attention it demands. The way Carnegie distanced himself from his company's clash with a strong union evidenced his determination to win without being forced to face up to the meaning of such a victory for his principle that workers have a right to organize. He left the battle, involving Pinkerton detectives, strikebreakers and the state militia, to his manager, Henry Clay Frick, who was not known to be burdened by a social conscience. Carnegie cheered him on privately from Scotland.
Carnegie won that fight, as he won most of his fights; there would not be another steel workers' union for 45 years. But, as the narrator notes, "His image as a radical reformer, so carefully cultivated, was in shambles." When Carnegie set foot in Homestead a few years later, it was to dedicate one of his libraries.

'We Meet Again . . .'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Only 13 times in American history has a President delivered a second inaugural address.
Consider the changes the second time around: 
 George Washington's second, notable for its brevity, seemed to invite criticism. The indispensable man swore an additional oath that if he knowingly violated the Government's injunctions, "I may (besides incurring constitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all. . . ." (Second-term upbraidings came, and President Washington was annoyed.)
Madison's second was mired in the conduct of the War of 1812, and Monroe switched emphasis in his second to foreign affairs. The seconds of Jackson, Grant and McKinley were unexceptional, but Lincoln's second revealed the searing change that four war years made in him.
"With malice toward none" begins the peroration by which it is remembered. Less remarked is the way he asserted national unity by calling for peace not between North and South, but "among ourselves" -- as individual Americans in all sections.
His first inaugural had been a legal argument against secession and a warning that he would fight for the Union, but his second was a mysterious sermon to justify the war's unforeseen suffering. Taking as text Matthew 18:7, he dared suggest that the long agony of both sides was in expiation for the nation's sin of slavery.
Lincoln wrote later to a friend that although the speech would "wear well," he did not expect it to be immediately popular: "Men are not flattered by being shown that there is a difference of purpose between the Almighty and them." No second-term President in our century made such a reach into religion.
Woodrow Wilson's first peroration was the most thrilling of all: "Men's hearts wait upon us; men's lives hang in the balance. . . . Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares fail to try?" But impending war forced him to start his second with "the shadows that now lie dark upon our path . . ."
F.D.R.'s second used the perfect ecclesiastical verb for the occasion -- "reconsecrate" -- but pressed the politics of a new New Deal by seeing "one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished."
Eisenhower, in his first, sternly saw freedom pitted against slavery; in his second, after smiling "we meet again," he took as his theme "the price of peace," offering hope though not help to "those nations which, now captive, long for freedom."
Nixon's first was inspirational, his second uninspired. Reagan's second was consistent with his first, proud of the economic rebound, memorable for his evocation of the political friendship made late in their lives of John Adams and anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson, who both died on the Fourth of July, 1826.
Of all the second inaugural addresses, the most vindictive was Jefferson's. His first had been conciliatory, but in his second, after taking credit for cutting taxes, he launched a diatribe against the media. "The artillery of the press has been levelled against us," he seethed, "charged with whatever its licentiousness could devise or dare." He was thinking less of the critics of his extraconstitutional Louisiana Purchase than the "falsehood and defamation" of the journalist James Thomson Callender, who had accused him of siring the children of a slave mistress as well as trying to seduce the wife of an absent neighbor.
Jefferson gloated at the public's "cool and collected" reaction to "these outrages" that resulted in his overwhelming re-election, which he found "consolatory to the friend of man who believes he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs."
Though cautioning that "no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness," the furious friend of man noted ominously, "he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law."
Our 13 second inaugurals have ranged from mean-spirited to high-minded, from boring to stirring, but most revealed a striking change in the man taking the oath and his message to the people.
Clinton must know his first fell short; Americans will listen intently to his second, wishing him and one another well in this once-in-a-generation moment of reconsecration.

HEADLINE: Promoting Technology In America's Rural Areas

BYLINE: By DAN CARNEY 

 BODY:
Senator Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, does not have the polish or erudition of most senators. He has no college degree, no expensive suits and few pretensions. On most days when the Senate is in session, he can be found telling stories about his ranching and farming constituents, people he once described as "awful good folks."
His legislative interests include Western land policies, farm price supports -- and Federal policy on encryption software. Like many of his colleagues who represent rural areas, Mr. Burns maintains a keen interest in technology and telecommunications issues. 
 The interest of legislators like Senator Burns -- not to mention two House members from the Appalachian part of Virginia, Robert W. Goodlatte, a Republican, Rick Boucher, a Democrat; Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Republican of Vermont; Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota; Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia -- is based largely on the theory that the information revolution is the best hope for economic development of their remote districts.
Their theory is that people and whole companies will migrate to places with lower labor costs and a higher quality of life once they are freed of the need to live and work in close proximity to customers and fellow employees.
"Rural America will gain enormously from advances in telecommunications," Mr. Boucher argues. "We have a low-cost business environment, an excellent work force, a superb quality of life. What we're lacking is telecommunications services."
With a determination that evokes earlier decades of the 20th century, when rural legislators pushed to get electricity and telephone service to their districts, the lawmakers are active on two technological fronts. The first is local telecommunications issues, particularly making sure high-speed transmission lines come to small towns. These lawmakers helped write "universal service" language into the 1996 telecommunications bill; some have gone even further.
Mr. Boucher, for instance, helped four towns in his district with populations of less than 10,000 bypass the local phone company and install their own fiber optic networks, which can handle far greater amounts of information than traditional copper telephone wires.
On the other front, they are devising the broad operating principles for the Internet. These include such things as a new copyright law that will allow publishers, film makers, songwriters and others to sell their products on the Internet without fear they will be illegally copied and circulated. These issues also include encryption policies that let companies and individuals protect confidential communications from hackers or competitors.
Rural legislators would like to see the Internet become a medium where employer, employee, producer and consumer can interact efficiently and securely. When that happens, they believe, physical proximity will be less important to commerce and employment and more people will move to small towns.
To this end, Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Boucher are trying to write a new copyright law that will function in a medium in which copying is extremely easy. On a parallel track, the 65-nation World Intellectual Property Organization approved two copyright treaties in December that will be up for ratification in the Senate this year. The issue of copyright law and digital technologies is complex, and understood by only a few members of Congress -- many of them representing rural areas.
Encryption is critical to rural lawmakers because it is used to encode and decode electronic communications. Software producers believe encryption programs will be as fundamental to security in the information age as the lock and key are now.
The issue pits business groups and self-described cyberlibertarians against Federal law enforcement and security agencies, which fear their ability to conduct surveillance will be greatly curtailed. The rural lawmakers come down on the side of business and the libertarians. Mr. Burns, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Goodlatte all have bills to ease restrictions on the use of encryption programs.
Neither of these issues has come to a vote. They are complicated and have not been give priority by the Republican leadership in either house. But they both could see some action this year. For now, their biggest champions are rural lawmakers.
All of this interest in the Internet and technology raises the question: are these lawmakers onto something or is this just the latest economic development fad that will go the way of business incubators and lavish tax concessions for foreign auto plants?
While the answer is still unclear, there is some evidence this may be more than a fad. After decades of almost unbroken decline, rural America has reached parity with metropolitan America in population growth. The average growth rate in rural counties started approaching that of metropolitan counties in the early 1990's and caught up in 1995, according to an Agriculture Department demographer, Calvin Beale.
And while communications technology is not solely responsible for this reversal of fortune, it certainly has played a role. William Beyers, a professor of geography at the University of Washington has studied a number of economically growing rural counties and found them full of independent consultants, contractors, brokers and other types of professionals that use modern telecommunications (along with some leg work) to serve customers around the country and around the world.
"It's not just the Internet, though that gets all the hype," Professor Beyers said. "It's good old-fashioned file transfer and even telephones." File transfer refers to a direct link from one computer to another without the Internet.
In one of his studies, he found that 40 percent of the new companies in rural areas were primarily serving customers outside of their regions.
Many of them are small professional companies, sometimes just a single person, that are commonly called lone eagles. They might be a graphic arts studio in New Mexico that does most of its business in Texas, or a stockbroker who has fled Los Angeles for the more pristine environment of Washington State. Though not primarily telecommunications companies, they rely on Internet technology to gather information and talk with customers.
In addition to these tiny companies, some major corporations have made telecommunications-related shifts that have benefited a few communities. Availing themselves of the lower labor costs, banks, credit card companies, airlines, telephone companies and a host of other businesses have put big switchboard operations and information centers in small towns. A call to directory assistance in the Washington, D.C., area, for instance, is routed to a bank of operators in Mr. Boucher's district in the southwest corner of Virginia.
But there is still no guarantee that rural America will benefit any more from the approaching technological era than from previous ones.
"It's not a silver bullet, but it's not a fad either," said Bob Rowe, Public Service Commissioner of Montana. Mr. Rowe said that rural areas could benefit from the new technologies, but only if people formed local networks and learned how to use them to their own benefit.
In this sense, information is no different from other technologies. Those who learn how to exploit it most effectively will prosper.
Some critics point out that rural America already has an up-to-date system capable of carrying vast amounts of information around the world. It's called a telephone, and it did not stop the exodus out of small towns this century.
Others argue that while changes in telecommunications may hurt big American cities, there is no guarantee that the beneficiaries of this will be small American towns.
"There's no reason it stops in Fargo, N. D., or wherever," said Andrew Blau of the telecommunications-oriented Benton Foundation. "Maybe it goes on to Malaysia or Mexico. It goes right past our borders, goes over our fence into the Southern Hemisphere."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: CONNECTIONS;
Making the Internet come to you, through 'push' technology.

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein 

 BODY:
I HAVE seen the future. It may work but it is very pushy.
Using catchers, whackers, finders, savers and casters -- software that has a slightly different attitude from passively casual browsers -- a nascent industry is trying to create a new model for the use of the Internet, one that will have almost nothing to do with hyperlinks, cyberspace or the electronic frontier. The goal is to make the Internet come to you, not the other way around. 
 This is being called "push" technology and is one of the hottest areas of Internet development. Microsoft and Netscape are planning to incorporate it into future software releases. Apple plans to use it to update software automatically. And right now, custom-designed news reports are being pushed into PC's, most famously via Pointcast with 1.7 million users of its free software (http:// www.pointcast.com) automatically getting reports from CNN, Wired and other publications including this newspaper. There are even commercial programs like Web Ex and Web Whacker that offer virtually a utopian promise: the software bears the burden of waiting on line; sites are downloaded for quick viewing, free of crashes and pauses. Off-line dipping replaces on-line surfing.
The startling thing about the interest in this technology is the built-in contradictions. It promises freedom from the very aspects of the Internet that have been so highly praised -- the spur-of-the-moment discoveries, the libertarian freedom from predetermined form and content. Each advantage of the Net has become a disadvantage when seen through the prism of push.
During the usual "pull" usage of the Net, we grope about, grasping sites with laborious dedication. The idea behind push technology is that the viewer becomes more passive; the material is thrust out of cyberspace, following a custom-built series of requests. It is more like home delivery than browsing, more like TV than PC.
Push technology is more appealing for making money on the Internet. Sites are guaranteed more visitors, which means that they can offer advertisers more attractive audiences. Advertisers' banners and images are inserted on the home PC, and may have greater impact because they are part of requested material. Gradually, there may come to be a kind of junk mail that will fill Web browsers along with E-mail boxes. If the Web is to have any economic future, it may be founded on the basis of pushing rather than pulling.
The promise of push, the value it adds, is its delivery of organized, edited information -- information that has been requested, things often hard to come by on the Net. And a wide variety of experiments testing how much such a service should be employed are in progress. The New Century Network (http://www.newcentury.net) calls itself the best of America's newspapers" and includes, in rather haphazard form, an anthology of news and information. (New Century is partly owned by The New York Times Company.)
New Century's contents are designed by its editors and delivered wholesale. A custom-designed result can be created on the Newspage site (http://www.newspage.com), where an individual profile will create a "daily custom newspaper," compiling sources ranging from industry trade magazines to wire services.
Pointcast is almost completely a matter of push. Theoretically it is like having a personalized ticker tape and news service: all news, all the time, all over the PC. Imitators have emerged, like Intermind Communicator (http://www.intermind.com). One new push-meister, Marimba (http://www.marimba.com), promises to do for software updates what Pointcast has done for news (Apple will be using their technology for self-updating software).
Push technology may ultimately be pushing the Net into a form of computer radio, and indeed, one of the most conveniently pushy objects I have recently tried has been the $149 Newscatcher from Global Village Communication, which regularly delivers news headlines and information to the PC via a radio network; its main problem is the brevity of the information.
Newscatcher was so appealing, though, partly because it managed to avoid many of the problems of push technology in its infancy: awkwardness, messiness, slowness. Automatic downloads can cause system crashes, eat up memory, clutter the PC with as much junk as accumulated magazines waiting to be read.
It was great to be able to read the lead news articles in The Boston Globe and The Los Angeles Times courtesy of Pointcast, but downloads were more time consuming than just leaping to those newspaper's Web sites via the traditional, now crusty browsers.
Not even commercial packages were completely satisfying. This kind of software requires a user with very specific desires, with a clear notion of which sites and which information needs to be regularly accumulated. But sometimes that can only be discovered through browsing.
Ultimately, the best form of push technology may be a sort that makes the Net almost irrelevant except as a vast sea to be explored at will by smart agents that fish at our request. The ultimate push will be the creation of custom-built channels, an individualized on-line service that is built when a user is off line. The numbers of channels is potentially infinite, with each one bearing the stamp of the user's desires.
By the time that happens, the Internet will have evolved into a utility more than a technological novelty, a convenience rather than a mode of consciousness. And as we channel-surf through these programs, delivered for our entertainment and enlightenment, push will have really come to pull.

HEADLINE: Latin Democracies Do Not Need F-16's

 BODY:
If President Clinton cherishes the democratic and economic revival that has transformed much of Latin America in the 1990's, he will overrule the recommendations of his departing Secretaries of Defense and State and maintain the ban on exporting advanced weapons to the region.
The Pentagon, pleading the case of American arms exporters and eager potential customers like the Chilean military, has long favored elimination of the restrictions. The ban was first imposed by President Carter in response to the belligerent rhetoric and human rights abuses of Latin American military regimes. The State Department, reflecting the Administration's goal of curbing regional arms races and encouraging poor countries to shift scarce resources from military to civilian needs, argued for maintaining the ban. 
 But just before leaving office, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has reconsidered his views and joined with outgoing Defense Secretary William Perry in recommending an end to the ban. Madeleine Albright, nominated as Mr. Christopher's successor, has generally championed restraints on arms sales, but has not yet specifically addressed the Latin American question.
Those who favor arms sales note that with the exception of Cuba, all Latin American governments are now headed by elected civilians. But selling expensive, high-tech weapons like F-16 fighter planes is no way to nurture these developing democracies. Significantly, the loudest Latin voice for unrestricted arms sales comes from Chile, where the military is not yet under full civilian control. If F-16's are sold to Chile, neighbors like Argentina and Brazil will feel compelled to catch up.
Although the United States is the largest arms seller to Latin America, other countries also sell weapons to the region and some are ready to sell high-tech equipment. But when Belarus recently sold two types of advanced aircraft to Peru, Washington rightly tried to discourage the deals, warning that they threatened regional stability. It is hard to see why that logic should not apply to American sales as well.

HEADLINE: My Kingdom for a Sound Stage

BYLINE: By LINDA LEE 

 BODY:
From the void come giant raptors and Michael J. Fox, music videos and lava flows, commercials and chat shows. But first comes the void, the sound stage.
Nature abhors a vacuum. The movie and television industries adore it, or at least an unused space of 10,000 square feet -- equal to two basketball courts -- that is 35 feet high and has no columns or windows. 
 Television networks have proliferated in recent years, and the number of films released by studios last year rose 11 percent over 1995. This has meant the physical scope of those movies has grown, as well as the demand for sound stages -- not just in Los Angeles County but in New York, London and parts of Europe.
"The motion picture industry is running up against capacity constraints," said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation. And, he added, "think of television: the actual number of productions, features, TV series, movies of the week, cable channels."
"Both cable and computer hit at the same time," added Mitchell E. Stokes, vice president of the John Alle Company, a real estate brokerage firm. "Music video is a whole separate cottage industry. And they all need stages. There's never been as much demand in the western Los Angeles County area, as well as Burbank, for studio space." The current 306 sound stages are overbooked.
So, after 40 years in which sound stages were torn down and back lots turned into condominium developments and office towers, the Los Angeles area is at the beginning of a stage-building boom. Last May, CBS opened three new sound stages in Studio City. This May, Disney will open two more in Burbank. In July, Shamrock Holdings Inc. and CFN/Flesch & Neuhauser will break ground in Manhattan Beach for 14 new sound stages.
If Dreamworks answers local community objections, there could be 15 new sound stages in Playa Del Rey. Currently, there is 3.8 million square feet of sound stage space available in and around Los Angeles; the Manhattan Beach and Dreamworks complexes, when completed, will add another 750,000 square feet.
All these projects will fall within a radius of 30 miles from the Hollywood intersection of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega. "That's the center of the studio zone," said Fred Baron, senior vice president of feature production for 20th Century Fox. "And you want to be as close to that as possible." Beyond that 30-mile zone, union contracts require additional travel stipends.
Any large space inside that zone -- be it a warehouse, hanger or decommissioned factory -- is fair game for conversion. Bring in the lights, the cameras, the rigging.
It's not just that there are more companies creating programs, films and videos for more outlets. The insatiable appetite for capturing the fantastic on film -- the same appetite that drives special effects companies to top themselves -- drives producers to seek bigger spaces. Everything from 55-foot-high Bat Caves to shots of the destruction wreaked by volcanoes or floods, requires what film makers call "scale" (and other people call "space").
"You really have fights over the sound stages," said Gary Martin, president of production and administration for Sony's Columbia Tri-Star. "If anyone goes over schedule, the other guy has to get in. We tell them which end of the set to strike first, because we have to get started building."
The demand for studio space has driven up rental costs to the point at which they are "back where they were when it was the highest, like 1985," said Vince Vellardita, who runs Studio West production operations in Los Angeles County. The growth has been a bonanza for real estate agents after the decline of the aerospace industry and the crash in home prices this decade.
"In '92, you could get stages cheaper," Mr. Vellardita said. "But right now there's no space available, so prices are really high." He said he rented 10,000 square feet for $10,000 to $15,000 a week. Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens offers its largest stage -- 26,000 square feet -- for around $15,000 a week.
In New York, buildings on piers in the Hudson River, empty armories in Harlem and in Park Slope in Brooklyn and old buildings on 10th Avenue near 14th Street have joined the Silvercup & Kaufman studios as production centers for television ("Spin City," "Cosby" and "Law and Order") and films like "Ransom" and "First Wives Club." A 15,000-square-foot sound stage in the Silver Screen Studios at Chelsea Piers in New York would rent for $15,000 a week, according to Darryl Jefferson, who manages the studio -- but "Spin City" has already booked it for the year.
Some producers sound downright grumpy about the situation. Ron Schwary, a producer of "Scent of a Woman" (shot at Kaufman Astoria Studios) and "The Mirror Has Two Faces" (at the 142d Street Armory) could not get a sound stage in New York for "Meet Joe Black," which will star Brad Pitt. It will be shot, instead, at an armory in Park Slope.
"The only stage that's decent is Kaufman Astoria," Mr. Schwary said, "and it's tied up with 'Cosby.' "
"It's tight in New York, and in London," said Robert Relyea, head of physical production for MGM/UA. "And London has spread to Europe. It's spreading east." To shoot "Goldeneye," the last James Bond film, Mr. Relyea had wanted to use the football-field-sized, 45,000-square- foot "007" stage at Pinewood Studios, 20 miles west of London. "Didn't work out," he said. The stage was being used for "Mary Reilly." "So we found this Rolls-Royce helicopter engine factory."
In addition to the increasing demand for filmed entertainment, concessions by craft unions have made it easier to produce shows, and local governments from London to New York are selling their cities as ideal for film work.
But while other venues are competing for business, Los Angeles has a natural advantage. "You find more and more people who like the idea of going home to their family and sleeping in their own beds," said Bruce Hendricks, the executive vice president of motion picture production for Walt Disney Studios. Then, too, studios have become somewhat reluctant to let big-budget pictures go off for extended periods to Hawaii, where they -- and their cost overruns -- are more difficult for studio executives to track.
Most of the studio sound stages are dominated by television production. "Television used to be a very seasonal business," said Richard Nelson, senior vice president for back lot operations at Paramount. "It would shut down late March, April and pick up in July. Now with pilots and replacements we're busy right through the year."
Then there is the issue of scale, especially pressing this year with mammoth movies like "Titanic," "The Lost World" (the sequel to "Jurassic Park") and "Batman and Robin."
"When you have a 'Titanic,' there's no such thing as a miniature," said Bill Mechanic, the chairman of 20th Century Fox. "Last summer, with 'Independence Day,' 'The Rock,' 'Mission Impossible' and 'Twister,' you had four big movies, all about scale."
"What producers are looking for now," said the economist Jack Kyser, "are big, big spaces with lots of access on the sides."
That means spaces like the Spruce Goose Hangar in Playa Del Rey, where part of "Independence Day" was shot, or the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach, Calif. Warner Brothers has leased the Dome for five years, and it is there that "Batman and Robin" has built its biggest sets.
"There is almost nothing that can't be done on film now," said Joel Schumacher, the director of "Batman and Robin." "But you've got to build something fantastic. You need a lot of space." After "Batman and Robin" finishes shooting this month at the Dome (where Howard Hughes stored an enormous airplane, called the Spruce Goose because it was made of wood), the Bat Cave and Wayne Manor will remain, awaiting the next Batman movie. The rental cost: $1 million a year. ( About 75,000 square feet will remain open for other productions.)
"What I assume is that it's cheaper to hold it there than to raze everything and start over," Mr. Schumacher said.
The movie business, however, is cyclical; the current boom may not last. "You will reach a point of saturation sooner or later," Mr. Kyser said, "and then people will go to the best stages, like Shamrock in Manhattan Beach. It's a great location."
AS Mr. Martin of Columbia Tri-Star said, "You go three or four years and you can't get a stage, and then two years later, you can't give them away."

Chart: "The View From Los Angeles"
There are more than 300 sound stages in the greater Los Angeles area, owned by television studios, film studios and small entertainment companies. Here's what the major studios have.
 
20th Century Fox: Century City, 18 sound stages. Less than an acre of back lot. A new soundstage and tank (for water scenes) in Mexico and one under construction in Australia.
 
MGM/UA: Santa Monica, no sound stages, no back lot. (After selling its sound stages, the studio rents what it needs.)
 
Paramount: Hollywood, 32 sound stages, 9 tanks, 63 acres of back lot. (Replicas of 7 New York intersections cover 5 acres.)
 
Universal: Burbank, 32 stages, 415 acres of back lot. An expansion is planned.
 
Warner Brothers: Burbank, 29 sound stages, 105 acres; Hollywood, 7 sound stages; near Burbank, 5 stages, 50 acres of back lot. Three new sound stages planned in Burbank.
 
Walt Disney Studios: Burbank, 5 sound stages; 700 acres of back lot in Acton, 20 miles north of Los Angeles. Two new sound stages to open in Burbank this spring.

HEADLINE: Vision and Reform

 BODY:
The arctic temperature gripping Washington this weekend is not the only blast of inclement weather surrounding the inauguration. President Clinton's oath-taking today takes place in an atmosphere chilled by scandal, contentiousness and widespread public disappointment in the ethics of Mr. Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This is a moment when both parties need to pause and think soberly about past mistakes and put forward an agenda to drive tainted money, reckless fund-raising and special interests out of national campaigns. The problem is that like their leaders, both national parties are in denial about the public's deep-rooted fervor for clean politics and the equally deep-rooted longing for trustworthy leaders.
Inaugural speeches must offer an expansive vision, but they also need a strong, specific anchor. The issue of clean politics, therefore, offers a huge opportunity for Mr. Clinton to step forward in a largely unoccupied area of leadership. We hope to hear at the heart of Mr. Clinton's speech a pledge to clean up his party's fund-raising practices and push Congress toward the campaign reform promised in his first inaugural address. With that commitment as a foundation, Mr. Clinton can use his speech to convey a sense of broad national purpose that is energizing, responsive and realistic on many fronts. 
 Since Mr. Clinton will be making the last inaugural address of the 20th century, he needs to guide Americans toward his vision of the century to come. Based on advance word from the White House, it sounds as if he will try to do just that. The President, his aides say, intends to focus on an appeal for racial healing, as well as programs to help Americans adjust to an economy driven by revolutions in information and technology. We hope that in the process he will build on one of the finest moments of his first term, when he defended affirmative action as a necessary tool to redress the heavy legacy of racial injustice in America.
Four years ago, Mr. Clinton's inauguration speech seemed to usher in a new era of government activism. Now, marking a different approach, he must say how government can still prepare Americans for rapid economic changes while honoring his new-found commitment to a balanced budget. Recent economic improvements may make it easier to reduce the deficit, but eliminating the deficit altogether will be extremely difficult if Mr. Clinton is also to preserve education, environment and health programs and reform welfare without warring against the undefended poor. Mr. Clinton's greatest gifts lie in summoning Americans to a sense of community, and starting today, on these issues, those abilities will be tested to their utmost.
In preparing for the subject, he would do well to look at the valedictory comments by departing Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who noted in a recent speech that growing economic inequality in the United States is jeopardizing the social compact that has long kept the country together. A similar breaking apart of the compact can be seen in the attempts by some to turn Social Security into a voluntary investment program in which the well-to-do would inevitably benefit the most and to let public education atrophy for lack of funds.
In foreign policy, the most urgent philosophical issue Mr. Clinton needs to join is how to square the United States' economic interests with its human rights and security concerns, particularly with China. The President has done more than his recent predecessors to educate Americans on the importance of competing for markets and investments abroad. But he has not told Americans how the country can keep pace economically and still push for its values and for curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other arms.
More than most re-elected Presidents, Mr. Clinton still comes across to Americans as unfinished and unpredictable. It is particularly interesting that his inauguration has been preceded by a revealing glimpse of his Presidency in the form of Dick Morris's book, "Behind the Oval Office." It portrays Mr. Clinton as endlessly torn by conflicting impulses, defending and attacking government at the same time and being wary of just about all his advisers -- a solitary man for all his gregariousness.
After all the gyrations and reinventions of the last four years, the public hungers for a President who presents a clearer image because both his goals and personality are fixed. History will remember Mr. Clinton for winning re-election, but it will measure him by what he learned from the victory. Bill Clinton's second inaugural address will be our first report on that question.

HEADLINE: Paul Tsongas, Who Made Presidential Bid, Dies at 55

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT 

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts who was the only candidate in the 1992 Democratic Presidential campaign to offer painful solutions to the nation's economic problems, died on Saturday at a hospital in Boston. He was 55.
Mr. Tsongas, who was hospitalized on Jan. 3 with a liver problem related to his treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph system, and later developed pneumonia, died at Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
 Mr. Tsongas made his survival from cancer an issue in his Presidential campaign when he and two of his doctors, Dr. Tak Takvorian and Dr. George P. Canellos, said he had been cancer-free since a bone-marrow transplant in 1986.
In May 1996, he underwent another transplant, getting bone marrow from his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger, to correct myelodysplasia, a bone-marrow disorder that can occur in people who have recovered from lymph cancer.
In seeking the nomination in 1992, Mr. Tsongas offered a somber analysis of the nation's economic plight in a book published by his campaign, "Economic Call to Arms." He opposed a tax cut for the middle class but advocated one on capital gains to stimulate investment.
Instead of fire-in-the-belly oratory, Mr. Tsongas offered a wry, self-deprecatory and occasionally moralistic message about responsibility. He began the primary campaign with a victory in New Hampshire and went on to win three other state primaries and the caucuses of four states.
He suspended his campaign after losing primaries in Illinois and Michigan. Bill Clinton went on to win the nomination and the Presidency.
After leaving the Presidential race, Mr. Tsongas practiced law and, with former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, a Republican, helped start the Concord Coalition, a nonprofit group that focused attention on the budget deficit and other economic problems.
He also remained active in public affairs in his home state.
Mr. Tsongas once said three things defined him: working as a young man in his father's dry-cleaning business in the economically depressed city of Lowell, Mass., serving in the Peace Corps and contracting the cancer that interrupted his political career in 1983.
He said the first made him aware of economic hardships; the second brought a joy in public service that led to a political career, and the third tempered what he called an overriding ambition.
"Pre-cancer, I was one of the pettiest people you've ever run into," Mr. Tsongas said in an interview in 1992. "I would get angry at my wife for leaving the top off the toothpaste. I'd get angry at my kids for the dumbest things. Looking back on it I feel mortified. I was a fool."
In his Presidential run, he tried to blend his three defining experiences into a political philosophy, characterizing his emphasis on building the economy as well as maintaining traditional Democratic social programs as "compassionate realism."
At the start of the campaign, Mr. Tsongas used what he said was his victory over the disease in his advertisements, and demonstrated his health by swimming the strenuous butterfly stroke.
But in April 1992, a few days after the New York primary, Mr. Tsongas said that he had been treated in 1987 for a recurrence of the lymphoma. Months after the campaign, Mr. Tsongas said he had erred in not disclosing the recurrence.
He pledged that if he ever ran again, he would submit his medical records to independent experts.
Mr. Tsongas began his political career on the Lowell City Council, on which he served from 1969 to 1972. He later became a Middlesex County Commissioner. In 1974, he defeated Representative Paul W. Cronin, a Republican, to become the district's first Democratic member of Congress in about 90 years.
In 1978, he defeated Senator Edward W. Brooke, a two-term Republican, with 55 percent of the vote.
On Sept. 29, 1983, when Mr. Tsongas discovered a lump in his groin, he thought it was a hernia, an inconvenience that would interfere with his plans to run in the Boston Marathon. But it was the cancer that would change his life.
What followed was a painful bone marrow transplant that left him with a new sense of his mortality. With that came a desire to spend more time with his family and subsequently a decision to retire from the Senate. He then joined the Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag & Eliot, saying that there he could earn the kind of income that would provide security for his family should he die.
But Mr. Tsongas said he did not want to be remembered only as the Senator who quit his political career because he had cancer.
In part, he said, it was his five-year freedom from cancer that had prompted him to run for the Democratic nomination when President George Bush's popularity was at its high point in 1991. But Mr. Tsongas had long coveted the office.
Like President Clinton, Mr. Tsongas was inspired to go into politics by President John F. Kennedy. In 1962, answering President Kennedy's call to public service, Mr. Tsongas was among the first young people to join the new Peace Corps. He spent two years as a teacher in Ethiopia.
He then attended Yale Law School and spent two summers working in the Washington office of Representative F. Bradford Morse, a Republican who represented Mr. Tsongas's home district.
Fascinated by the Vietnam War, Mr. Tsongas read about Vietnam and studied its language. He considered becoming a medic with the Green Berets. Instead, after he finished law school, he became a Peace Corps director in the West Indies. Unable to recapture the satisfaction he had felt as a volunteer, he decided to go into politics, this time as a Democrat. Mr. Tsongas attributed the switch to his experience in the Peace Corps and growing up in a declining city.
Paul Efthemios Tsongas was born Feb. 14, 1941, in Lowell, the son of Efthemios and Katina Tsongas, immigrants from Greece. Growing up in Lowell after the closing of the textile mills, he keenly felt the plight of its residents. It was a city whose empty factories and stores and jobless workers, he said, reflected the troubles of the nation as a whole.
His father, who had missed graduating from Harvard by a semester because of the Depression, owned a modest dry-cleaning business where Paul and Thaleia worked after school. He straightened hangers, he said, and brooded about not being able to take part in school sports because of the work.
Mr. Tsongas said he had a respectful and sometimes strained relationship with his father, particularly when the son's growing liberalism conflicted with his father's conservatism. The elder Mr. Tsongas died in 1980, and Paul Tsongas's mother died of tuberculosis when he was 6.
Survivors include his wife, the former Nicola Sauvage; three daughters, Ashley, Katina and Molly, and his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger.
On Dec. 1, 1992, when he disclosed at a news conference that he had developed another type of lymphoma, Mr. Tsongas exhibited his dry humor. Asked what he would say if he had been elected President, he replied: "I would love to be standing here today as President-elect. The fact is a lot of people who should have run for President didn't. There was a medical problem with gonads, not lymph nodes."

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Of the East? Try Malaysia

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 19

 BODY:
Malaysia's Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, made a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley last week, calling on the area's companies to join in an ambitious effort to build a replica of the region in his nation.
Speaking here before a group of Silicon Valley executives, Mr. Mahathir sketched out a vision of a 25-year plan to build a "multimedia supercorridor" that would stretch south from Kuala Lumpur, the capital, to the city's new international airport, which is under construction. 
The 9-mile-by-30-mile area, which would include two new cities and a computer network designed to exceed those in the world's most advanced technology centers, would be created in part with generous tax and financial incentives by which the Malaysians are hoping to attract hundreds of corporations to build research and development as well as manufacturing operations.
"Fantastic changes are taking place which make what was impossible in the old economy of the Industrial Age suddenly possible in the new world of the Information Age," Mr. Mahathir said.
Mr. Mahathir met on Wednesday with William H. Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, and on Thursday with a group of Silicon Valley leaders including Jim Barksdale, president of the Netscape Communications Corporation; Larry Ellison, chairman of the Oracle Corporation; Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc., and Lew Platt, chairman of the Hewlett-Packard Company.
A number of industry leaders have agreed to serve on an advisory group for the Malaysian project, and at least one of the companies, Sun Microsystems, has already agreed to locate a software development group in the region.
While American companies for years have been making high-technology products in Asia for the United States market, Silicon Valley executives are growing more interested in opportunities to sell in the region, where economies are growing more rapidly than in other parts of the world. To develop products for these markets, many executives believe that the companies need to base development staffs closer to them.
Malaysia's plan is an effort to move beyond manufacturing to high-technology development, and the Prime Minister pledged that in addition to the financial incentives the project holds out, his Government was in the process of passing laws that would be attractive to high-technology companies. He said these would include new legal structures to accommodate electronic commerce, intellectual property protection and a promise not to censor the Internet.
Several Silicon Valley leaders said they believed that in the economic wars of the future, regions like the planned Malaysian corridor would provide America with some of its fiercest competition.
"This will be the new challenge," said John Morgridge, chairman of Cisco Systems, a computer networking firm based in San Jose, Calif. "It won't be missiles that they are sending over here."
This competition could even extend to sensitive issues like computer encryption technology. In response to a reporter's question, Mr. Mahathir said that because the United States, for security reasons, had placed strict export controls on data-scrambling technology it would be necessary for his country to develop similar hardware and software independently.
The Government plans to begin construction on the two cities before the end of the century, according to the Prime Minister. One is to be the new seat of the Government, and it is expected to have a population of 250,000. The second city, to be named Cyberjava, is to be an education and research and development center, and it is projected to have 100,000 residents.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Phones on Go And Talk Is Cheaper

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
When Keiko Takei moved into a new apartment in May, she did not bother ordering telephone service. She simply began using her mobile phone as her home phone as well.
Miss Takei, a 27-year-old employee of a trading company, is using the Personal Handyphone System, known as P.H.S., a kind of poor man's cellular service that has attracted 4.3 million users in just the 18 months it has been offered. Many of these new customers are young people who previously could not afford a mobile phone. 
 The quick growth of P.H.S. subscriptions, as well as the deregulation and falling prices of conventional cellular phones, has turned Japan almost overnight into one of the world's fastest-growing markets for mobile telephones, with more than one million subscribers signing up each month, or one every two seconds.
Just three years ago, the low use of mobile phones in Japan was seen as a prime example of how over-regulation and high prices were retarding Japan's advance into the information age. Only 1.5 percent of the population had a mobile phone, one-third the rate in the United States.
But by the end of October, 16.4 percent of the Japanese population had a mobile phone, a slightly higher rate than in the United States and, indeed, the highest in the world outside of Scandinavia.
For Japan, the rapid growth of cellular phones and P.H.S. stands as a prime example of the changes that can be wrought by telecommunications deregulation, something that is being contemplated for other parts of the nation's economy.
Mobile telecommunications has become a driving force of Japan's economy. Capital investment by the mobile telephone industry is expected to exceed $15 billion this fiscal year, more than the investments by either the chemical, automobile or steel industries. And earnings from the telecommunications sector are helping cushion electronics companies from the adverse effects of the collapse of memory chip prices.
Japan's Government and industry are also pushing, with some success, for other countries to adopt the P.H.S. technology. P.H.S. mobile service is expected to begin this year in Thailand, and then perhaps in Australia, Hong Kong and Indonesia. Recently, China, a potentially huge market, agreed to set aside some radio frequencies for P.H.S. service. Other countries, including Argentina, Guatemala and Uruguay, will use P.H.S. technology for basic phone service because it is faster to build a wireless network than to install a wired one.
P.H.S. is not likely to be accepted in the United States because such phones do not work in fast-moving cars. But P.H.S. is similar in concept to some of the personal communications services, or P.C.S., that are being introduced in the United States.
The experience in Japan, where P.H.S. service has been operating since July 1995, could serve as a preview of what might be expected in the United States as American cities served until now by only two cellular phone companies are opened to as many as three P.C.S. providers.
In Japan, P.H.S. phones are being sold for as little as 1 yen (or about 1 cent) to lure subscribers. P.H.S. subscriptions are being sold in convenience stores and even vending machines. Cellular phone prices have plummeted as well.
But if growth is buoyant, profits are virtually nonexistent for the mobile telephone service providers, which are accumulating huge debts building their networks and subsidizing the sales of the phones at low prices. Some industry executives expect a brutal shakeout.
"My concern is if competition further accelerates, the weaker carriers may be forced to fold and we will see at that stage whether customers are happy or not," said Takeo Tsukada, president of the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation, a provider of conventional cellular service.
The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation deployed the world's first cellular phone system in 1979. But prices were so high that barely anyone used such phones.
As recently as three years ago, it cost about $450 to sign up for cellular service and $130 a month as a subscription fee, plus calling charges. The Japanese Government required customers to rent their phones from the service provider, paying about $600 a year.
The turnabout in the market started in April 1994, when the Japanese Government moved to deregulate the mobile phone industry, allowing customers to buy their own phones and permitting two digital cellular service providers to compete with the two existing companies that provided conventional service.
Competition further intensified in mid-1995 with the start-up of P.H.S. service, which is offered by three companies. The leader, with about half the market, is the DDI Corporation, a competitor to NTT in the long-distance and cellular markets. The two others are NTT and the Astel Group, a new company backed by 155 corporations including the Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui & Company and Toyota.
P.H.S. phones are similar in concept to cellular telephones, which work by breaking a city up into blocks, or cells, each served by a separate antenna. As a car moves from one cell to another, the cellular call is automatically handed off from one antenna to the other.
But P.H.S. does not provide the high-speed handoff from one cell to the next, so it cannot be used in fast-moving cars and trains. Still, the lack of handoff capability allows P.H.S. to be cheaper than cellular service.
Because it takes so many antennas to cover an area, P.H.S. will probably not be economical outside of densely populated regions. There are already about 300,000 P.H.S. antennas in the Tokyo area alone,
The introduction of P.H.S. did not eat into sales of regular cellular telephones; indeed, P.H.S. apparently gave them a huge boost. Many people attracted by the publicity surrounding P.H.S. chose regular cellular phones when they saw the shortcomings of P.H.S.
Cellular providers, in response to the threat of P.H.S. and their own deregulation, cut prices sharply. The sign-up fee for a cellular phone, which was $450 three years ago, fell to about $60 last year and was eliminated entirely by some companies in December. There are 16.5 million cellular subscribers in Japan, about four times as many as for P.H.S.
So far, cellular phones have been used mainly by business executives, while P.H.S. is becoming more of a consumer item. About 10 percent of the P.H.S. users are teen-agers.
P.H.S. service has a sign-up fee of 7,200 yen, or about $62, and a monthly fee of 2,700 yen, or about $23. A local call costs 40 yen for three minutes, much less than the 150 yen for a cellular phone call and only slightly more than the 30 yen for a pay phone.
In Japan, ordering a home phone costs about $700, so some people find it more economical to just get a P.H.S. phone.
Japan is now starting to deal with some of the social problems raised by mobile phones, especially their potential to disturb people nearby. Service providers are running advertisements urging people to be polite in the use of the phones. And some phones now come with a "whisper mode," which enables callers in a crowd to whisper.

HEADLINE: World Trade Body Opposes Canadian Magazine Tariffs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The United States appears to have won an important skirmish with Canada over trade restrictions on intellectual products like magazines, a development that could strengthen Washington's case against cultural protection trade policies used by many other countries.
The World Trade Organization, which decides issues among more than 120 nations that trade with each other, ruled on Thursday night that Canada could not try to ban the Canadian editions of magazines from the United States by imposing heavy excise taxes or other measures that throttle trade, including favorable postal rates for domestic magazines. 
 The ruling was preliminary, but it was considered unlikely that the trade organization would change its mind before reaching a final decision next month.
Canada has long contended that it needs to keep out the Canadian editions of magazines like Sports Illustrated to protect the country's own modest magazine industry.
The regular editions of magazines from the United States can easily be found at most newsstands, where only about 20 percent of the magazines displayed come from Canada. But unlike the Canadian editions, the regular editions contain no advertising specifically for or by Canadians.
The complaint filed by the United States Office of the Trade Representative argued that the excise tax and other measures constituted an attempt to ban the Canadian editions of United States magazines and thus violated international trading conventions that Canada had already agreed to follow.
Canada uses a range of trade restrictions and legal limitations to protect books, films, television and radio broadcasts and other aspects of what it considers its cultural heritage from American domination. Such products are excluded from the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but are covered by trade agreements overseen by the World Trade Organization.
Officials in Ottawa argue that culture cannot be treated the same way as auto parts or other goods that cross international borders.
"Essentially, the Americans are trying to get culture back on the table," the president of the Canadian Magazine Publishers Association, Catherine Keachie, said in a statement. "They're trying to bully what they couldn't bargain in open negotiations with Canada."
Trade analysts have said that a victory before the World Trade Organization, one of the most influential trade bodies in the world, would bolster the United States' position and pave the way for future challenges in other countries.
At issue in the complaint against Canada is what are called "split runs" or local editions of magazines from the United States. For example, in 1993 Sports Illustrated, a division of Time Warner Inc., started to publish a Canadian edition in which most of the editorial content came from the United States. A few Canadian stories were usually added.
But since the original advertising sold in the United States more than covered publication costs, the magazine could sell advertising in the local edition to Canadian companies at rock-bottom rates.
Trade officials in Ottawa argued this was a kind of dumping, intended to put competitors out of business. To fight back, in December 1995, the Canadian Government imposed an 80 percent excise tax on advertising sold in Canada for each weekly edition of Sports Illustrated.
Sports Illustrated stopped publishing a Canadian edition then because the tax would have forced up the price of the magazine to a level that consumers would have rejected.
Now, Nicholas P. Wattson, sales manager for Sports Illustrated in Toronto, says that there are no plans to start publishing another Canadian edition soon.
"We're not chomping at the bit to come back into this market," he said.
Ottawa is still trying to assess the full impact of the decision. Nicole Bourget, a spokeswoman for the International Trade Minister, Arthur Eggleton, who was on a trade mission to East Asia, said that Canada still had a chance to submit additional arguments, or appeal a final ruling.

HEADLINE: With State Budget, First Impressions May Deceive

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
At first blush, New York State's balance sheet looks pretty good. The state, more flush with cash than in many years, expects to end its fiscal year March 31 with a $1.3 billion surplus, thanks to a strong economy and a boom on Wall Street.
But independent analysts say that Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed $66.1 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 squanders a rare chance to use the surplus to correct longterm problems, instead making them worse. They liken the budget to someone using a windfall to live beyond his means for a while, rather than following the wiser course of paying off credit card balances, fixing the roof and putting something away for an emergency. 
 One problem, critics say, is that the state would have a $768 million shortfall in the portion of the budget financed by state taxes, using money left over from this year's surplus to make up the difference. Spending would remain about the same, even as tax cuts reduce revenue, creating a problem when the surplus runs out.
"This budget's not balanced, and it drives large deficits in the years to come," said Cynthia B. Green, vice president for state studies at the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group that analyzes the state's and New York City's spending. "It's bad public policy. When you have a surplus, you use it for one-time expenditures. You use it to pay down debt. You should not roll a surplus over."
But John Signor, a spokesman for the Governor's budget office, offered a vigorous defense of what he called "a responsible, well-balanced plan," and added a sharp rejoinder to Mr. Pataki's critics. "These are the same people who for the first two years said we were out of balance," he said. "They said the sky was falling. They were wrong."
The underlying assumptions in Mr. Pataki's plan are a bit optimistic but reasonable, analysts say, though they caution that, six years into an economic expansion, a downturn is always possible. The budget envisions that the economy will grow at the same rate as in 1996, that the stock market will rise 15 percent and that personal income growth in New York will slow somewhat.
Mr. Signor noted that the Governor's chief Democratic adversary, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, has maintained that, if anything, Mr. Pataki had underestimated revenues for the coming year. In his first two years in office, Mr. Pataki, helped by a strong economy, cut the budget gap the state faced the following year. "We've made substantial progress, so if you look at the big picture, we're moving in the right direction," Mr. Signor said. "Why don't they come up with a list of where we can save a billion dollars?"
Still, an official at a major bond-rating company, speaking on condition of anonymity, had this assessment: "The budget works for '97-98, but beyond that, there's trouble."
New York has by far the largest debt of any state, and analysts contend that it should use the surplus to make early payments on some of that borrowing, reducing the principal and lowering future interest payments. But under Mr. Pataki's budget, the debt would continue to grow.
The Governor's proposed budget anticipates that the state would have to spend $3 billion, or 9.5 percent of all state tax revenue, to make payments on that debt. The median among the states is 3.5 percent, said Robert A. Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. New Jersey spends less than 3 percent, while Connecticut spends more than 13 percent.
Mr. Pataki boasted last week that with his budget, the state's rainy-day fund, a cushion that can be used to soften the blow of a recession, would swell to $332 million, "the greatest level since it was created a half-century ago." But New York is hobbled by a provision of the State Constitution that prohibits putting more than two-tenths of 1 percent of the general fund, or about $63 million next year, into the reserve fund in any year. Many far smaller states keep a bigger emergency reserve than New York does. "It's clearly an area where New York State lags tremendously," Mr. Kurtter said "I mean, little Indiana has $2 billion."
On average, he said, states have reserves of about 5 percent of annual state tax revenue. With the increase Mr. Pataki proposes, New York's reserve would grow to 1 percent of state taxes. New Jersey's is $440 million and Connecticut's $241 million, each about 3 percent.
"When we have surplus, a good portion of it should be committed to reserve," said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is seen as a possible 1998 challenger to Mr. Pataki.
Medicaid presents an area of major uncertainty for New York, as for other states, because no one can be sure how fast medical costs will rise. The Governor's budget anticipates that unrestrained, Medicaid expenses will rise 5.7 percent,
Last week, the Congressional Budget Office projected Medicaid inflation nationwide at 7.8 percent, down from its projection of 9.7 percent six months ago. The Citizens Budget Commission predicts that in New York, it will fall between 5.9 percent and 8.5 percent. The Greater New York Hospital Association says it will be less than 5 percent, and bond raters, too, think the state's estimates are high.
"The numbers depend heavily on the number of people enrolled in Medicaid, and that could fluctuate widely with changes in the economy, and in Federal policy," said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a health care research organization in Manhattan. "It's a very hard area to predict."

Fancy Talk Aside, Cuts Mean Hunger

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
THE Rev. William A. Greenlaw stood in the middle of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles' soup kitchen, at Ninth Avenue and 28th Street, while a line of dejected-looking men filed past. Each carried a tray with a helping of scalloped ham, carrots and bread, and, on the side, a handful of incongruously festive Christmas candies. Few of the men looked up from their trays as they walked by.
"There's a meanspiritedness in this that's an indictment against our whole society," Father Greenlaw said, struggling to be heard over the rattling trays and scraping chairs. Then he quickly added, "But I don't believe that the people of New York want to be that meanspirited." 
 Father Greenlaw was talking about changes to the welfare system, specifically about a new provision of Federal law that could end food stamp eligibility for thousands of New Yorkers starting next month. Under the provision, able-bodied, childless adults under age 50 who are not working at least 20 hours a week can receive no more than three months of food stamps every three years.
There is, however, a way to sidestep the provision that 11 states, including Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio, have already pursued. To soften the provision's impact, Congress allowed states to apply for waivers for regions where there are "insufficient jobs." In New York, several regions, including New York City, would qualify for such a waiver if the state applied.
But Gov. George E. Pataki has chosen not to. Instead of seeking the broadest possible waiver, he has sought a narrow one that would apply only to regions with unemployment rates above 10 percent. In New York, no such regions actually exist.
Advocates for the poor and religious leaders, like Father Greenlaw, have widely deplored the Governor's decision and assert that as many as 100,000 people could go hungry as a result. They are particularly disturbed, they say, because food stamps, unlike other welfare programs, are paid for solely by the Federal Government. Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, estimates that without the waiver, the state's residents will lose up to $80 million a year in Federal aid.
"Isn't the job of a governor to make sure he maximizes Federal revenues?" she said.
SO far, at least, Mr. Pataki has refused to be drawn personally into the debate, leaving it to aides to respond. Much of their effort has gone into challenging the dire predictions about the measure's impact.
Administration officials maintain that most of the people affected by the new Federal law are already required by state rules to work or to enroll in workfare programs and, as a consequence, will remain eligible for food stamps. They calculate that at the very most, 17,000 people might lose their benefits and that, ultimately, local governments will find workfare slots for these people as well.
The Governor's aides have also challenged the whole notion that New York ought be seeking Federal money for the poor just because it is available.
"It is unfortunate that some people out there are talking about money instead of human beings," said John Signor, a spokesman for the State Budget Division. "We don't look at it as additional money. We look at it as trying to move people out of the web of dependency."
He continued, "The welfare lobby wants to keep people dependent on the government."
Critics of the administration counter that Mr. Pataki's decision not to apply for a broad waiver is less a matter of social welfare philosophy than political calculation. The Governor frequently boasts that thousands of new jobs have been created in the state since he took office. Were he to apply for a broad waiver, the gesture could be interpreted -- at least by his political opponents -- as an admission of the state's continuing economic weakness.
"It is so offensive to the Governor to declare that we don't have enough jobs," Ms. Krueger said, "that he is prepared to lose $250 million over the next three years."
IN the meantime, letters have already started to go out to thousands of food stamp recipients warning them about the impending changes.
A homeless woman who gave her name only as Gila and was waiting to see a counselor outside the Holy Apostles soup kitchen said that she had received her letter and was worried about what to do when her three months were up.
"How are you supposed to survive the other months?" she asked.
A homeless man who identified himself as Tyrone Robinson "and a failure," also said that he had received a letter. He then searched for it, unsuccessfully, among the various admonitory letters from the city's welfare agency that he carried folded in his pockets.
He was evasive when asked whether he would try to find a workfare position to maintain his eligibility for food stamps. And he seemed less angry about the change than resigned to it, explaining, "I knew it was coming."

HEADLINE: Russia and U.S. Are at War (But Only if You're Driving)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 19

 BODY:
With the American flag fluttering from his limousine, the top United States diplomat here rode out of his embassy on Thursday.
But no sooner had the car belonging to the diplomat, John Tefft, passed through the embassy gates than it was stopped by the Russian traffic police on Moscow's Garden Ring road. 
 After a check of official documents, the diplomat's car was allowed to drive on. But there seemed little mistaking the message to American officials:
Russia would retaliate for an embarrassing series of traffic violations its diplomats had been accused of in New York. And not even even Mr. Tefft, the charge d'affaires and senior American diplomat here pending the appointment of a new ambassador, would be exempt.
"They were hitting really hard," an American official said today, referring to the recent, and highly unusual, road checks of American diplomats.
For four decades, Moscow and Washington were bitter political adversaries. But now, with the cold war behind them, Russia and the United States appear to be embroiled in a tit-for-tat traffic war.
Ever since a Russian envoy and his Belarussian colleague were accused late last month of abusing their diplomatic status and becoming involved in an altercation with New York police officers, Russia's Foreign Ministry has responded with howls of indignant protest.
And articles have appeared in the Russian press accusing Western diplomats of drunkenness and irresponsible behavior on Russia's anything-goes highways.
But the latest twist is something Moscow's traffic police call "Operation Foreigner." On Thursday, the first day of the campaign, according to a police spokesman, traffic officers stopped 1,000 foreign-owned cars. More than 200 violations of traffic rules were discovered, he said, most committed by Americans.
Russian traffic officials publicly insist that they are merely trying to maintain order in the disorderly scrum that typifies Moscow's road travel. But Western officials, as well as many Russians, trace the crackdown to politics.
Certainly, Russia's feud with New York's police department contrasts markedly with the approach taken by Georgia. When a Georgian diplomat was accused earlier this month of causing a fatal accident in Washington, the Georgian Government apologized and stripped the envoy of his diplomatic immunity so that he could be prosecuted.
But then, Georgia is seeking to strengthen its economic and diplomatic ties with the West while the Russians see their run-in with the New York police as the latest in a series of painful humilations.
Russia's dust-up with the New York police began last month when Russian and Belarussian diplomats scuffled with the police after being accused of parking near a fire hydrant and seeking to drive while intoxicated.
It intensified last Monday, when New York police officers ticketed the limousine of the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations three times for illegal parking.
Three days later the Moscow police launched "Operation Foreigner," with Americans, British and French diplomats apparently receiving the brunt of the attention. Over the weekend, however, the number of road checks appeared to decrease.
Singling out Americans is a simple task since their cars display telltale license plates, with the numerals "004" identifying their nationality. The letter "D" identifies diplomats. The letter "K" is used to identify foreign correspondents.
In addition to Mr. Tefft, the embassy's chief of protocol was stopped three times on the way between the ambassador's residence and the embassy.
The American Embassy is still in the process of compiling a statistical record of the road checks. But one official said today that when Mr. Tefft asked at a meeting of senior American officials about their recent experiences driving in Moscow, "everyone had a story to tell."

HEADLINE: G.I.'s Might Get Even More for Less

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In the daily life of American soldiers, few perks are as prized as shopping at the base department store, which sells almost everything from lingerie to lawn fertilizer at cut-rate prices.
But regulations adopted in 1949 to protect mom-and-pop stores outside the base from unfair Government competition also spell out in quirky detail what the military stores, or post exchanges, cannot sell. 
 The exchanges, called P.X.'s by generations of G.I.'s, may sell television sets, for example, but none with screens larger than 27 inches. They may sell rugs, but none larger than 9 by 12 feet. And they may sell cheaper, ready-to-assemble furniture, but not fancy mahogany dining tables.
The Pentagon has proposed lifting the remaining restrictions next month, arguing that family businesses have largely succumbed to big discounters like Kmart and Wal-Mart, and that troops are clamoring for big-screen TV's, high-end computers, foreign-made microwave ovens and other products the exchanges are barred from selling.
"The dynamics in the retail sector render these restrictions obsolete and present an unfair burden to our servicemen and women," Frederick Pang, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, wrote to the House and Senate military committees recently.
But under intense lobbying from trade associations representing big retailers like Circuit City, Montgomery Ward and Sears, Roebuck & Company, as well as many Main Street merchants, the House National Security Committee has ordered the Pentagon to wait until Congress holds hearings on the matter.
"Many businesses and chambers of commerce see this as a tremendously unfair advantage for the P.X.'s," said Representative Walter B. Jones Jr., a North Carolina Republican who has three military bases in his district and who sits on a special House panel that is responsible for the "morale, welfare and recreation" of the armed forces.
The dispute has caught lawmakers on the House panel between their duties to improve the benefits of the all-volunteer military -- a vital incentive in recruiting and retaining a top-quality force -- and the economic interests of constituents who are small-business owners.
"It's a very sensitive issue in that we have to balance the interests of the soldiers and the local community folks," said Representative Saxby Chambliss, a Georgia Republican on the House panel.
The Senate, which in the past has supported lifting the restrictions, is now taking a wait-and-see approach, pending any House hearings.
Though Congress may be cool to the Pentagon plan, it is a big hit with the troops and their advocates.
"We fully support lifting the restrictions," said Sydney T. Hickey, associate director for government relations for the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group in Alexandria, Va. "These regulations were done to protect mom-and-pop stores outside the gate. They ain't there no more, and it's difficult to see how Wal-Mart is a mom-and-pop."
At Bolling Air Force Base's exchange here, where as many as 6,000 customers a day are served on weekends, military personnel voiced strong support for the proposal.
"It's a great idea," said Lieut. Bill Shea, a 26-year-old Air Force logistics planner, who was browsing for compact disks. "Right now, the big-ticket items is where they are really limited."
Lieut. Steve Smith, a 28-year-old Navy officer, said he spends as much as $200 a month at the exchange, and added, "More selection would be better."
Since the first exchange opened in 1895, the stores have sold merchandise to troops, veterans and their families at prices averaging 25 percent below what other commercial stores charge. That's a big difference for any service member, but particularly for a young sailor or private earning $20,000 a year. Exchanges have lower retail markups, charge no sales tax and offer cheaper financing than their commercial rivals.
Unlike the military commissaries -- groceries that receive a $1 billion annual Federal subsidy -- the exchanges are largely self-supporting. Last year, the military's 360 exchanges earned $307.5 million on $9.2 billion in sales.
About two-thirds of the profits go toward building and maintaining recreational activities on bases, like golf courses and bowling alleys.
But exchange sales and the corresponding dividends to recreation funds, another important quality-of-life account, have been declining as the military has shrunk to just under 1.5 million troops from 2.1 million a decade ago.
Pentagon officials say expanding the exchanges' wares could increase annual sales by about $106 million and bring in an additional $18.4 million a year for more bowling alleys, day-care centers and swimming pools on military bases.
This would mean waiving the limits not only on TV's and rugs sold, but also on diamond rings (only one carat and below are sold now), electrical appliances that cost more than $81.75 (ruling out high-end bread makers and juicers) and some foreign-made goods, like small microwave ovens built in Korea.
"In today's retail world, the current system just doesn't make sense," said Robert F. Swarts, a retired Air Force major general who heads the American Logistics Association, a group of companies that supply the exchanges and support the Pentagon plan.
But the powerful retail lobby on Capitol Hill is fighting hard to knock down the proposal, warning that unfair Government competition will drive even more small retailers out of business and hurt the communities surrounding military bases.
"What we're saying is, 'Philosophically, this is too much,' " said John J. Motley, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Retail Federation in Washington. "It'll undermine the local tax bases."
A compromise may be in the offing: to let each base commander decide which of the 13 remaining restricted retail categories to lift, depending on the local economy. "That," Representative Jones said, "would be a step in the right direction."

HEADLINE: Slower Growth in Number of Prisoners

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The rapid growth in the number of people in the nation's jails and prisons slowed last year for the first time in a decade, according to a study released yesterday by the Justice Department, reflecting at least in part a decline in the crime rate over the past five years.
At the end of June 1996, there were 1,630,940 people in Federal and state prisons and local jails, an increase of 4.4 percent over the previous year, compared with an average annual growth rate of 7.8 percent in the last decade, the study found. 
 The growth rate slowed most noticeably in city and county jails, rising only 2.3 percent last year after increasing by an average of 6.9 percent over the previous decade. Inmates sentenced to jail usually serve a term of a year or less.
The slowing in the overall growth rate "is good news; it could be an early reflection in the incarceration rate of the drop in crime over the last five years," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie-Mellon University.
But Professor Blumstein and some other experts tempered their enthusiasm, noting that a slower growth rate in one year could be a random fluctuation. It will take a few years to confirm whether this is a real trend, he said, noting that the slowdown was not dramatic and that the incarceration rate grew last year despite the five-year drop in the crime rate.
In fact, Franklin Zimring, the director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute of the University of California at Berkeley, suggested that because the incarceration rate has continued to increase even as crime has fallen, the number of people in prison "tells us more about our feelings about crime and criminals" and about changes in sentencing laws than about the the actual crime rate.
The total number of people in jails and prisons doubled over the last decade and tripled over the last 20 years as politicians pushed for tougher sentencing laws and for building more prisons in response to mounting public fears about violent crime. The national incarceration rate was 615 inmates per 100,000 Americans last year, up from 313 per 100,000 in 1985.
One reason it is difficult to calculate precisely why the incarceration rate goes up or down is that there is enormous variation in prison populations among states and regions. The new study found, for example, that the District of Columbia had the highest number of prisoners per capita, 1,444 per 100,000 residents, followed by Texas with 659, Louisiana with 611 and Oklahoma with 580. But states in the northern Midwest and northern New England tend to have much lower rates. North Dakota had 90 per 100,000, followed by Minnesota with 108 and Maine with 112.
The South had the highest imprisonment rate with an average of 487 prisoners per 100,000 people, and the Northeast had the lowest, with 306.
An important factor in explaining why the prison population has continued to grow, while the crime rate began to decline in 1992, experts say, is that the crime which has led to the largest increase in incarceration, the sale and possession of drugs, is not counted in the F.B.I.'s crime index. Over the last 10 years, Professor Blumstein estimated, drug offenders accounted for about half the growth in the prison population.
The crime index tracks four violent crimes (murder, aggravated assault, robbery and rape) and four property crimes (burglary, auto theft, arson and larceny, or minor thefts like like shoplifting). Murder has dropped the fastest of the crimes included in the index, though the murders make up only a very small part of the total number of crimes.
Another reason the number of prison inmates has continued to increase, despite the decline in serious and violent crimes, is that it often takes a year or longer for offenders to be tried and sentenced to prison.
It is unclear whether the slower growth in the prison population could be interpreted as a sign that tougher sentencing laws are successful. While experts agree that building more prisons may reduce crime by removing some career criminals from the streets, they have long argued about whether the threat of harsher sentences deters criminals.
Professor Zimring said he was skeptical about a deterrent effect because the prison population has tripled in 20 years while the crime rate has oscillated in a slim range.
But Steven Levitt, an economist at Harvard University who studies the effectiveness of prisons and police, said, "The underlying amount of crime would have grown faster had we not locked so many people up."
To measure the effectiveness of imprisonment in reducing crimes, Professor Levitt has studied the results of successful prisoner lawsuits to reduce overcrowding.
In 12 states where such suits resulted in a judge's decision to reduce overcrowding, he said, the growth rate of those states' prison population was 12 percent slower than that of the nation over the next three years, while the violent crime rate in those states exceeded the national average by about 10 percent. Similarly, the property crime rate in those 12 states surpassed the national average by about 6 percent in the three years after the lawsuits.
Although Professor Levitt acknowledged that using prisons to fight crime was costly in both human and dollar terms, he said the new figures showing slower growth in the incarceration rate "are a very clear indication" of the nationwide drop in crime since 1992. "I would not be surprised over the next five years to see more falling crime rates accompanied by continuing small increases in the prison population," he said.
"It is conceivable that we have gotten over the hump, or cleared the peak of the fight against crime," Professor Levitt said.
The new report released yesterday was written by Darrell Gilliard and Allen J. Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the Justice Department.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE OVERVIEW;
Americans Foresee Harmony in Capital

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
On the eve of President Clinton's second inauguration on Monday, the American people and their political leaders said they had high hopes for uncommon bipartisan cooperation even as the capital was riven by battles over the ethics controversies enveloping both parties.
But while the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that the public is optimistic that there will be harmony, it also makes clear that Americans have lower expectations about what they view as particularly intractable problems facing the nation. Far fewer than half of those polled expect progress toward balancing the budget, restraining entitlement costs and reforming the way campaigns are financed. 
 In another manifestation of the public's upbeat feeling but caution about the future, Americans give a higher rating to the way things are going in the country today than they did four years ago. But they are more uncertain about the future than they were when Mr. Clinton took the oath four years ago.
Even as the ethics accusations against Speaker Newt Gingrich and the campaign finance problems that confront the Democrats draw attention away from the inaugural festivities and exacerbate partisan hostilities, 66 percent of the Americans polled said that they thought Mr. Clinton and the Republicans who control Congress would be able to work together on the most important issues.
The poll of 1,307 adults nationwide, conducted by telephone Tuesday through Friday, found that Mr. Clinton's job performance rating of 60 percent is at the highest level of his four years in office. Statistically, it ties with the 62 percent rating President Ronald Reagan drew at the start of his second term.
Over all, 66 percent of the Americans polled said they were "generally optimistic" about the next four years with Mr. Clinton. The poll's margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
While Mr. Gingrich's favorability rating is rock bottom at 15 percent, that in itself does not appear to have dampened the public's expectations about how much the Congress can accomplish. The job approval rating of Congress stands at 45 percent, the highest since 1991. And slightly more than half of the Americans polled said that they expected Congress to accomplish more than it usually does in a two-year period; 26 percent expected fewer accomplishments.
In fact, even though Mr. Gingrich is preoccupied by his own ethics problems, people are nearly evenly divided over whether the House or Senate will have more influence over the nation's direction.
Despite the positive outlook expressed by party leaders and the public, there were signs of deep partisan fissures on the eve of Inauguration Day. Erskine B. Bowles, who takes over as White House chief of staff on Monday, vowed to work hard to defeat a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget. "We don't think it's right to muck around with the Constitution," Mr. Bowles said on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press."
Earlier, on the same program, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, had sharp words for Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who on Friday warned of the ill consequences to the economy of a balanced budget amendment. "He really was hysterical," Mr. Lott said. "I was very disappointed in him."
Mr. Clinton, who was polishing his inaugural speech today, is expected to stay clear of such partisanship in his address on Monday. His advisers said that the President planned to emphasize national unity and the importance of reaching out to the Republicans.
And, despite his tough words today, Mr. Lott insisted in a recent interview that he intended to move beyond the aggressive partisanship that marked Mr. Gingrich's early tenure as Speaker. "There will be areas where the debate will be passionate, and it will be contentious at times," he said. "But I think we're starting off on a positive note, and I think we have a lot of potential to work together."
Despite the President's move to the center in his re-election campaign, he will be leading a country whose partisan leanings have not changed appreciably in the last four years. The public is still closely split among those who describe themselves as Democrats, Republicans and independents, and more Americans continue to call themselves more conservative than liberal.
In contrast to two years ago, the public views Mr. Clinton and the Congressional Republicans as much more evenly matched. Forty percent of the Americans polled said that Mr. Clinton would have more influence over the direction of the country; 50 percent said Republicans in Congress would have more influence. But in January 1995, when the first Republican majority in 40 years took over both chambers of Congress, 78 percent said Congress would have more influence. Only 14 percent cited Mr. Clinton then.
Mr. Clinton's advisers have said that he was extremely concerned about his place in history. At the start of Mr. Clinton's second term, the public has rendered a mixed verdict: 40 percent said he had been a "good" or "very good" President; 47 percent described him as "average" and 13 percent said he had been "poor."
Nedra Robinson, 42, who owns a child care center in Minneapolis and was one of the people surveyed, explained her hope for bipartisan progress. "I'm hoping that they'll be able to see beyond all this personal stuff and get on with dealing with the issues facing this country," Ms. Robinson, who voted for Mr. Clinton, said in a follow-up interview.
Another respondent, Joseph Waldspurger, a data processor in Cary, Ill., who voted for Bob Dole, said he thought that the parties would cooperate, but only so much. "They'll be able to work together but they won't be able to set any specific goals that are worthwhile because of partisan bickering," said Mr. Waldspurger, who is 52. "There's a lot of emphasis being put on balancing the budget and they'll probably make some headway on that, but I'm not convinced it's a high priority."
Beneath their general sense that the parties would try to work in harmony, people expressed doubts when they were asked about specific serious problems. Only 45 percent said that Mr. Clinton and Congressional Republicans would make progress toward balancing the budget in the next four years; 52 percent said that the leaders would not. Only 39 percent said they would be able to resolve most of the problems with Medicare funding; 56 percent said they would not. And only 36 percent expect the parties to resolve most of the problems with Social Security funding; 58 percent said that the parties would not.
People who expect little progress in those areas said they were dubious largely because the problems were inherently too complicated, rather than because of partisan rancor.
On another matter that the parties have squabbled over for years, reforming the campaign finance system, 39 percent said the President and Republicans would make significant progress. Fifty percent said they would not. But those who foresaw little progress were highly skeptical that the President and Congress were truly serious about wanting reform.
The public has limited expectations in other policy areas as well. Only 33 percent expected the nation's education system to be better by the end of Mr. Clinton's second term; only 18 percent expected fewer people to be living in poverty. In both those areas, most Americans expected the same number as now. And only 24 percent expected a decrease in violent crime by the end of Mr. Clinton's term.
The survey found that the economy had faded as one of the most pressing concerns of Americans. Seventy-one percent said the condition of the economy was good. Only 35 percent had responded with that assessment four years ago when Mr. Clinton entered office after capitalizing on the discontent over President George Bush's handling of the economy.
As the major political parties install new leaders this month, the controversy affecting Mr. Gingrich and the inquiries into the Democratic Party's fund raising practices do not seem to have altered the relative popularity of either party. Fifty-five percent of the Americans polled said that they had a favorable view of the Democratic Party; 50 percent had a favorable view of the Republican Party.
Even so, 50 percent said Congress should hold hearings to investigate events surrounding illegal campaign contributions that the Democratic Party received from foreign business executives; 30 percent said hearings were unnecessary. On another distraction for the President, the public, by 56 percent to 39 percent, said Paula Corbin Jones's civil lawsuit against Mr. Clinton should be postponed until he leaves office.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from Tuesday through Friday with 1,307 adults throughout the United States.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges in the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For the question that asked respondents to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 the way things are going in the United States at the present time, the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 0.10; that is, in 19 cases out of 20, a mean rating by the poll's respondents of 5.64 on that scale would be no lower than 5.54 and no higher than 5.74 if all adults had been sought out.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Power Is Underpriced, Energy Secretary Says

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The price of energy is artificially depressed in this country, Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said in an interview on the eve of her departure from office, and Americans will not be serious about conservation or energy independence until the price goes up or there is another shock.
Mrs. O'Leary also said members of Congress do not care nearly so much about making the right technology choices in handling nuclear waste and weapons as they do about providing jobs in their districts. 
 No future secretary of energy will undertake trade missions to foreign governments, she said, because of the criticism she received for her travel expenses. As a result, she predicted, America's competitors will march into countries that want new technology or services and are accustomed to dealing government to government and "go laughing all the way into the next meeting with the minister."
Mrs. O'Leary said she was exhausted by the last four years and that anyone who stayed longer in the job was "probably certifiable." She said she would continue working with black organizations, especially those concerned with education in science and other fields.
President Clinton has nominated Federico F. Pena, who has been Secretary of Transportation for the last four years, to replace her.
In the last few days she has renewed a campaign of "openness," announcing that thousands of films of early nuclear weapons tests would be declassified, and giving information on plutonium left by the United States in South Vietnam 20 years ago. Whatever follows, she said, the culture of secrecy has been broken.
Mrs. O'Leary was interviewed in her seventh-floor office at the Energy Department, with its northern wall of windows giving both a stunning view of the castle-like Smithsonian headquarters and a perpetual chill. She, like her predecessors, makes a conservation compromise: using an electric space heater to supplement the inadequate central heating system.
Mrs. O'Leary, who served in the Energy Department in the Carter Administration and was an executive at the Northern States Power electric company when President Clinton named her Secretary of Energy, said she did not want another Government job.
She said that she had tried within the constraints of the budget to nurture alternative fuel and energy technologies. The prevailing view, she said, was that "somehow, miraculously, the market will present itself" for technologies like fuel cells, which make electricity from liquid hydrocarbons, and photovoltaic cells, which can make electricity from sunlight. But Government will have to subsidize these technologies to help lift volumes and keep costs down, or let energy prices rise.
"The price of energy is artificially less in the United States," she said. There is no political will to raise prices, she said.
Mrs. O'Leary said that in Germany and Japan, governments subsidize purchases of solar cells. Referring to American dominance of manufacturing, she said, "We own 47 percent of that market share, and if we're not careful, we're going to lose it," she said.
Referring to dependence on imported oil, she said, "We need a wake-up call, and I know for a fact that doesn't come from the Secretary of Energy wandering the land and saying what needs to be done, because it's not nearly as dramatic as a price shock or some other dislocation.
"Almost any short-term dislocation, from a place like Venezuela, which is in fact our largest source, or from Russia would get our attention in the short term," she said.
But the reaction to price shocks, she said, is to try to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That, she said, is "a sin, a shame, and it ought to be stopped." Some oil from the reserve has been sold in the last few years to pay for improvements in storage equipment, and some members of Congress have proposed selling more to balance the budget.
The Department's main work is not energy, though, but nuclear weapons. Production of weapons materials had mostly ended when Mrs. O'Leary took office, but she moved to retire many cold war-era factories, most sitting on environmental nightmares. She said that in the last four years, her department had cleaned up 700 factories, storage areas, ponds and other sites -- but the total inventory is between 5,000 and 10,000. In contrast, Mrs. O'Leary said fewer than 80 had been cleaned up in the previous four years. Environmental spending runs about $6 billion a year, much of it for maintenance.
Mrs. O'Leary said Congressional debates over what new equipment was needed for the weapons complex were mostly devoid of discussions about technologies or economics, and instead were based on politics.
"We've built ourselves into a system where we have to overcome those expectations and try to do what's best and good for all, as opposed to, take care of 'my district, my state, my constituency,' " she said.

HEADLINE: Casino Plan Stumbles in Albany, But Maneuvering for Bill Persists

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
To the casual observer, a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling now before the State Legislature must have looked like a wounded animal in its death throes last week. Support for it had eroded among the State Senate's Republican majority. Democrats were complaining that it did nothing for New York City. The opposition was in full-tilt mobilization.
"The chances of a casino bill passing in my house presently would be pretty remote," declared the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican, on Wednesday. 
 It seemed a stunning turnaround for a measure that just weeks ago appeared on a fast track to passage. But the amendment is far from dead. And while it clearly is in trouble, it has become the object of an awkward pas de deux involving the Senate's 35 Republicans and 26 Democrats that may yet result in its passage.
The amendment's problems in the Senate can best be understood with a little geopolitical arithmetic. The amendment calls for one casino in each of three areas: Buffalo, Niagara Falls and either Warren or Saratoga County. It would allow an unlimited number in the Catskills. And it would authorize harness race tracks to install video poker and slot machines.
With the exception of Buffalo, those are mainly Republican districts. And with the exception of Saratoga County, those regions have been clamoring for casinos. That means that more Republicans than Democrats want the gambling amendment to be passed.
Passage in the Legislature would send the amendment to voters in a referendum in November.
Many Republicans oppose the measure because they believe allowing gambling would cause a host of social ills. And many others, including several from New York City, are lukewarm at best to it because their districts stand to gain little or nothing from casinos.
The result, according to Mr. Bruno: the amendment cannot pass with Republican votes alone. It needs Senate Democrats -- about 15 of them, the unofficial Republican head count indicates.
But most of the Democrats come from New York City and are under little pressure from their constituents to vote for or against the amendment since it will not directly affect their neighborhoods. Their votes are, in a sense, free to be traded.
Many Democrats say they believe that enough Republicans want the amendment to pass that Mr. Bruno will, in fact, be forced to trade for their votes.
In return, the Democrats want Republican support on any number of issues, from staving off budget cuts, to increasing state aid to city schools to maintaining rent regulations that are scheduled to expire on June 15.
"These casinos are not in Democratic strongholds, they're in Republican districts, and those people want them," said Senator Larry Seabrook, a Bronx Democrat. "Bruno will have to negotiate. It's crucial to him."
Jubilant that they might be in the coveted position of having something that the majority actually wants, the Senate Democrats have tried to walk a fine line between flirting and playing hard to get. When asked last Monday by Mr. Bruno how many Democrats would vote for the amendment, the Senate minority leader, Martin Connor of Brooklyn, demurred. Democratic officials say Mr. Connor has ordered his members to "stay loose."
In a survey by The New York Times last week, only one Democrat said he would vote for the measure while four committed to opposing it. More than half -- 14 -- said they were undecided. (Six did not respond.)
"At this juncture, I'm taking a wait-and-see attitude," said Senator Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat, echoing a typical Democratic sentiment.
In the Assembly, the measure is expected to pass because it is strongly supported by the Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
Mr. Bruno has studiously maintained a poker face when confronted with the issue. He expresses ambivalence about the amendment, saying he opposes gambling but wants the measure to pass in the Legislature so that voters can have the final say. He will not pressure Republicans to vote for it, nor negotiate with Democrats for their votes, he said.
And in what would appear to some to be the ultimate expression of indifference, Mr. Bruno announced last week that even if he thought the amendment would fail, he would still bring it up for a floor vote. "If it doesn't pass in two or three weeks," he said, "it will be dead this year."
Democrats say they think Mr. Bruno is bluffing. Eventually, they contend, he will quietly open negotiations with them. "It's more important to him than he's letting on," Senator Seabrook said. "He's trying to get our votes on a benevolent approach. But we're more sophisticated than that."
But if Mr. Bruno publicly supports casinos, he may find trouble in his backyard. The strongest pocket of opposition to casino gambling in the state comes from Saratoga, in Mr. Bruno's district. Local business leaders, ministers and even Skidmore College have mounted a furious lobbying effort against the amendment, asserting that a casino nearby would hurt the Saratoga race track, weaken the local economy and cheapen their quaint tourist area.
The opponents have vowed to work against anyone who supports the amendment, including Mr. Bruno. "People would to some extent hold him responsible," said the Rev. Jay Ekman, a Presbyterian minister from Saratoga who is coordinating an anti-casino campaign for the New York State Council of Churches. "If we lost and this community were changed radically, he would be perceived as the man who had the power to stop it and chose not to."
Though Mr. Bruno is one of the three most powerful people in Albany, capable of directing huge amounts of state spending into his district, he won re-election over a political unknown last November by a surprisingly narrow margin: 58 percent to 42 percent. For that reason, Mr. Bruno may feel compelled to say he will do nothing to advance the amendment.
Still, some casino opponents think that Mr. Bruno may be under pressure to get the amendment passed from his Republican ally, Gov. George E. Pataki, who contends that casinos will help the state's economy. But the Governor has insisted repeatedly that he will not cajole any lawmaker to vote for it.
If that remains the case, and both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno stay on the sidelines, the measure is considered likely to fail in the Senate. That would probably mortally wound it for this year, but only this year, Mr. Bruno and other lawmakers say.
"It has been killed by the Legislature four times since I've been here," said Senator Hugh T. Farley, a Saratoga County Republican who opposes the amendment. "It keeps getting resurrected. It's like a phoenix."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE FIRST LADY;
Hillary Clinton, an Evolutionary Tale

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
There is something startling and even poignant in the speed with which White House spokesmen quash suggestions that Hillary Rodham Clinton helps create her husband's policies.
Just last week, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, did not hesitate when asked whether Mrs. Clinton was a "prime motivating force" in drawing the Clinton Administration's attention to the plight of the District of Columbia. 
 "I'd say it's more accurate the other way around," he replied. Mr. McCurry said that it was President Clinton's interest that "led a number of people throughout the Administration to think about what they can do to lend support," thereby lumping the President's wife of 21 years with assorted unnamed bureaucrats, or "others throughout the Administration."
But in an interview on Friday, Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, gave Mrs. Clinton more credit. "She is the one that actually originally came to the President with thoughts about doing something in D.C.," he said.
Scorched by the fallout after Mrs. Clinton's leadership in seeking universal health care coverage, the White House has labored to play down her influence, describing a conversion from policy-maker to speech-maker, helpmate and goodwill ambassador, a seemingly docile role for an accomplished lawyer with more than two decades of experience in public life and no shortage of opinions.
But while the White House may lump her various causes under the anodyne rubric of "children's issues," Mrs. Clinton is still pursuing a far broader agenda of causes -- including foreign development, immunization in the inner cities and expanding financial credit for women -- than almost any predecessor in the undefined role of First Lady.
Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledge that she remains among the President's most powerful advisers, and Administration officials credit her with fighting internally to preserve or increase their budgets.
"I think she's easily the most influential First Lady in history," said Michael Beschloss, a historian of the Presidency.
The evolution of Mrs. Clinton's role parallels the arc of the Clinton Administration itself. She may no longer be trying to rework the nation's health care system, but neither is the Administration undertaking such a monumental cause. She may have taken to the bully pulpit and embraced politically milder goals, but then, so has her husband.
At all levels of the White House, officials walk on eggshells when questioned about Mrs. Clinton's plans. Asked whether he would like to see her take more of a public leadership role, Vice President Al Gore said quickly: "That is completely for her to decide."
Mrs. Clinton has been vague about her intentions during the second term, and she has declined most interview requests, including one for this article. In an interview broadcast today on C-Span, she described the political difficulty of spelling out her role as First Lady, a position she called "a struggle."
"On the one hand, people want a wife of a President to be concerned and caring about the issues confronting the country and to work on something of public interest," she said. "On the other hand, they don't want her to do it in a public way on a policy level."
But she indicated that she would not confine herself to noncontroversial issues, offering this daunting tongue-twister: "I'm not about to start caring about things that I've never cared about because it's not appropriate in somebody else's mind for me to continue to care about what I've always cared about."
Some of her allies believe that Mrs. Clinton's public image suffered from her early honesty about her influence. Previous First Ladies, they argue, cannily downplayed their impact. "It's almost as if she's been penalized a little bit because she didn't hide parts of herself," said one associate, speaking, like many, on condition of anonymity.
A New York Times/CBS Newspoll shows that most Americans agree with that analysis. Seventy percent said Mrs. Clinton had the same influence as previous First Ladies, but that it was "just more visible."
Given that view, and the vivid role Mrs. Clinton played in the first two years of the Administration, it may be too late for the White House to camouflage her, as it tried to do during the campaign. Further, since the election, Mrs. Clinton has demonstrated that she will not bury her sharper views with an avalanche of First-Lady-like bromides.
In a speech in Australia in late November, Mrs. Clinton criticized the free market, "which by definition knows the price of everything but the value of nothing," and reported that in the United States, women were still striving "to claim their share of personal, political, economic and civic power."
"Will we stop pigeon-holing women and invoking stereotypes that limit their potential?" she asked, posing a question she might well put to some on her husband's staff.
Many in the White House believe it is the press that wants to pigeonhole Mrs. Clinton, a point Mr. McCurry made last week as he minimized her role in the District of Columbia. "Every time she says anything about any subject," he said, "everyone rushes off to write some new thing about some new role."
Although Mrs. Clinton's popularity has climbed in polls, some of her allies acknowledge that the drumbeat of scandals touching her, particularly Whitewater, darkened her image. In a typical late-night jab last week, David Letterman told his television audience that one goal of the designer of Mrs. Clinton's inaugural dress was to make the sleeves long enough to hide her handcuffs.
Mrs. Clinton's devoted friends talk about her thoughtfulness, about birthdays remembered and losses understood. They describe a complex woman with a wicked, teasing sense of humor and a rollicking laugh. And, sadly, they add that that person rarely comes across in public, because she has to be guarded.
"You can see her sometimes almost censoring the first and second and third thing that comes into her head," said Diane Blair, an old friend who is a political science professor at the University of Arkansas.
But others say that Mrs. Clinton was trained to be publicly stern. Michael Conway, another old friend, noted that only 10 percent of the students in Mrs. Clinton's Yale Law School class were women. And when the two of them worked together on the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry, he said, 2 of the 40 lawyers were women.
"That's her formative training," he said. "She was trained to be a woman lawyer, and particularly to be a trial lawyer, and had to be more determined, more intense, more humorless, to be accepted." Criticizing her for seeming that way in public, he said, was "sort of like criticizing a graduate of West Point for being too rigid and too militaristic."
Still, officials throughout the Administration are beating down Mrs. Clinton's door to line her up as a speaker. They just don't necessarily talk up her role in molding the policies she speaks about.
"The policies are made," said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, referring to the new welfare law. "Now we need to go out to talk to the people."
Others in the Administration said that they have learned to count on Mrs. Clinton as more than a spokeswoman.
"I don't think that the Endowment would be alive today if it weren't for strong White House support, and I'm sure she plays a very important role," said Jane Alexander, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts.
At the Agency for International Development, Brian Atwood, the administrator, said of Mrs. Clinton's grasp of complex development issues: "She understands these issues better than 90 percent of the people who operate within the foreign policy community."
Mrs. Clinton has been working with A.I.D. to import to inner cities lessons learned abroad, on child immunization, for example, and inexpensive techniques to combat diarrhea. She has taken a particularly strong interest in "microenterprise lending," or efforts in developing nations and troubled cities to lend small amounts of money for new businesses, often run by women.
It is no coincidence, Mr. Atwood said, that the Administration is seeking to slightly increase the budget for A.I.D. next year. "She deserves more credit for that," he said, "than anyone."
